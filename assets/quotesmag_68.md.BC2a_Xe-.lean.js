Sandford took some risk in leaving his Lucas Davenport character and some of the critics of this book have panned him for doing so. But I loved this book. It is interesting, believable and not as \\"boxy\\" as his \\"Prey\\" novels. In the \\"Prey\\" novels, which I love by the way, they all follow a pattern and the characters are somewhat cookie cutter. But here he expands, he writes some fascinating characters with real depth and personality. The idea of this free lance film crew out on the prowl through the streets of LA hoping to get some good footage to sell to tv newsrooms, is unique and appealing. You can also read this book without any knowledge of the \\"Prey\\" novels and you will find it irresistable."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"This is the first John Sandford book I've read - and I'm an instant fan! Sandford was recommended to my by a flight attendant in 2007 and also by fans of Dean Koontz looking for similar authors. I will probably start reading Sandford's Prey series but I wanted to try some of his stand alone novels first. I have already started readingDead Watch (Night Watch)and look forward to readingRough Countrylater this year.The opening scene in The Night Crew is extremely intense and the book contains a high-quality of writing throughout. I loved the character of Anna Batory and think Sandford's writing is superb - I like that his writing is so genuine and unforced. I must admit I'm not usually very good at figuring out who did it in a mystery novel, but I thought I had figured out this one - in the end it was someone else.Here is a sample from The Night Crew :\\"I couldn't help noticing that you're carrying a gun.\\"\\"Yup.\\" She nodded.\\"You got a permit?\\" he asked.\\"Are you kidding?\\"\\"Maybe you should give it to me - the gun,\\" he said.\\"Maybe not,\\" Anna said\\"I could take it,\\" he suggested.\\"Cop takes gun from woman stalked by serial killer who brutally murdered movie actress.\\" She looked over her shoulder at Louis. \\"Could we get that on the air?\\"\\"Are you kidding?\\" Louis said. \\"I could sell it everywhere. But it'd sound better if we said, ' Cop takes gun from woman stalked by serial killer who brutally murdered movie actress, while gangs run wild with assault rifles in South Central.'\\"\\"That is an improvement,\\" Anna said.\\"It'd do okay,\\" Louis said. \\" But if you could get him to rough you up a little bit, we'd get more than we got for the jumper.\\"\\"How about it?\\" Anna said, turning back to Coughlin and batting her eyes. \\" Do you carry a club or a sap or anything?\\" Could you push me around a little? I mean, I kind of ... like it.\\"\\"Louis said, \\" ' Cop takes gun from beautiful woman stalked by serial killer who brutally murdered glamorous, drug-abusing \\"90210\\" actress, abuses her with baton, while gangs run wild with assault rifles in South-Central -- and she likes it.' \\"Coughlin hunched over the steering wheel and shook his head sadly, \\"Christ, this could be a long night,\\" he said."},{"Title":"The Night Crew","review":"The piece of paper was the drugs!

His total learning and experiences are distilled in this book, first published in 1878. Since then the book has been reprinted and re-published several times, with revisions done to it by Edward William West, another outstanding Orientalist and a great Pahlavi language scholar. The book is one of the most readable accounts on the history of the Zarathushtrian religion and Zarathushtrian literature encompassing both Avestan and Pahlavi language literatures, and the history of the Parsis of Western India in general. Though succeeded by more informative and massive tomes on the same subjects, this is an excellent book for a beginner, who wants to know something about the Parsis in general. I wish and hope that every Parsi and Zarathuhstrian will give this book their undivided attention and will keep it as a good reference source. It would be difficult to surpass Dr. Haug's account under 476 pages. Readers should be very thankful to the University Press of the Pacific for publishing the paperback edition of this time-tested classic, so that a generation of modern Zarathushtrians can benefit from this nineteenth century account of the Parsis."},{"Title":"More Than One Angel","review":"This is an exceptionally well written book about the survival of a child growing up in a dysfunctional family.

This book is perfect for anyone going through a similar situation. Gregory Huth addresses some of the paradoxes in the bible I have always felt needed further explanation, and he does it in a manner that does not contradict or offend people of various religious backgrounds. In fact, he highly stresses the importance of looking past religion into the deeper aspects of being spiritual and I couldn't agree more. After reading the book I feel more secure in my personal spirituality and can more fully appreciate the different spiritualities of those around me. I would whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone who considers themselves even remotely spiritual and especially to those who are searching for the answers to some of the questions that cannot be answered by simply attending church."},{"Title":"The Future of Teledemocracy","review":"In the theory and practice of democratic governance, Ted Becker and his colleague/wife, Christa Slaton have come up with a benchmark study. In wholly three distinct but interrelated areas. First with respect to our changed cosmological worldview, they argue the case that our post-Newtonian worldview demands an entirely new set of principles for the discipline of political science. Second, in the specific venue of scientific deliberative polling, they document their own empirical findings as well as those of others and present conclusions squarely at variance with those of mainstream political scientists. Third, in the role of the futurist, they chart a future that should be welcomed by the portion of our citizenry which remains disenfranchised, as well as those disillusioned, and alienated. On any one of these parameters of exploration, this is a book well worth delving into by that spectrum of the electorate which is looking for something simply sane in politics.With respect to the first realm of their exploration (Part I), the authors hold to the view that the paradigmatic shift in the view of Universe and ourselves in this Universe--born of the 20th century discoveries of relativity, quantum mechanics and chaos theory--shows that mainstream political science is out of date by two centuries. Worse still, it is not just irrelevant but systemically dysfunctional and counterproductive. In getting to this position, they use as one of their points of embarkation the view of a Harvard professor of government of some 70 years ago, William Bennett Munro. They cite him as &#8220;quantum political science&#8217;s first voyager&#8221; (p. 38).. Munro in 1928 they point out &#8220;chided American political scientists, political commentators, leaders and gurus for continuing to be &#8216;in bondage to eighteenth-century deification of the abstract individual man&#8217; &#8221; (p. 39). From Munro&#8217;s view as well as other visionaries such as Buckminster Fuller, Eric Fromm and Hazel Henderson, Becker and Slaton then move into the principles and theory for &#8220;modernizing the marriage between physics, politics and the science of government (p.. 21). Here in their first area of exploration these modern day voyagers provide the reader with a pioneering draft of a quantum politics, a quantum political science. Mind-expanding stuff worth pondering.In the second vector of their voyage, (Part II), Becker and Slaton lay out the scientific findings from their own experimental studies as well as of others in the field of teledemocracy. The latter they define as &#8220;scientific deliberative polling + comprehensive electronic town meetings + the Internet&#8221;. [ + Voting] = deliberative direct democracy (p. 47). What they persuasively show here is that ordinary people no less than academics and other well informed citizens when provided with a full range of information and the opportunity to deliberate in a conducive context can move from unstable public opinion to sensible public judgment and do so with reasonable facility. Once again in trajectory two The Future of Teledemocracy is chock full of documentation for readers to immerse themselves in profitably.In the third area of their voyage, (Part III), the authors project a scenario in which we in the 21st century are moving from an 18th century Newtonian hierarchical age of governance into a non-hierarchical, lateral and interactive deliberative democratic governance. Here more clearly than heretofore, they foresee, and yes, argue for Initiative and Referendum as integral if not centerpiece in &#8220;the Global Direct Democracy Movement (p. 158-165), But it is here also that Homer nods--not once but twice....Their first nod occurs in their treatment of what they classify as one of those &#8220;extraordinary transformational ideas and recommendations about the citizens initiative process (p. 163)&#8221; This is Philadelphia II (P.-2). In my view P-2 is the most peacefully revolutionary plan of action on the horizon to bring about systemic change in governance: It is a project the authors point out created and &#8220;led by a former U. S. senator from Alaska (1968-80), Mike Gravel. Philadelphia II is bringing forward a &#8220;national citizens initiative&#8221; which the authors see as &#8220;within New Democratic Paradigm parameters&#8221; in light of &#8220;how to achieve it.&#8221; p. 163.So far so good. Their first Homeric nod consists of a critically significant misperception within the P-2 Initiative process. They mislead the reader on how a projected federal agency-- designed to administer citizens initiative election--is to become enacted. They state: &#8220;Congress...[is] to set up something called &#8216;the Electoral Trust&#8217; (ET). which would be a new, largely independent agency of the U. S. government.&#8221; Wrong! The people will directly enact the ET. Additionally, according to P-2&#8217;s Direct Democracy Initiative (DDI), &#8220;[t]here are hereby appropriated, from the Treasury of the United States...funds to enable the Electoral Trust to organize itself...and begin the performance of its duties.&#8221; .... The consequence of the authors&#8217; s e mistaken view is they fail to present to the reader the political sovereignty that is implied and will come into play as a result of the creation of a &#8220;Legislature of the People&#8221; via Initiative. The partnership between the Legislature of the People and the Congress in the P-2 plan of implementation (and all other legislative assemblies) will be rightly ordered with the Sovereign, the People being functionally sovereign. Not so in Becker and Slaton&#8217;s mistaken description.Their second Homeric nod occurs as a result of the authors&#8217; failure to situate the &#8220;public opinion poll&#8221; for qualifying an initiative for a vote into the full context of the deliberative procedures included in P-2 (p. 191). When the associated P-2 deliberative support procedures is taken into consideration, one could argue that the end result will be precisely what the authors seek as their end game:: &#8220;&#8216;scientific deliberative polls embedded within a comprehensive Electronic Town Meeting process&#8220; as described in Chapter 5)&#8221; (p. 38).Setting aside these two missteps, I heartily endorse The Future of Teledemocracy....."},{"Title":"Dreambuilder (Soulsmith Trilogy # 2)","review":"I picked up this book with the hope of being as impressed as I was with Deitz's &quot;Soulsmith&quot;. While he does succeed in developing newcomer, Brandy Wallace into a very interesting character with a fantastic goal--an artist who is going about building a castle (dubbed Brandy Hall) in Welch County that is straight out of Tolkien or Mervin Peake, Deitz seemed to struggle with providing adequate reasons as to why Brandy and Ron Dillon should build a relationship. Sure, they were both artistic geniuses with the ability to realize their wonderful dreams; but they also had planet-sized egos and neither one of them wanted to bend.While characters like this can still be interesting and believable, in comes the improbable Van Vannister: handyman extraordinare with the almost magical ability to do everthing around Brandy Hall perfect the first time.Throw in the idea that Vannister seemed to be insane, and that he (along with Ron) wanted to engage in amorous activities with Brandy on an almost constant basis, and you come away with a scenario that's more R-rated soap opera than good fantasy.Not Deitz's best work."},{"Title":"The Dambusters Raid","review":"The May 1943 attack on German dams by 617 Squadron is arguably the second most-famous bomber op in history.* Unfortunately early books and films on the raid (ENEMY COAST AHEAD, Paul Brickhill's DAM BUSTERS) were less than accurate, perpetuating several myths in the public's mind. To my knowledge, John Sweetman's THE DAMBUSTERS RAID is the first, accurate history to have appeared describing this epic undertaking.Along with describing 617 Squadron's attacks on the Sorpe, Eder and other German dams, Sweetman provides much background information, material that exposes several of the myths connected with the raid. For instance, the dam attacks weren't the brainchild of Barnes Wallis, a gifted civilian engineer. Rather RAF brass had extensively discussed such attacks in the years immediately preceding war's outbreak. Likewise various weapons including ones similar to Wallis' 'Upkeep' revolving depth charge had already been proposed and investigated. In short, many agencies and individuals contributed to the effort. Likewise 617 Squadron crews who flew the mission weren't all highly experienced combat vets. Another point: the inspiration for the spotlights that aided the Lanc crews in maintaining their height over the water was not the result of Guy Gibson watching theater spotlights focus on a row of chorus girls! Then too the operation was not well-planned and executed. Navigational errors accounted for most of the eight aircraft lost. One Lanc even attacked the wrong dam and so on!Sweetman's throughly-researched book provides a comprehensive account of the entire Dams story. Readers may be put off by Sweetman's detailing of the countless meetings and briefings that preceded the development of Upkeep, establishment of 617 Squadorn and the actual attacks but all that IS part of the Dambusters story.Sweetman also examines and refutes the claims of revisionists that the raid and its effects were hyped and the actual results minimal. In point of fact, the Dambuster raid made a great impact on many levels.Well-illustrated and well-written, THE DAMBUSTERS RAID is a warts-and-all account of an epic mission. Unless something better comes along, it will probably be THE definitive book on the subject. Highly recommended.********The atomic bombing of Hiroshima probably ranks as the #1 bomber raid of all time."},{"Title":"The Search for Harmony: Essays on Science and Mormonism (Essays on Mormonism Series)","review":"A compilation of 16 essays (plus an introduction and epilogue) of which two are published for the first time about the Church and its changing relationship with the hard sciences. The selected essays provide a prospective of the issues from both a historical and a contemporary vantage. Not to be overlooked are the editor's 18 page introduction (with notes), as well as their \\"Review Essay,\\" (one of the non-published essays) that serves as an annotated bibliography to this subject area of the Church's leadership and their use, disuse, trust, retreat and alienation from science. Included essayists are Richard Sherlock, William Bradshaw, James Farmer, Eldon Gardner, F. Brent Johnson, Richard Smith and Gary James Bergera. Specifically discussed are creation, organic evolution, Darwinism, age of the earth, scientific versus religious truth and pre-adamites. Each essay has its own endnotes, but the volume has no illustrations, index or general bibliography. The anthology serves as a basic introduction to the problem of reconciling Mormonism and science."},{"Title":"The Search for Harmony: Essays on Science and Mormonism (Essays on Mormonism Series)","review":"The first thing I would change about this book is its title. It should have been &quot;Essays on Evolution and Mormonism.&quot; I wouldn't change the subtitle, though. This book has everything to do with apologetics, and very little to do with the search for truth. There is nothing in the book, for example, about the scientific problems with the Book of Mormon or the Book of Abraham. Neither is there any discussion about such things as the scientific problems associated with Mormonism's belief in a literal, worldwide flood or the literal tower of Babel.Since there are so many contributors, it's difficult to assign an overall score to the book. Some of the essays are particularly insightful, don't draw unwarranted conclusions, and provide useful references and historical data. On the other hand, It's pretty hard to take some of the essays seriously. I found the editor's introduction to be among the most interesting parts of the book, with some quotations from Mormon leaders, and statistics I've not seen before. For the most part I found the editors fairly honest in their portrayals, with a notable exception. In the introduction they portray Ezra Taft Benson as being open minded and embracing of science. I find this hard to believe of a man who once said:&quot;Our families may be corrupted by worldly trends and teachings unless we know how to use the book [of Mormon] to expose and combat the falsehoods in socialism, organic evolution, rationalism, humanism, and so forth.&quot; (Ezra Taft Benson, &quot;A Witness and a Warning, page 6.]Another problem I found with the editors, and with almost all the essays in the book, is a pervasive tendency for Mormon apologists to define evolution as something it is not. Instead of using the scientific definition of evolution, they tend to redefine the subject as something they can believe, and then claim (with no explanation) that evolution and Mormonism are compatible. For example, apostle Widtsoe said:The law of evolution .... Does not require that all things, all life, shall have a common origin. It merely declares that everything in the universe is moving onward.&quot; [page xi].I'm sure this statement will come as a complete surprise to any evolutionary biologist.Other Mormon apologists define a type of &quot;divine&quot; evolution, in which they allow the evolution of one species into another, but only through the guidance of deity. Both these definitions are without any basis in the scientific theory of evolution, however. Consequently, the &quot;definition thing&quot; becomes a real stumbling block when trying to have a meaningful conversation with Mormon apologists who insist they believe in evolution, only to find that what they really believe is a smattering of real scientific principles that are hopelessly mixed in a morass of mythology.Not all the essays deal with semantics, double meanings, and denial, however. A number of them are quite informative. Chapter 3, for example, outlines the evolution controversy at Brigham Young University, and the firing of three professors who taught evolution on campus and refused to stop. The chapter is very detailed, with lots of interesting historical highlights, and is well referenced.Essay 5 raises some interesting ideas I've not seen in the apologetic literature before, but unfortunately the author (Richard Sherlock) did not see fit to carry the discussion through on any of the really interesting concepts. For example, on page 71 he says:&quot;Furthermore Mormon anthropomorphism made God the prototype of man; Adam was literally his offspring. To think of a being made in the literal image of God as the result of decent from other forms of life was a difficult move indeed.&quot;In fact, the problem goes much deeper than this. According to the theory of evolution, people share a common ancestor with apes. That means Jesus (through is mother, Mary) also has a common evolutionary ancestor with the apes. It seems the vast majority of Mormons, and certainly all Mormon leaders, would reject such a conclusion, yet the author simply drops the discussion at this point, and never picks it back up. Mormonism is quite specific on the origin of humans and their literal image of God. The persistent problem with virtually all Mormon apologetics on the subject of evolution is that it tends to deal with the opinions of the shrinking pool of intellectuals within the Mormon community, while ignoring the opinions and beliefs of common Mormons. Though the book points out that 75% of Salt Lake City Mormons reject evolution, the authors never delve more into that issue, or why Mormons, more than almost any other religion, are so likely to believe in creationism.Another problem is the persistent reliance upon assertion and opinion. Many of the essayists assert that Mormonism is compatible with evolution, but none of them explain how or why - especially in light of the very strong statements against evolution made by Mormon ecclesiastical leaders when interpreting Mormon scripture. I don't recall a single specific reference to any Mormon scriptures in all the essays I read.So, this is basically a book written by Mormon apologists, for Mormon apologists who want to remain in the Mormon Church, and need some way out of the conundrum created by the anti-evolutionary rhetoric of Mormon ecclesiastical leaders. If that's you, the book will probably be worth while.One last thing. The book lacks an index, so make sure to have your yellow marker, red pen, and sticky highlighter ready."},{"Title":"Kitsch Deluxe","review":"KITSCH DELUXE by Lesley Gillilan, with photography by Dave Young, is an eclectic crazy colorful cavalcade of a coffee table book as well as a stunningly fun and informative reference work on collecting kitsch and tasteless popular culture. It also gives new-comers a great introduction into various themes of kitsch , as well as showing the more advanced collector some extraordinary interiors in the real homes of the truly tasteless. From Elvis to Big Eyed Art to Jayne Mansfield to Barbie and Barbarella, this book wil help you discover those areas of bad taste and camp, that you wish to explore. The lavish pictures are in your face, from the truly hideous to the divine, lush cool cocktail lounge style to trailer park treasure. The book also includes a directory of shops, cool online sites, museums and architecture of interest.Today, sadly, most of the best books on the subject of Bad Taste are now hard to find. The classics 'KITSCH: An Anthology of Bad Taste' by Gillo Dorfles (1968), 'KITSCH' by Jacques Sternberg (1971), 'KITSCH-IN-SYNCH' by Peter ward (1991) and the fabulous 'The ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BAD TASTE' by Jane &amp; Michael Stern (1991) an invaluable source, are all out of print. But help is at hand with '20th CENTURY POP CULTURE' by Dan Epstein (1999), 'THE BOOK OF TIKI' by Sven A. Kirsten (from Taschen 2000), 'Just Above the Mantlepiece' by Wayne Hemingway (2000) see my review, 'BEATSVILLE' by Martin McIntosh (2003), 'BIG EYED MASTERS' by Megan Besmirched (2003), and of course this style guide you're reading about....... 'KITSCH DELUXE'.This book also includes bizarre chapters on the homes of true eccentrics like artists Pierre et Gilles, fashion designer Zandra Rhodes and Tom Bliss (from the 'less is a bore' school of home decorating). Its a book for those wanting to relive their childhood with no rules, for those willing to create their own Valley of the Dolls or Elvis's Tiki Room at home. Enjoy. (Nov. 2003)"},{"Title":"Kitsch Deluxe","review":"Just because my funds are a bit low, I checked this book out of the library, but I WILL be purchasing this book after seeing first hand how great it is. I'm not sure if some other people were looking for some kind of great literature here or not, but it is what it is; a book showcasing kitsch homes. I was afraid the book, PAD (my Bible) was the only book to show off such inspirational rooms; but Kitsch Deluxe gave me a whole new range of rooms to drool over and become inspired by. There was only one room in the Kitsch Deluxe book that was in my PAD book. I don't seek to copy any of the rooms I've seen, but instead see bits and pieces I might be able to incorporate into my own ideas. Kitsch Deluxe isn't really giving you a history lesson and I think for one, trying to give kitsch a history is just a waste of time. You like it, you like it. It's tacky, it's glam, it's Vegas, it's fun, it's so many different things. The book isn't a how to, it's just presenting some great homes and a little bit of why the owners decorated the way they did. I'll be purchasing this one soon and flipping through it's well worn pages for ideas."},{"Title":"Kitsch Deluxe","review":"Though there are no \\"how to's\\" in this book, it is a great source of ideas and inspiration! If you are longing to break free from the same old decorating things, this book will help you on your way. Not all the ideas will be practical for everyone. If you are a fan of minimalism, clean, tidy lines and so forth, look elsewhere. But if you are yearning for something different, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Kitsch Deluxe","review":"Disappointment. Just another coffee table book. Writing is shallow, nothing is new from other Kitsch books. Best part of writing is on the dust cover. Color pictures are colorful, but all Kitsch books have been already used these pictures. Nothing is fresh looking. If you are looking for a coffee table book to cheer up your room, it is OK. Just not for me. Or don't be fooled by the dust cover writing, which sounds like little more than other Kitsch books."},{"Title":"Sam","review":"The main and title character is the head and owner of a publishing house in New York City - and he's gay. However, I wouldn't classify this novel as stirctly gay fiction. There are heterosexual main characters and they are involved in a couple of subplots. The novel is interesting for two reasons: First of all, it explores the very close relationship between a gay man and his straight female best friend. The closeness of their relationship creates problems both for Sam's current partner and his female friend's husband. The book is also interesting because in spite of the early publishing date (1959), the protagonist is presented in a positive light. He loves his career, is intelligent and has a good sense of moral values and he wants a lasting relationship with another man rather than an empty promiscuous life. It is refreshing to see this in a book published in 1959. As far as the writing goes, it's not great literature, but still is an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Sam","review":"Sam is a great story for any time. The fact that it was written back in 1959 makes it astounding. Having gay characters that weren't deviates, or living lives of shame (always ending in suicide, of course) just was not done. Then Sam came along and gave us a proud, likable, gay man. A hero we can cheer for!The icing on this cake is that the book is full of great dialogue, interesting and fun characters, and a good plot. You'll want to read this!"},{"Title":"Apollo Helmet","review":"&quot;These poems offer a fresh image or perspective to startle and illuminate.&quot; --Publishers Weekly&quot;James Scully is one of our more courageous and undaunted poets...I find Scully to be a rising dragon in a time when much poetry is suffering from an identity crisis.&quot; --Cale Jacobsen, North Dakota QuarterlyAPOLLO HELMET &quot;raises important questions about politics and human nature with an infectious indignation.&quot; --Library Journal"},{"Title":"Clay Pot Cooking","review":"The recipes collected are representative of ancient cooking from many cultures. Traditional clay-pots from each culture are described. Each recipe has detailed, clear instructions. This is not a throw-the-ingredients-in-the-pot book. A number of the recipes are time consuming and require several cooking steps prior to adding all the ingredients to the clay-pot. Most clay-pot dishes bring to mind homey, comfort foods. These dishes have a fresh, lively nature. I think the secret to this is two-fold: the use of fresh ingredients and a lower cooking temperature than is called for in the classic clay-pot cookbooks. The food photography deserves praise too."},{"Title":"Clay Pot Cooking","review":"There aren't a ton of recipes, and you have to have a certain type of pot to cook certain meals. While it is ambitous, it's not the best general clay pot cooking book out there"},{"Title":"Brilliant Food Tips and Cooking Tricks: 5,000 Ingenious Kitchen Hints, Secrets, Shortcuts, and Solutions","review":"If you've gotten this far, you probably already know the premise of this book. Rather than arranging recipes and tips by course or type of food (as in most cooking books that are arranged in chapters on appetizers, breads, etc.), Joachim has given us an alphabetical listing of cooking terms and tips.What makes it useful? It's definitely a valuable resource for new cooks. Personally, when I was starting out in my new kitchen, I hadn't the slightest clue what a reduction sauce was, and a friend sent me a recipe calling for one without explaining exactly how I was supposed to go about making it. I was saved by this book, which has a simple explanation of reduction sauces that was very easy to find. This book provides simple explanations of the cooking terms and techniques that a lot of recipe books (and friends) assume you already understand.It's also handy when it comes to creating the last-minute menu. Murphy's Law states that you'll only have last-minute supper guests when your refrigerator is mostly empty. (Okay, so it doesn't exactly say that, but humor me.) But if I'm going to have last-minute guests and I find that I have plenty of pasta on hand, the pasta entry in this book can give me ideas on how to make a meal out of it. There is a chart listing the best types of sauces to use for each pasta shape, as well as recipes for artichoke pasta sauce, fettuccine alfredo, macaroni and beef, shell pasta with lentils, and so on and so on.My misgiving about the book is that, as I've gotten better and better at cooking, I use it less and less often. If simple and quick homestyle cooking is your forte, you'll probably like the recipes, but they didn't work too well with my fancier tastes. All in all, I find myself picking up this book when I need to whip up something easy at the last minute, and I would highly recommend it if that's your goal. But if you're looking for something a little fancier, you're better off looking elsewhere."},{"Title":"Brilliant Food Tips and Cooking Tricks: 5,000 Ingenious Kitchen Hints, Secrets, Shortcuts, and Solutions","review":"An interesting concept is at the base of this book. It provides hundreds of recipes--as a part of what is described as 5,000 \\"ingenious kitchen hints, secrets, shortcuts, and solutions.\\"Coverage is from A to Z. Some examples of helpful hints. On page 3, substitutes for alcohol in recipes are noted. Instead of one tablespoon of sherry or Madeira, use one tablespoon of apple juice. Another item under A is the choice of the right apple for the right purpose. For example, Golden Delicious apples can be used for sauce, baking, salads, and eating; McIntosh apples are best for eating and sauce; and so on. And immediately after these hints, there is a nice recipe for spicy applesauce (using McIntosh apples). On page 75, for those readers addicted to Buffalo Chicken Wings, there is a recipe for Buffalo Hot Sauce. While I would prefer old-fashioned Tabasco Sauce, the recipe calls for somewhat milder hot pepper sauces, for palates that aren't as willing to burn. In addition, there are a couple recipes for using the sauce other than on chicken wings. What about making Mango Salsa? Page 268 features a simple, easy to make recipe. Polenta? Pages 377-378 provide a veritable \\"how to do it\\" mini-manual, including what to do if you err in making it (such as burning the bottom of the polenta). On Page 531, you can read how to prepare vegetables for grilling. For asparagus, snap off the tough ends and use direct heat to grill the vegetable. And so on and so on. A to Z? What about getting the zest from oranges to use in recipes? Here is one of the few places that I have run across this \\"how you do it\\" tidbit.All in all, a very nice and useful volume."},{"Title":"Brilliant Food Tips and Cooking Tricks: 5,000 Ingenious Kitchen Hints, Secrets, Shortcuts, and Solutions","review":"If I am about to cook something that I am not completely sure about, I will spend a few seconds looking it up in this book first.

I started to browse it while I waited to go out for dinner and I found several recipes that called my attention and were well explained. the author uses simple measurements like 1/2 cup of this or 1 cup of that, not like others that say everything in grams or used seasonings impossible to find. I also noticed the recipes looked doable for a guy like me that loves to eat well but hadn't had much practice preparing the meals. Anyway, I decided to try a few things at a time and the results were good and got better as I familiarized myself with the process. in just a few months, of mostly a weekend day, I've prepared some delicious stuff that I love to eat but thought it would be impossible for me to make it.

We have oppressed, demoralized, institutionalized, degraded, segregated, stereotyped, and persecuted millions of persons over the years. What is unfortunate is that with all our advances in business and technology... there are still single mothers living on the streets, starving with their children. There are still foreign workers being payed much less than minimum wage. There are still persons living with mental illness being drugged and institutionalized. The rich are still getting richer, as they exploit the poor and working classes.America has much to be proud of. America also has much to be ashamed of.

While more contemporary works deal with what's become of Anglicanism in a way that Neill's book does not (having first been written more than 50 years ago), \\"Anglicanism\\" is still an important work. In fact, if you want to understand Anglicanism, it's still one of the best places to start.The subtitle of Neill's works is \\"An Explanation, in the light of history and theology, of the nature and working of the Anglican Communion, its relationship with other Christian groups, and its part in the movement for Christian union.\\" As you can see from the subtitle, although \\"Anglicanism\\" is primarily historical in nature, Neill manages to weave in good discussions of theology and helps the reader to understand the place of Anglicanism in the larger Christian Church. Neill was among the first to understand the importance of the global nature of Anglicanism, and not just the Anglo-American side of things. His background as an Anglican bishop, lecturer, evangelist, and worker with the World Council of Churches made Neill an ideal person to write such a book.When I first became serious about studying Anglicanism, this book was one of the first places I turned, and it gave me a solid foundation that I've built on over the years. After my first reading of the book I was especially impressed by Neill's easy-to-read style and his ability to convey the most important historical details in an engaging narrative. His presentation of the Reformation as being composed of several distinct kinds of Reformation was particularly insightful.I highly recommend this book, along with Moorman's \\"A History of the Church in England\\" as historical introductions to Anglicanism.Neill breaks down his discussion into the following chapters:1.

He provides a more than adequate narrative of the history of Anglicanism that includes fairly in-depth writing of the conflicts of the early history of the Reformation in England. He provides good but brief introductions to the major figures in Anglicanism. This is introductory writing of the whole general scope of Anglicanism.Neill also provides introductions and summaries of the history of the globalization of Anglicanism. Through the book, readers will get a sense of the theology, structures and ongoing tensions within the Anglican Communion while also getting a flowing historical narrative."},{"Title":"Anglicanism","review":"Stephen Neill's \\"Anglicanism\\" remains a valuable historical introduction to Anglicanism. While more contemporary works deal with what's become of Anglicanism in a way that Neill's book does not (having first been written more than 50 years ago), \\"Anglicanism\\" is still an important work. In fact, if you want to understand Anglicanism, it's still one of the best places to start.The subtitle of Neill's works is \\"An Explanation, in the light of history and theology, of the nature and working of the Anglican Communion, its relationship with other Christian groups, and its part in the movement for Christian union.\\" As you can see from the subtitle, although \\"Anglicanism\\" is primarily historical in nature, Neill manages to weave in good discussions of theology and helps the reader to understand the place of Anglicanism in the larger Christian Church. Neill was among the first to understand the importance of the global nature of Anglicanism, and not just the Anglo-American side of things. His background as an Anglican bishop, lecturer, evangelist, and worker with the World Council of Churches made Neill an ideal person to write such a book.When I first became serious about studying Anglicanism, this book was one of the first places I turned, and it gave me a solid foundation that I've built on over the years. After my first reading of the book I was especially impressed by Neill's easy-to-read style and his ability to convey the most important historical details in an engaging narrative. His presentation of the Reformation as being composed of several distinct kinds of Reformation was particularly insightful.I highly recommend this book, along with Moorman's \\"A History of the Church in England\\" as historical introductions to Anglicanism.Neill breaks down his discussion into the following chapters:1.

The Nineteenth Century in England: 111. Expansion into the English-Speaking World12. A Missionary Church13. A World-Wide CommunionEpilogue: Present Situation and Prospects"},{"Title":"Anglicanism","review":"This is an enjoyable read that traces the history of Anglicanism from its Reformation beginnings and then goes on to discuss it in light of High, Low and Broad Church parties and their respective influence and then Anglicanism's ecumenical relations around the globe. Stephen Neill is always a pleasure to read even though some readers would prefer a High Church/Anglo-Catholic take and some would prefer a Low Church/Evangelical take on Anglicanism. Neill is neither High nor Low Church, but gives a respectful presentation of what I would call \\"middle of the road\\" traditional and ecumenical Anglicanism. One should really read this presentation of Anglicanism along with Norman Sykes's \\"The Integrity of Anglicanism\\" and McAdoo's \\"The Spirit of Anglicanism.\\" These three works were the most influential in defining Anglicanism in the second half of the twentieth century. For a more recent, twenty first century take on Anglicanism see Paul Avis's work."},{"Title":"The gospel and the church (Fifty-cent religious series)","review":"Alfred Loisy (1857-1940) was a French Roman Catholic priest, professor and theologian, who was perhaps the leading exponent of \\"Modernism\\" in the Catholic Church. Ultimately, he was dismissed as a professor from the Institut Catholique de Paris, his books were condemned by the Vatican, and he was excommunicated. (But of course, that simply whets our appetite even MORE to read what he wrote, eh?) He then taught the history of religion at the College de France until his retirement in 1931.Loisy wrote this book in 1902, and it contains his most famous statement, \\"Jesus foretold the kingdom, and it was the church that came; she came, enlarging the form of the gospel, which it was impossible to preserve as it was, as soon as the Passion closed the ministry of Jesus.\\"Loisy's disputes with the Catholic Church don't mean that he had Protestant sympathies, however; he wrote, \\"Jesus was the first to give his disciples a formula of prayer; He observed the practices of Jewish worship; He never recommended to His followers a worship without external forms, and never intended to establish such a worship.\\" He also concludes, \\"every advance is explained by a necessity of fact ... so that the historian cannot say that the total extent of the movement is outside of the gospel. The fact is, it proceeds from it and continues it.\\"This historically-significant book remains of interest to those interested in the life of Jesus, the Catholic Church, Catholic theology, and Modernism."},{"Title":"The Shorter Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature","review":"Excellent book and fast shipping. I got the book in a couple of days after I placed my order."},{"Title":"Theory and Problems of Genetics","review":"This book quite literally got my biology career started. I had just graduated with an associate's degree and was going on to a four-year school. With limited funds and time available, I needed to take as few classes as possible as quickly as possible. Rather than backtrack and take lower level classes in biology, I wanted to jump right into an advanced class, namely genetics. However, it was first necessary to convince my advisor that I could handle it.To prepare myself, I bought this book and began going through the problems. I hit them hard, solving most of them before I met with my advisor. During our interview, I had him ask me some genetics questions and I was able to answer all of them. He then allowed me to take the course and I had no trouble pulling an A. The questions were an excellent preparation for the class, most of the questions I encountered in the class were over something I had already dealt with in this book. I strongly recommend it either as a supplement or as a guide for self-study."},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","review":"This is a gripping series of conversations between the three authors discussing various aspects of the psyche, the universe, the role of chaos theory in the dynamics of creation and the rediscovery of ancient wisdom. The authors, all three of whom stood at the cutting edge of their respective disciplines, challenge the reader about our current views of reality, morality and the nature of life. The sometimes breathtaking insights emerging from this will not fail to move the reader. The chapters on creativity, the imagination and chaos are amongst the most compelling, and deal with theories like the cosmic imagination as a higher dimensional magnet that pulls the evolutionary process to itself, the Omega Point, and imagination arising out of the womb of chaos. Other fascinating topics include indeterminism in nature, nature's organising fields as mathematical representations, and the encoding of information in crystals and in written language. The chapter \\"Light and Vision\\" is one of the most poetic, dealing as it does with physical light and the light of consciousness, the theory that one's thoughts are a measurable field emanating from the eyes, the similarities between electromagnetic and mental fields, the concept of a world soul, and morphogenetic fields as a medium of divine omniscience. Incorporeal intelligence and non-human entities are discussed - are the latter merely inhabitants of the psyche or do they have an independent existence? Scientists and inventors like Kekule, who received answers in dreams, are referenced here. The book concludes with a glossary, bibliography and biographical information about the authors. It is a stimulating text in which the power of the mythical imagination, scientific observation and innovative speculation combine to create a thought-provoking reading experience."},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","review":"I read this book while on jury duty. Because I ran out of reading materials, I went back over it and decided to write down some of my favorite quotes. Here is one example, by Ralph Abraham. \\"I find the whole idea that the world's soul is confined in a space/time continuum of four or ten dimensions extremely claustrophobic.\\" So, you all get the idea. This was not a book to summarize, so I kept writing down quotes and buzz words. What gave me a lot of chuckles were the interspersed references to psychedelic drugs and various qualities of mushrooms, and the use of mushroom examples and so forth. I don't know much about mushrooms, but it helps date these guys, even while they are talking about ten dimensions being claustrophobic. I will say this-- they must have had some good trips.I don't pretend to understand a lot of their references, mushrooms aside, but it is an easy book to read as long as one doesn't feel the need to follow up every lead and reference. Their approaches seem to be kind of cutting edge, but dated, if there is such a combination. I am particularly interested in Sheldrake's morphogenetic fields, which is what led me to the book. My attention span tends to be a little short, so I wanted a kind of breezy overview. Although I enjoyed the book a lot, I don't think I got much out of the morphic fields discussion. So I will look elsewhere for that.I lent this book to my daughter, who is enthralled by it, particularly since she just took a bunch of final exams, some having to do with statistics and econometrics, so their discussions of modeling were most interesting to her.And who wouldn't go for the idea of creativity coming out of chaos? Aren't our lives in chaos most of the time anyway? There must be a purpose for it. That's it. I get more creative after every chaotic event!! The discussions about beginnings, endings, various attractors, etc. were really fun to read. Not sure which ones came from their imaginitive minds (resulting from chaos), or their super intelligent brains, and which ones were from the mushrooms.Oh, here's another Abraham quote I absolutely loved. \\"As the waves pass the rock, their shape is changed. There is a hologram of the rock within the wave that comes forward and crashes on the beach, then there's a reflected wave back.\\"Ok, that was cool!! All things considered, if you have some extra time (either on the beach, or on jury duty) read this book. They weaved in references from all aspects of experience-- mythology, mushrooms, science, waves, psychology, philosophy, history, etc. I love that!! I consider a book a success for me if I get one good idea from it. And I got more than that from this one, although I am not any more inclined to take psychedelics than I was prior to reading the book."},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","review":"Well I just received my book and come to find out it is the exact same book I already own under a different name + graphics. This book is originally titled \\"Trialogues at the edge of the west\\".I would not have bought this book if I knew I already owned it. I find the publisher, Park Street Press, completely dishonest for not informing the \\"would be buyer\\" what this book really is.I was friend's with one of the authors, Terence mckenna, and I find this to be just another way for corporations and individuals to capitalize on his death-such a shame."},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","review":"I have read McKenna's other books, The Archaic Revival and The Invisible Landscape, True Hallucinations, and to me, this seems even better! Perhaps McKenna's best book! By page 10 I was flipping out, and it only got better.

Thank cosmos later."},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","review":"I have always respected the open mindedness of all three thinkers and found the material in this book consistent with that as it was far from dogmatic. It inspired me to consider new ways of looking at the old concepts. On the negative side. I think some of the ideas showed a little lack of critical thought. Some of the topics were philosophically based notions and, as that is my field, I felt that it was a little lack of awareness of the problems that have been worked out by some other thinkers(I wish that they would have at least mentioned those ideas then debated the point). Specifically I wish they would have acknowledged the issues that have come up in transpersonal psychology. Overall, I feel most interested in these issues (the evolution of consciousness and mind and critique of the modern post modern views) will enjoy the creative thinking they share. C.J."},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","review":"For those new to the works of Sheldrake, this could be the perfect buy.Yes, it's a repackaged version of what the authorities would consider &quot;Old School.&quot; So if you want a book with a cool title, cool cover, and probably one of the more digestible texts of Sheldrake's ideas, (and you don't have any Sheldrake on your shelf) then this would work.As for complaints by Sheldrake fanatics, hey, at least this is getting those marvelous ideas by McKenna and Sheldrake out to newer and newer audiences!"},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","review":"Three of the most intriguing and revolutionary minds of our time together at last. If you can find the video in which this book is transcribed,it's definitely worth watching as well. it's called Metamorphasis."},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","review":"I must agree with those reviewers who concluded that these three \\"thinkers\\" were more like a bunch of college sophomores in a beer-drenched brain-storming session than serious scholars. (Or stoned out of their heads? This was at Esalen twenty years ago, after all!) But then, this was a refreshing break from reading all the reductionist neurobiologists claiming that mind is brain and brain is chemical reaction and subconscious chemical or electrical mechanisms control our conscious minds and that is all there is. (See my review of Antonio Damasio's Self Comes to MInd, for example.) After reading such \\"serious\\" scientists, discussions of \\"morphic fields,\\" \\"resonant wave phenomena,\\" and \\"cosmic consciousness\\" were a welcome break from \\"doom and gloom\\" views of humans as robotic zombies under the delusion that they are in control of... anything. I did appreciate Sheldrake's notice in the Preface, \\"I hope that this book will encourage others to explore with their friends some of the questions we discuss here and will serve as a reminder of the importance of dialogue as a means of discovery.\\" Unfortunately, what my friends and I discover is our own complete lack of mental discipline. But then we laugh, fall down on the floor, and generally have a great time. If you don't take them too seriously, you, too, can have lots of laughs with my drunken buddies, Sheldrake, McKenna, and Abraham."},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","review":"The chapters in this book are transcripts of three academics rambling on and on as they speculate about \\"cosmic consciousness\\" and how it touches upon existence, science, history, religion, etc.An example of their fare:\\"The chaos revolution now taking place throughout the sciences is a major setback for the forces of law and order, control and dominance. Scientists, the high priests of Marduk, must now accept chaos and replace Tiamat on her rightful throne. This is why I say that chaos is the biggest thing since the wheel. Imagination, creativity and inspiration are all on the upswing. Chaos, Gaia, Eros-arise!\\"If you find meaning in statements like this, you will probably love this book. This material reminds me of listening to late-night frat house bull sessions, or someone who's stoned and thinks that his random navel-gazing is actually providing profound insights. It's reminiscient of the psychedelic froth of the 1960's.I didn't find this worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","review":"A more appropriate title for this book would be \\"Three Pretentious Fools Talking About Things They Know Nothing About.\\" The book is composed entirely of vacuous but lofty-sounding rhetoric and New-Age style cosmic speculations, and is remarkable for its almost complete lack of intellectual content. It reminds me of the kind of pseudo-intellectual discussions I used to have in the dorm with my college buddies after we'd each had several beers."},{"Title":"Instant Immersion Arabic - Eastern Colloquial (Arabic Edition)","review":"I've had this CD set for about six months, having bought it after I took two semesters of Arabic in college to keep up over the summer. I play it in my car, and it does what I intended it to- keep me on my toes with Arabic vocab and sentence structure. The narrators are native speakers (a plus) but can be hard to understand at times, and make a few awkward but minor errors in the English translations. The subjects covered are diverse, and familiarize you with all kinds of vocabulary you're not likely to learn in a classroom setting (\\"At the Dentist\\" and \\"Household Furniture,\\" for example).However, I don't recommend it if you have no exposure to Arabic and want to learn- they give an elementary syntax lesson up front, but it's nothing more than a cursory review. For the serious beginner, there isn't enough grammar to get the big picture using this resource alone. For the serviceman, contractor or tourist who just wants enough to get around, this is probably too much to sift through. For the student of Arabic who's already had a basic introduction to the language, though, this collection is perfect, and paired with a book, class or mentor would make an excellent resource."},{"Title":"Instant Immersion Arabic - Eastern Colloquial (Arabic Edition)","review":"This set of discs does what few other methods can - teach you how to speak Palestinian Arabic. There are no printed materials, you can make your own from your notes. Other methods will teach you Al FusHa, classical Arabic (which no one speaks) or MSA (modern standard arabic) which will help you to understand most dialects, sort of.Since 1948, most Arabic-speaking people understand the Palestinian dialect. So you can either learn Egyptian Arabic, or learn Palestinian. This set of 8 discs is reasonably priced, and I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Instant Immersion Arabic - Eastern Colloquial (Arabic Edition)","review":"The product was a little delayed, but once I called Amazon.com and notified them I had not received the order, they rushed it out immediately and I received it within days! It is an awesome product and very helpful for it is helping my understanding of the Arabic language, and is very easy to use! Within the first few minutes of using I have already begun to learn and better understand the Arabic culture."},{"Title":"Instant Immersion Arabic - Eastern Colloquial (Arabic Edition)","review":"I was lucky in that I was able to obtain this from my local library. So, for free, its ok. Had I paid for it, I'd have gone back and asked for a refund.This program is good in that it gives you a good basis of vocabulary. The bad thing is, it doesn't really seem to give it in any helpful context.The vocabulary seems to be just given in successive recitation without any basis for reference. For example, you might hear \\"marhaban\\", but because they don't tell you the meaning of \\"marhaban\\", it doesn't really mean much other that you're hearing the word. Ok, so now you've heard the word \\"marhaban\\". So what, if you don't know the meaning, its kind of useless. And that's what this whole thing seems to be is just one long stream of vocabulary. One word after another.So I guess I'd have a hard time recommending this course. I like to be able to hear something and be given a meaning. So if I heard \\"marhaban-Hello or welcome\\". Then it would be useful. But I like to listen to stuff in my car. I can't very well do that if I'm having to sit there with a book and read along...Sorry, but I'd recommend something else before I'd recommend this. Its fine if you already have a solid basis of vocabulary, but worthless if you're a beginner."},{"Title":"Instant Immersion Arabic - Eastern Colloquial (Arabic Edition)","review":"This is my third language from Instant Immersion. The Arabic is easy to follow and understand. I have surprised myself by using a few words and the receiver smiles pleasingly when I pronounce the words dead on. Great learning language."},{"Title":"Instant Immersion Arabic - Eastern Colloquial (Arabic Edition)","review":"When I purchased this set, it was about $20, and what a deal it was!You get 8 CDs thoroughly stuffed with all manner of useful phrases and grammatical variations. If this was all you had available for learning this language, you have a about two semesters of material in one neat, portable set.Arabic is a very easy language to learn, the grammar is uncomplicated, and acquisition of a new vocabulary is all under your initiative. However, it should be noted that Arabic language dialects vary drastically not only throughout the Middle-east and North Africa, but even within one Arabic-speaking country. In fact, its similar to how Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes speak their own distinct languages, ...yet those Scandinavian languages are so similar due to their common origin, that those three nationalities can still understand each other most of the time. Being firmly rooted in at least one Arabic dialect will definitely help in comprehendig others.Some practical advice for this set of CDs:-Listen to the disk, and write down the English phrases, number them.-Listen to the disk a second time, and write down the Arabic phrases phonetically, as they sound to you.-After you have learned to write in Arabic script, write the Arabic phrases in Arabic script."},{"Title":"The Foundling","review":"Some feel that an aborted fetus is unwanted tissue. How does that &quot;tissue&quot; impact upon a host of people when intead of being incinerated that creation cries, is saved by a caring janitor, a committed chaplain, and a conscientious nurse--all who value life? These people's lives become entwined around that saved baby boy who grows in today's world to become a young Christian man who is completely aware of his remarkable identity. The rescuing of that child starts a life-saving underground movement for similar discarded human beings. Meshed in the story are the medical and legal implications of discarded tissue being born. The consequences are so enormous that even organized crime becomes involved. This readable and believable novel deals with life as it is, not as the author, a clergyman of the Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod would have it to be. The clergy characters in the book correctly convey an attitude of compassion and forgiveness to women who abort-- pointing to the forgiveness belivers have in Jesue Christ. This novel will leave the reader with the conviction that every life is an incredible gift from God which is to be treasured.Reviewed by the Rev. James E.

Having grown up in Texas, I admit I was a bit skeptical. Up to the point I actually tasted it. I was so impressed I searched out and bought this cookbook. It makes a nice balance between recipes, Dinosaur BBQ history and lore, and explainations on what and why certain recipes are the way they are. So far pretty much everything my wife and I have tried from this cookbook has been a winner. The only thing I would say in criticisim is we tend to up the spiciness of a lot of the recipes, but we seem to like things hotter than most folks, so bear that in mind.

If you are lucky enough to have the Dinosaur sauces in your grocery store, these recipes become very easy. I've introduced many friends to the Dinosaur Sensuous Slathering Sauce, which has converted many to use this as a condiment.

It was with great reluctance (and an effort to please my husband!) that I made my first dish out of it, but that's all it took to make me a believer! I have since tried 12 recipes from this book and they have all been very good to excellent. Not only does it contain the traditional barbecue fare that you would expect from it, but there are many inventive tantalizing ones as well (like Sweet Potato-Crusted Mahi-Mahi with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce or Seared Tuna with Wasabi Green Onion BBQ Sauce). And the everyday barbecue recipes? Well, even I can't get enough of them, and that's saying a lot for someone whose dream dinner consists of crab towers and creme brulee.

Throw in the rubs, sauces, and marinades and you've got everything to make some outstanding food.To top it off it has some great tips for cooking. You can tell that John Stage is a stickler for getting things done right. And then the writing and photography really take you there.Yeah, I'm from Syracuse, but the book still stands out from my 80+ cookbooks."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"I must admit that I avoided purchasing this book as I have been disappointed in the past with cookbooks that are written for a particular restaurant. Too often, the recipes in such books are only close approximations of the real items. Alas, this book forgoes that tendency and gives the actual menu directions. Dinosaur Bar-B-Que cooks traditional 'American cuisine'. The recipes for 'Not Your Mama's Meatloaf' and 'Macaroni and Cheese Shepherd's Pie' were big hits. Each section (Beef, Poultry, Seafood, Pork etc.) contains some suggestions for the barbeque novice. But what separates the 'Dinosaur' from other cookbooks are the recipes for sauces, rubs and marinades. I have grown habanero chiles in my garden this summer and used them to make the hot version of the Mutha Sauce. Problem is, I can't get enough of this stuff. The combination of tastes will just dance on your tongue and you too will use it in more and more recipes. The Creole Rub is also an easy to create but versatile spice combination. On a lighter note, the compilation of the best of Dinosaur graffiti is hilarious. It is obvious that this establishment takes its food seriously without taking itself all that seriously. Buy the book....make the sauces....assemble the rubs and try the recipes. As the authors suggest, this will be only a guidebook for you. Feel free to experiment with your own spices and flavors. If it isn't already, barbeque will become an indispensable part of your culinary experience!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"I've got a lot of BBQ books, maybe 40 or 50, and I would have to say this one has moved to the top of my list! Its got it all over the others. This book has &quot;the vibe&quot; its got soul, funk, rock and roll and some of the best damn barbecue recipes you'll ever come across. I'll have to settle for having to recreate the recipes as I am nowhere near this juke joint (but I am putting it on my BBQ Mecca list!)but just flipping thru the pages of this gaw-jus book I get a feeling like I can hear the music, smell the 'que and meet the characters that inhabit this place. Who says Dinosaurs are extinct! Chow time! Get cookin' get smokin! This is one 'Saur that Roars!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"I have many cook books (much to my wife's chagrin) and I use this one all the time. It is clear, concise, and the recipes are SUPER! It also offers a detailed resource page for all of those ingredients that are hard to find. This book is not just about BBQ either, there are plenty of other non-BBQ recipes, desserts, etc. An over-used phrase but.........\\"A must have\\"!!!!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"As a long time lover of the &quot;Dinosaur&quot; in Syracuse I wasn't quite sure what to expect in the cookbook. In short, it is everything that I could have hoped for and more. It is visually stunning and chock full of useful information for both novice and experienced 'que people, in addition to the recipes. The sense of humor and spirit of life that exemplifies the Dinosaur is mirrored as well. And the recipes!!! They actually are giving them all away! Hands down, this is the best barbeque cookbook I have ever seen. P.S. You'll still want to eat at the Dinosaur 'cause it always tastes better with one of their Platinum Margaritas."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"Many reviewers of the book have been to the restaurant(s) and have sampled its menus \\"live\\" - I have not. My comments are purely on the book. It is a very good bar-b-que book. The recipes in it are mouthwatering, and I don't mean just a few either. The \\"hook\\" in many of these recipes is that they utilize an all-purpose red rub recipe and/or a basic sauce recipe (the Mutha Sauce) provided in the book. I have made both recipes in order to try many of the interesting recipes. My only complaints are that the Mutha Sauce produces a very vinegary sauce and the one quarter cup of pepper sauce in it may, for some tastes, be a little over the top. If it suits your taste, fine. If your taste is more to the sweet, either amend the recipe or use another red sauce that you prefer."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"WOW!!!! What can I say received the cookbook on monday and planned my trip to Syracuse today (friday). I'm a Syracuse native and on my trips back there it is quite rare for me not to eat every lunch and dinner at the Dinosaur. Like several of the other reviewers I'm a voracious cookbook hoarder and this book really stands out. It is absolutely my favorite bar-b-que book. It does a great job of capturing the funky vibe of the place and the recipes are unbeleivable, but you've realy got to go there."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"I've ordered hundreds of books from amazon, and this is only the second one I've bothered to write a review on. I'm no fabulous cook, but every recipe I've tried has been unbelievably good. The Honey Cornbread, Key Lime pie, Tomato and Garlic soup, Sweet Potato Pecan pie, and Macaroni 'n Cheese Shepard's pie are the ones I've made so far. I live near Syracuse and have been to the restaurant many times; these dishes turn out as delicious as the ones they serve there. I know I'll be making every recipe in this book, especially for dinner parties at my house, then my guests WILL think I'm a fabulous cook. Thank-you, John Stage, for a work of art. My taste buds thank you too!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"My fiance received the cookbook as a gift for Christmas one year, so I tried a couple of the recipes on the grill. From there I bought a Weber smoker and used the recipes for ribs and pulled pork.I have a number of BBQ books on smoking, but this book was my inspiration, and remains my home base from which to experiment with different rubs, sauces and recipes. You simply can't go wrong with the book. I'm sure they kept their best secrets out of the book, but it is darn close. I actually like the Drunken Shrimp recipe in the book better than at the restaurant.I live in Rochester and eat there frequently. It really is an 'experience' to go there - set on the edge of the Genesee River, great food, and some of the best live blues bands in the area. It's worth going out of your way for if you're traveling through the state. The original is in Syracuse."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"Have already cooked a couple of the reciepes in it and shared them with some friends and they loved it. Will have to tone down some of the spices, the old belly can't handle them anymore, but still very good."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"Ate at one of their resturants, enjoyed the food, so we bought the book. The recipes are so true to the dishes served at the resturant. No funky weird ingredients in the recipes that cost a fortune and will be used only once. Have used this book as a house warming gift for some of our friends."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"I love this cookbook and all the recipes! I have had some recipes from a friend and they are amazing.

Our family passed it around looking at it (and fighting for it!). Ha! I went online and proceded to order additional books for gifts.

If you ever get to Syracuse or Rochester you have to go to the restaurant, but now the next best thing is all here in the book. Mouthwatering photos, all the Dino characters, and the story behind the joint make this a great cookbook and short story all in one. I vote it the cookbook of the year!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"The book is a quick and entertaining read with the authors providing a history of their restaurants from the spark of an idea to three locations in Syracuse, Rochester, and New York City. Each recipe has a short story and the surrounding pages are accompanied by humorous quotes from the restaurant patrons. There are a lot of great looking recipes (descriptions as well as the actual photographs). Each recipe that I've have tried has been absolutely excellent. Highly recommend the \\"Mutha Sauce\\" (great by itself or as a base for other sauces), \\"Not Your Mama's Meatloaf,\\" \\"Macaroni & Cheese Sheppard's Pie,\\" \\"Honey Hush Cornbread,\\" and the \\"Rice Pudding.\\" My wife uses the book just as much as me (her favorite recipe is the \\"Dr Pepper Texas Chocolate Cake\\")."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"I got this cookbook shortly after going to the BBQ. It was just by accident we found the restaurant while up in Syracuse. I managed to \\"accidentally\\" find my way back several times that weekend..until I was nearly too sick from stuffing my face with meat to finish my nursing clinicals. Whoops!This book is the mecca of BBQ cookbooks. Try it, you will love it! I also just noticed that Wallyworld box mart has started stocking their sauces and I snatched up the last 2 bottles to mop my chops with out of laziness.Nothing is a substitute for actually visiting this awesome joint so start saving up those frequent flyer miles so you too can enjoy the source of inspiration for this cookbook! :) Stepping in there is like stepping into a movie of sorts. Lots of pizzaz and attitude - much like this book. I've had lots of BBQ in my life - been to Tennessee and Texas to name a few places - and Dino is right up there with the best ever."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"We have made several recipes in this cookbook and they are all excellent. Some ingredients are hard to find, but they are well worth it."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"My husband actually purchased this book as a bachelor. And, thank goodness!! I'm newer to BBQ and this is a fun, easy to use, and informative cookbook that results in amazingly delicious dishes. The Mutha Sauce is super (even tinkering with the ketchup ingredient). And, the Mojito Marinade (and Mojito Chicken) is outstanding! The Coleslaw and Asparagus, Red Pepper and Potato Salad recipes give these sides new life and will make your family or friend you are cooking for feel loved!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"I have never enjoyed a cookbook more than this one. I had a Bar-B-Que last weekend and made only Dinosaur Bar-B-Que recipes. Every dish was divine. The cajun corn, barbecue beans, cornbread, black beans and rice and everything else I made was amazing. The \\"Red Rub\\" is the best rub I have ever used. We finished with the peanut butter pie. WOW!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"One of the best cookbooks I've ever used. All the recipies are from their restaurant and the food tastes amazing.

Thanks L & L!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"My significant other thinks that he is a BBQ master, I havn't had the heart to tell him that truely, 10% of what he BBQs comes out good. He likes to experiment with his own sauces (mostly beer, and a little bit or worcestershire), and always comes up with some weird side dishes that are kind of gross.In order to encourage his fledgeling interest and guide him towards a more tasty way, I purchased this book for him. Well, more for myself but...you get the point!At first he was a little hurt, but then I made the Mac n' Cheese shepherds pie, encompassing everything that he loves: meat, cheese, tabasco. He was skeptical, but ended up loving it and brought the leftovers to work to show off to all of his friends. The next night, we had chicken and andouille and peppers; he loved that even more, and he was sold on the book, read it front to back, and began testing out other recipes that he thought sounded good. We have loved everything so far, we've tried almost everything! I am particularly impressed by the side dishes - the cajun corn is amazing! I also like that they encompass a lot of new things for us - red bell peppers and other veggies especially.We both now LOVE this book (me, especially). We have made almost every recipe out of it.However, the true gem in this book is the cooking instruction, and the sauces and rubs.It has a whole directory on how to cook different cuts of meat on the grill (HALLELUJAH!) and on the stovetop, what to cook it in, etc. And the sauces and rubs, hello! The mutha sauce is absolutely amazing and we now make it by the pound and put it in everything. The red rub is amazing. The creole seasoning is fantastic!We LOVE these recipes because as novice cooks, they are easy to follow and outline exactly what you need to do and exactly when to do it. And even if you make an opps, it's salvageable because regardless it's gunna taste good.Finally, there's tons of fun quotes and pictures in it....who doesn't like some entertainment when cooking?Overall, it's the best cookbook that I've EVER found. There is not one recipe that we havn't liked so far!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"This book is the best! I live nearby Syracuse and fell in love with this BBQ. The book gives recipes for their sauces and rubs, both used in the recipes troughout the book. I bought my first book at the BBQ in Syracuse and the manager will autograph it next to her pic, have servers sign it, etc. It is the best gift I have given to all my family and friends who seek a great BBQ. And the fried tomatoes are good too!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"Great recipes. They're easy and always a hit.

If you've been a back-yard barbque person using rubs and store bought sauce and want to go to another level, you'll love this book. It takes a little time to prep the ingredients and make up the &quot;Mutha Sauce&quot;,but the end result is well worth it. On our next trip to the East Coast we are planning a quick stop in Syracus to experience the real deal."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"I have been eating at the Dinosaur in Syracuse,NY for about 6 years now. It is a &quot;must stop&quot; when I travel for business in the area. So naturally, when I found out about the cookbook, I was excited. I have made about 8 of the dishes and have found them to be just as excellent as at the restaurant. This book does it right! The recipes are clearly and concisely written with some humour and twangy fun throw in.I highly recommend this book and have given three as gifts and have gotten rave reviews from the recepients."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"Just about the perfect cookbook! GREAT recipes, great humor in the form of phrases gathered from the restroom walls left by patrons of the resturant, (an encouraged practice at the Dinosaur), and lots of color photos. Sorry but my opinion is, what good is a cookbook if the author doesn't have the guts to show what they are presenting. Sure it's a cost factor in the production of the book, but a big purchasing factor for me.This book is one of my all time favorites. Haven't had a bad recipe out of it yet and really don't expect to find one. The resturant is in up state New York, and I would love to get there one day, (may be a bit too close to an ex-wife however), to have some great food, and listen to some sweet and hot live blues the resturant also features. That should just about sum up the direction in food this book takes. Little fancy but all great, down home, rib stickin', diet bustin', soul feedin' fare. To heck with the ex., I'm off to the 'Saur! Even if it is only on my cookbook shelf right now."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"Think that all the good bbq is in the south, think again. Dinosaur BBQ is a fantastic BBQ joint that makes traditional dishes with a little attitude. The two restaurants, Rochester and Syracuse also have some of the best blues bands you'll ever see. The cookbook gives all the restaurant favorites. All the sides are fantastic. Even if you don't have a traditional smoker, the authors have made sure that all recipes can be done on a Weber Grill."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"While on a business trip to Syracuse my daughter asked me to stop at the Dinosaur Bar-B-Que to pick up this cookbook. After an hour wait at 9pm on a Tuesday night (the place was packed) I finally ordered my meal. I live in the South and I found this to be one of the best Bar-B-Que \\"joints\\" I have ever been to. I ended up buying the book, but after a few weeks of trying it out I found I could not part with it. Had to order a second copy (for my daughter) from Amazon. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"This is your book. &quot;Dinosaur Bar-B-Que&quot; is a wild, funny, exciting cookbook filled with a lot of good eating. It's not a cookbook for the serious chef, but rather for those who appreciate high flavor, good times, great music and ambience and a general sense that food is an intrinsic part of a good life.Many of the recipes are best made on a grill, but you can adapt them. They won't be quite the same, but then flexibility is all. The point is to eat well and have fun. And you can do both with the help of this book."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"We've been waiting for this for almost 3 years! If you are ever in Syracuse or Rochester you have to stop in, but at least now you can take a little of the Dino home. It's all here - mouthwatering photos, the whole cast of characters, and the behind the scenes story of how it all got started. It's as much an engaging short story as it is a cookbook... Glad it's finally here and can't wait to get cooking!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"This book comes as close to home as I can get without walking to my own kitchen! And these guys are in New York! The photographs alone are worth the price of this masterpiece! Mouthwatering tried and true authentic recipes! I can't think of any dish in this book that wouldn't satisfy someones Jurassic Appetite! My only disappointment is the fact that there isn't a Dinosaur Bar-B-Que restaraunt around the corner from where I live! Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"This is the best BBQ book in my collection ( about 20 books), the whole feel of true BBQ in everywhere in it, and i know because i cater parties and barbeque's as a side job. If you love bbq or just like great cookbooks than this one is a must.Also if you ever get to within 150-200 miles of this place you have to make time tostop! I did on a fishing trip to the great lakes...now we will go back evey chance we get!The book is just as great as the place so dont think twice about both....just do-it."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"Even if you've never eaten at a Dinosaur BBQ restaurant you'll be pleased with this cookbook.

Try the Mac & Cheese Shepards Pie - delish!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"Ok, this is my first review. Ever. Bear with me.I enjoy bbq, and better yet, my friends enjoy MY bbq. I've accumulated many bbq books, but this book is without a doubt the best one I have. We all have those books you go into for one recipie, and otherwise take up space on a shelf. This is the only cookbook, regardless of bbq or fine cuisine, that I go back to multiple times for multpile recipies. The spine is broken, I can't say that for any other single book I own. My friends ask me for recipies all the time, and every time I tell them to go get this book. It is that good, and you will not be disappointed. The meatloaf recipie is fantastic (and I spent the first 28 years of my life hating meatloaf). Put this in your basket, and click the checkout button. Don't even think about it."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"Nothing really needs to be said just buy it, you'll love every recipe in this book. They go through how to create the amazing meals they have at the resturant, from how to use smoke on a home bbq to using the correct sauces at the correct time. Appitizers to desert its all in there. The only recipe book you will ever need."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"On the one hand we are very lucky that the Rochester Dinosaur is only an hour away---but on the other hand it is an hour away and some days that is not feasible. I have tried for years to make their incredible \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" with spicy buttermilk dressing but haven't really hit the mark. It is wonderful to have the recipes--that make this restaurant worth a drive in a snow storm--right at my fingertips. My family has two favorite BBQ places--the Dinosaur in Rochester and Southern Soul in St. Simon Island GA...truly food fit for the Gods. We thank the Dinosaur for being so generous with their secrets. Even though it's great to be able to make things at home, the atmosphere makes it still worth the drive. This is a very easy to follow, fun cookbook. I'd give this 10 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"If you love grilling/bbq this is one of the best books you will ever buy.

Unfortunately, I don't live in Syracuse anymore, so I can't always feed the need for their fabulous food. I just got their cookbook, and have had the chance to try only one recipe - the cajun corn. It was dead-to-rights just like what they serve at the Dino. If that's any indication of how close the recipes are to the real thing, I can't wait to try more recipes!

I still like to go there every time I'm in town. I bought this book recently and cooked an all-Dino 4th of July feast that was delicious. I cooked the Asparagus, Red pepper & Potato salad, bbq chicken (I used skinless, boneless breasts) and their most DELICIOUS bbq baked beans. The beans were a lot of work but completely worth it! (I found the Zatarain's mustard in Gelson's & used their brand of italian turkey sausage to cut the fat). I must admit I used the pre-made Dino sauces that you can purchase in the stores back in NYS, and I don't plan on every making my own sauces from scratch, but I think it's great they provide the full recipes! I did prepare my own spice rubs, though, and it was simple (though I found the red rub for the chicken a bit too salty). There are still plenty of recipes I plan on trying, and many look extremely simple, though the smoked meats look like a lot of work. I doubt I'll attempt my own pulled pork, for instance, which is my FAVORITE item at the restaurant. Visiting Dinosaur in person is definitely a must for any fans out there, since their meats are slow-cooked and the best ever, but in lieu of that, this book is pretty good!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"My husband and I used to go to Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse when I was in graduate school there. It's one of the only things I miss about Syracuse. We were given a copy of the cookbook as a wedding gift, and have made many recipes from it; all of them have been wickedly tasty, and there is not a single one I would not make again. Our particular favorites are the mojito marinade, the cornbread, the tomato soup, the spicy drunken shrimp, and my husband is a big fan of the ribs. We have made the ribs for friends and family and the recipe is now being circulated throughout the Pacific Northwest, quite happily (even by my mother-in-law to random people in [...]). We have bought four copies of the cookbook now to give as gifts. This is a great addition to your cookbook collection."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"Excellent! Easy to read recipes and how to, this book will give anyone, from amature to master griller a new weapon in the grillin arsonal. Very funny and full of character, this is more than just a cook book. A must have for any grill or kitchen, goes way beyond just plain old bar-b-que."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","review":"I'm a native Texan, and have been cooking Bar-B-Que for about 30 years, so I was naturally skeptical of \\"Yankee\\" Bar-B-Que. That said, I was pleasantly surprised with these recipes. We may differ on a few minor details, but overall, this is an excellent book. Some of the recipes are very close to mine, and their techniques are easy to follow. Whether you're an aspiring cook or an experienced one, there's something in there for you.

I purchased it mostly because I'd been to the Syracuse restaurant, had a great time, and figured this book made a nice &quot;souvenir&quot; if nothing else. What a pleasant surprise: I've tried at least a dozen of the recipes (many more than once -- the real sign of a great cookbook) and all of them turned out wonderfully. And I'm not just talking BBQ -- I've made seafood, stews and braises, vegetables, and desserts from this book too. It's fun to read, and the instructions/layout are clear and comprehensive.

The authors, historians at UCLA who have written on American history and on the Enlightenment, argue for a pragmatic and empirical approach to studying the past, against the \\"absolutisms\\" of a reified, capitalized, and \\"heroic\\" Science, Cold War ideologies, strong post-modernism, and \\"traditionalism.\\" Against all that they make the case that history is study of an objective and to some extent knowable past, which should serve democratic values by telling a story that embraces multiple narratives.Three issues in this book particularly interested me: their take on the epistemology of history, conservatives on campus, and how historians with an ax to grind (basically, almost all of us) can support an idea by placing it in a larger historical context.I noted with interest that the authors, who generally wrote as secularists, found themselves using the words \\"faith\\" and \\"belief\\" to describe the historical epistemology they found most reasonable: \\"Belief in the reality of the past and its knowability is essential to a practice of history . . . An openness to the interplay between certainty and doubt keeps faith with the expansive quality of democracy . . . a belief in the reality of the past . . . Such faith helps discipline the understanding by requiring constant reference to something outside of the human mind.\\"While I am not sure the adjective \\"scientific\\" best describes historical epistemology, such comments remind us that uncertainty and knowledge are always in tension, and that this state of affairs is healthy. History is never a matter of certain proof, rather of warranted belief based on good evidence. I have argued that this form of \\"faith\\" is very close to what informed Christians have always meant by the word. This is a common sense view of epistemology that finds middle ground between the positivism of a Richard Dawkins and \\"blind faith.\\"The authors position themselves towards the middle of contemporary academic American \\"culture wars.\\" They admit, on the one hand, that some \\"politically correct\\" talk goes too far in limiting free speech. I think their somewhat more emphatic criticism of the opposite tendency, what they call \\"traditionalism,\\" is mostly overstated, though. They picture conservative colleagues as \\"muscular ideologues.\\" They accuse those who oppose compulsory classes in women's studies or multiculturalism of carrying out an \\"all-out war on multiculturalism and the democratization of the university,\\" \\"using the dead hand of the past . . . to muzzle the voices of the present\\" and creating a \\"national bogey in the form of political correctness.\\" They position traditionalists as defenders of the \\"status quo\\" and de facto opponents of the \\"effort to democratize the university.\\"Much of their talk on this subject seems overwrought, and I don't think it accurately reflects the situation on American universities. The \\"status quo\\" is anything but conservative or \\"traditionalist\\" on American campuses. Making the university more \\"democratic\\" would entail participation not just by the assortment of neo-Marxists, radical skeptics, relativists, post-modernists, and \\"liberals\\" the authors describe, but also by that huge portion of the American populace that holds to \\"traditional\\" values. Forcing students to take politically radical classes, which often prove in practice to be taught by professors hostile towards the tradition in which those students have been brought up, seems by their own lights anti-democratic. The authors equate \\"the decision by an American university to recruit postmodernist faculty members\\" with \\"searching for scholars with a particular expertise,\\" as if choosing ideologues of a particular stripe were the same as choosing people with expertise in a given field of study.I have been told how an earlier generation of moderately liberal faculty members, in a desire to recruit more widely, elected scholars who were wed to some of the far-left agendas they mention. Unfortunately the new, ideological scholars did not always share an appreciation of philosophical diversity, so the faculty became more illiberal and exclusive. It would be nave to equate radical stances with \\"liberality\\" in the ethical sense.Towards the end of the book, Appleby, Hunt and Jacob make some interesting comments on the democratic value of historical study.They point out that history can provide minority groups with a psychologically empowering social solidarity. Historical precedent can lend the oppressed a fellowship with the past: \\"roots,\\" to use the term Alex Haley used to justify his own search for dignity as an African American descendent of slaves.As someone who studies the process by which Christian thinkers relate their faith to pre-Christian traditions, I find this interesting. But of course historical precedent is a double-edged sword, because every tradition is diverse. Appleby, Hunt, and Jacob open the door to all kinds of \\"marginal\\" and \\"diverse\\" viewpoints to enter the mainstream, but do not help us judge between them.The power of alternative historical narratives to strengthen marginal positions is ambivalent. One can find precedent not just for abortion, but infanticide or human sacrifice, in Western history. The Nazis also appealed to a real or imagined pre-Christian past to reinvent slave labor and a virulent form of human sacrifice.The question, then, is what criterion one will use to decide which parts of the human heritage one should link to. For me, that's Christ. The authors make it clear that they think neither religion nor science provides an adequate criterion. The pragmatic alternative they offer seems fuzzy and open to manipulation. I guess that's the nature of pragmatism. They seem like reasonable people, though, and make many interesting points."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"The book argues that various types of absolutisms (political, intellectual, or ideological) have been dethroned. Ever since the \\"heroic model of Science\\" (which in the past centuries enjoyed an aura of absolute validity) has been shown to be less than \\"perfectly objective,\\" a struggle has ensued to fill the vacuum in the interpretation of history.On one extreme we find the radical projects of the so-called De-constructionism, championed by Derrida and Focault (mutually exclusive projects, by the way), claiming that the human subject is a fiction and that all attempts to retrieve meaning and valid interpretation from the past are doomed to fail, especially when we try to derive lessons for the future. These philosophers want to deconstruct the notion of the individual as an autonomous, self-conscious agent; to de-center the subject, his primacy as a location for making judgements and for seeking the truth. Human beings are hopelessly caught in the prison of language. They attack \\"logocentrism,\\" namely the idea that words express the truth of reality. Thus, the direction taken by postmodernism leads to relativism and to nihilism. Putnam, in his Renewing Philosophy, p. 133, claims that \\"deconstruction without reconstruction\\" amounts to irresponsibility; this is true, I may add, if one embraces methodological skepticism rather than dogmatic skepticism, which is instead what the deconstructionists are doing. Apparently, Putnam's critique misses the mark.The other extreme is represented by Traditionalism, \\"fixed\\" in its classicism and in a hopeless resistance to what is known today as \\"multiculturalism\\". The authors blame the traditionalists for lumping together multiculturalism, postmodernism and social history, and for resisting a process that the authors call the \\"democratization of the university.\\" The authors contend that this process has exposed the racist, sexist, homophobic and Eurocentric roots of contemporary historiography. (Bloom and Hirsch scoff at this process, and remain angry at \\"tenured radicals\\" and at the \\"philistine critics.\\")The position advocated by the authors is Pluralism and Multiculturalism (heavily influenced by Historicism). The authors call for a \\"democratic practice of history\\", for \\"practical realism\\" (that somehow embraces the correspondence theory of truth). They also argue in favor of Truth and Objectivity, though not in the traditional, fixed perspective and against what they call a \\"debilitating relativism.\\" They seek for a qualified objectivity; no research is neutral, since knowledge involves struggle amongst various groups of truth-seekers (\\"Objectivity does not require taking God's perspective, which is impossible\\"). The authors claim that we need to come to terms with subjectivity, artificiality and language dependence. Against post-modernists, they argue that an inquiring mind is an operative tool: the past exists and we must try to reconstruct it, since it is knowable and real. What we need is methodical skepticism. They recall the words of Diderot: \\"All things must be examined, all must be winnowed and sifted without exception and without sparing anyone's sensibilities.\\" (s.v. \\"Encyclopedia\\") and again: \\"The follower of the Enlightenment is an eclectic, skeptic investigator who trampling underfoot prejudice, tradition, venerability, universal assent, authority - in a word, all that overawes the crowd - dares to think for himself, to ascend to the clearest general principles, to examine them, to discuss them, to admit nothing, save the testimony of his own reason and experience. (s.v. \\"Eclecticism\\")\\". The authors talk about the tradition of Marxist historiography; of the French Annales School, which in the 1950s and 1960s paid attention to three layers: 1) Climate, geography, biology; 2) Social structures and patterns; 3) Politics, culture and intellectual life. This \\"history from below\\" pays little attention to what traditionalists care about (statesmen, generals, diplomats, intellectuals, ideas and institutions) in favor of social history, the history of workers, servants and the poor.As far as I am concerned, in choosing the way to study and to teach History to my students and children, I will purposely ignore and neglect a) Social history (with its emphasis on ordinary people); b) Economic history (emphasis on how economic forces work); but focus and celebrate c) History of Ideas. Ideas and views shape the world and the course of events; everything else is secondary to me and not of much interest."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"Well written with ample empirical examples and insights most of us would never consider. This book is for anyone interested in tracing Western perspectives from the emergence of reason under the thumb of ignorance and dogma, through the advent of science, to muddlings of our present era returning to ignorance and dogma under the confines of censorship and totalitarian Political Correctness.Driving forces that made America and the West what it became are surveyed - forces including the birth of reason, influence of science and our Western notion of progress. Focused on their topic, our authors properly consider what matters most to America and the West, excluding a vast array of other cultures because those cultures (Mayan, Hutu, Chilean, Eskimo - a virtually endless list) have little or absolutely nothing to do with Western development. Thus we are saved from useless inclusion of irrelevance. Nor do they waste trees on a cacophony of \\"voices\\" with something opposing to say about the facts of history as though their intent is to produce committee minutes. Noted, repeatedly, are oversights and outright suppression of females as bared from the men's club, but it is treated as a fact of history, not a call to arms.Results of these forces included exaltation of history and \\"heroic science\\" as a means of positive reference for America (and Europe) that has since been attacked by factions wishing in part to make history's picture larger while reinventing history in ways that deny credit for anyone but their own group. It requires imagination, but the authors clarify how successful Postmodernist relatives have been in advancing the most ridiculous ideas, and, as noted, would not be given a second thought were they not becoming so dominant at our universities. Ideas such as; We invent theories in science, we do not discover them; What was not said or not written is more important than what was - as everyone in every period is said to have been political and fully so with no regard for truth. Thus whatever point was made was in fact a diversion hiding what they \\"really\\" meant. This brings to bear creative talents of our finest historians and \\"text interpreters\\" as they expend lifetimes inventing, out of thin air, what the truth \\"really\\" was. A boundless exercise as what was not spoken or written remains infinite, while what was is limited. And such conclusions from those who paradoxically preach \\"the truth is, there is no truth, and that's the truth\\".Thankfully the authors state the obvious. \\"Relativism, a modern corollary of skepticism\\" not only reasonably questions but is now used to promote doubt in knowledge of any kind, while to the contrary our authors argue \\"truths about the past are possible, even if they are not absolute\\". For those who claim we can know nothing, and that even our theories of nature are pure, politicized imagination, we are reminded that artifacts exist - remains of civilizations, buildings, monuments, graveyards on battlegrounds, movements resulting from written words and speeches. As for inventing scientific theories as simply another false Western bias, one may wonder how all those atoms and galaxies know our political views well enough to behave precisely as predicted by theory.The authors commit the error of confusing science with scientists - science being an ideal, while scientists remain human - and they wrongly promote a reference which claims the defense industry as dominated by scientists when it is rather dominated by engineers. This offering to reinforce a notion that science is political. (Indeed, scientists may be.) With an open mindedness bordering on mere \\"inclusivity\\" Postmodernists are given limited credit, stating they \\"deserve\\" to be heard on some matters - which left me wondering why serious historians would squander time on sophomoric reflections of declining education and trite exercises in sensitivity toward the absurd. We might consider the notion of a moon made of green cheese still holds promise if a certain vast system of conditions concerning our measurements and conceptions exist - say that we are in fact being manipulated by aliens. But any advancement in our understanding of the human condition is bound to be wasted. As a German engineer once said, \\"I have no time to waste on probable failures.\\" So why waste it?An assumption is made from the outset - common to anyone's era, which is not challenged - that the past was incorrect in their perspective. Perhaps we are wrong in refuting their positivism. Instead we assume without question the heroic models were flawed. Despite what we consider the past's delusions and narrow mindedness, we are never offered an option that their perspective, though incomplete, was superior to our own in which winners at the auction are those with the most terrible things to say about who we are. Perhaps the authors saw this as too \\"inclusive\\" and a probable failure."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"I'm willing to bet every person applauding this book isn't a historian. Historians check facts; that's why history books have to document their sources.As readers, you may want to know who wrote the book. The three authors of \\"Telling the Truth about History\\" are all devout Christians. Not only are they devout Christians, but they're intelligent designers. They believe that science affirms the existence of God, but only Newtonian science (so Darwin doesn't count).They begin the book by claiming their book is not a polemic against postmodernism. In fact, that's exactly what this book is, and it's not only an attack on postmodernism, it's an attack on social progress in general.They are horribly flawed with a number of their arguments. Here's a few of their main claims and why they're wrong:1) \\"Darwin's theory of natural selection led to racism in Europe.\\" There were a number of other racists writing around the time of European imperialism and the rise of nationalism. Racism was alive and well in Europe long before Darwin. As historians and historiographers, Appleby, Hunt, and Jacob should know about this. They should also know that much of European racism, especially antisemitism, has its roots in Catholic traditions -- not scientific ones. Just read Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\" if you need some examples of pre-Darwinian racism.2) \\"Nietzsche was an antisemite.\\" The quote of his they use on p. 209 is from \\"Genealogy of Morals.\\" Had they actually read Nietzsche's book that they pulled this quote from, they would know that Nietzsche was not claiming any of the antisemitic lines that were written. He himself was narrating a story where a herdish fanboy of his work was incorrectly regurgitating Nietzsche's philosophy back at Nietzsche. In other words, Nietzsche was saying anyone who was claiming the Jews were in any way inferior to Europeans was a moron. This is history at its worst: Not only did the authors incorrectly cite Nietzsche, they did it in such a way as to distort his image historically. *This underhanded tactic is exactly what the authors claim they are writing against.*3) \\"Science claims absolute knowledge.\\" Western scientists haven't made this claim since the turn of 20th century. (Mid-Eastern and Far-Eastern scientists never made this claim to begin with.) During the early 1900's, physicists were already aware that there were major problems with the Newtonian conception of classical mechanics. After the quantum and relativity revolutions, scientists no longer made claims to absolute knowledge because they knew they could never mathematically demonstrate that events occurred deterministically. Science can only claim what's most probable according to what is already known and documented. Again, as historians, the authors should be acutely aware of these well-known facts.So, in short, read this book with caution. This is not a scholarly text. This is pop-history masquerading as the intellectual middle-ground; in actuality it is right-wing progpaganda at its \\"finest.\\""},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"I am taking my History capstoneatfor my undergrad and I have to say I hate this book. Appleby, Jacob and Hunt all teach history at UCLA. Not known for it's ultra-liberal persepective. SO they bash the church, white males and consevative historians. THey have done their work and the book is well done. I wish that teachers using this book would show the other persepective of historical progress."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"Written by three distinguished historians, this is a well intentioned but only partly successful effort to develop a systematic approach to historical truth. The authors open with a set of historiographic chapters covering the development of history as a discipline since the 18th century. This is a generally concise and nice precis of the importance of the natural sciences as a model of inquiry, the idea of history of a teleological and progressive model of modernity, the development of secular and nationalized professional history in the 19th century, and especially the emergence of a strong and rather distorted triumphalist historical narrative about the USA. This is followed by some good descriptions of how this tradition then began to run into problems. The somewhat \\"heroic\\" model of scientific history became its own form of dogma, and with the Progressive era, serious doubts aroase about the 19th century triumphalist model. The authors are also justly and conventionally critical of naive positivist views of historical explanation.This is generally well done, though the need for concision may have led the authors to some incomplete and inaccurate statements. For example, the authors' facile attribution of late 19th century racism as the inadvertant consequence of Darwin's theory ignores the substantial contribution of influential non-Darwinist thinkers like Gobineau and Agassiz. Similarly, the authors' discussion of 19th century historiography ignores the fact that the greatest 19th century American historian was the disenchanted Boston Brahmin Henry Adams. Adams' work is a sustained and brilliantly written presentation of history as irony.The authors really go astray in the middle of the book with their chapter \\"Discovering the Clay Feet of Science.\\" This is a description of the misleading nature of the \\"heroic\\" model of science and how this \\"discovery\\" provoked an intellectual crisis. I don't doubt the authors' assertion that this was a major issue in the community of historians, but the authors' implication that this was a general intellectual crisis is fairly silly. As the authors point out, one of the major features of academic life in the last 50 years is the enormous expansion of universities and the democratization of access to a university education. The authors seem to be unaware that the other great change in universities over that last 2 generations is the enormous expansion and investment in the natural sciences. At my large research university, a majority of the faculty are in the natural sciences or related fields like Medicine or Engineering. In terms of funding, the natural sciences are even more dominant. The discoveries the authors that authors see as uncovering the clay feet of science had no effect on natural scientists or the university administrators who hire them. The suggestion that the writings of a few historians of science or literary critics provoked a general intellectual crisis is hyperbole. THe authors make a similar series of inaccurate claims about the Cold War, which they see as producing \\"distortions\\" of science. While there were real problems with Cold War administration of science, the fact is that rivalry with the Soviet Union was one of the factors that turned the Federal government into the major patron of American science. The Cold War was partly responsible for the enormous progress made by American science in the last 50 years.Because the authors exaggerate the effects of historical revision of scientific progression, they similarly exaggerate the importance of post-modernism/deconstructionism. The authors characterize this movement correctly as an intellectual deadend. But the amount of attention and number of pages devoted this is essentially inconsequential movement is wholly out of proportion to its actual importance.The authors positive contribution is an attempt to define an approach to history they call \\"practical realism.\\" The authors have a good discussion of the problems with establishing truthfulness and causal relationships in historical analysis. Their recommendation, epistemically based on Peirce's fallibalism, is a modestly realist approach based on careful accumulation of data, constant testing of defined hypotheses, skepticism about data, peer review, and a community of scholars open to alternative interpretations. If this sounds familiar, its because it is. Its essentially a version of the best practices of modern science. This is crashing through an open door with a vengeance. As an aside, the authors contrast their position with the \\"metaphysical realism\\" of Karl Popper and his logical positivist \\"associates.\\" Popper would be surprised to find himself grouped with the Vienna Circle philosophers of whom he was so critical. In fact, Popper's work has a strong fallibalist orientation with strong kinship to Peirce's work.The authors also get themselves into trouble with some fairly careless statements. For example, \\"the exclusive dominance of European cultural forms in the United States in now consignable to a specific period,...\\" This from authors whose recommended approach to historical analysis is a clear mimic of western scientific practices and based on a philosophical approach articulated by a 19th century American man. Fallibalist epistemology is based on the work of several imporant 17th and 18th century European philosophers and has roots in Hellenistic Greece. This is about as European as it gets. I don't see the authors recommending nor would they recommend authentic non-European approaches like Theravada Buddhism or Confucianism.Finally, the authors would like a form of American national history suitable for a democratic society. What does this mean? The authors are appropriately critical of instrumental uses of history like the triumphalist version of 19th century America and they are cautious about the dangers of making the same types of error in things like 'Afrocentric' history. So what is their solution? They are not completely explicit but it appears they wish a systematic, accurate, unbiased account of the past that is fair to the historical experiences of all relevant actors, a kind of inclusionary multiculturalism. But how is this different from naive positivism?"},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"I found this book to be one of the most valuable and most hopeful books I have read in a long time. As a High School teacher of American history, I have long grappled with the question of historical truth and how best to teach it to students. I have also wondered if I could justify my own profession, since American history instruction so often seems to be simply political indoctrination in one form or another. This book gave me hope that my efforts are not in vain. The book traces the evolution of history from the enlightenment model of scientific history through postwar issues of postmodernism and relativism;. and the authors persuasively argue that historical truth is possible, even if not absolute. The book is not light reading - I was not able to race through the book, but had to wade through it, so to speak. However, I do feel the book is well worth reading. It is well written, balanced and fair-minded, and it transcends the simplistic conservative-liberal debate over the teaching of history. I feel the book should be read by everyone who is concerned with the teaching of history or the question of historical truth."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"Since this book was written in the wake of the intellectual \`wars' at U.S. universities involving multiculturalism, political correctness and the subsequent backlash to these, it primarily focuses on the history profession in the United States rather than worldwide. Thus, some of the book's shortcomings in not dealing adequately with non-American or non-Western European views or concerns can be forgiven. Despite these flaws, \\"Telling the Truth About History\\" very successfully addresses the many criticisms hurled at the scholarly pursuit of history in recent decades, and the three authors' conclusions can be useful and edifying even for those historians living and working far beyond America's borders. In line with the pragmatism and practical realism the authors extol in their last several chapters, they essentially call for a middle ground between the extremes of postmodern relativism and the apparent absolutes of the Enlightenment \`heroic science' model. This means not abandoning the pursuit of verity while incorporating many of criticisms and even methods of the postmodernist theorists. Truth may still be elusive as ever (to say nothing of absolute truth) but, as they say at one point, even provisional truths are better than ignorance or outright falsehoods - with a nice example from the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev years to illustrate this point. This is a very well-written and persuasive argument for history as a rigorous and expansive (and mind-expanding) academic discipline. Along the way, the authors also provide a very informative overview of historiography from the Enlightenment era to the present, albeit in a largely American context."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"In this historiographical work, the authors convincingly argue that the overthrow of absolutisms which has characterized much of the historical and scientific scholarship of the past century does not carry in its wake the disavowal of all knowledge or truth. In place of the old absolutisms and of the new skepticism, Appleby, Hunt, and Jacob, offer a new model based on a more pragmatic understanding of objectivity and truth.The authors spend the bulk of this book tracing the development of Enlightenment absolutisms in history and science and cataloguing their demise. While this section is more than adequate, the strength of this book lies in the authors' response to history's current postmodern crisis.The authors are more than willing to acknowledge that the pursuit of knowledge is subjective and affected by the personalities involved, yet they insist that a greater diversity of perspectives also brings historical fact into greater focus.As part of their argument, the authors provide the following illustration: let's assume we are all sitting at a table and an object is placed in the middle of it. We are all historians, and that item is a given part of human history. The postmodernists would say that because my perspective differs from yours, we can never know what the object TRULY looks like. The traditionalists would say that our perspectives must be the same, because the item is the same. A, H, and J would claim that our perspectives differ, but that they differ in such a way that, when combined, they provide a better and truer sense of the object's characteristics.Overall, I find this argument very convincing. Multiculturalism (or, the pursuit of multiple perspectives) is not the enemy of Truth, but rather its friend. In effect, the democratization of the academic world ought to serve as a check against unsupported interpretations and theories, thus honing our understanding of the human past.For a weighty, parallel look at some of these same issues, I strongly recommend HERITAGE AND CHALLENGE by Paul Conkin and Roland Stromberg. For those who are interested in a more theoretical book on the questions facing the field of history today, it is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"This book is interesting from a couple of perspectives. First, it was written by three outstanding historians (including Joyce Appleby, a leading colonial historian, and Margaret Jacob, the virtual guru of scientific history) in the late 1990's to repudiate what they saw as a postmodern attack on the integrity of history as a discipline. So there is much disparaging discussion of post-modernism, multi-culturalism, absolurte truth, social history, relativism, cultural history, deconstruction, textualism, etc. I agree with Gordon Wood in his excellent \\"Purpose of the Past\\" that from today's perspective, this dimension of the book comes across as somewhat \\"overanxious and somewhat dated.\\" History as a discipline continues to flourish and explore new areas. This section is really designed for professional historians and those interested in history from the standpoint of epistemology, since it can become somewhat technical, though of substantial value.The second facet of the book, written as background but occuping about 1/3 of the total text of 309 pages, which I found of greater interest is a fascinating recounting of the development of scientific inquiry, from Bacon and Newton on. Probably due to the involvement of Margaret Jacob, this discussion moves into the linkage of science to history in the cultural wars involving the Enlightenment and the Counter-Reformation. Eventually, the narrative discusses the role of \\"Protestant science\\" in American universities; national identity history in the hands of Hegel; and scientific history in the west with Marx, Durkheim and Weber. The competing approaches of Beard and the Progressive historians then enters the stage, leading to social history and the rise of multi-culturalism. In turn, science itself comes under attack and the argument that there is no absolute truth, only relativism, emerges and we are into post-modernism. History becomes a target with allegations that historians have subconscious prejudices, face problems with their methods and very language, and that narrative is destructive as a technique (\\"history is the western myth\\"). This obviously is a lot of ground to cover in a couple hundred pages, but the authors do an outstanding job, although this section is really designed to educate the reader for the key discussion to follow, namely historical inquiry remains viable if not perfect.So the most valuable section of the book may not be that was the focus of the authors' concerns, but that which is preliminary. Nonetheless, a book chock full of interesting insights and ideas, although somewhat dated by today's standards. Unfortunately, it lacks a bibliography, but does have some helpful footnotes as sources for further investigation."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"This is a *popular* historiography of history (i.e., don't expect many footnotes or sources). It reviews the history of historical consciousness since the Enlightenment--its initial emergence as a mimicry of Christian-medieval truth-seeking (as applied to the secular: i.e., power of God is transferred to Nature), the subsequent period of \\"heroic science\\" (the rational, \\"objective\\", scientific model of history), to the reformers and the birth of social history and the postmodern turn in the 20th century.Appleby, Hunt and Jacob, outside of giving us an overview of historiography, also attempt here to show how a pragmatic middle ground between a \\"scientific objectivity\\" and completely fragmented postmodernism might look as method of doing history. Their thesis: neither extreme works, but both points of views bring valuable contributions to the study of history--and they can and should be used to complement each other. We cannot lose sight of \\"objectivity\\" (they don't mean Enlightenment objectivity, they mean the idea that *something* real exists out there, regardless of our interpretations or our problematicizing of our interpretations)--for if we did, we'd lose the \\"object\\" of history. But we have to always remember we are essentially subjective (even though our aims in doing history might be).Appleby, Hunt and Jacob explain they have written this book because it's about time historians explain (to the rest of world) what they do.. As democracy's foundation is the educational enterprise, and as history is integrative of national memory and character, I was struck by this sentiment and theme as a thread through the work.As an overview of themes for those interested in the historiography of history, this is definitely the book you want to read. For those with some background in historiography, this work is probably not rigorous enough (no sources, only a few pages per major thinker, i.e., if your life is Foucault or Derrida or any of the other people they discuss, you will probably find their discussion on your particular specialty to be lacking, and perhaps question the rest of the work)."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"When studying, researching, and writing about an historical event, it may take careful reading and an open mind to understand the foundations that construct a historical narrative. TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HISTORY is a critical examination of the subject of history by three distinguishable historians, Joyce Appleby, Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob, which proves that history and science are essential elements when understanding truth and objectivity as it relates to the past.TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HISTORY is by no means a definitive study. However, it introduces the reader to the historical method, and how the discipline as traversed throughout the years with trends and theoretical approaches. The authors of the book are all eminent historians in each of their respective fields, American, European, and Cultural history, but their study is somewhat skewed when they briefly discuss the multicultural aspect to the understanding of history. Indeed, they cannot touch upon all the events that have occurred in world history, and a few of the subjects that they mention in their discussion do not fall in their area of expertise. But it was interesting to read the authors' tug of war discussion pertaining to postmodernist or revisionist history; at the time the book was published, 1994, postmodernism appeared to be an issue, which now and then is subtly discussed.Overall, the book is very helpful when understanding why one studies, writes, or teaches about history. It is indeed an intricate subject that cannot be clearly understood without understanding other histories and the people and places that constituted a particular past. After re-reading TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HISTORY, it takes intellectual maturity and experience to understand the premise that the authors were attempting to convey. This is an insightful book recommended for discussion."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"Telling the Truth presents a very solid overview of western historiography's evolution and provides a provocative argument for the broadening of perspectives of what is valid for historians to include in their search for accurate causes for past events. The authors' intent to model the democratic practice they preach through collective authorship of the essay was evident, and one wonders if it would have been strengthened further by an examination of the impact their own historical context has had on the creation of their individual ideologies. In short, use themselves as case studies. This would be revolutionary of course, but a potentially very interesting historical version of self-analysis: three professional historians, women educated in the United States, during the 1970s, examining how their own environment and training shaped their views.The emphasis on the significance of the printing press and the loss of clerical authority over publication was well stated. Left unexamined was the importance of the rise of the merchant middle class in Southern Europe, which is surprising considering the social history described later in the text. The Civil War's nationalizing effect and the lack of Black America's inclusion in the traditional American narrative are well founded, but leaves the subject's treatment woefully incomplete. The authors would have been able to draw a more accurate picture of rising American nationalism by including the War of 1812 in their analysis for example. And the nation's history of immigration and resulting discrimination, which includes Asians and Latin Americans as well as Europeans and Africans, is far more complex than presented. In short, the opportunity to use the immigrant experience as historical evidence for the authors' views was under utilized. The passing reference to Native American experiences underscored the authors' main point, but is not drawn out. And for American historians promoting a more gendered approach to history to leave out the suffrage movement was shocking to this reader."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"This is a book by three well known professional historians. Obviously , this book was meant to be a readable introduction to the history of the historical profession and its problems for the unintiated. It falls short for the reader who is already familiar with the major questions raised."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth about History","review":"Telling the Truth About History by Joyce Appleby, Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob is both a history book as well as an attempt to outline a new approach to history altogether. At first, Telling the Truth About History reads like a lamentation for the original, scientific historical approach that was born during the enlightenment, but with sound historical data as well as their own theories, it is obvious that the authors are trying to show how all the different movements towards the telling of history originated, and how and why they all ultimately failed. In the beginning of Telling the Truth About History, the authors tell us that history is simply a search for a basic law of human development. The first laws of human development came with Isaac Newton's Principia and defined the \\"scientist as hero\\" or \\"heroic model of science.\\" The book continues to explain how Newtonian science manifested in applied mechanics and became the \\"mental capital\\" (23) of the Industrial Revolution. With Newton's laws of mechanics came mechanization of other realms of science and even society. Engines. mines, and even labor could all operate under Newton's mechanization theory. The authors of Telling the Truth About History continue to outline how Newtonian science propagated itself outside of science...meaning that it created more leisure time, and allowed physics and new political laws to be discussed during this leisure time. With \\"commercial expansion, enlightened reform, and revolution,\\" science was undeniably the backbone of modernity. With modernity and other changes in science, namely Darwin's theory of evolution came new schools of thought, including the Philosophes, positivism, nationalism and Marxism. From this point on, Telling the Truth About History becomes, in a sense, a History of Relativism, and is a story of how American historical scholars gained and lost scientific objectivity, and their struggle to find it again. The American Historical Profession saw great changes in the years after 1880s and professional standards themselves were born. During this time, the authors argue, national -1- identity became one of the most fatal unsuspected blows to scientific history because, especially with the diversity in America, trying to find national identity derailed scholars from telling one agreed upon notion of history. As Peter Novick does in That Noble Dream, the authors chronicle how growing professionalism in history also meant the growing pressure by different special interest/political groups to write a separate, relative history that also pushed scholars away from scientific objectivity. Truth itself began to seem to be an unattainable and idealistic notion with different groups arguing that their truth was right, and \\"denying the possibility of truth produces a relativism that makes it impossible to choose between Ethical systems.\\" (194) With great care and much evidence, Telling the Truth About History chronicles the search for one truth in history, and it discusses how the latest movements in telling history are right and wrong. Social historians \\"with their passion for breaking apart the historical record had dug a potentially fatal hole into which history as a discipline might disappear altogether.\\" (200) but postmodernist historians \\"question the superiority of present and the usefulness of general worldviews.\\" The authors don't say that these two examples are without their respective pros and cons. Social history made room for cultural history, which seeks to explain that human reason is shaped by culture, not social or scientific contexts and infers meaning rather than telling a cause-and-effect history. Likewise, postmodernists attacked the very foundation of history and became ununified and their aim unclear. (206) Both cultural historians and postmodernists attacked the idea of historical narrative, seeing it as unuseful. It is with these very recent developments in history that the authors of Telling the Truth About History make their call to arms in a new approach to telling history. The authors defend the validity of the narrative saying it is a main ingredient in describing individualism and social identity. They make an appeal for Practical Realism, a somewhat romantic search for interpretation of the meaning of events. Through Practical Realism one can recognize both the existence f an event and its interpretations simultaneously(250). In this way, the author argue, the Postmodernists were right to have destroyed meaning that \\"sustains itself\\" in objects (257) so that the ditinctions between the objects/events and their meaning can become more clear. Chronicling the rise and fall of scientific history as well as explaining the various movements that grew out of the Enlightenment and and how it was otherwise detrimental to telling history, Appleby, Hunt, and Jacob all argue that the meaning of events already exist, and through a summoning of the original hypothetical and theoretical aspects of the Scientific Model as well as adopting a realism in practice, we can again tell history from a more collective, truthful standpoint."},{"Title":"Times of Sorrow/Times of Grace: Writing by Women of the Great Plains/High Plains","review":"From the visually stunning cover to the black and white wildflower drawings and eye pleasing font, this anthology is a keeper.

I am a prairie dweller and writer myself. I've experienced first hand the beauties and sorrows, and yet I found myself astounded by the power of their words. Poets and story tellers shared familiar workworn faces from which every dream has fled, the shame of discovering pockets of starvation and neglect amidst plenty. Secrets that poison generations are spoken plainly, along with heart stabbing sorrow that will never be mended. I read of precious shining moments frozen in time, love that could not be battered or shattered into indifference. And there is the sort of beauty one can only find in the plains - sights, scents, and sounds. Huge black prairie skies full of stars remain unchanged through every generation. Weather, people, and everyday life are lamented or extolled in turn.

Patrick Abrams, love, faith and trust are tested but will the parties involved be willing to forgive and their relationships able to stand the test of time?Miles and Tyler Stewart have been married for five years. They have no children and are happily in love. Miles is the typical Don Juan, always romancing his wife and making sure she knows just how special she is to him. A brief encounter from his past comes back to haunt him and he does his best to not have it resurface. Tyler undoubtedly loves her husband and can't imagine life without him, until she stumbles across something suspicious that leads her to her biggest fear. Their relationship takes a turn for the worse and the happily in love is no more. Can they get their happily ever after back? Or will they remain estranged? Forgiveness is the key but it's not as easy at it seems.Franklin and Clarissa are married but separated and have two daughters. Franklin has a skeleton in his closet that resurfaces in his bedroom and inadvertently causes him and Clarissa to part ways. Clarissa feels betrayed and can't believe what her husband has done to her and her family but the truth, as she knows it is actually a lie that changed her marriage. In an effort to get back with Clarissa, Franklin attempts to make peace with his past. Is it to late for their relationship to overcome the broken trust? Or will they have the ability to forgive and reunite their family?If someone has ever betrayed you and you found it hard to forgive them then you can definitely relate to PERILS OF THE HEART. Nothing hurts more than having someone you care about deceive you. But if you are able to get past it and forgive them for their wrongdoing, you become the bigger person and are more at peace. It use to be difficult for me to forgive, but once I realized not to sweat the small stuff and that my inability to forgive was more harmful than good, I mastered the art of forgiveness and became a much happier person.Reviewed by Eraina B.

While the material is generally presented in a linear fashion, images and texts from different stages of her career are juxtaposed to underline the many recurring themes in her work (dreams, speech, time, technology). Various entertaining stories, observations and anecdotes are interspersed with stage directions and song lyrics. There's an annotated chronology at the end to help keep things straight. Anderson's performances have often utilized the violin, and her numerous modified versions of it are explored (the Tape Bow Violin, the Self-Playing Violin, the digital violin, the neon violin, the Viophonograph). Many of her other innovations are also touched upon, including her projects with the pillow speaker, the Handphone Table, the Acoustic Lens, the video clone, and the body drum-suit.

What is surprising about this slender book is the way in which it is disturbing. There is no chilling, psychologically twisted character here. There is, equally, no brutality, of a sexual nature or otherwise. In fact, Chance, the main character, is indeed an innocent -- he has spent his entire life tending to a garden and otherwise confined to one room. He has only interacted with two other people in his entire life -- The Old Man, who took him in when he was just a child, and a maid in the house they live in. And those interactions were minimal at best. Everything that Chance knows about life he has learned by watching television. It is not Chance who is the disturbing factor of this book (however, the confinements under which he lived his life is certainly disturbing); as the story unfolds, we quickly realize that it is the society around Chance which is disturbed -- the society each and every one of us live in. And to the extent that the parable is true, it is a chilling view of ourselves that we see. Unfortunately, the book doesn't hold up the longer it goes on, and, in the end, it becomes a parody of itself more than a satire of society at large.When the \\"old man\\" who took Chance in takes ill and dies, Chance is unceremoniously thrown out of the only home he's ever known. Wearing one of the old man's tailored suits, he leaves the house and is almost immediately struck by a limousine belonging to a rich society type, Elizabeth Eve Rand (\\"EE\\"). She takes him home to be evaluated by the doctors who are caring for her much older sick husband, and he ends up becoming their permanent house guest. As Chance, who is dubbed Chancey Gardner by EE, interacts with the household and its visitors, he relies heavily on the only thing he knows of human interactions -- what he's observed of them on tv. Whenever it is necessary to socialize, he recalls a similar situation he's seen on tv, and mimics. The only topic he ever talks about is gardening, as it is the only thing he knows. So, when he tells the President of the United States, who is visiting Mr. Rand, of the annual birth, death and rebirth of a garden, his statement is taken as a metaphor on the state of the economy, and suddenly a business man and financial advisor is born. Chauncey is hounded by the media, becoming a guest on news programs and interacting with chancellors and ambassadors at social functions. He continues his \\"metaphor\\" whenever he speaks, and he is deemed a brilliant by his observers. He has become a full blown celebrity.That this simpleton becomes a celebrated business advisor, via the machinations of the media, is certainly a strong statement by Kosinksi. And while the novel is disturbing in this regard -- and there's no escaping that it is -- I ultimately found it a bit repetitive, a bit shallow in its own development as a story. It's a wonderful premise and, probably, an important book. However, it begins to fall flat the longer it goes on, not finding any new ground to cover once its point is made. Still, a book that deserves a reading."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"BEING THERE is an absolute gem, a book worth reading at least once a decade to take a sounding of the world around you. In the childlike, tabula rasa of a simple-minded gardener named Chance, Kosinski has created a complex character who is both sponge and mirror. Out of \\"Chance, the gardener\\" comes Chauncey Gardiner, a man whose entire existence in the home and employment of the Old Man has been framed by what he has seen and absorbed from television and learned from his simple gardening job. Unable to read or write, his every action is refracted through the lens of his television \\"experience.\\" Yet when Chance is unexpectedly released to the world at large as a result of the Old Man's (arguably his father's) death, he becomes a walking mirror, silenting reflecting back at everyone he meets that which they most want to hear and believe about him, and about themselves. More than Woody Allen's Zelig or Winston Groom's (and Tom Hanks's) Forrest Gump, Chance is the perfect empty vessel, the ultimate \\"other\\" whom we can each mold into exactly what we most want him to be.A \\"chance\\" coincidence lands an impeccably-dressed Chauncey in the hands of an aging but wealthy and influential financier named Benjamin Rand and his wife, EE, and their social and political connections soon put Chauncey in contact with the President, foreign ambassadors, television and the press. Gardiner's answers to questions draw upon his gardening knowledge, making them sound like profound parables and metaphors with unusually direct aptness and an almost Biblical depth of meaning. His listeners of course hear what they want to hear, and soon Chauncey Gardiner is a national celebrity and rising star in the world of commerce and even politics.Reading BEING THERE today, it seems hard to believe that Jerzy Kosinski wrote this wickedly funny short parable back in 1970. He was remarkably, albeit sadly, prescient. Consider the American situation today: vicarious thrill-seeking (Fear Factor, The Survivor) and ersatz depictions of reality (The Apprentice, The Loser, The Bachelor, The Contender) fill our television screens, we elevate the most brainless, talentless, or shameless people (Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson, William Hung, Loreena Bobbit, Michael Jackson, Scott Peterson) to celebrity status, we look to pop cult advisors for guidance in our personal and cultural lives (Dr. Phil, Dr. Ruth, Oprah, Martha Stewart), and we elect (twice!) a President infamous for his intellectual dullness, lack of curiosity, ignorance of facts, disdain for newspapers and reading, and utter incapacity to string three spontaneous sentences together to express a meaningful original thought.If you don't believe BEING THERE remains a dead-on satire of American life and political culture, refer to Ron Suskind's discussion with a senior official in the Bush Administration (New York Times, 10/17/04) who asserted that guys like him (Suskind), opponents of this Administration, live \\"in what we call the reality-based community,'' which he defined as people who ''believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.'' ''That's not the way the world really works anymore,'' he continued. ''We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality.\\" Sadly, Jerzy Kosinski died in 1991, but wherever he is, he's undoubtedly laughing his head off.Chauncey Gardiner for President in 2008?"},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Jerzy Kosinski has written a delightful modern parable. Each actor in this allegorical tale sees Chance as a wise and insightful sage. But Chance, dubbed Chauncey Gardiner, is an illiterate gardener whose only contact with the outside world before being caught up in high finance, politics, and diplomacy was his garden and his television watching habit. He doesn't try to hide his past as he adapts as best he can to his new environment. His aphorisms taken from his experiences in the garden are interpreted by his listeners as great sooth. Because he has no discoverable past he is believed to be an operative some powerful organization in the eyes of the beholders.This is a story to enjoy and give some thought to."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Chance is the sixty-something gardener in an old man's estate. He has never left the grounds of the estate in his entire life, being rather slow. Yet, although he's not the brightest proverbial bulb on the proverbial Christmas tree, Chance is pleasant, polite, and anxious not to offend. When he is thrust out into the world, due to the old man's unexpected demise, these traits serve him well. People like him, automatically. People trust him, instinctively. Through a series of extremely unlikely coincidences, Chance finds himself hobnobbing with the president of the U.S., and giving him advice on economic matters, albeit in singularly vague terms. His advise, however, does always seem to contain a sort of metaphorical wisdom, and before he knows what's happening, pundits are falling all over each other to be the one to interpret his oracular utterances.This book claims to be a modern fable, discussing the power of the media to shape our notions of leadership, etc, but I think it speaks to a deeper issue -- the role of outsiders in general, and how we project our hopes and fears onto them. It's also about a certain kind of fear, by which I mean the fear we all experience of having to admit to ourselves that we strongly suspect that nine times out of ten our elected officials are just full-court-bluffing their way through life, and are every bit as clueless and scared as the rest of us. In this case, due to Chance's refreshingly childish innocence, the Emperor not only has no clothes, but he doesn't even understand that people want to BELIEVE that he does.If anyone's interested in buying a similar sort of story for their children, I'd like to recommend the story &quot;Nazar the Brave,&quot; which is in a collection of Armenian folktales called &quot;Once There Was and Was Not,&quot; compiled and retold by Virginia Tashjian. It's a great little story, just like &quot;Being There.&quot; Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Jerzy Kosinski brilliantly links Chance--the product of television--with the age we so gracefully are entering.

Those who created Chauncey Gardiner, and those who continue to create their presidents and beliefs in objects that appears well on television. It is an interesting novel to read as it was written in the 1970s, and is almost prophetic of what the world has become today.

(In fact, he has never left the estate because all his needs, even meals, were provided for.) When the owner (the \\"old man\\") of the estate dies, the truthful, well groomed, well dressed but illiterate Chance is evicted.Chance knows only about three things: gardening (his passion), watching television, and the environment of the estate where he lived and worked. That's it!!By \\"chance,\\" he becomes involved with a very successful but dying businessman and his wife. The businessman is economic advisor to the US president. Everything that Chance says is misinterpreted as profound and sage wisdom. (Even his name is misinterpreted from Chance, the gardener to \\"Chauncey Gardiner.\\")Chance or Chauncey becomes famous in the span of a few days and he is seen as an \\"educated man\\" who can \\"grasp things quickly\\" and, among other things, soon becomes a presidential political advisor, and a media icon. He also becomes romantically involved (though he doesn't know it) with the businessman's wife.Here's a bit of \\"wisdom\\" that Chance passes on to the president when the president asks him about the bad US economy:\\"In a garden...growth has its season. There are spring and summer, but there are also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again. As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well.\\"The president's unexpected response to this wisdom: \\"I must admit, Mr. Gardiner...that what you've just said is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements I've heard in a very, very long time...Many of us forget that nature and society are one!\\"The very ending of this book has Chance famous. Despite his international fame, there is only one main thing on his mind. The very ending of this book ends with the following:\\"Chance...stepped into the garden. Taut branches laden with fresh shoots, slender stems with tiny sprouting buds shot upward. The garden lay calm, still sunk in repose...Now and then, boughs rustled and gently shook off their drops of water. A breeze fell upon the foliage and nestled under the cover of its moist leaves. Not a thought lifted itself from Chance's brain. Peace filled his chest.\\"Finally, there is a movie called \\"Being There\\" (1979) starring the late Peter Sellers as Chance. (That's Sellers as Chance on the front cover of this book.) This movie's screenplay was written by Kosinski. Even though this movie differs in some respects from the book, it's still a great movie. Sellers gives a stand-out performance, perhaps one of the best in his interesting career.In conclusion, this is a unique novel that presents a different type of story--a story not to be missed!!!(first published 1970; 7 chapters; main narrative 140 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"Being There","review":"In the book Being There, Chauncy Gardiner changes the people's outlooks on politics,economics, and life. Chance is a simple man whose only life had been in the Old Man's house watching Tv or tending to the garden. He had no background knowledge of anything, except for flowers grow, and some things he had seen on TV. This story was very touching. It made me realize that society is optimistic about politics, economy and even their lives, once someone with a new brand of &quot;knowledge&quot; comes along. Chance was a very simple man, who had almost been forced to evolve into someone that the people of New York, wanted and even needed. This story relates to the movie of Forrest Gump. Both simple men, Forrest and Chance affected and changed people's outlooks on their lives, and how they want to be perceived."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"As the film and the novel differ only sligthly, I've decided to post the same review for both.Kosinski's satire isn't limited to the effects of media culture on people and society -- it productively branches off into related areas. The satire is so rich for such a short novel that it becomes difficult to provide a coherent exegesis. But I'll try.There's nothing cryptic about the title's meaning. A man who's \\"experienced\\" life vicariously only through what he's seen on television, suddenly finds himself \\"being there\\", in the \\"real\\" world, which he has essentially no understanding of. He has trouble making the distinction, as we see when he uses a remote control to try to shut off a disagreeable young man.Chance isn't congenitally stupid -- he's been \\"stupi-fied\\" by watching so much TV. This is not accidental. The Old Man who took him in as a child paid no attention to his education. Chance provided labor for nothing more than the cost of feeding and clothing him; his development as a human being was of no importance. (It's noteworthy that Louise, the Old Man's black maid, though claiming to have raised Chance, made no effort to teach him to read and write.) The poke at capitalism is obvious -- even heavy-handed -- but it could apply to any society in which the worth of the indvidual is not of primary importance. *Chance's vapidity is a \\"tabula rasa\\" on which others' values and views are written. But the projection is largely due to the listener's unwillingness to hear what the speaker is actually saying. People hear what they want to hear, and \\"Being There\\" is also an indictment of our failure to \\"be there\\" with those with whom we engage in conversation.Chance's repeated \\"I like to watch\\" has obvious voyeuristic connotations, which were confirmed in a Dick Cavett interview where Jerzy Kosinki revealed that he liked to go to public baths to watch people having sex. Most people found (and still find) this shocking, but I've never understood why \\"voyeurism\\" is considered a disorder (unless it replaces sex). Humans are highly visual animals, and we all \\"like to watch\\" all sorts of things, which is one of the reasons television has taken over so much of our lives.The projection of our inner lives on the outer world of television and movies can block the development of an \\"inner dialog\\" that can help us make sense of our own lives and what is going on around us. (Fundamentalist religion also has this effect.) Chance is lost in the outer world, in part because he has no inner world in which to retreat and figure out things. His is the ultimate \\"candidness\\", in which everything is on the surface. \\"There is no there, there\\", as Gertrude Stein said about Oakland.It is all-too tempting to paint Ronald Reagan as a real-life Chance, and I won't resist the temptation. It is difficult to understand why such a vacuous idiot was elected to the Presidency, but it was partly due to his very shallowness, which allowed even people who disagreed strongly with his policies to find him \\"likeable\\". How can one like a stupid person who has nothing of any value to contribute? It is no surprise that, at the end, the power brokers are thinking that Chance should run for the Presidency.The film was made at Peter Sellers' encouragement, as he viewed the novel as a vehicle for his acting skills. It's a near-perfect performance (unlike, say, Dustin Hoffman in \\"Rain Man\\", where we're constantly aware we're watching an actor pretend to be something he isn't). Although the novel describes Chance as handsome and athletic, the older and somewaht vacant-looking Sellers is a better choice for the film, as removes the possibility people think well of him simply because he's good-looking. The other performances are mostly good, with Maclaine, Dysart, and Douglas standing out. Douglas's Oscar-winning performance, in particular, is a fine example of acting without appearing to act.The ending -- not in the novel -- spins the story in a direction Kosinski did not intend. Is Chance the fool of God? Is he so cut off from the material world that its laws no long apply to him, and he can walk on water -- perhaps because he doesn't understand it isn't possible (as suggested by the tag line on Rand's tomb, \\"Life is a state of mind\\")? Either way, the story's meaning is softened and blunted. Chance is neither hero nor divine.Other than this misstep, Ashby's direction is spot-on, giving the material the weight it needs to be believable. A lighter tone would call too much attention to the satire. The Blu-ray transfer is beautiful, highlighting Caleb Deschanel's rich photography.Thematically, \\"Being There\\" recalls \\"Rear Window\\" (voyeurism) and \\"Network\\" (media corruption of the \\"inner self\\").The film is very good, and the novel great, arguably one of the best of the 20th century.* \\"Individualism\\" and \\"individuality\\" are not the same thing."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"When humans are not \\"talking past\\" one another, they're busy trying to \\"read\\" the other person or figure an entranceway for their own personal agenda. Rather than developing a genuine appreciation of another - requiring time and effort - too many of us are already mentally asking, \\"What can (identity) do for me?\\" In a culture keyed to instant gratification and focus groups, who has time to cultivate a genuine understanding of someone else on this planet?\\"Being There\\" presents us with a human being who enjoys the serenity of knowing who he is and living in the moment. His conversations are factual and honest, his dealings with the self-absorbed are courteous to a fault and his approach to interpersonal relations is camera-like, taking in as much of someone as possible and trying to fathom \\"the complete picture\\". Where politicians try to separate a candidate from his negatives, Chauncey seeks to imbue the famous he meets with as many characteristics as he can discern - not ascribe notions to them, but simply capture the whole of their personality to take their \\"full measure\\". And he attempts to do so despite his limited mental capacity.When Chauncey strolls into the garden at the end of this odyssey, he's at peace. The colors, sights and sounds of the world's natural state surround him, and he is at one with them. It's connectedness, being \\"in the zone\\", and few of his more \\"gifted\\" contemporaries could ever appreciate what he has discovered.This is a thoughtful little book that rolls around in the back of your mind."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"&quot;Being There&quot; is a great book. When I read it, I couldn't put it down. I was curious about the plot, what was going to happen to Chance. The author created the character &quot;Chance&quot; who had no education except knowledge of gardening, but people in the real world thought of him as a resourceful man. It is an interesting story. This book gives me the idea that most people in our society like judging a person by his appearance. Therefore, I should be careful to make any judgments before I know a person very well.

This is story is very well written, but unrealistic. How is it possible that someone who can not read or write and only knows about gardens can be shaped by the American public into a political hero? After a heartwarming story that is very well written and captivating, the author seems to let the reader down quickly at the end by a sudden and almost unconclusive ending."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"As I read the story, I kept thinking about how Chance would react and how people would react to him in the society today. Chance is no the kind of persont hat thinks deeply about life and what it means or has going for him. He is more the kind of person that says what is on his mind very simply at that time. His life is the Garden. He eats, sleeps, and walks the garden. I found it very amazing that just because of who he ended up with, he was a brilliant man, but if he still lived in his house by himself, I don't think that he would be so famous and such a brilliant man. Overall I liked the book very much. Even though it was short, I thought that it said a lot and I liked how I had to kind of interpret the meaning of words myself."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"&quot;BEING THERE&quot;, by Jerzy Kosinski was a great read. I could hardly put it down ( not for long though, it is only 118 pages). Kosinski puts together a well thought, interesting story with a very relevant theme. His main character, &quot;Chance the gardiner&quot; is an excellent example of kosinski's power of creativity and cleverness. In the story, Chance has been locked away all of his life. One day he is suddenly thrust out into the real world. He has no education, only the nowledge of a garden he has spent his whole life growing. The story shows just how far he gets on luck, fate, pure personality, and his knowledge of the garden, which he uses to answer the complex questions people ask him. It will make you wonder, and question our society. A definite must read for anybody."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"I liked the book. I felt the author made his readers understand the way his main character was feeling. This book was a good short story and was a good book to just sit down and read.

I recommend it to pass the time and hope you pick it up some time."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"I found the book to be great. It was funny, catchy, and there was a good story.

I also found it somewhat confusing. The reason for this is because the author would be talking about politics then Chance would relate to his garden. Overall, the book was very enjoyable and I would recommend it to all my friends. I also liked the hopitality the Ran's gave Chance when he lost his house after the old man died. Another thing I enjoyed was how E.E. began to like Chance."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Being There is life reduced to its simplest.

Therefore he was only educated by TV. After his benefactor's death, he is flung into the real world, the world of sex, money and power. After a car-accident he gets the chance to live with EE and her husband Ben Rand who is very ill. As Ben Rand is a famous financier, Chance gets in contact with the President of the USA and with other important persons so that he becomes a famous media superstar himself although he does not really know what he is saying; the people interpret his words like they want. Kosinski has already seen the development of media, especially of TV in our society 30 years ago. Today many things are shown on TV in a way that everybody can find something he is interested in. TV is always a topic to talk or discuss about. But many people, especially children and teenagers are influenced by TV. This goes so far that some people even do spend nearly their whole leisure in front of their TVs'. In our opinion it is not very realistic to become an important, famous member of society without really being educated. As it is exaggerated on purpose, the book is interesting to read because it deals with a very topical problem everybody should be confronted with. For these reasons we recommend \\"Being There\\"."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Governed, in the widest sense. This brilliant satire is right on the money as it portraits the culture we live in: real thought is neglected; superficial perception is all. I won't summarize the plot, for other reviewers have done it well. I will insist in something very sad, but perhaps unevitable: Kosinski's message was enjoyed, but not really listened to. We still elect Chances; we still believe what they say on TV; we still track down their every step (how they went shopping; who they married; what liposuctions they got). The real thinkers are almost abandoned, their work covered by dust in libraries and museums. And the saddest thing, in the book, is that all of it is not Chance's guilt: he just talks about what he knows: the garden and TV, and it is the Confederacy of Dunces that surrounds him who elevate him to a media icon and presidential adviser. The clarity of the message should be growing fastly, since the society portrayed in the book is getting more and more real. I wonder if it is too late to get it: the media society is taking away from us the time to think and reflect, and so find solutions to our problems. The tragedy is that every time a thinker becomes a public figure, and so gets the opportunity to act, the system eats them and transform them into &quot;celebrities&quot;: ...."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"\\"Being there\\" is the story of a man whose primary interest, if not the only one, is a garden.

Satire. Gimmick. Twisted. Believable, but not quite plausible. Pure Kosinski. As always, a rush."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Chance is the sixty-something gardener in an old man's estate. He has never left the grounds of the estate in his entire life, being rather slow. Yet, although he's not the brightest proverbial bulb on the proverbial Christmas tree, Chance is pleasant, polite, and anxious not to offend. When he is thrust out into the world, due to the old man's unexpected demise, these traits serve him well. People like him, automatically. People trust him, instinctively. Through a series of extremely unlikely coincidences, Chance finds himself hobnobbing with the president of the U.S., and giving him advice on economic matters, albeit in singularly vague terms. His advise, however, does always seem to contain a sort of metaphorical wisdom, and before he knows what's happening, pundits are falling all over each other to be the one to interpret his oracular utterances.This book claims to be a modern fable, discussing the power of the media to shape our notions of leadership, etc, but I think it speaks to a deeper issue -- the role of outsiders in general, and how we project our hopes and fears onto them. It's also about a certain kind of fear, by which I mean the fear we all experience of having to admit to ourselves that we strongly suspect that nine times out of ten our elected officials are just full-court-bluffing their way through life, and are every bit as clueless and scared as the rest of us. In this case, due to Chance's refreshingly childish innocence, the Emperor not only has no clothes, but he doesn't even understand that people want to BELIEVE that he does.If anyone's interested in buying a similar sort of story for their children, I'd like to recommend the story &quot;Nazar the Brave,&quot; which is in a collection of Armenian folktales compiled and retold by Virginia Tashjian.

The book's language is simple and easy to understand. But once you read the first page then you don't want to put down the book because you are eager to know the ending of the book. The main character of the book is a middle-aged man mamed Chance-later on called&quot;Chauncey&quot; by other people. He got his name Chance because he was brought into this world by chance. He was a gardener, a really good gardener, all his life. But his philopsophy about gardening inspired a lot of people even the U.S. president. People loved him.

But I cannot help but think that despite the many potential understandings about this work, there is a most important lesson to be learned.How did a simple-minded gardener--\\"dumb as a jackass\\" according to his maid Louise--become Chauncey Gardiner? The heir to a billionaire's fortune. A media guru. An advisor to the president of the United States. A potential presidential candidate himself. Maybe even a prophet. Was there something innately great about Chauncey? Maybe. But probably not. Being there begs the question, \\"Being where?\\"Being there is about three things: location, location--and location! Chauncey Gardiner, upon getting hit by the Rand's car, was in the right place at the right time. But the lesson goes beyond a mere bump on the leg by a billionaire's fender. Chauncey Gardiner's greatness lied not in the man but, rather, in the relationships of people who chose to define him as great.

The author goes to great lengths to show physical similarities between the \\"old man\\" and Chauncey \\"the gardener\\". The old man's discarded clothing fit Chauncey absolutely perfectly as if they were tailored for Chauncey. Chauncey was not listed as an employee. No one knew who Chauncey's father was. There was no records for Chauncey. People of that time period were not known for taking in retarded strangers, the retarded were either institutionalized or otherwise hidden away. Not even the old man's business parter knew about Chauncey. The only possible explaination for these facts would be that Chauncey was the old man's child. Otherwise you would have to credit the old man, a retired lawyer, of having Chauncey working in his house as a gardener for over 40 years, starting when Chauncey was a little boy, as unpaid slave labor. At the end of the book, Chauncey is himself an old man visiting his garden, just like the \\"old man\\" used to do (another parallel drawn by the author).

I am a great fan of Being There and have been so for several decades. I would like to express my opinion about the significance of the last scene in the move where Chance walks on water. I believe this to be a complete surprise ending that opens up an entirely new perspective of the book. If anyone has seen the brilliant and hilarious Monty Python's &quot;Life Of Brian&quot; they can appreciate the concept of people perceiving realitly to suite their own desires. &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, which came out around the same time as the novel/movie &quot;being there&quot;, depicts the Roman empire at the time of Chirst with a demoralized frustrated population of jews desparately seeking a Messiah to end their misery. Brian of Nazareth, a regular innocent joe, is choosen to be the Messiah by a group of people that interprets everything he does as magical and holly. There are several parrallels to &quot;Being There&quot; where Chance, an innocent and dim-witted bystandard, is mistaken by a desperate and corrupt society to be their next &quot;Messiah&quot; and leader.

One might say that Becket doesn't either and that is his genius. But I have the sense that the emptiness which Kosinki finds at the heart of 'Television Civilization's is an emptiness in the heart of Kosinski himself.Unfairly perhaps I think of Tolstoy and that kind of fiction which makes the person love life more, not wonder why one is reading something which makes one wonder if life really is so worthless and so small."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"I think the novel &quot;Being There&quot; describes well a problem of our modern society.

First thing I noticed was that it was only about 130 pages, minus a few blanks between chapters, with not many words per page. From there I was somewhat disappointed at the character development which somehow was better pulled off in the movie. I think Peter Sellers is &quot;to blame&quot; for this because he added so many nuances to the main character through his economy of gestures and complete involvement in the project. I also much preferred the Eve movie character to EE of the book because the screenplay and her acting fleshed out her vulnerability much more. An example of this being her telling Chauncey that she is a &quot;shy person,&quot; before trying to be intimate with him. I was also disappointed to find out that there was no Street Gang episode nor was there Louise's reaction to Chauncey's being on television. These two scenes, aside from the &quot;I like to watch&quot; scene, were some of the funniest in the picture. Last, but certainly not least, was the somewhat mysterious walking on water scene at the end of the movie which ended the picture on such a sublime note where in the book it is just politicians babbling over the next VP, before going back to the nature metaphors.Seems like the author, since he also cowrote the screenplay, did better on his second take with this idea and by combining it with the talents of Shirley Maclane, Melvyn Douglass, Hal Ashby, and Peter Sellers made it into a comedy classic.BTW the only other picture I can say that was better than the book it was based on was &quot;Lost Horizon,&quot; but that movie is in its own category altogether."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Our book discussion group read this book and we all felt that it a pretty good story.

For example his honesty he doesent feel he needs to candy coat anything for anyone because he doesent see the point but on the flip side he doesent see much in anything. The book in my opinion was a refection of our society to a degree...but thats it, most of the charaters I thought were dull and almost like a bunch of zombies trying to find meaning in nothing, but over analyzing everything and sady enough making themselfs sound dumber and dumber with every sentece they speak.

In contrast, the film was the perfect parody of the beginning of the Reagan era, in which appearences and the assumptions of the observers mix in the most surprising ways. Oh well.

After coming to the United States from his native Poland, Kosinski embarked on a writing career spanning nearly three decades. During this period he wrote nine novels and two collections of essays. The awards he collected over these years are too numerous to list here, but he did win an award for turning \\"Being There\\" into a screenplay. In the movie Peter Sellers played the role of Chauncey Gardiner (that's Sellers on the cover of the book, by the way). Jerzy Kosinski died in 1991.If you have seen the film version of this book, you already know what the story is about. Chauncey is a gardener for a wealthy old invalid referred to cryptically as the \\"Old Man.\\" Poor old Chauncey doesn't have much going on upstairs; he cannot read or write, and his days are spent watching television and working in the garden. The Old Man adopted Chauncey when he was a small child, and maintains an iron grip over his life. Chauncey has never seen the outside world, never interacted with people beyond the gates of the house, or left any trace of himself in the outside world. He's a sort of modern day Robinson Crusoe, isolated on his own private island in the middle of our bustling world.When the Old Man finally succumbs to his illnesses, Chauncey is left to his own devices in a world he has only seen on television. After a slight accident that occurs a few minutes after he leaves his cocoon, Chauncey finds himself quickly moving up in the world. He is \\"adopted\\" by Benjamin and EE Rand, a wealthy family. When Chauncey spouts a few vague aphorisms about gardening, the Rands misunderstand him and begin to believe that Chauncey is a brilliant, wealthy industrialist with intelligent insights into the business world. Chauncey's star continues to climb as every person who meets him, from the president to the Soviet ambassador, thinks he's a charming, insightful man. Chauncey appears on television, his quotes begin to pop up in newspapers, and his name is on the lips of everybody who is anybody. The world is going crazy for Chauncey Gardiner, while Chauncey remains blissfully ignorant of his newfound status. A large part of Chauncey's success comes from his good looks and wearing suits he took from the Old Man. If the image makes the man, Chauncey can't help but succeed.The back cover of this edition declares that Kosinski's book is a scathing indictment of the media culture, and there is much to back up that assertion in the book. Chauncey's fascination with television is the only way he can relate to those he meets in the larger world. When meeting people, Chauncey remembers how people act on television, and then he mimics their behavior. Since Chauncey is essentially a blank slate (no one can discover anything about him because he has no background), he resembles one of the images he loves to watch on television. Like a television character, Chauncey has no substance. He lives in the present, with no past and no future. It is up to others to fill in the details of Chauncey's existence, and this is exactly what happens when everyone around him projects their own needs and wants on to Chauncey.A particularly annoying incident in the book concerns a sexual encounter Chauncey has with a partygoer. There is no need for this encounter to take place, and it considerably cheapens the value of the book. Why Kosinski felt this sexual encounter needed to be included is a mystery. Whatever the reason, the addition of this situation dampens the simplicity and innocence of the story.Overall, reading \\"Being There\\" is still a treat. The movie is highly recommended as well. Peter Sellers longed to play Chauncey for years, and does an excellent job with the role. If memory serves correctly, this was Peter Sellers's last film role. If you have already seen the film, be sure and read the book as well."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"A friend recommended Jerzy Kosinski to me, so I thought I'd start with a fairly familiar title, though I have yet to see the movie. &quot;Being There&quot; is quite short, though the story is by no means short on style and quality. Kosinski offers a powerful, unlikely hero in Chance, whose simple philosophies on tending a garden are misinterpreted by people around them as guidance for controlling the national economy. It is amusing to read how all these well-educated, self-important people twist Chance's words to suit their own purposes and beliefs, so much that this simple-minded gardener is, in the course of a few days, one of the most admired men in the nation!I also like Kosinski's take on the media, as presented through Chance's love for television -- he accepts a name change to Chauncey Gardiner (as accidentally heard by EE Rand), thinking that is standard for people on television to do. The scene in particular where Chance is invited on a program to speak is fun to read, as Chance wonders how he will translate physically onscreen. Though this book was written twenty years ago, it still speaks to us today as a good satire on media and American culture, and how we tend to make heroes of people who do not necessarily fit the mold. It would have been interesting to see this work translated today, with the advent of cable television and the Internet."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Chance. the gardner, &quot;knows not whence he came.&quot; His only memories are of his room, his television set, the garden that he tends, the old man who owns the house and garden, and a cook/housekeeper. The sum of all his knowledge comes from what he sees on his television set and what he has learned tending his garden. He doesn't read. He doesn't write. He really doesn't know that there is a world outside of his garden.When the old man dies, Chance is thrown into a world about which he knows nothing. His one advantage coming into that world is that he has the old man's hand-me-down suits which are impeccably tailored and are old enough to have come back into style.By chance, Chance is injured by a chauffeur driven limousine belonging to a very rich and influential man. (Thank goodness for the suit he is wearing! Through no fault of his own, he looks rich and successful.) He gives his name as Chance, the gardner and it is misunderstood as Chauncey Gardiner. His vast experience in things worldly, gained from viewing television, tells him that if someone tells him that is his name then that is his name.Whenever Chance, now Chauncey, enters into a conversation, he speaks of what he knows, the garden. Within a very short time, his replies, such as, &quot;For everything there is a season,&quot; in response to a question about the future economic climate, are taken to be the astute observations of a brilliant man.These meaningless utterances, coupled with his total lack of a background, make him into a media idol and, seemingly, the ideal candidate for Vice President of the United States. After all, if he has no background, there's nothing in it for the opposition to attack, and his garden variety, visionary, comments don't have enough substance to be contradicted.As a commentary on the media culture that existed when Kosinski wrote BEING THERE, and which still exists today, I don't think this book can be beat. Further, as a reflection on the ability of the &quot;unwashed masses&quot; to distinguish between hype and substance, it's rather frightening.The book begins with the ambiguity of Chance's origins and ends in an ambiguous scene that leaves Chance's future open to interpretation. I think that this is the only intellectually honest ending possible for BEING THERE. I recommend BEING THERE for Kosinski's commentary on our media driven society and because of the inferred questions it asks us about ourselves."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"After watching the film several times over the years -- but before reading the book -- I concluded that Being There was a prime candidate for one of the rare instances in which the cinematic version of a story was superior to the literature it was based on. The story is so simple and so much of it is communicated by expressions, gestures, and tone of voice that it seemed unlikely that the written word would be up to the task.Instead, finally reading this thin but ambitious effort showed me again that good writing trumps good cinema almost every time.To be sure, the film is good cinema. And the talented duo of Peter Sellers and Shirley McLean are so convincing in their silver screen roles that it is hard to imagine the characters they portray looking and sounding any different than the way they were played in the film (my effort to disassociate them from the story wasn't helped by the fact that my edition of the book has Mr. Sellers larger than life on its cover).Yet the book takes the story to another level. Chance, the main character, is still a fortunate simpleton, But in the book author Jerzy Kosinski can reveal what is happening in his head, the swirling and disconcerting mystery that even the most obvious events seem to someone like him. These passages add an unexpected depth and darkness to the story, which is without most of the comic relief so prominent in the film.The end result is a book that isn't the wry comedy with precision timing I expected after knowing the film so well but rather a biting and trenchant satire about the culture of modern media, politics, and business, and of the gullible nature of a people far too eager to follow anyone they think may be willing to lead."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"I first became aware of this book as the basis for the remarkable film starring Peter Sellers and Melvyn Douglas. Kosinski&#65533;s book, however, is just as remarkable in its own right.The hero of the book is Chance, a mentally retarded adult who works as the gardener at the home of a wealthy retired New York lawyer. During the whole of his adult life, Chance has never left the house and garden; his only contact with the outside world is through television, which he watches obsessively. His life changes, however, when his employer dies, the house is sold and he is forced to leave. Chance is slightly injured when he is hit by a car belonging to Elizabeth Eve (&#65533;EE&#65533;), the wife of Benjamin Rand, a rich and influential Wall Street financier and a friend of the President. EE, mishearing &#65533;Chance the gardener&#65533; as &#65533;Chauncey Gardiner&#65533; and mistakenly believing Chance to be a successful businessman, invites him to stay with her and her husband at their home. A series of misunderstandings leads all concerned to believe that Chance is not only a businessman but also an economic prophet. He is invited to speak on national television where he talks about the only thing he understands, gardening. A series of platitudes about the changing of the seasons in the garden is taken to be an extended metaphor forecasting an upturn in the economy, and his supposed optimism strikes a chord with the viewing public. The book ends with the elderly, terminally ill, Rand about to name Chance as his heir and successor, and the President about to nominate him as his vice-presidential running-mate.The book is short, a novella rather than a novel, of around 100 pages. The style is direct, simple and like a fable. It has been interpreted as a satire on the role of television in the modern age or on the American political system. Those elements are certainly present and were emphasised more in the film than in the book. (In Britain the film was widely taken to be a direct attack on the Reagan administration, even though it was actually made during the Carter years but not released here until after the presidential election). The significance of the book, however, is a deeper one.In the film, Peter Sellers portrayed Chance as a lonely, pitiable character in late middle age, young only by comparison with his aged employer and the ageing Rand. It is an affecting performance, but subtly different from the Chance of Kosinski&#65533;s book. Kosinski&#65533;s Chance is relatively young, good-looking and emotionally detached from his surroundings. This detachment allows others to treat him as what in German would be called a Wunschbild, that is to say a picture of one&#65533;s wishes, a blank canvas onto which one can paint one&#65533;s own desires. Each of the other characters sees in the supposed Chauncey Gardiner whatever he or she wishes to see. Rand, who has no children with EE and who is estranged from the children of his first marriage, sees him as a potential successor to his business empire and almost as an adopted son. EE, sexually frustrated in a marriage to a much older man, sees him as a lover and a possible second husband after Rand&#65533;s death. The President sees him as the ideal candidate for Vice-President, a position he has been struggling to fill. The Soviet Ambassador to the UN sees him as a liberal, Russophile capitalist who will use his influence to further east-west relations. The American TV audience see him as the man who will lead them out of recession and into prosperity.The book certainly is, in part, a commentary on the television age. It certainly is, in part, a political satire. (We can all think of politicians who have the ability to be all things to all men). Most importantly, however, it is a brilliant fable on the human capacity for self-delusion and for seeing others not for what they are but for what we would wish them to be."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Chance, the mentally handicapped hero of this story, has spent all his life working in the garden. Having never been on the other side of the wall surrounding the house he is living in, he has learned everything he knows about the world and its people from TV. Suddenly launched into the real world, dominated by money and power, Chance accidentally becomes a media superstar. Due to his metaphorical speeches about nature, wrongly interpreted as political statements by everybody, he becomes very popular. His road to success leads him straight to the top. Will Chance's emergence find its end in being the next President of the United States of America?&#8220;Being There&#8220; is a well written satire criticizing American society and the media in particular. Although this novel is fiction, Kosinski included some personal experience he gained. &#8220;Being There&#8220; partly is an imaginative projection of his life. Connecting both, satirical and thrilling elements, Kosinski created a story which is worth to be read. The image of modern society mirrored by this novel will still survive in your mind when putting the book down."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"&quot;Being There&quot; is a cute little book, a modern day fable. Chance (later christened &quot;Chauncey Gardiner&quot;, a misunderstood form of &quot;Chance, the gardener&quot;) has lived for forty-some years in an abbreviated world. There, he tended the garden of the Old Man, ate his food, and watched television. When the Old Man dies at the beginning, Chance is thrust into the world outside with no tangible proof of his existence: no birth certificate, tax statements, library cards, etc.Dressed in the Old Man's elegant suits, Chance becomes drawn into the 1960's world of WASP-y social privilege: businessmen, journalists, the President. His simple statements about his garden or the seasons are understood as eloquent, moving metaphors for The Economy or Statesmanship. Repeated in the mouths of politicians and reporters, Chance's words take on a wholly different sort of meaning from that which he originally intended. Thus, the book's premise: that a man can be thrust into the spotlight by the compellingness of his image.Chance is a mirror, as it were, in which others see only those meanings which they give to him. Moreover, he is a sympathetic figure, explicitly described as within himself, confident, and so a touching hero in today's multimedia age. With all the talk of cameras, looking and penetration, Kosinski's novel could probably delight a film theorist (television is the medium through which Chance learned of the world, and through which he filters his experiences when in the world). For the rest of us, this two-hour read is clever, amusing, and doesn't overstay its welcome."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"\\"Being There\\" is a novel about the capricious issue of existence and identity in the television age, yet it is told in the manner of a child's fable, with simple, often beautiful prose and a narrative as processed through the consciousness of a simpleton.That simpleton, Chance the Gardener, a.k.a. Chauncey Gardiner, is cast out of the garden he has tended which has been all he has ever known of the world, left to fend for himself in uncaring Manhattan. A fortuitous accident leaves him in the care of a dying plutocrat and his young, sexually frustrated wife, for both of whom Chance is the perfect tabula rasa upon which to affix their aspirations and sensibilities. How soon before they guess at Chance's true nature, and kick him out of their world? Or will he somehow avoid detection, with his storehouse of borrowed phrases and techniques he has learned from television?Jerzy Kosinski can't tell a joke to save his life, but he writes with beautiful clarity.\\"And yet, with all its life, even at the peak of its bloom, the garden was its own graveyard,\\" goes one early passage of Chance tending his garden. \\"Under every tree and bush lay rotten trunks and disintegrated and decomposing roots. It was hard to know which was more important: the garden's surface or the graveyard from which it grew and into which it was constantly lapsing.\\"If \\"Being There\\" the novel suffers from one thing, it's \\"Being There\\" the movie. There, Chance is played by the sublime Peter Sellers, who finds every glimmer of humor in Chance's character, adds some more, and yet carries Kosinski's character to metaphoric heights the author himself didn't envision. There's also the fact that the film plays more assuredly with the video medium that is a central theme in both stories, throwing up bits of real commercials and children's TV to play up against the plot shifts.What the book has going for it is its use of fable-like elements that don't translate so well onto film. The Russian ambassador tells Chance that he has \\"that certain Krylovian touch,\\" referring to a popular Russian fable-writer, and its true enough. Near the end of the book, we are told by a White House observer that the sequence of events that have brought Chance to global attention span fill just four days, which is clearly not in the realm of reality as we know it, especially given the soporific pace of events in the book.There's an edge to this fable: The Russian ambassador goes on to send Chance a copy of Krylov's fables in the original Russian, which we discover has been taken from a recently arrested Jewish dissident. But characters who present a voice of skepticism in the film, like Louise the cook and Dr. Allenby, are absent here. So too, alas, is the film's finest single moment, its enigmatic ending which actually underlines the fairy-tale quality of this story.Chance does have some self-knowledge in the book, just enough to wonder who he is and whether he will become two people when he appears on television, the Chance on TV and the Chance who watches. Within its simple constructs, Kosinski asks some deep questions and presents us with food for thought. Plus he doesn't take very many pages to do it. Fables work better when told fast. \\"Being There\\" is an adult fable told very well."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"A brilliant and terse novel about the precarious nature of power and influence, and about the folly of mass communication in a plastic culture. The main character is named &quot;Chance,&quot; and that says it all: He's a semiretarded gardener who is fortunately graced with terrific grooming habits, a good set of fine clothes, and a careful pattern of speech. He ends up--totally obliviously--as an advisor to the President of the United States and possibly the next candidate! This book is not only intelligent--it's funny. If only it weren't so darn plausible.The movie made from this book (also called &quot;Being There&quot;) is as good as the book! It stars Peter Sellers, who is phenomenal.FYI Jerzy Kosinski, the author, also wrote &quot;The Painted Bird,&quot; a haunting and violent chronicle of the author's own experience as an accidentally abandoned child during World War Two. It is also noteworthy for its fatalistic emphasis on chance and randomness, on the ultimate meaninglessness and precariousness of personal attachments and identity."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"As most folks probably recall, 'Being There' was a Peter Sellers film some twenty years ago with the memorable line \\"I like to watch\\". The film was well done, both funny and sad in equal measures. Most folks probably don't realize the film was based on book by the late Jerzy Kosinski, written some ten years earlier. I decided to see how the book compares with the film. I'm delighted to say it fairs very well indeed.'Being There' is a short novel about an illiterate, dim-witted man who had done literally nothing in life but garden. During his life he has engaged in limited social intercourse, and none of the other sort of intercourse. But his life completely changes when his guardian dies. Thrust into the world, the rich and beautiful people he meet view him as deep thinker ... interpreting his gardening statements as profound metaphores. He becomes an overnight sensation.Taken as a story by itself 'Being There' is just ordinary. The prose is adequate as are the characterizations. But 'Being There' is a scathing satire on how the most undeserving become stars in America. Clearly one can become a celeb without an ounce of intelligence or talent.Bottom line: if you enjoyed the film you'll really enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"What an awful, horrific, hateful book. Kosinski must have had a bad year or ten in high society. Nobody is ok in this book. In Kosinski's bleak, black satire it blasts away at who we we are, our thinking selves (avatars is what I actually want to say) which in truth hide self-knowledge or awareness of the extreme self-involvement and the resulting recursive solipsism of every single human being, in the author's opinion. I don't think some readers have caught on that Chance is a symbol of the inner self, not a reflection, but the embodiment of what is dreadfully wrong with every character in the book except for The Old Man, who has the good sense to keep Chance as far away from him as he can. Chance isn't a real person. He is a monster. He's of the same type of creatures Dickens used in his book, A Christmas Carol, about Scrooge being visited by ghosts, in which one of the ghosts had attached to him creature children he called Want and Ignorance. Chance is a creature child attached to society and power in this monstrous fable. Chance is a miserable and devastating aspect of ourselves that causes such awful self-delusion and poverty of thought. The resulting harm of mistaking empty authenticity for reality and substance is terrifying. The book was written in 1971, but of course, it appears to reveal our current environment of politics and TV news scarily, exactly, resoundingly perfectly. Yikes. I cannot clear my brain now of how much this book seems to be happening right now. It feels like we are in a time where the spirit of Chance is holding on to the legs of our current politicians and Big Business CEOs. The garden reference is important and turned on it's head as is everything in this book. Not the garden of Eden and the Tree of Knowledge and innocent goodness, but the Garden of Hell and the Tree of Ignorance."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Chance, an idiot savant finds himself in situations where, by association with an extraordinarily rich and socially connected couple, his simple words are treated as metaphors for society's problems. He is quoted extensively all the while maintaining that he doesn't read, and constantly watches television. His sound bites infiltrate the highest echelons of government, and society, and unfortunately, the possibility of something like this happening seems all too likely."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Kosinski must have had a crystal ball, because it is all to apparent this story could easily be applied today. Given this political year, I have to recommend this book to anyone who watches the talking heads on television. The main character, Chance, is the epitome of every \\"expert\\" on t.v.. We swallow the bitter pill of platitudes and opinions everyday on cable t.v. news and the aftertaste is blissfully sweet. Amazingly, we ask ourselves 100 days into the next presidency and say what happened - where's the beef? Well, I'll tell you what happened, we heard what we wanted to hear and so we bought into it. This book tells this story well. This satire will never go out of date - it is to the point, despite the one odd aside of a meaningless sex act, and it should be put on a mandatory reading list for political science majors."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Loved the movie so thought I would read the book. The book is different in several respects of course. Chance thinks in the book in ways that can be only hypothesized in the movie. He knows how to use the phone and elevator. He knows to say he does not drink. Also note that the sexual observations are much more descriptive - perhaps necessarily so in the book. But in each of these cases I feel the description takes away some of the effect of the movie. All in all, while the plot remains the same the movie seems to me to be the better of the two. The book is a good read none the less. It is light and a good bed book.

Chance Gardiner claims to have been tending the garden (\\"Gardiner,\\" get it?) since he was a little boy, yet there are no records of his employment. Chance has no contract, no pay stubs, no ID. He has no mother, no father, no family. His name is Chance \\"because he had been born by chance.\\" He has no existence outside the garden and no knowledge of the outside world that doesn't come from his television. He's adopted and introduced into high society by a rich woman who runs over him with her car. Chance proceeds to impress the members of the loftiest sociopolitical strata who see him as a genius and an expert on pretty much everything despite his oft-professed desire to simply watch TV. His cheery optimism and ability to talk a lot without actually saying anything (Conservative friends, insert your Obama jokes here) propel Chance into the upper echelons of money and politics, an empty and empty-headed symbol of power (Liberal friends, insert your George Dubya jokes here). Suggesting that our politicians are vacant vessels and that our celebrity-obsessed culture feeds off vapidity is hardly revelatory, but that doesn't make Jerzy Kosinski's sharp little novel any less pointed or accurate. In fact, DC life went on to imitate art. Thirty-odd years after \\"Being There\\" was published, Dubya unwittingly echoed Chance's innocent declaration of ignorance: \\"I don't read newspapers.\\" A fawning media usher Chance into prominence in much the same way that Barack Obama took office almost 40 years later.

As politicians and pundits continue to grow ever more cartoonishly ridiculous, is there anything left to satirize?"},{"Title":"Being There","review":"At only 140 pages, this was a very quick read but fun.Chance was sheltered from the outside world his entire life. He never left the house of his employer except to tend the garden in the backyard. He cannot read or write and spends his off time watching TV. When his employer dies he is left homeless and thrust into the outside world. After an accident and a few gardening metaphors he is thrust into America's financial and political society.I found this book incredibly humorous. I loved the irony of the entire situation. How someone who knows nothing and says very little can rise to fame all because of assumptions and media perception.Kosinski's writing is simple and to the point which made it very easy to read. The subject matter is relevant probably more today than it was when it was written in 1970. I think it's nearly impossible to read this book and not insert a politician from your life. It makes you think about politics and media.Being There would be a great book for a book club. So many discussions could come out of this book.[...]"},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Chance was one of those people who has pride in the garden. In our day we also take pride in things we do.

It's still a very funny book, and it works well as a parable about innocence, stupidity, and how we choose our heroes.Viewers of the movie miss the dramatic irony in the first-person narrative of the book. This makes things much funnier, and the satire that much more trenchant."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"This is a modern novel about a stupid man being a gardener all his life and so never gone out of the house of the man, where he has lived all his life.Going out of the house for the first time, he was flung into the &quot;real world&quot;. After being injured by the limousine of E.E., he gets his first new friends - E.E. and his husband Mr. Rand. And then his career begins.Meeting the president, TV-shows and interviews will be normal in his daylife.This is an amousing novel full of sex, money and power. It is based on the two main elements garden and TV. The hero of this story - Chance - is very child-like and does not know how to react in the &quot;new real world&quot;.If you read the first chapters, they seems to be very boring.But if you go on reading, it becomes more and more interesting and funny.But this you all have to find out alone!!!Sometimes the novel is difficult to understand, but you will understand it, if you go on reading. Chance, the hero, speaks in a very childish way, what makes the story very amousing. He influence you by his way of speaking. You will get an other oppinion to your life, after you have read the novel!"},{"Title":"Being There","review":"This summer, I spent a lot of time in a van traveling, and I had a lot of time to read. This particular day, I chose to read Being There, which only took around forty-five minutes to read. I then spent a good three hours just processing what the book was saying. I was totally amazed with how the narrator put such complex human problems in to the simplist of terms. I would highly recommend this book to anybody that likes good books."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"Being There is a novel with many different themes. Although I enjoyed the novel, I thought it was very unrealistic. For one thing, the main Character, Chance has never been out to society to see anybody including a dentist or a doctor. It's amazing that a friend of the old man, the man who made Chance a prisoner to tend for his garden would not have led the police or an authority figure to report he was making Chance a slave. Chance also has no idea about who his parents are.Mr.Rand, the old man who Chance stays with after he leaves the old man 's house wants his wife to be in love with Chance. Although he knows that he is going to die, why would he want his wife to be in love with another man?The main problem with Being There is that the main character, Chance is very unrealisic. The book never explains why Chance never had a family or why nobody came to his rescue before. There are too many unanswered questions and the plot is very undeveloped. Although I liked the book to a certain extent, I find the movie a little more realistic than the book."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"This book I thought was a little out my league. It seemed to go very slow. The book just wasn't that intresting to me because of what the books events were. I just didn't like it very much."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"The novella Being there\\" is about the gardener Chance who lives completely isolated at the Old Man's house until he dies. Only educated through TV he has to manage his life on his own and is involved into a car accident and meets EE and Ben Rand, a successful chairman of the Board of the First American Financial Co. They help him to climb up the ladder of success until he is a popular man brought up by media.The novella is unreal and the story seems to be far fetched. But if you rate the novella with regard to what Kosinski's intention was the book becomes better and better. That media is controlling our lives and that this controlling is increasing, that's the main point of Kosinski. It's of course extremly exaggerated but it is a vision of what media might be like in a couple of years or is already today. The story itself could be a bit more detailed and comprehensive because the story moves on too rapidly which makes it more unreal. It seems that the story itself is full of symbols, metaphors, etc. but that's not important to him. He only cares about his message or his warning which he wants to give to the reader. The story is just the medium to explain and to underline it. I think it is worth reading the novella."},{"Title":"Being There","review":"The book it's Awesome, Chance is the Forrest Gump of the 70', he is a hero but he doesnt know That."},{"Title":"Cop And The Cradle (Switched At Birth) (Harlequin Special Edition)","review":"This book, along with the rest in the Switched at Birth series, was so good I couldn't put it down. Just when you think you have figured out the &quot;mystery&quot; surrounding the sets of twins in these books, some new twist pops up. Warning, though. Don't try to read them out of order, or you will probably miss a lot of important details (however, the authors do a good job of summarizing the past stories in each book). I usually have found in a series written by more than one author that there is a lot of discrepancy in the story line--not the case here. The author's did a wonderful job sticking together on their stories.

Everything I have read of his has been extraordinarily beautifully written. There are pages I have to reread just for the joy of the wording, the descriptions, the expressions of thoughts.As a teacher he must have been a treasure. It is an indictment of the school system in which he worked that he was not fostered and encouraged. America's children are the losers in the situation. I know the people of \\"Yamacraw\\" felt the loss when he was not allowed to return to the school there.America's readers have reaped the benefits of Conroy's education and experience and his exemplary use of the language.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read!

There can be some dull moments, but that is only because you are comparing it to the rest of this highly eventful story."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"My first novel by Pat Conroy. I was really intrigued by this piece of work and I'm not sure exactly why. I guess in thinking back that perhaps that it was simply a well-written novel. Conroy has a fine way with words and a real feel for the plight of people. As a teacher, I had a tough time visualizing the situation on the island, but I had no trouble understanding the politics. I enjoyed this book, talked it up and now I am moving on to PRINCE OF TIDES."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I read this in high school and it was the first novel that made me understand the necessity of all the vocabulary tests I'd endured. Conroy's use of language is unparalleled in our time. His stories are intricate and enticing and his words bring them to life. Someday I'd like to thank him for teaching me how to enjoy reading!"},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"The Water is Wide, by Pat Conroy was one of exciting books I have read in years and based on a true story. The book is based on Pat Conroy life and what events he went through. Pat Conroy goes to a remote island called Yamacraw to teach students who have no idea of the world outside of Yamacraw island and Pat is the person who will change those students life by telling them what he knows about the life outside of island and will the students whole perspective about what the know and a lot of things they didn't know.The book is very appealing to me because it tells me that every is like here every places is advanced in technology which makes life easier and that we should not take it for granted. \\"The tiny bellicose Irishman residing in my genes and collective unconscious urging me on and whispering to me that a great injustice was being perpetrated and that it was up to me to expose this condition to the person with the ability and training to do something about it\\". The theme of this book is to never give up no matter how hard things get and always strive for the better. I agree with the theme because not giving up is the best solution to the problem at hand. It relates to my life in a big way because when lived in country I was poor and I had always had to work hard for the things I had to get and not giving up or not quitting was my motive because if give up on anything it means you are a failure. Yes I would recommend this book to others because it has a great message and you care it through you life."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Pat Conroy never disappoints"},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"It's short and easy, but it's just an okay read. I like books about inspirational teachers, but Pat Conroy spends a little too much time patting himself on the back while criticizing everyone else involved."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This book was recommended by a neighbor as new residents to Coastal Georgia. As a former teacher, I was amazed at the tale told in this story. It is heart wrenching with details of the life that was during this time. Mr. Conroy's writing style, humor, and perspective makes for a book that is hard to put down. It is a story of following what you know is the right thing to do no matter the adversity you are up against."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"What an eye opener of how life was being lived on a remote island off South Carolina back in 1969, the year the author went to teach there.It's hard to imagine that the kids he was teaching didn't even know they were part of the USA or who the president was at the time.By getting so involved in their lives, searching for and discovering whatever means he could to accommodate their learning abilities, taking them on field trips and showing them things like Washington DC, for example, this man provided a great service to these people, even though the school district didn't appreciate all his efforts and didn't let him teach the second year. It makes me realize how we take so many things for granted, like the opportunity to go to school.Read this book!"},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Pat Conroy is usually one of my favorites but even though the writing was good the story left something to be desired."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This novel is especially appropriate for teachers, educators, and students who aspire to make a difference in the world through teaching. This book revolves around themes of social change, specifically the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement where attitudes of the heart lagged behind newly instituted laws. This book is about a young, idealistic, teacher who comes of age in a harsh, prejudiced environment. He fights for justice and change in a culture that does not want to change, that fears change.The tiny, lush island of Yamacraw lies twenty miles off the coast of South Carolina. Populated by black people who depend on the sea and their farms for their livelihoods, the island has practically been forgotten by the mainland. The white powers that govern the island neglect the needs of the Yamacraw people and thus perpetuate the poverty, drunkenness, illiteracy, and hopelessness that consume the islanders. It is this environment and situation in which Pat Conroy enters in 1969. He becomes appalled at the lack of education the children have received from the inefficient and uncaring educational system. He exposes his lovable class to the world they are cut off from and thus becomes the bridge that brings ideas to their young minds-- minds that have no idea what state or country they live in. Everyday, Conroy crosses the treacherous waters between the island and the mainland to bring his kids hope and the education they rightfully deserve. However, it is not nature he must overcome to educate these kids, but the monstrous forces of prejudice, inefficient educational bureaucracy, and institutional racism.This is the kind of novel that gets you fired up about the ills and wrongs of society and makes you want to change the world. It is definitely a must read for aspiring educators and teachers. I loved this book. Conroy tells his story poignantly and insightfully. Plus, the children are a hoot"},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"\\"The Water Is Wide\\" was a very interesting book and I enjoyed reading it mainly because I knew it was based on the life story of the author. The book is about a man named Pat Conroy who moves to a small island in South Carolina named Yamacraw. The reason Pat decides to move is because he decides to teach the students of the island. As Pat starts working he realizes that the students have been given the worst education ever. Most of them don't know how to write, read or even count to atleast 10. The children don't know anything about the modern world and do not even know the name of the country they live in.As weeks turn into months and so on, Pat learns many things from these children and tries teaching them different things about the world around them. He decides that using the text-books is a waste of time due to the fact the students can't read. After taking them to several trips and getting married to a woman named Barbara Jones, he get's into arguments with the board of education. These problems cause many things to change and throughout the book Pat Conroy explains every detail of his life very well.This book not only tells us how wrong the island is treated and how ignorant some people may be but it also teaches us to value many things in life. Segregation is no longer an issue but for many years played an important role in life to where the people became ashamed and fought for many resons. Pat Conroy proves himself to be a very honest, loving man towrd people. The love that he develops for his students and the thing he teaches them is just beyond anything I would have ever imagined, specially during that time in life. This book is great and opens the mind of any children who may want to become teachers one day."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I could feel the firey spirit that kept &quot;Conrack&quot; going. I wanted to stand and cheer and applaud his efforts to improve the lives of his students. The story is a great tribute to what great teachers can do. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This book by Pat Conroy is a must for every teacher you know. It will help remind them why they entered the profession plus it's just a darned good read."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I knew this would be the perfect book to read this summer. I first caught a glimpse of \\"Conrack\\" playing one morning on AMC, then I found this book on the shelves by some kind of kismet. As I perused the pages, I was immediately drawn into the humid, lush island environment that Conroy deftly describes. There's a paragraph in the beginning of the book that I read over and over, it was such a wonderfully and lovingly written homage to the beauty and wonder of this magical place. The rest of the book was equally great, and was a wonderful learning experience for me. It taught me many things, but most of all it taught me how great storytellers tell great stories. The lessons that the writer and the reader learn together in the telling of the tale are fairly self evident, and don't need to be retold here. It is a brave book, told by a courageous and extraordinary writer and man. I didn't take a vacation this summer, but I read The Water is Wide. And it was one of the finest trips I've ever taken."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Published in the 1970's, &quot;The Water Is Wide&quot; was the first of author Pat Conroy's novels to be adapted for the big screeen, that project being &quot;Conrack,&quot; starring Jon Voight. Conroy's uproaringly hilarious and, at the same time, heartbreakingly honest and moving story-telling should be read first to catch the spirit that the film doesn't totally harness. Conroy spent a year on the improverished, virtually isolated and forgotten Yamacraw Island off the South Carolina coast as teacher to an economically and socially devastated group of children, most African-Americans, that the outside world seems to have cast off and neglected until Conroy reaches shore. Little does he know on arrival just how desperate his pupils lack even the basics of life, and he gets a clue when his children, unable to pronounce their teacher's name, instead come up with &quot;Conrack.&quot; But through an ingenuity as an educator and an even greater gift to tap into the souls of his destitute pupils, Conrack manages to lift the veil of ignorance and instill in his wards a thirst for knowledge. In powerfully moving story-telling fashion that will invoke both laughter and tears, Conroy teaches us just how much one person can make a difference in a life of another who has been left behind. And at the same time, Conroy manages to instill in his readers a sense of compassion for the status quo that most of us are blessed enough not to endure. Well worth a read once and again, &quot;The Water Is Wide&quot; masterfully bridges the gap between classes and races and implores each of us to exericse our humanity for the good of the lesser of our children."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"In The Water is Wide, by Pat Conroy, he does a great job of writing about his experiences on an island called Yamacraw where he is faced with difficult challenges. He shows us how he developed a bond with these childreb abd taught them things they may have never known before. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because he made you feel as if you were him and that you were one of the students watching from afar. This book also made me laugh right out loud sometimes, like when the kids would tell him he was crazy or he would try and trick them when he was teaching them something. This book also made me know why I wanted to be a teacher so badly, so I could make a diffrence in kids'lives just like he did."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I like Pat Conroy's books. He has a unique way of writing that reaches a wide array of people: white collar and blue collar, scholars and the average Joe, men and women. He doesn't flash his intelligence around like some authors, but his brilliance is understated. If you haven't read any of his books yet, do."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I read this book over a year ago, and I still think of it as one of the best books I have ever read. I admit I am not a \\"well read\\" individual, but I read a book or two a month and this one continues to stand out. I agree with other reviews that it is a must read for teachers. I personally found the book so appealing because it left me laughing, then crying, then angry, then sad. It pulled and tugged at all of my emotions and made me see that I have given up too easily on some things I have wanted changed in my own life. Pat Conroy had to be creative and innovative to get through to the children as well as their parents. I believe he learned as much from the kids as they did from him. I was inspired by his story."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I read a news article about Pat Conroy and his book, The Water is Wide. I was instantly intrigued. I bought the book, read it and could not put it down. Since the book is written about his exploits as a teacher to \\"colored children\\" in a southern atmosphere and dealing with attitudes of a more southern nature, I'm surprised that he got as much accomplished as he did in his 1-year term as a teacher. All of the characters portrayed were painfully believable. This book tells it like it was during the 60's. I would definitely recommend the book for everyone who has an open mind, a sense of humor and is not afraid to delve into life's realities."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This is an example of a developing writer. If you've read some of his latter works, you can see how he has perfected his craft.

Keeps your interest, hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This book is superb from cover to cover. Conroy's story, based in large part on his own experiences, is fascinating from the first page. His use of his powerful storytelling abilities is evident throughout and his vivid description of the plight of the children and others on the island is compelling. His thoughts regarding the futility of the education system he had to work with ring true, but are heartbreaking nonetheless. Read this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Pat Conroy wrote this story about his year of teaching in a school for poor black kids on an island off South Carolina in 1969. A young man on fire to teach not just the basics, but to give kids a broader view of the world, runs into a culture of ignorance and neglect, and not just with the blacks, but the whites as well. The administration is woefully neglectful, since they do not really care what happens to the poor black children in their so-called school. The only other teacher in the school is a black woman who believes children need beatings and shame to learn and practices both on what seems to be a daily basis. Why she thinks that is beyond me. Surely she can see that the kids she sends on to Conroy after her years of \\"teaching\\" have advanced only in hating her and learning to beat on each other. Some cannot read or write at all, and those who can are nowhere near their grade level. I applaud Conroy's efforts to raise awareness of the world beyond the island by taking them on trips and exposing them to other forms of enrichment, but the time might have been better spent in teaching the basics of reading and writing. Perhaps one or two moved beyond the limitations of their environment, but without the basic skills of reading, writing, and math to build on, it would be extremely difficult. Conroy might have made a huge difference in the lives of many of the children had he been able to stay on for several years, but in his anger and frustration at the less than worthless administration, he butted heads and lost the battle and if he made any dent at all in the lives of those children, it had to have been minimal.Eunice Boeve author of Echoes of Kansas Past"},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I've recently discovered the coast of South Carolina and recognized the towns mentioned in the book...loved the details of the area and the story line was very informative....the harshness at times was difficult but realize the actual reality must have been appalling to say the least...thank you Pat for shedding light on this subject."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Only a bit self-congratulatory, (well, maybe a tad more than a bit), the novel gives a good, and most-likely accurate view of race relations in the south just at the start of the Civil Rights movement in America.

We were told the Gullahs thought the book put them down and they did not want the book available on the island. ..... Interesting."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"The Water Is Wide is a terrific book, but I'm confused by the many comments that praise it as a &quot;novel.&quot; This wasn't written as a novel. Pat Conroy lived the story, and this is the story of his experiences as a teacher on a sea island off South Carolina. He changed some names (of both people and sites) in the book, but fiction this ain't. The book does, however, draw on his wonderful talents, just as his novels do."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This is an amazing memoir about the struggles of a middle class white teacher trying to change the world through his teaching. Little does he realize how neglected these children are. Instead of trying to play catch up for seven grades worth of neglect, Conroy tries to equip them with enough knowledge of the world around them, their own sense of worth, and enough education to get by. While this may sound somewhat defeatist, Conroy understood exactly how much he was up against and tried to make the best of it. Forty years after the publication of this memoir and things are getting better, but there are still areas of the country where the quality of education is greatly in need of reform.I think anyone who is a teacher or thinking about becoming a teacher needs to read this and be aware of the history of disparity they may face. Conroy made mistakes on the way by not respecting or understanding the significance of the island's cultural beliefs and he held his own forms of 1970's prejudice, but you can also see a willingness to change, adapt, and grow from his experiences.This is possibly one of the most useful and powerful memoirs I've read recently.The reviewer is the author of the blog A Librarian's Life in Books."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"First of all, I need to say that Pat Conroy is my favorite author. His writing is so full of wit, honesty, intellligence and a genuine love of the English language.The Water is Wide is based on the year that Mr. Conroy spent teaching isolated, impoverished African-American children on an island off of South Carolina. He brings these wonderful children to life with his marvelous gift for storytelling. The children felt very real to me and I think Mr. Conroy did a terrific job with their dialogue. It's fascinating to see how much he and the children learn from each other through the course of the year. Working in a school office myself, I found Mr. Conroy's struggles and frustrations with the administration to be very interesting. He sincerely wanted what was best for the children and wanted them to learn as much as they could about the world around them, but the administration blocked him at every turn. I found myself cheering for every small victory he achieved and booing for the times those victories were taken away from him.I highly recommend The Water is Wide and any other books by Pat Conroy. He truly is a master storyteller."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Following his acclaimed \\"The Great Santini\\" and \\"The Prince Of Tides\\" we have come to expect not only radiant prose but honesty and intriguing story telling from Pat Conroy. There is no disappointment whatsoever in his THE WATER IS WIDE, a memoir of the time he spent on a small South Carolina island attempting to teach the poorest of the poor who could neither read nor write. Making the task even more difficult was the fact that they spoke what is called Gullah, a type of Creole developed by the African American people living there.On Yamacraw (a fictional name for the island where Conroy stayed) the living is credibly stark, tantamount perhaps to a third world country. The children have nothing - of course, no television, radio or anything. One might think of them as growing up in a cultural void. Yet they're hungry to learn, even almost hypnotized by Beethoven's Fifth symphony.Upon arriving on the island Conroy is met by the school teacher, Mrs. Brown, a martinet if there ever was one. Her teaching methods consist primarily of striking the children or delivering verbal insults. Obviously, her methods have not been successful, so Conroy tries a much different, more relaxed approach - chairs in a circle, walks together. Eventually, his methods win over not only the children but the island's residents as well. However, Mrs. Brown and school officials remains opposed to him.Although in truth the island is much changed today THE WATER IS WIDE remains a heartwarming true story of what patience and understanding can accomplish. It is a poignant yet joyful look at our past.Highly recommended.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"The Water Is Wide: A MemoirIn the book, Pat Conroy writes an honest, candid account of his year as a teacher at Yamacraw, based on Daufuskie Island, off the South Carolina coast.Pat's early teaching position prepared him for yet another milestone in his courageous writing. From day one, at Yamacraw's school, Conroy seeks to reconcile years of disregard for every child's right: the right to a proper education. Conroy shares his shock, hopes and dreams for the children who are neglected and uneducated, which is sad, yet inspirational.As with Conroy's, Prince of Tides, I was drawn immediately into the unique story. I was appalled at the lack of education on the island and even more so, at the men in control who bent to no man to assist Conroy in his efforts to alter the offensive school system. It would take more than Pat Conroy's unconventional teaching methods to deliver the tools required for the system to meet their children's needs.The children on Yamacraw were part of our future; the island's school system investment let them down."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"We enjoyed this book, gave us an insight as to how poor and neglected our neighbours are right here in our own country.Plus it was well written and kept your interest.A quick and informative read, yes, we recommend it."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This book is about a passion very few teachers possess. I am a former special education teacher and a huge fan of Pat Conroy. I saw the first movie version of this book starring Jon Voight when I was in highschool. Since Conroy writes a book about every decade, (not often enough!), and I've read them all, I decided to go back and read this one. Regardless of the content, Pat Conroy always paints a spectacular picture with words. This book is no exception. As a former teacher, much of my time was spent trying/failing/creating new methods to reach my kids who possessed a wide range of learning styles. This is great reading for anyone but especially teachers. Educators will chuckle in agreement that there is at least one \\"Mrs. Brown\\" in every school, chain of command is gospel and quite likely a \\"Dr. Piedmont\\" resides at the top."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I was a big fan of Conroy's PRINCE OF TIDES and picked up a paperback of this novel to keep me company on a recent cross-country flight. I was engrossed from page one and didn't want it to end. He writes with such wit and sensitivity, without ever losing focus and keeping the reader cunningly entertained and simultaneously enlightened. He has such a gift and we're lucky he shares it in this wonderful memoir of his early teaching experience. All educators and parents should give this book a read. It's also an important time capsule and has many contemporary lessons in tolernace and equality. Thoroughly captivating."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This book was selected for my book club, and I was indifferent about the subject matter, but Pat Conroy's writing, his unique voice, enthusiasm and humor quickly drew me in. His memoir is an unabashed testimony of the socioeconomic status of an isolated black community on an island off the coast of South Carolina during the tumultuous year of 1969. When he accepts a teaching job on the island, Conroy is confronted with the inadequacies of a system that does not regard the education of black children as a priority. In a south that is warily transitioning to integration, racism remains prevalent. Conroy deviates from the role of disciplinarian and textbook driven curriculum to transform illiterate children into students who care about education and bettering their lives. He is truly inspiring as he encourages the children to become fervent about learning.At times I was confused by the bureaucracy of the administration and frustrated by the chain of command, but Conroy defiantly challenges the status quo when defending his methods and his students. The students themselves are a riot and Conroy conveys their ignorance to expose an innocence that is uncorrupted and malleable. The dialogue is humorous and Conroy effectively delivers the local color in his portrayal of the island and its inhabitants. I was so enamored with the story that it left me wanting more. I would have loved if there were an epilogue that depicted the island or Conroy's students ten or twenty years later. Regardless, this was a moving and inspirational tale of one man's effort to change lives."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This book read like it was written by a fifteen year old who, with a lot of work, could develop into a decent writer.

This is about the experience Conroy had in the early 70's teaching in a one room school house on Yamacraw Island (which is the pseudonym for Daufuskie Island), an island off the coast of South Carolina. This island was populated by mostly African Americans. The experience was truly eye opening . It really depicted the society of that time: Civil Rights, Segregation and Southern Culture and it's resistance to change. Conroy took a true life experience and put in down on paper in such a way that the reader felt like they were there on the island with him. Add to that an exceptional sense of humor that was drizzled throughout the story and you have yourself a masterpiece. I have added all of the rest of Conroy's books on my wishlist and I feel a little bit more with the program after finally reading one of his works."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"The Water is WideGreat. After reading this I wish Pat Conroy would start writing more books. I loved the story that sparks this book. It really made my emotions about certain things come to the surface. It is wonderful to be so stimulated again as he did to us in the Prince of Tides. I am about to start his, \\"My Losing Season\\". I am sure I will be as glued to this as I always am to a Pat Conroy book. I just wish there were more of them."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"As usual, Pat Conroy spins a good yarn that will keep you riveted to the book. As a son of the South, he tells his story of the challenges of overcoming the prejudices of the day to educate black children. He does a masterful job of letting the reader know that one of the greatest challenges is culture. His portrayal of the Gullah speaking island inhabitants is a fair one based on fact rather than myth. Great book, one of his best."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I liked this book a lot and being a highschool sophmore I believe that it is a good book for students my age to read. I liked the way it had problems that were soon solved and they had a good number of characters. Although I did think that it was kind of confusing with all of the kids in the class I still loved all their personalities. All in all i believe that The Water is Wide is a good book and that many people should read it. I read it in about 3 days and i loved it!!!"},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Pat Conroy's &quot;The Water is Wide&quot; is an early work of his that talks about his teaching career on a Carolina sea island with gullah children of very little education. Teachers will find this inspiring. I loved how he told the status-quo maintaining administration to go to hell! As always, Conroy's prose and understatement is terrific."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Mr. Hill, in your statement you say that everyday, Conroycrosses thetreacherous waters between the island and the mainland to bring his kids hope and the education they rightfully deserve. As it says early on, he sleeps at the school. Just anted to add that info."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Somebody else already attacked the other reviewer for calling this book a novel. This memoir is fact. But the other writer wrote that Pat Conroy went to Yamacraw Island to fight &quot;institutional racism&quot;, blah, blah, blah. That misses the point entirely.Pat Conroy was a native of the South Carolina coast. Being a writer he took the job of being a school teacher at Yamacraw because he wanted to teach. That would give him time to write. And living on Yamacraw would give him something to write about.Pat Conroy is the author of &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot; , &quot;The Great Santini&quot;, &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot;, and &quot;Beach Music&quot;. Fans of these novels should add &quot;The Water is Wide&quot; to their bookshelves.In this memoir the young Pat Conroy takes a job teaching black children on Yamacraw Island. There is no road there so he takes a boat to work each day. The school kids are pretty much illiterate. Complicit in the neglect of the school-from a materiel point of view-is the headmistress. Representing the status quo do-nothing school board, she is just like the matron in George Orwell's novel &quot;The Clergyman's Daughter&quot;. Just like in the same novel, Pat Controy, the bright new school teacher, comes along with some new ideas and is able to achieve some positive results in the classroom. The bureaucrat in the way laments Conroy's efforts. She says he should just beat them. That's the only way to instill discipline she says.I think that Pat Conroy might have come to Yamacraw to live the contemplative live of a writer. But he soon is embroiled in controversy and busy fending off the headmistress and bewildered parents. But his skill as a teacher is he is able to mollify his critics. The apogee of his success is when he organizes his retinue for a field trip to Savannah. This is one of the most enjoyable and most worrisome parts of the book as he and the kids have a great trip, but Conroy must jump through hoops to get the requisite signatures from all of the parents. For some of the kids this is a their first trip off the Island.One should not look upon the people of Yamacraw with pity as I am sure Pat Conroy did not. What ruined their lifestyle, he clearly points, out is the pollution of the Savannah River which wiped out the crab population there and the islander's livelihood. (Probably the crabs have rebounded now with the Clear Water act and other efforts to curtail nitrogen and other emissions.) Rather Conroy's look at the Island is whimsical-i.e. he has a fondness for the winding creek and the expanse of marshes, the live oak forests, and the simple life of the agrarian dweller. He genuinely grows fond the of kids under his kids. As was his goal, all of this provided greater fodder for his memoir.The only criticism I have of Pat Conroy is he seems to have strayed from literature and gone commercial. &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot; was a great yarn about life at the Citadel. But I refused to read &quot;Beach Music&quot; because it seemed to use the same backdrop of South Carolina as a setting and theme one time too many. Not being a writer with the skills of Faulkner-who kept his focus on one tiny county in Missippi-I think Conroy could have gone elsewhere after he wrote &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot;. Maybe he is one of these writers like Tom Wolfe (of Asheville and not the Richmond writer) who can only write autobiographical books."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Bought the book after seeing the movie. The movie was very close to the book and was called Conrack. It's a true story of the author Pat Conroy and I highly recommend both."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I have never read a book by Pat Conroy that I didn't love, and The Water is Wide is no exception. Conroy is one of the best writers of our time. I didn't just read this book; I became involved in it. I wanted to help the students myself. As with all of his books, I was sorry when I came to the end."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Perhaps I should have come to this memoir earlier in my Conroy reading series or maybe I had already knew the story too well through the movie or other things I've read. This is the true story of Mr. Conroy's year teaching on a coastal island in South Carolina. I love Mr. Conroy's writing style but the story never grabbed me. Mr. Conroy is taking on the establishment as tries to teach the illiterate students of the island. He exposes them to new experiences (trips off the island for Halloween, the Globetrotters, Washington,DC) and uses unconventional methods to reach the students. Ultimately, as could be expected, he steps on one too many toes and is fired. It may be because of my educational bias that the premise of this work bothers me. I work in education and I believe in challenging the established way of doing things. I also believe that if you truly want to make long term change you need to be in it for the long haul. You don't do that by pissing off everyone around you. I don't think this work comes close to his truly great works, \\"The Prnce of Tides\\" and \\"The Great Santini\\"."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This book started out as a burden for me, because it was assigned to me by my literature teacher. It started off kind of slowly, and I resented having to read it. However, once I got a good way into the book, I realized that I was enjoying it immensely. It was no longer a burden, but a pleasure. It is a deep, moving story that really makes you think. How anyone could say it seemed like it was written by a fifteen year-old is beyond me.I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, especially if, like me, you live in the south. It really gives you a lesson on how things were just a short time ago."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"My high school students have been reading this novel now for15 yrs straight...its relevance continues, especially for a generationof kids who seem to know nothing about that time period (1968-1974).They have lived with technology their entire lives yet heir lack of historyor historical perspective amazes me.

It is worth reading... a sort of \\"The way it was\\" book, true, sad and inspirational."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Pat Conroy's teaching experience on an impoverished South Carolina island in 1969 is reminiscent of Eliot Wigginton's situation in Rabun County, Georgia, during the same time period. (Read Wigginton's book, _Sometimes a Shining Moment: A Foxfire Experience_, if you can locate it.) In each instance, a well-meaning and hopeful young teacher was dropped into what seemed to be an almost impossible educational situation -- an isolated community with seemingly backward students, nonexistent funds for decent materials, and goals and textbooks that didn't come close to meeting students' needs. In Conroy's case, the added strains of regional racism and administrative power games were too much to overcome, and he had to leave after serving a little more than a year there.And yet, _The Water is Wide_ is a humorous book. We laugh at the white teacher's ignorance of the Gullah children's lifestyles, and we laugh at the children's reactions to the facts he tries to teach them. It's one \\"fish out of water\\" gag after another, so to speak. We applaud Conroy's dismissal of the educational chain of command and we cross our fingers that field trips to the mainland will come off without a hitch. We hope that the students will be better off than they ever were before his arrival; for this commentary on one year at one small elementary school stands for all the rest of us, across time, at all the other schools in the nation.The most disturbing fact here is that those of us working in public education today can easily recognize practices that we still have to deal with: superintendents as dictators; ineffective or intimidating school boards; administrators who rule from afar and never set foot in any classroom. Most of us squeeze the living daylights out of the scantiest of budgets and rebel against the pressure to see the kids as testing statistics rather than human beings. It's all right there, in Conroy's book, and it's still in our schools today. So you can read his words and say to yourself, \\"Geez, at least we don't have it THAT bad,\\" or you can find yourself commiserating with him and saying, \\"Wow. We're not that different. I hear you, Pat. Go for it.\\"\\"Conrack\\" may not have made as much of a difference in his students' lives as he would have liked. (Who among us does?) But Pat Conroy has given teachers an inspirational, impactful story: one we can learn much from."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"In Pat Conroy's first book, The Water is Wide, he writes of a universal theme: young idealistic man sets out to change the world and runs into a brick wall. But while this story has been told by other writers, nobody writes with the passion and emotion of Conroy.The Water is Wide is based on Conroy's experiences of teaching on Daufuskie Island in the late 1960's (thinly disguised as Wamacraw Island in the book). After his application was turned down for the Peace Corps, Conroy applied for a job teaching black children on this isolated sea island off the South Carolina coast. His 18 charges were from the upper elementary grades. What he discovered was an unbelievable shock. These 18 students did not know what country they lived in, the name of their president, or what ocean lapped their beach. Some couldn't read or write, recognize the alphabet, write their names or count to ten. Also, none of these children who lived surrounded by water could swim. Everything Conroy had learned about teaching was obsolete on Daufuskie, and he had to be flexible in his methodology in teaching his students to learn. Unfortunately, he hits one roadblock after another from supervisors, the superintendent, the school board, his only colleague and even the parents (who liked what Conroy was doing, but didn't want their children leaving the island for trips). He also runs into hypocrisy, inertia, prejudice, and jealousy.While Conroy is trying to teach his students, they are giving him an education as well. While the kids from nearby Beaufort are worrying about the homecoming dance, what costume to wear for Halloween, dating, and a host of other non-serious topics, the Daufuskie kids have to deal with poverty, substandard levels of education, alcoholic parents, violence and a host of very serious issues for children so young. Yet, his students are honest to a fault and very endearing. Conroy is amazed and enlightened to see the world through their eyes.But Conroy wasn't fated to remain at Daufuskie very long, and not all endings are happy. He claims to have not made much of an impact on his students (most readers will disagree). Much of the pristine Daufuskie Island has been turned into a golfing resort. Many of the same problems still plague the islanders. Yet, his short-lived career as a teacher gave him the story that really began his literary career. Not many young writers can boast that their first commercial effort not only became a major bestseller, but also a major motion picture (Conrack with Jon Voight). Conroy's agent, Julian Bach, first read The Water is Wide and told him that he was a natural writer and would write many more successful books. Bach's crystal ball was certainly working well that day as Conroy has since published The Lords of Discipline, The Great Santini, The Prince of Tides, My Losing Season and Beach Music. It doesn't get any better than that."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Set on a small island off the Carolina shores, where Conroy spent a year teaching a small group of black children, who were so lost in time that the name of the ocean that surrounds their island was unknown to them. This colorful and delightful memoir will warm your heart and open your eyes to a system that has not delivered on its promises. Those promises being, the right to an education funded by taxes and delivered in the appropriate manner by someone who can get the job done.Ever upbeat we find the protagonist working his way into the lives of the children on this all but forgotten island. We watch them attempt to bloom like so many different flowers, and enjoy their trials and tribulations as well as their ability to conquer their ignorance when given half a chance. Different than his novels, PRINCE OF TIDES and BEACH MUSIC, but none the less just as good, this is an endearing and sweet taste of a champion among the children. Kelsana 7/24/01"},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Before Pat Conroy became a successful author he was a teacher. This book chronicles the one year he spent teaching in a two-room schoolhouse on Yamacraw Island off the coast of South Carolina. It is a moving and often funny story of one man's attempt to bring education to eighteen mostly-forgotten black children. Children who didn't know the name of the ocean at their front door, didn't know who was their President, didn't even know the name of the country they lived in. However the story never becomes maudlin and the tone is upbeat throughout. Many times I found myself laughing out loud. Mr. Conroy is an excellent writer. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I am sure that if every teacher was also an incredibly talented writer, there would be hundreds, or even thousands, of great books like this one. As it stands, this is one of those rare opportunities when the world gets to read an exciting example of what happens in one classroom in the circus-like world of education. This book happens around the time of desegration, and is a true story about the author's venture into teaching on a small island of black families off the coast of South Carolina.This is a great book for teachers, aspiring teachers, and people interested in education. It reminds you of all of the roadblocks--political, cultural, financial, familial--that a teacher deals with; then it shows you that despite these barriers, there is a way to make a difference.Pat Conroy is in top form on this book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This is a true account of Pat Conroy's year of teaching on an island he calls Yamacraw which actually is the island of Daufuskie, one of the coastal islands of South Carolina. Daufuskie is close to Hilton Head, but the difference between them is night and day. While Hilton Head is completely modern and developed, Daufuskie is still natural, beautiful, serene, quiet and tranquil. Because the 20th century basically ignored this small island, time seems to have stood still. The students he taught, cut off from modern society, knew almost nothing of events outside their narrow and impoverished life. Conroy attempted to expose the students to a world outside of the island. While the main theme is education, a secondary and strong theme is life on the island. This book is well written. It was read after my visit to Daufuskie where I saw the school he taught in, and experiencing that really brought the book to life."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This is a great book for many reasons. One of my favorite parts of this book is the dialogue between Conroy and the kids of the Island. It is hilarious! I laughed out loud on quite a few occasions. The personalities of the students come alive. Conroy's descriptive writing is mesmerizing, and the deeper themes are also emotionally captivating. Anyone who has been a teacher will be able to relate to Conroy's idealistic dreams and his frustrations about teaching a difficult population of students. This is definately worth your time!"},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"The Water is Wide by Pat Conroy is a great book. The Book is about a white school teacher going to Yamacraw Island to teach the deprived black children. The book touches your heart and makes you think how well you have it. You will learn many things from this book like what it is not to have a house, electric, and even a good education. I think that all teachers should read this to understand how much some people love their job and this book can help you improve the way you teach. This book is also shows how if you want something so bad and you work at it you can achieve your goals."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"The Water is Wide is my second favorite Conroy--Prince of Tides being the first.

He faced immense challenges in this primative school, but loved his students and made a great impact on these young lives.I found his stories both tragic and humorous. Aternatley lauging and crying.

It relates a year the author spent teaching on an isolated island off South Carolina. The children are charming as are the residents of the island. The author, sadly, is way too impressed with himself. Even when he admits to faults, he does it in a way that ends up patting himself on the back which makes him annoying on a meta-level.

However, the Kindle edition, which I purchased 26 December 2008, is riddled with ridiculous typographical errors which make reading a chore.

It doesn't have a really solid, twist-filled plot like most novels but it sure was a good story. What I found to be the thing that really spiced up this book and made it good was not only the insight into the life of the people in of the Sea Islands but the colorful collection of characters, and how he really took his time in going over each one, of whom there are so many and showing what their world is like. He also gives the reader a good idea of what life in the area (Beaufort, Sea Islands) was like at the time, and he gives the information first befoer he displays his usually fiery opion on it. It's not my type of book, I personally prefer something with a more solid plot and more action (or philosophy) to plain old good stories, though I did enjoy reading it. I think this book is excellent reading for anyone thinking of going to the Sea Islands, as I am myself."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Great read, a must read for a teacher but can be enjoyed by all.

The island was totally exiled from the rest of the world. The special thing about the island is that its mostly comprised of blacks and the kids on the island have been neglected by the system.Overall i thought it was an ok book. If you like autobiographies (especially about teachers) you'd be interested."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"When I read this book its told in such a great way, that you forget throughout the whole book that it is in fact a non-fiction book. Pat Conroy tells about his life in very good detail. He places every quote from his friends in here literaly word for word, you can tell as some charactors have much stronger (colorful) language than others.The main storyline in this book is how Pat Conroy, a teacher at an integrated high school at the time of Martin Luther Kings Death, gets tired of all the racism between White people and Black people. He thought that by being a High School teacher he might be able to change the world. After he accepts the fact that society wont ever change in this school. He asks to be appointed to an open position on Yamacraw Island as a teacher and principle. Yamacraw is an island off the coast of South Carolina. When he arrives at Yamacraw he finds out just how dumb the children are. It's hard not laugh at some of the plain and simple reatarded remarks they make. Within a few chapters of the book you can tell that Pat Conroy is finally begging to make a difference in the lives of the children.You really need to get the book and read the rest of his story. Find out if he gets fed up with a false cause of teaching future farmers or if he sticks with it and helps to develope Yamacraws first succesful people."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Have not yet read the book.

An enjoyable reading experience which I am revisiting this summer during many sailing adventures."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I read books like a shark swims ... I keep moving, devour them, move on. Rarely I come across books that I reread, and fewer that I reread more than once. The Water is Wide is one of those re-readable books. I first encountered Pat Conroy's book when I was in junior high, and have returned to it again and again. Finding that it's been re-released, hopefully to gather a new audience, is encouraging to me. The book, written when the world, especially the South, was grappling with changes spurred by the Civil Rights movement. A white teacher, graduate of one of the premiere Southern military colleges, The Citadel, takes a position as a teacher on an island isolated from the most of the cultural changes in the United States. He introduces children to the joy of learning and to their place in the world. Conroy is a compelling writer, and gives life to his story and subjects."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I loved Pat Conroy's \\"The Prince of Tides,\\" and that led me to reading \\"The Water is Wide.\\" Conroy writes beautifully and had me laughing as well as feeling deeply for both the children on Yamacraw Island and Conroy's situation. The book brought me back to my own teaching experience in a poor district of California in 1966. Although the children I taught had a bit more knowledge than Conroy's, I could identify with many of the situations he faced. I highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in race relations and/or education."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Pat Conroy is an honest writer. Throughout this powerful book, he blames himself--his ego, for getting in the way of educational success, or at least bringing about some minor changes on the Island. While he certainly was as good an enemy to himself as any other, that fact does not dilute the powerful evil of prejudice and fear that runs freely and daily through the Island's educational enterprise.At times, Conroy reminded me of Yossarian inn Catch 22 or Leper in A Separate Peace--wild, chaotic, and bound to bring fear to those who didn't understand or appreciate him for what he was--a teacher, pure and simple.While this did take place in the South, it could have been in any segregated school system. His tracing of segregation and desegregation is seering in its honesty, charitable in its perspective, and a sad testimony of this phase of American history. If we pay attention to this book, perhaps we will learn from it."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I enjoyed the book -- it was a candid story about Pat's journey from living in the deep south and his growth journey as he became an educator who realized that institutional racism deeply affects the lives and the future of all students.

I ENJOYED MANY OF THE ANECDOTES IN THE BOOK THAT WERE NOT IN THE MOVIE."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Based on the author's experiences on Daufuskie Island as the new white school teacher of a black school, it is interesting to read Conroy's youthful understanding (published in 1972) of his even more youthful idealistic fervor.Even more interesting, however, is to follow this book with a collection of personal memories from the region: Remembering the Way it Was at Hilton Head, Bluffton and Daufuskie (http://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Hilton-Head-Bluffton-Daufuskie/dp/1596290617)A number of the real people featured in this book are clearly models for characters in The Water is Wide: Iris Glover = Frances Jones; Henry Piedmont = Henry McCracken (some sources claim that Ezra Bennington = Henry McCracken); Ted and Lou Stone = Lance and Billie Burn. It is fascinating to read the different perspectives of these people. McCracken is shown in a very different light. For example, Queenie Jenkins describes how McCracken helped her (black) son Theodore go to college. This is where one readers can go, for a more thorough epilogue about some of the characters and the region.On local message boards of the region and in the reviews here at Amazon some claim that Conroy chose to teach in Daufuskie as a way to accumulate material for a book. The Water is Wide does not read this way. He draws a fairly convincing picture of a naive, self-righetous young adult tilting at educational windmills - and coming out of the experience a bit more sober.In Writing Educational Biography: Explorations in Qualitative Research p.214-217 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0815322968) Craig Kridel describes trying to figure out which parts of Conroy's book are fact and fiction. He comes to the conclusion that Conroy's dispute with the school board is portrayed fairly accurately, while the personalities he assigned to some of the major characters (such as Ruth Brown = Julia Johnson) are not.Regardless, whether you believe everything in the book as nonfiction or not, it is a compelling read."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"This is my first Pat Conroy book. All of his books have great reviews on Amazon, so I wasn't sure which one to start with; I just picked this one. I think I made a very good choice by reading 'The Water Is Wide' first. It's an early book, and I got a lot of insight into who Pat Conroy is, his humor, his goodwill, the kinds of people he surrounds himself with, etc.I just started reading 'Beach Music' and I really feel an affinity for this author after reading 'The Water is Wide.' I appreciate his ability to write and articulate ideas.'The Water is Wide' is about the time period in the south in which many people grew up with racial prejudices as a way of life. As children, it's \\"just the way it is\\" and they don't know any better. As Mr. Conroy became a man, more educated and involved in the very things he had been taught to dislike as a child, he underwent a huge personal change and touched so many people along the way. I like his kick-*** attitude and how candidly he wrote about everything.This story moved me on many different levels. This is a book about a man helping others, inspiring others, and overcoming the false beliefs about race that stemmed from his upbringing and culture. It's also about someone who was courageous enough to stand up to authority. It's a wonderful story. If it were fiction, it would be a good story. But the fact that it is based on the author's experience just makes it even better. Can't wait to read the rest of his books!I looked up Daufuskie (aka Yamacraw) Island on Google and it seems to be a big resort island with golf courses and hotels now; probably nothing like the Yamacraw Mr. Conroy experienced many years ago. Must visit some day anyway.I searched for the movie 'Conrack' on Amazon, but they seem to only have VHS version sold by a different seller, but not available on DVD. Conrack wasn't on Netflix either. Let's hope it gets re-released on DVD."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"While reading The Water is Wide, I experienced exactly the kind of heart-warming, comical, enjoyable reaction Pat Conroy had in mind while writing the book. Several themes are apparent throughout, and it was easy for the reader to recognize the most important one. Pat Conroy taught his students and readers that no matter a person's race, literacy level, age, or gender, everyone matters, and everyone is equal.Pat Conroy moved many times as a child, since his father was in the military. His first job was teaching English in Beaufort, South Carolina. He then found himself teaching on the remote Daufuskie Island, which was referred to as Yamacraw Island in the novel. This teaching job provided the inspiration and plot for The Water is Wide.Pat Conroy, referred to as \\"Conrack\\" by some students, has an excellent way of teaching readers the importance of acceptance and equality. He does not preach or lecture his message, but his delivery of it through countless situations is just as effective. Sometimes his point is concealed by the amusement of the Yamacraw students, but by the end of each chapter, the reader will be reminded of the seriousness at hand.The Water is Wide never failed to entertain me. The book takes countless turns in the plot, and each turn results in comedy, sincerity, or amusement. The reader finds him or herself relating to each character, even though the lifestyle on Yamacraw Island is much different from most of the United States. Pat Conroy made me realize how lucky I am to live in a society where education is important and emphasized. This book opened my eyes to how people in other, less fortunate areas of the world live. I recognized that education is imperative, and how much the average student takes for granted.While Pat Conroy had no problems capturing my attention with plenty of interesting stories, he sometimes overwhelmed readers with his personality. Several parts of the book were filled with Conroy's strong opinion on characters and school rules. This sometimes interrupted the plot. Other than the occasional rant by Pat Conroy, the book flowed smoothly.The Water is Wide was an excellent read for teenagers and adults, especially those interested in teaching. I enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover, and it influenced me in ways only exceptional literature can."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I really enjoyed this book. This book helped me understand the many different ways some places were ignored maybe because they were all back or uneducated. In this book I realized how much I take my own education for granted."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Any teacher would enjoy this read. The author's point of view and observations about the island culture have been interesting and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Rarely have I felt the range of emotions the surfaced while reading a book. I laughed out loud. I shed tears. I was shocked to anger. I burst with admiration for a teacher who cared so deeply for his students and who went to incredible extremes to teach and love them. This is a rare book by an extraordinary writer. He tells a story so compelling that you will wish you could be such a passionate and effective teacher."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Having read several of Pat Conroys' books before and enjoying every one of them, I really like this book about his teaching days. It is not fiction."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Loved this book. Very well written. It gives an insight into the people whom Conday was teaching and their circumstances. The contrast of life on the island and life in town was interesting."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"The Water is Wide details Pat Conroy's first career as a teacher on a small island off the South Carolina coast. It is so far removed from the rest of the U.S., the black residents of the island speak a totally unique dialect of English known as Gullah. Conroy is assigned to teach the upper grades of a combined class in a two-room school house.Anyone in education will find common ground with Conroy's attempts at reaching kids so unlike him. It is the same for the majority of inner-city, rural, and reservation schools. The kids have difficulty understanding his accent. They come from different worlds. The parents are exceptionally poor, living off social security and whatever meager funds come from fishing polluted waters.Conroy has several small successes as a novice in the classroom. Teaching kids to write their name for the first time. Taking them off the island for a field trip. At every step, he fights the bureaucracy of a system that does not care for the well-being of a few dozen illiterate black children.Compared with previous educators on the island, Conroy is extremely liberal. He spends nights sleeping at the school and plays music and movies in class. He does not use corporal punishment. Most of the kids lack television/books/magazines and have no understanding of the broader world around them. His big fight with the superintendent of schools is anticlimactic, by this point most readers will have a sense that the main character's teaching career is on the rocks.Conroy is one of the most gifted writers of his generation. His prose evokes a spiritual truth that goes far beyond entertainment. Although not one of his best books,The Water Is Wideit is well worth a read for its introduction to a subculture long ignored by the rest of the country. 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"Pat Conroy's \\"The Water is Wide\\" was a shocking eye-opener! My own first two years of teaching in 1960 to 1962 were such a blessing, not because I was a great teacher, but because the children I taught were blessed to have dedicated teachers who helped them establish a solid foundation of the basics of education. As I read Mr. Conroy's account of his teaching experiences on Yamacraw Island, I felt overwhelmed by the obstacles he faced in those two years of his teaching. As his book revealed the educational levels of each of his students, or the lack thereof, I marveled at his choices to bring those children out of the despicable chaos and brutality administered in that school. Granted, Mr. Conroy's classes were chaotic at times, but the students were learning more than they realized; Conroy made learning a joy for his students. He created ways to use music, theatrics, visuals, and he enlisted the help of a variety of talented people outside the classroom to develop more ideas for teaching geography, math, grammar, and history. Pat Conroy was a genius at determining when and how to educate the children in his classroom. He fought to give his students a chance to travel outside the boundaries of the island where they lived, and he bravely challenged the school administrators for the right to do so. Without Conroy's determination to expand the world of his students, no doubt they would have had little opportunity to enjoy the numerous educational experiences that he strongly believed they deserved. Pat Conroy's book is an inspiration to any teacher."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"The book has a lot of energy, and should be required reading to anyone involved in education for children.The author gets a little \\"preachy\\" at times, but still with energy that carries the reader forward. I really liked it, and for me it fell in the \\"I couldn't put it down\\" category."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"The story is well told as are all of Conroy stories. This book is just a little different from some of his others. I came to love and admire the characters and as the story progressed knew they would overcome the tribulations of poverty and ignorance. Great story!! I have been an avid reader of Conroy for many years. Some of my favorites are Beach Music the The Great Santini."},{"Title":"The Water Is Wide","review":"I don't typically read non-fiction, but I love Pat Conroy and he didn't disappoint here.

Like Elmore Leonard Estleman takes the reader on a long ride into the human condition of yesteryear, ambushes a number of preconceived notions along the way, and leaves you with a story that stays with you long after the dust has settled.There's enough humor as well to keep you chuckling and enough well written dialogue and description to make the pages (and Page too!) fly.Good for you, Estleman and good for us."},{"Title":"White Desert (Page Murdock, US Deputy Marshall, Book 6)","review":"This is the sixth book in the series about US Deputy Marshall Page Murdock and this time out he is away from his usual Montana stamping grounds having been despatched to Canada by Judge Blackthorne ,his boss ,to bring back two especially vicious killers.They are Bliss and Whitelaw who while lacking the notoreity of such as Jesse James and Billy the Kid are more destructive and depraved by far.It is a trip fraught with danger-the Metis Indians are chaffing under British rule and seem likely to break out in open rebellion ,ther Sioux have taken refuge in Canada after defeating Custer and are not overly enthusiastic about US lawmen .In addition there are the Shulamites -a colony of ex slaves now living in Canada and also lacking in will to help any stray US white .Add the constant butting of heads between Murdock and the Mountie commander Urban Vivian ,bone freezing weather and hostile wildlife and its a bumpy ride for the Deputy..He does have useful help however from the guide he engages ,the resourceful Phillipe la rochelle .The climax comes with the capture of Murdock and Vivian by the outlaws and a shootout and pursuit following it .The decriptive writing in this book is especially fine and the action plentiful and well described.Estleman is a master profssional and this fine stand alone novel is him at near best .It works as a pursuit ,adventure tale rather than a pure western and is immensely enjoyable"},{"Title":"White Desert (Page Murdock, US Deputy Marshall, Book 6)","review":"Deputy Marshall Page Murdock encounters Mounties, Metis, and Cree Indians in a wintertime assignment to Canada.

They usually don't tell the stories of fae folk in their own homeland. There are exceptions, of course, but authors tend to focus on faeries stuck in the human world, or humans encountering Faerie. I think I may know why that is. When writing about faeries living in Faerie, it's all too easy to have nothing happen.Anne Eliot Crompton uses beautiful, if occasionally stilted, language to draw us into her take on Arthurian legend:\\"When I was yet a young woman I threw my heart away.I fashioned a wee coracle of leaf and willow twig and reed, a coracle that sat in the hollow of my two palms. In this I placed my wounded, wretched heart, and I set it adrift on the rain-misted wavelets of the Fey river, and I watched it bob and whirl, sail and sink. Ever since I have lived heartless, or almost heartless, cold as spring rain, the way Humans think all Fey live. Humans I have known would be astounded to learn that I ever had a heart that leapt, brightened, fainted, quickened, warmed, embraced, froze or rejected, like their own.\\"The narrator is Niviene, daughter of the Lady of the Lake. In the ensuing chapters, Niviene endeavors to tell us how she came to the point of throwing her heart away. This ornate, image-rich prose continues, and Niviene meanders and digresses in her tale. She'll mention an old family friend, then backtrack and tell us all about how she came to meet him before going back to the main thread of her narrative.By combining the flowery style with a narrative that is ever looping back on itself, Crompton conveys a sense of what Faerie is said to be like. It's beautiful and hypnotic, and time doesn't flow in Faerie the way it does in the human realm. The trouble is, it's *too* hypnotic. Lulling. Dreamlike. Reading Merlin's Harp made me sleepy. While falling into an enchanted slumber and waking on the cold hillside is very much in keeping with Faerie tradition, it doesn't help propel one through a novel.It also doesn't help that not much happens in the first hundred pages or so, which is as far as I got before giving up. Roughly the first ninety pages are taken up with an interpretation of the Lady of Shalott tale, and a rather uninteresting one. The main problem is Gwenevere, who spends this entire sequence drugged and being toddled around like a doll. Sure, she's gorgeous, but can physical beauty alone account for the trouble she unwittingly causes here? I've seen sympathetic Gweneveres and unsympathetic ones, but all the best portrayals afford her some charisma that helps explain why she is so loved.This is followed by a four-page sequence (I counted) in which Niviene gets pregnant and gives birth to a son, the son grows to the age of five, and then the son goes missing. All in four pages. That was when I decided to give up. If it takes ninety pages for a young boy to break a young girl's heart in favor of a pretty woman in a stupor, and four pages for a fetus to become a five-year-old, the pacing is just a little too strange for me, Faerie or no.Merlin's Harp contains some lovely language and an interesting perspective on the Matter of Britain, but finally the pacing and the hypnotic effect were too much for me. I recommend it to fans of lush prose who have plenty of coffee on hand."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"Merlin's Harp is an exquisite addition to Arthurian literature. Anne Crompton's writing is lyrical and beautiful. Itleads you into the story and keeps you there. Her veryoriginal presentation of well known characters, well knownstory lines, and even objects such as the Grail is so veryintriguing that you do not want to put the book down untilyou have finished it. Her central character Niviene isdelightfully &quot;odd&quot; and fantastical. This is a Niviene noone has seen before. I cannot recommend this book highlyenough. It is one of the few books that really does takeyou into another world. When you put it down, when you haveread every page, you are left with a feeling of amazementand sheer delight in the experience."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"This is a rather unique look at the legend of King Arthur. This is the tale of Niviene, daughter of the Lady of the Lake.We see Niviene grow up from a young Fey still learning about her surroundings and follow her through becoming a mother and a companion to Merlin at the Court of King Arthur. Arthur starts as just a tale Niviene hears from Merlin during his visits to Avalon. Then there is their chance encounter and finally Niviene encounters him at Camelot.But While this is an Arthurian tale there is very little about Arthur actually in it. Instead we learn about the Fey, how they feel about this human king and the plots and reasons of Merlin. We find out the truth behind Sir Lancelot and where he came from. We learn about Mordred's shadowed history. We even learn the truth behind the Holy Grail and why someone as wise as Merlin sent the knights of the Round Table looking for it.All in all a very entertaining book that is both well-written and freshly plotted. I recommend this one to anyone interested in Arthurian legend."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"Touted as a new and different interpretation of Arthurian legend I thought perhaps this book would be a good bridge into fantasy for a reader somewhat interested in exploring the genre. Unfortunately it fell short in that regard. It was such a tough read that it did more to turn me off the genre than on.The flowery and excessive prose made it, at times, difficult to follow. I never really got a clear picture of what either land looked like. Apple Valley (ie: Avalon) was slightly more vivid than Arthur's kingdom but all things considered the characters hopped so quickly between different settings it was tough to grasp on to any sense of place or time. Speaking of which, I had no idea if we were in the present or the past or seeing some sort of Fey vision of the future.Not having read much in this genre or much in the way of Arthurian literature some of the intricacies were lost on me. However, I will say I found some of the characterizations and relationships developed to have quite a bit of potential. I would really have enjoyed seeing more of Lugh and the Fey girl he'd left behind. I actually found that element of the story (while extremely short lived) quite compelling. Heck I would have chucked the whole Arthurian aspect to just focus on that part of the story entirely.In the end, what I take away from having read this book is that this type of fantasy isn't for me. Perhaps lovers of the genre will read it and find it's strengths, I would certainly enjoy hearing a different perspective."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"Merlin's Harp is a great short read (one day ), that will transport the reader back to Arthurian times through the eyes of an important, but not much talked about player. The book reminds me of 'Forest House' by Marion Zimmer Bradley. It is light reading, yet keeps your interest. Merlin's Harp will give the reader new insight on Lancelot and Melwas, with a new revelation on Merlin and the Holy Grail"},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"Well this was, um . . . not good. Really, at all. I don't think it's ever taken me so long to read a book so short. Like wading through snow up to my hips. It's so overwrought and drowning in such flowery language that it's hard to connect to anything that's going on in the story. I often found myself having read a page without really reading it and only skimming it when I went back over it.To Crompton's credit, she stuck very closely to faerie lore which is to her benefit but even greater to her disadvantage. Because she stuck so closely to the lore, I felt nothing for Nivienne. Faeries are traditionally heartless and don't emote as humans do. That certainly came through in the reading but at the same time it also made me not give a crap about Nivienne. And so help me if she said, \\"I, Nivienne,\\" one more time, I was going to put my hand through the pages and slap her. I get it goes with the tone of the writing but it's overwritten so, to me, it was just annoying.Plus Nivienne constantly refers to herself as brown. Maybe my eyes aren't working correctly but fish lips on the cover is a white girl. And can I say how much I hate it when people purposely push out their lips in a vain attempt to make them look fuller? The Olsen twins do it all the time. Makes me want to throw things at them and see if I can get them to stick.But more to the story, the whole Saxon war I felt was glazed over. I was three quarters of the way through the book before I realized that we'd already moved beyond that. For me, the focus of the story wasn't quite right and what was being talked about was secondary to the greater problem going on in the background. The characters just kind of glided through their surroundings as if they were inconsequential and didn't matter to their greater scope of things. The urgency of the Saxon threat in the blurb is unfounded in the story and barely appears to make a dent in the consciousness of the characters.It didn't help that the text was, within chapters, non-linear. Nivienne kept having these sort of flashbacks where she'd go off on tangents about what happened in her past because something in the present reminded her of it. It started to ebb towards the end but it was really prevalent in the beginning. I often found myself having to read back a few paragraphs because I'd realize that I had missed a time jump. Very jarring and interrupting. That's one of the motivating issues I had with getting into the story aside from not connecting with Nivienne.The best part was the last few chapters where Arthur and Mordred got into it. It's really the only part that's not completely glossed over with insubstantial nothing. I think if that part of the story was more played up, not only would Nivenne have become a more well-rounded character, it would have made the story stronger. I got to see facets of Nivenne in those few scenes that were absent the entire story (presumably because of her Fey nature) that I really liked. But too little too late, really.Overall, I really appreciate that Crompton kept so close to the lore even though it was detrimental to the success of the main character. I liked how she played with the King Arthur legend and made it her own. Other than that, I think the writing style is trying too hard and what story is there is drowned by it. The MC isn't human and thus I couldn't connect with her for 95% of the story because, for all intents and purposes, she remained emotionless. I think if the writing weren't so flowery and the story were told from someone else's perspective, or Nivienne was allowed to emote a little more, it could have been much better. As it stands, I couldn't rightly recommend this one. Read Le Morte d'Arthur. Much better.My apologies to Paul at Sourcebooks."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"I think one of the problems some have with Crompton's novels is that they are more literature than popular in style, and many modern readers, unfortunately, have lost almost all sense of even minor abstraction, instead needing things to be told simply. This is one of the problems with much of contemporary fantasy being written by and for a more game/SyFy Channel crowd than a literary one. That aside, Crompton has really done her homework on the Fey and their point of view. Also some nice twists and turns on the Arthur myth. One of the problems some readers seem to have is following the story chronologically, but considering the narrator isn't human and lives in a world of immortality and non-human motivations, I find this an interesting device. I wish the author had written more than just the three books in this universe. She seems to share with Joy Chant the same burst of three good novels and then silence, although I see she has written several children's books as well."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"A refreshing new perspective for Arthurian legends we thought were thoroughly explored.

The book is based on the perspective of a Fey woman. The first few chapters focus entirely on the life of the Fey and I found it a very interesting perspective. Merlin is introduced as is Guenevere and Arthur and Lancelot - though you don't know this at first. The introduction of characters is subtle and almost elusive. Not until later in the book does the plot twist and turn and bring you to the familiar aspects of the Arthurian legend we all recognize. It is a fast and intriguing read. I also liked her inclusion of Merlin's songs throughout the novel. They brought the poetic oral tradition of the legend into the book to show how the story evolved over time to the tale we know today. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"Now this is a fun book (in a tricky and magical sense).But I think the cover on this book is deceiving --at least the pink one looks juevenile and sparkly aimed at 14 year olds.

They live on Apple Island, also known as Avalon, with Niviene's brother, Lugh. Niviene is happy in her Fey world, living apart from most of her kind except when she and Lugh and their friend Elana slip into the villages and pretend to be Human.The basic elements of the Arthur legend are here--Gwen's relationship with Lancelot (though there is a surprise there), Mordred's arrival at the court, the forces that ultimately threaten Arthur's rule. But what sets Merlin's Harp apart is Niviene's perspective.Niviene is 100 percent Fey, or so she believes, and as such she doesn't understand the Human emotions of love, honor, greed, lust and longing. She has special powers that allow her to see the future through the flames of fire and speak to animals. Her forested world is rich in fantastical elements. And yet, Niviene is drawn into the Human world by Merlin, a frequent visitor to Apple Island and a friend of her mother's. Merlin asks Niviene to help Arthur by going with Merlin to Arthur's court. She risks losing her own power, and if she does, she will not be able to help Arthur.Merlin's Harp weaves a tale that blends the lines of mythical and historical worlds. Poems of Merlin's Song and his life history are woven through the chapters, and they create a subtext of interest in Merlin's birth and adolescence, not just as the old man we usually see him as. While the premise of the story may be well known, the details of Merlin's Harp make it seem freshly told. Niviene's perspective made me thing of the Arthur legend in a different way and imagine new possibilities for the reasons behind the actions of each player. The ending surprised me as well, and I thought it was fun to think of new possibilities for a tale so often told. I recommend it for mother-daughter book clubs with girls aged 14 and up."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"Originally posted on [...]Take a journey into a time when knights reigned, magic existed, and there were still unexplored regions in the land. Merlin's Harp is a story that combines many of the tales of old and creates a new version of King Arthur, the round table, Lancelot, Merlin, and the fabled Avalon.Told through the narrative of Nivienne, a fey who has lived on Apple Island in Avalon all her life, this isn't the tale that you remember. In this fable, Nivienne is front and center, and the stops along the way create her own unique journey. Those around her are the supporting cast - her fellow fey, King Arthur, Merlin - all of which come into play as the mystery unfolds and the hidden villas are revealed. It's an intricate puzzle that unravels piece by piece, creating new variations which are far more than you anticipate.Written in a lyrical fashion, at times I found myself wondering if a fourteen-year old fascinated by shimmering vampires would find appeal in Merlin's Harp. To be certain, it's beautiful at times, yet here and there the narrative and dialogue became cumbersome and drew me away from the story. This isn't the average YA fanfare, yet strives to provide something fresh and unique in a genre saturated by angst and modern-day calamities. Yes, there is a smidgen of romance, but ultimately, this is a tale of love, loss, forgiveness, and acceptance. Nivienne has many tragedies that mark her soul, each one painful and heart-wrenching. It's not always an easy read, however, when the twists and turns occur, it's enough to draw the reader back in and ensure they'll continue flipping the pages through to the end.Fans of the Arthurian legend will enjoy Merlin's Harp, although it should be stated that some of the themes, while not graphic, are adult in nature. If you want to experience the legend through the voice of a young-woman, this is exactly what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"When I was yet a very young woman I threw my heart away. Ever since then I have lived heartless, or almost heartless, the way Humans think all Fey live.Among the towering trees of magical Avalon, where humans dare not tread, lives Niviene, daughter of the Lady of the Lake. Her people, the Fey, are folk of the wood and avoid the violence and greed of man. But the strife of King Arthur's realm threatens even the peace of Avalon. And while Merlin the mage has been training Niviene as his apprentice, he now needs her help to thwart the chaos devouring Camelot. Niviene's special talents must help save a kingdom and discover the treachery of men and the beauty of love...Niviene is an interesting character. She is very spirited and strong. Her voice made it one of a kind and I really liked her point of view. This book is an original take on a myth that we all grew up on, King Author and the Round Table. Instead of being from a male points of view, it is told from the Daughter of The Lady of The Lake. I found it to be an original take on the myth. The plot still had unique twists and turns that made the story more interesting. Crompton is a great writer. The songs that were intertwined in the story really helped make the story original and fun. I would recommend this book if you enjoy Mythology or Song of the Sparrow by Lisa Ann Sandell."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"From the opening paragraph of Merlin's Harp, I was lost. Crompton's writing is beautiful to the point that it may be too overcomplicated for many readers, teens or otherwise. To be honest, I had to pull out a dictionary after only the second sentence to figure out what in the world a \\"coracle\\" is. (It is a small boat, by the way.) As the novel continued, Crompton's writing style did grow on me a little bit. However, I am sure that while it suits the plot well (seeing that this a novel about the Arthurian legend), as a reader, I just wish that everything had flowed together better.Merlin's Harp has a very interesting premise. However, for me, the premise is overshadowed by the complicated writing. This writing made everything in the novel feel so disjointed and unorganized. It was honestly a novel that I could only read so many pages of before I just had to put it down. In addition, it took me much longer to read than it should have since I had to continuously seek help from a dictionary. In Crompton's defense, I realize that she was using authentic wording and descriptions. But for the average reader, this may be more of a hindrance than a blessing.Sadly, I am not sure if there is much more to this novel other than a pretty cover. While I did finish this novel... barely, I am not sure that I got that much out of it, which is a pity. This novel holds so much promise. But when I cannot even get past how hard it was for me to read, everything else seems overshadowed. I believe that if the novel was toned down quite a bit, then I might have enjoyed it more, but as it stands, I just cannot get past the writing. Unfortunately, this novel is a book that I would recommend that you skip unless you are a die hard Arthurian legend fan."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"Okay, this was a GREAT book, price doesn't figure into it -- intelligently written, entirely plausible, thoroughly enjoyable. I read it from start to end in one sitting (if a book is reasonably good I'll do that).What tells me a book is great? When you are reading it, you don't have those periods of, 'oh, I'm reading a book'. You are so immersed in the story from start to finish with nothing drawing attention away from the story, that you see it in your head and don't realize the information is on a page in front of you.Well done!"},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"Original point of view on King Arthur from the Fey. Very well written. AEC is a good writer.But there is no point to this story. Nothing remarkable stood out after I finished the last page. I often reflect on and absorb a story after I finish and there was not much there. Loved the insight on the Fey but that wasn't enough.Free on kindle so no complaints. Maybe a generous three stars."},{"Title":"Merlin's Harp","review":"I have to give this book a 3 simply since I didn't finish it and it was free on Kindle.

Not a book to read 2x."},{"Title":"Acting for the Camera: Revised Edition","review":"The first two sections of the book alone increased my abilities in front of the camera 100%. It became that I would read it over each week on my way to acting class. Tony Barr examines all areas of acting, tools, preparation, working on set and putting what you have learned into practice. It is to the point, intelligent and easy to read. It is a book to be studied, underlined and reread. I really feel it is a must for anyone wanting to act in front of a camera, regardless of your talent level."},{"Title":"Acting for the Camera: Revised Edition","review":"Well, got a camcorder? I'm not being funny. The Eric Kline exercises at the end of the book will teach you things, with the aid of a camcorder that no amount of talking or reading can. But first, read the book.Economy is its keyword. Tony Barr gleans, from years of teaching since he founded The Film Actors Workshop in 1960, the most effective and easiest techniques for both the novice and the pro to truthfully &quot;communicate ideas and emotions&quot; through the camera.Correctly relegating exercises to exercises rather than as a response to the director's shout for &quot;action,&quot; Barr recounts the need for listening, sensing and learning to respond to stimuli moment to moment. He divides the book into sections. The first two, &quot;Acting&quot; and &quot;Working on the Role&quot;, he tells us are enough for anyone to create a strong performance. The next, &quot;Tools,&quot; he warns are extras, only to be approached after you have mastered the first. The last part of the book gives the never-been-on-a-set-before actor everything he/she needs for that first role, the understanding of the mechanics of movie making that directors expect from actors.Want to be in pictures? This is a must-read for you."},{"Title":"Acting for the Camera: Revised Edition","review":"I obtained this book to read while taking an \\"Audition For Camera\\" class at my acting school. I'm a relative novice, but had read some books on general acting before, such as Uta Hagen's \\"A Challenge For The Actor,\\" and really wanted a book that talked about specific aspects of acting in front of a camera.This book, Tony Barr's \\"Acting For The Camera,\\" is a little different from what I was initially hoping it would be, in that it basically is a book about general acting, with more than the entire first half of the book devoted to that. I remember often thinking \\"when are we going to get to the part about camera work?\\"Mr. Barr's general thoughts on acting are actually quite good, though, which encouraged me to read through the whole of the first section, and I would say that there are many excellent insights there. It's also a relatively quick read, as opposed to Uta Hagen's book, for example, and many things are presented in ways I hadn't read in other books before.When I finally got to the \\"camera\\" section of the book, I sort of realized that the reason he probably spent so much time with the \\"general acting\\" stuff is because ... well, the most important part of \\"acting for the camera\\" is the ACTING, not the CAMERA! Of course there are many specifics that he addresses, but all the specifics and terminology etc. aren't going to help you if you can't act.Plus, the section on \\"exercises\\" at the end of the book was helpful to read, even though I haven't tried any of them myself yet ... they seem like well-thought out exercises to improve ones' camera work.The groundwork and advice on acting that he gives, though, is excellent all-around and seems appropriate to apply to ANY type of acting, not just camera acting.So, all in all, I'd say that the book would more accurately be titled \\"ACTING, with a special section on Acting For The Camera!\\" That isn't quite as marketable though, I suppose!!"},{"Title":"Acting for the Camera: Revised Edition","review":"Overall, this is a good purchase. I got this a while ago because of my interest in branching out in my acting. I will admit that the first few chapters were slow, and I stopped reading for a while. However, after the first 1/4 I really got into it. There are excellent tips in there on how to go from theatre acting to film acting. There were also some good ideas on acting in general--from reacting to stimuli during a scene or dealing with unruly directors. It also had a few addresses for unions, which is always nice to have. There were also definitions of jobs related to film and the equipment used in film. The last chapter of the book is a compilation of exercises to practice in front of a camera. These are exercises that you will need about 2 or 3 other people for, and you will either have to improvise a scene, write a scene, or find a scene to perform while doing the exercises.This is a very good book that gives you the basics. It can be used as an introduction or as a refresher, and it is generally an enjoyable read--Tony Barr writes with humor but also gets the point across. After the first few chapters, I devoured this book. This is definitely a good book to have for reference, one that I will have around for a while..."},{"Title":"Acting for the Camera: Revised Edition","review":"This is, by far, the best guide I've ever read of acting for film and television as it compares to acting for the stage -- for the dollar, a Barr-gain of anything taught in acting school! A very descriptive reference manual to read again and again throughout one's acting career, it examines the correlation between theatrical and film acting, a principal that's often disregarded by many modern actors to the detriment of their skill. This book is a thorough technical manual for those never before the camera as well as for experts in the field. Victoria Ward, Artistic Director, Stage Forward"},{"Title":"Acting for the Camera: Revised Edition","review":"I was fortunate enough to have known a personal friend of Tony Barr, and attended on 3 separate occasions a small private training workshop done by Tony himself. I have to say that what you learn in this will mean nothing unless you put the exercises into practice. He was one of the rare teachers that never really told you what to do but knew how to pose questions that got you thinking in his method. The techniques put into practice can have you prepared for a character by the second reading, which is an invaluable asset in the hasty Hollywood environment. The techniques are based upon how real life works. The simple concept of listening, motivation, and crossing the bridge are invaluable to writers, animators, filmmakers & any profession of understanding interaction.

However, he has an obvious bias against theater. He consistently implies that theater actors are unable to create realistic performances. He refers to theater actors having to do without the &quot;glamour&quot; of theater when on a sound stage. Someone please tell me where this theater with all the glamour is..I've only been on the ones where there's hard work.He educates the poor shallow theater actors with such elementary concepts as that when one plays an evil character, one should not only play the character as &quot;evil.&quot; I learned that in high school. He also devotes a whole chapter to the unrealistic notion that an untrained actor would be asked to do a stunt on film or television.

I got him out of his wet clothes, warmed some freshwater so he could wipe down, and got out his dry clothes. But it wasn't until he had had some hot, solid food that he started to warm up and stop shivering\\" (p. 357); the real situations experienced during extended cruising and appropriate responses are the focus of this comprehensive book which contains relevant advice on nearly every cruising situation imaginable, with a strong emphasis on how those situations impact the crew.The authors are professional sailors and have been full-time cruising sailors for over forty years. Their vast experience and precise writing skill enable them to expertly address a wide range of topics, and the book clearly demonstrates their mastery of the care and feeding of sailing crew.The book is divided into 52 chapters and two indices. Each chapter presents a logged day of a sailing cruise, noting weather and sailing conditions, and covers items which are appropriate to that particular stage of an extended cruise. The concepts are emphasized with enjoyable anecdotes which illustrate the importance of preparation and adaptability. Topics include nearly everything imaginable, ranging from menu planning and food purchase and storage, through cooking methods and preservation techniques, to fishing and keeping the crew well-clothed. The authors' cruising experience ensures the hints are appropriate across a variety of weather and climate conditions. For example, rough-weather food preparation is contrasted with calm-weather cooking using limited galley facilities. The text dispenses with theory and focuses on the reality of small-craft living.The tone of the book is personal and engaging; the coverage of the topic is masterful and authoritative. Now in its revised 3rd edition, the book is superbly edited and particularly well-balanced. The writing style is accessible and inviting and the material reads like a long letter from a personal friend--albeit a well-spoken friend with indisputably good advice and an incredibly interesting suite of daily experiences. Not only does the book instruct and encourage, it positively portrays cruising and draws the reader into the author's world.Part adventure book, part how-to guide, part personal history, and part cookbook, the text is fun, creative, and sure to please. Regardless of the reader's level of sailing experience, the book has much to offer and ensures that the care and feeding of sailing crew will not only be possible, but an enjoyable component of future cruising."},{"Title":"The Care And Feeding of the Sailing Crew","review":"Lin Pardey produces works which are everything they should be: carefully crafted from patient, thorough record keeping.

Their suggestions for ways to prepare for a voyage, and to increase your comfort and improve your experience while under way are fascinating. They're also amazingly useful even for those of us who rarely venture out of sight of land.More than just useful, this book also gives you a vivid glimpse of what living aboard a sailing vessel is like.I recommend this book if you're interested in life at sea, now or in the past, if you're an armchair sailor, and especially if you're responsible for keeping a family or crew healthy and happy on a vacation, longer race, or coastal delivery. And, of course, it's wonderful for the obvious audience: those who are considering casting off from land and crossing oceans."},{"Title":"The Care And Feeding of the Sailing Crew","review":"A wonderful resource for anyone considering ( or actually living )on the water.

But belying the book's title, there are huge gaps in her knowledge -- for which she does allow and begs forgiveness.Her field research and travels in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Southeast-Asia places greatly influence -- perhaps too much -- her coverage of beekeeping in these areas. She provides good general coverage of traditional hives in history and in current usage.However, her research pretty much stops at 1998 or so, and thus has little to say about the recent proliferation of top bar and other unframed hives in \\"emerging economies\\" and in the West.Substantially missing are discussion of post-Langstroth developments in hive design and beekeeping methodology. For instance, the early-mid 20th Century writings of Abb&eacute; &Eacute;mile Warr&eacute; and later non-Rationalist trends in beekeeping are not mentioned. Warr&eacute;'s Ruche Populaire (People's Hive) has been rescued from a half-century of obscurity, and is gaining adherents in the post-Rational beekeeping movement of the 21st Century.So this book has excellent coverage of beekeeping's history, proving that humans have been doing it for an awfully long time; yet it is a dated work of pre-internet scholarship, and so its limitations must be kept in mind."},{"Title":"The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting","review":"If you are scientifically-minded and love lots of little details, this is a great book for you. Eva Crane has well-documented her resources, and if you can get through all the details, you find great stories as to the origin and development of beekeeping in different cultures.

Given the title and era in which it was written, I expected it to contain some pretty weighty material about Christian living. I was not disappointed.In this book, Law challenges the reader to respond to his \\"serious call\\" (and he was very serious when he wrote it) to devout living. The author makes a very solid case for this approach to Christian living for two main reasons. First, he is dead right about most topics he covers. His main point is that many Christians (I fall into this category) take for granted what God has done for us. There is no higher call than to love and serve Him. Yet we do not place as much value on spending time in devotion (prayer, reading scripture, praising, worshiping, serving) to God as we should. Instead we lived unbalanced lives in which God has a secondary role, instead being the primary focus of our existence.Secondly, as another reviewer mentioned, his message is as relevant today, if not more so, than when it was written. We live in a day were modesty and pious living are completely ignored. It was refreshing to read a book which calls Christians to a much higher standard - we should not crave the things of this world. It is something I have struggled with, and continue to struggle with everyday that I live in overly abundant America. This book has helped me regain a more proper perspective on the importance of living for God (and what that means) versus living for the world.I highly recommend this book to any Christian looking for a well written resource about living a life devoted to God. Law provides a lot of deep thought about the subject, and practical ways to try and live it out. At times, he goes a little bit too much into legalism for my taste, but overall he is on the mark with his approach and logic for his \\"serious call\\"."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"I read this book because Hannah Hurnard, author of Hind's Feet on High Places and other allegorical and devotional works, credits it with revolutionizing her spiritual life. Law exhorts Christians to offer all aspects of one's life and work as holy to God - work, finances, relationships, worship, prayer, etc. He reminds us of the Christian virtues of love, humility, peace, simplicity and conforming ourselves to God's will. This is a work which should not be forgotten or neglected by modern Christians."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"This &quot;edited&quot; version is a great disappointment. William Law's elegant prose has been dumbed down for &quot;reading comprehension,&quot; and is dull as a junior high civics textbook. In Chapter VII, which talks about Miranda and Flavia, Flavia has been omitted. Presumably to keep everything &quot;positive.&quot; The very spirit of truth so eloquently championed by Law in HIS book has been made a mockery of, because there are no warning labels to tell us that some anonymous hack has tampered with his text. O tempora, o mores! This book doesn't even deserve one star."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"William Law was one of the great mystics, clerics, and educators of the Church of England. Born in 1686, he was educated at Cambridge, eventually taking a teaching position there in addition to being ordained in the Church of England. He lost his position at Cambridge for being a Non-Juror (the Church of England being a state religion, clerics and others are required to swear oaths of allegiance to the monarch, and this Law could not do with regard to George I). He wrote the first work, \`A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life', one of his best-known works, while in retirement as tutor in the Gibbon household (he was tutor to the father of the historian noted for the work on the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire) in the 1720s.. He wrote the second, much shorter work, \`The Spirit of Love,' in 1750s.The first is a major work of spiritual practice, rightly deserving the description as a \`classic' or \`masterpiece'. For a course we teach at my seminary, this book is on the list of spiritual classics one may choose to use for inspiration and spiritual reflection, and for good reason. Influenced by Law's readings from other mystics such as Thomas a Kempis, Johann Tauler and others, this book is full of mystic insight and practical wisdom. It was popular from the start, and remains an enduring classic of post-Reformation spirituality.Law has a fairly ecumenical audience, though he is not without controversy. Law is very much a man of the church, and of a high-liturgy and sacramental church at that, thus some Protestants may find difficulty with some of his unstated but very present assumptions. Law resists bibliolatry, does not accept the doctrine of Calvin of a complete corrupt humanity, and never assumes to try to prove the existence of God, taking that for granted. It is interesting, in our post-Christendom world, that Law is more widely read than ever before, given that it would seem there is much concern about whether or not there is a God, and often those of a more mystical mindset shy away from mysticism so firmly influenced by ecclesial structures.Law's work in \`The Serious Call' takes the form of 24 chapters, each one beginning with a simple spiritual rule, observation or proposition. Sometimes these can take a directive form as a spiritual practice - some chapters, for example, recommend prayer at certain times of day (chapter 16 recommends 9 a.m., chapter 20 recommends 12 noon, etc.) and prescribes the content and the manner of the prayers. Some work from a proposition (chapter 13 - that any life, full of vanity or even more humble, will ultimately show misery and emptiness) and some work from proclamation and argument (chapter 24, of the excellency and greatness of a devout spirit). \`Devotion signifies a life given or devoted to God,' Law writes in the beginning. This devotion is not just church work (although it involves that), and not just prayer (although it involves that, too), but is an entire life given over to God, and as such can be something all can do, not just clerics, mystics and monastics.Unlike \`A Serious Call', the second work contained here, \`The Spirit of Love', can be very difficult reading, as there is no organising principle similar to the logical progression of the earlier work. It is done in a dialogue form, in the shape of letters, and better known according to the editors in piece-meal collections of highlights or selected passages, given Law's general lack of method and organisation of texts later in his life. However, there are those who love \`The Spirit of Love' and proclaim it to be Law's best work, particularly for his identification of the wrath of God as something that separates us from God, but is in fact not to be found in God, but in us. Our redemption and reconciliation with God requires our removing this wrath and embracing the divine love always freely offered.The editions here are fairly standard, authoritative ones. The history of Law's work in print is laid out, and selection reasoning is given in the introductory material, which also includes (as do all of the Paulist Press editions of this wonderful series) biographical information (not just simple historical, but also spiritual biographical information), textual notes, and other information of interest."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"With so many light weight devotional books flooding the market these days, it is good to sink one's teeth into a great spiritual classic. Law was an 18th century Anglican. As he grew, his theology also grew. Near the end of his life, his writings began to lean toward gnosticism. &quot;Serious Call&quot; was penned while Law was in his prime. It was on John Wesley's personal book shelf and greatly influenced the father of Methodism. This book will challenge the reader. It speaks as strongly to the 21st century reader as to the 18th century reader."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"This is the most challenging book I have ever read on following the teachings of Christ practically in every day living. The conviction was so fierce that it was hard to get through the first chapter. His words bear so much truth it motivates you to want to be more like Christ himself."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"To find a man like William Law in 17th century England is as unexpected as finding a violet blooming in the Arctic. It's almost beyond anyone's powers to fully describe the beauty, benevolence, and wisdom--and good solid sense--of his spiritual advice. Consider instead the character of those who have praised him: there's Samuel Johnson, who took up Law in a frivolous mood in his youth and found himself nearly bowled over; or closer to our own age, C. S. Lewis and Aldous Huxley. The most memorable parts of the _Serious_Call_ are those where Law (following the model of Theophrastus's _Characters_) describes several spiritual types and how their natures relate to the pursuit of the devout life. The _Spirit_of_Love_ is a later work, written after Law had been influenced by the German mystic Behmen; if you're not acquainted with Christian mysticism, it might be hard to follow. But do not miss Law's account of the Atonement, particularly if you're one who has always felt scandalized by the &quot;blood sacrifice&quot; theology emphasized in traditional Protestantism."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"William Law was one of the great mystics, clerics, and educators of the Church of England. Born in 1686, he was educated at Cambridge, eventually taking a teaching position there in addition to being ordained in the Church of England. He lost his position at Cambridge for being a Non-Juror (the Church of England being a state religion, clerics and others are required to swear oaths of allegiance to the monarch, and this Law could not do with regard to George I). He wrote the first work, 'A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life', one of his best-known works, while in retirement as tutor in the Gibbon household (he was tutor to the father of the historian noted for the work on the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire) in the 1720s. He wrote a second, much shorter work, 'The Spirit of Love,' in 1750s. These were of discernable influence on John and Charles Wesley.The work of 'Serious Call' is a major work of spiritual practice, rightly deserving the description as a 'classic' or 'masterpiece'. For a course we teach at my seminary, this book is on the list of spiritual classics one may choose to use for inspiration and spiritual reflection, and for good reason. Influenced by Law's readings from other mystics such as Thomas a Kempis, Johann Tauler and others, this book is full of mystic insight and practical wisdom. It was popular from the start, and remains an enduring classic of post-Reformation spirituality.Law has a fairly ecumenical audience, though he is not without controversy. Law is very much a man of the church, and of a high-liturgy and sacramental church at that, thus some Protestants may find difficulty with some of his unstated but very present assumptions. Law resists bibliolatry, does not accept the doctrine of Calvin of a complete corrupt humanity, and never assumes to try to prove the existence of God, taking that for granted. It is interesting, in our post-Christendom world, that Law is more widely read than ever before, given that it would seem there is much concern about whether or not there is a God, and often those of a more mystical mindset shy away from mysticism so firmly influenced by ecclesial structures.Law's work in 'The Serious Call' takes the form of 24 chapters, each one beginning with a simple spiritual rule, observation or proposition. Sometimes these can take a directive form as a spiritual practice - some chapters, for example, recommend prayer at certain times of day (chapter 16 recommends 9 a.m., chapter 20 recommends 12 noon, etc.) and prescribes the content and the manner of the prayers. Some work from a proposition (chapter 13 - that any life, full of vanity or even more humble, will ultimately show misery and emptiness) and some work from proclamation and argument (chapter 24, of the excellency and greatness of a devout spirit). 'Devotion signifies a life given or devoted to God,' Law writes in the beginning. This devotion is not just church work (although it involves that), and not just prayer (although it involves that, too), but is an entire life given over to God, and as such can be something all can do, not just clerics, mystics and monastics.The edition here is a fairly standard, authoritative one. The history of Law's work in print is laid out, and selection reasoning is given in the introductory material, which also includes biographical information, textual notes, and other information of interest."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"This is what mainstream Christianity is missing! We need to get back to the basics of a holier and pious life. The late Mr. Law emphasizes the need for volitional poverty and the freedom one receives once a person has committed to this form of lifestyle and how it allows for greater ability for service. Not only that, but he focuses in on the heart beat of what every Christian needs and that being time with God. He lays the foundation for prayer and how this is the life blood and the highest form of worship and adoration. This book speaks to the hearts of those who deeply yearn for a closer relationship with God through Jesus Christ. I have implemented changes in how I do things now and I can honestly say that I felt a difference and a deeper abiding love for God. If you don't want to be absolutely love sick for our heavenly Father, then go somewhere else, I'm sure they have more self help books that need to be bought."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"This timeless classic by William Law is for anyone in search of God. I have read it again and again. It is full of encouraging words, gems of wisdom, and biblical insight that satisfies the intellect as well as the soul!"},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"Refreshing to read the inspiring words of William Law, written in the 1700's. The realization that this theologian may have influenced the faith and thinking of America's founding fathers makes it even more awesome. Gives a poignant perspective from a day when faith was more God-centered and less &#34;me-centered&#34;, when personal holiness rather than personal happiness; living in the will of God rather than focusing on how He might bless me, was the emphasized as the life of faith."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"This is a very good source of spiritual understanding, in fact I highly recommend anything Wm Law has written. His material is very deep and devout, if you're looking for something more than status quo...look no further."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"As a seeker of truth and a amateur theologian I read many books dealing with \\"what is the state of our being\\". None I have ever read deals so honestly and piercingly as this one. It may take a chapter or two to get past the writing style that was common for the times. But speaking of times this is timeless. Nothing he says is passe. If you are interested in truth about how you really live and what is really important you will \\"enjoy\\" this book. Be prepared to be haunted by it's message.One other thing. This book, in my opinion, could be used as a text in a logic class. Law is simply brilliant.You might also consider \\"A Testament to Devotion\\" by William Kelly or \\"The Gospel of the Kingdom\\" by E. Ladd.Anything by Dallas Willard will be a great benefit and blessing to you."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"A classic book, originally published in 1728. William Law is a puritan. And he writes like a puritan - but what he writes is so worth reading. While this book may be difficult to read (330 pages) if you are not used to reading the puritans, it is worth trying. His whole point is that we must get serious as believers in our devotional life. What is devotion? He define sit as:...a life given, or devoted to God. The devout, therefore, are those who live no longer to their own will or the way and spirit of the world, but live to the sole will of God, consider God in everything, and serve God in everything.He goes on to say:If we do not live unto God in all the ordinary actions of our life, and make him the rule and measure of all our ways, we cannot be said to live unto Him at all!The goal of such a life is transformation & change.As I said, if you are not used to puritan writing, you may find the middle chapters repetitive, and his reasoning \`long winded' - but the danger in skipping over such chapters is to miss the nugget of great insight which the puritans can give to us.A classic which should be read today - and one which should inspire us to be diligent and vigilant in spending time with our God and allowing his word to change how we live."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"Here is the clarion call to a true life thatglorifies God.

I'm still in the process of reading it but I already love it. This should be required reading for all Christians. Then perhaps the church would live differently than the world and perhaps we'd have less scandal.So far I can see that there needs to be a balance. One could easily tend towards legalism and a justification by self-works type of mentality. Perhaps he'll cover in later chapters how it's the Spirit of God that now creates the will to do differently and also empowers us to do so as we allow him to lead us in all areas of our lives.But as long as one is aware of this work of the Spirit in a believer's life, then this book can do nothing but stimulate one to self-reflection and love and good works."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"If you're looking for a challenge in your spiritual walk - this is the book for you. Law's classic book was the transforming resource in the lives of the Wesley brothers as well as abolitionist William Wilberforce - just as it changed their lives, this book will not leave you the same!I've read an abridged and edited version for the modern reader by John Meister (158 pages) - but it wasn't enough - I had to order the small type 317 page version! This is not an easy read - on the difficulty scale of 1 - 10, this would be a solid 9. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone in high school or even college - Law deals with real world issues and a little seasoning in life is necessary to get the full effect of his challenge. This is a perfect book for the Christian man who wants more than a Purpose Driven Life, the man looking for a profound, insightful, and challenging read that will deeply impact the core of his being!You can find these books online. The longer version is a Vintage Spiritual Classics edition and retails for around $13.00. Rare will be the person that will want this book - but if you're the one, don't pass this one up! I give this my highest endorsement and recommendation.Law deals directly with the concept of devotion to God - and asks some difficult questions about where man places his true devotion in life - in the things of this world, or in the Kingdom of Heaven? Law argues that a wise and reasonable man will wholly devote himself to the things of the Lord for they are far superior to the temporal and worthless things of this world. In fact, Law says that a lack of this devotion is a clear indicator of gross ignorance! The book gives several practical elements necessary for a devoted life including prayer, study, humility and confession. But it is not the elements about which Law writes, it is the manner in which he presents them to the reader that makes this book so exceptional - Law raises the bar and challenges the follower of Christ to live an exemplary life, a life worthy of their calling, a life comparable to the great saints who have walked before us or even to angels who minister above us!"},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"This book should be read by every Christian that can get it. It was a tremendously insightful and humbling book that opened my eyes to the hypocrisy in my own life as well as the church in general. The Christian church in America and I am guessing much of the Industrialized and wealthy west[yes, I am a member of that group] have fallen so far from the devotion and holiness that God requires that it is a shock to see what was the actual New Testament norm just 270+ years ago, let alone at the time of the writing of the New Testament. This was a very easy to read book, compared to say Spurgeon or Calvin. Extremely convicting personally. Would recc. to anyone who see themselves as sinners and wants to know what they should do. Includes excellent examples and is written as a practical guide, though not a how-to book[remember, was written over 270+ yrs. ago, before self-help books where invented;)]Found out about this book from a Word Pictures Program on the subject at their video's are also highly recc. for those seeking to glorify God and enjoy him for eternity[mans chief end]Sincerely,Wayne Borngesser"},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"William Law is a great mystic who combined great spiritual insight with brilliant literary gifts. Aldous Huxley commended his work extremely highly, quoting Law abundantly in the 'Pereniall Philosophy' and describing his works as one of the finest in the English language.Law grew up in a fairly religious environment and was set for a good career in the Anglican Church. A devout Protestant, from an early age Law's piety was noted by all who encountered him, and he was fondly remembered by the father of Edward Gibbon (who hired Law as a tutor for the family) as one of those rare men who carried out in deed what he claimed to believe.This collection of Law's works contains his long book 'A serious call to a devout and holy life' and another work called the 'Spirit of Love', a dialogue based on Law's interpretation of the mystical visions of the German shoemaker, Jacob Boehme. The first work is a brilliant attack on all forms of Christian hypocrisy, ranging from inane gossiping to the seductions of earthly power and prestige to the traps of lust and money and the threats they pose to Christians from all walks of life. One of the most original ideas in Law's works is that all vocations, no matter how menial or of what type, can be good and holy in the sight of God; a key insight of other Protestant reformers like Luther and Calvin who were deeply concerned to stress that the good gifts of God are to be seen in all callings and in all people, in all areas of society, not just in monastic or clerical elites. However Law also recognised there is a deep danger in any worldly vocation that the constant temptations of ordinary life and of our own ego can very quickly and easily lead us into many forms of sinful behaviour and thought, which are in the end deeply destructive to our spirituality and our relationships with others.Law as a great writer doesn't just talk in abstract ideas but makes his themes concrete through 'characters' he introduces in the Holy life, to represent the sincere Christian as opposed to the Christian who lapses into the temptations of the world. It is disturbing at how often you see yourself reflected in the Christian who succumbs to temptations, and how rarely you see yourself in the Christian who doesn't.The Call was a deeply influential work, and had a strong influence on no less a figure than John Wesley, the founder of Methodism and also of the evangelical revival in England. However, Wesley came (perhaps understandably) to have deep reservations about Law's later mystical writings, and his enthusiasm for Boehme.'The Spirit of Love' is a long dialogue which draws out Boehme's mystical themes, at least as interpreted by Law. The key is the love God has for the universe and all creatures (even fallen man) and that even though the Protestant emphasis on God's anger and wrath for sin are appropriate, these images reflect a deeper truth in that the Godhead is in actual fact entirely love, in essence as well as act. Even God's wrath or anger is in fact really God's love taken as pain, but it only occurs as pain because the creature is sinful and its will is turned away from God's will. In this sense Law's mysticism agrees with that in the Theologica Germanica, where perhaps even the devil would be saved in an instant if he turned from his self will to conforming with God's will.Law seems to skip over other aspects of Boehme's strange mysticism, from Boehme's idea of God being an 'ungrund' or fathomless abyss, from which the Trinity and another figure called 'Sophia' (a female personification of divine wisdom), to Boehme's use of very obscure language borrowed from occult sources (especially alchemy and astrology) to try and work out the connections between the world of spirit and the created world. Nevertheless, there is strong merit in Law's focus on God's total and complete love for us, which can be obscured if we only see God's hatred and judgement for our sins in his actions and in the Bible. Law would like to remind us that even if God hates sin more than anything else, we can so easily reconcile ourselves to him by turning to his son, Christ, and once again being cleansed from our sin and our selfish will against God we can be restored to what God made us to be in the beginning.Regardless of whether or not you would agree with Law's points, his works, especially the Call, contain many valuable warnings and lessons about the life of the spirit in the Christian context and well worth reading."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"This book is assembled by a print-on-demand publisher, from a text that has been captured through OCR text recognition.

As I went through the chapters, however, it is clear to me and will become clear to the readers as well that Law sounds eerily close to a Roman Catholic minus the devotions to the rituals. Despite many deep, excellent, stinging, uncomfortable, soul-searching reflections and illustrations on the Christian life contrasted against the futility of a self-centered life that I believe are profitable for Christians, particularly to defy the preaching of prosperity gospel that seems to \\"prosper\\" more than the true gospel, sadly Law embraces the fatally erroneous doctrine of justification by works. In his view, Christians need to practice the principles of piety, self-denial, generosity, meekness, simplicity of life and all the Bible, particularly the New Testament teaches, the best they can in order to be saved that sounds all too familiarly popish. What he mostly brings up from the Bible is the wonderful teachings of Christ. There is no mention of poverty of spirit, dependence on God's grace to live a sanctified life or to desire to live for him to begin with, let alone the cross, justification by faith, sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, and perseverance of the saints.Well, the immediate questions that arise are of course, aren't Christians saved already, and that they are saved by grace on the basis of the finished atoning death and resurrection of Christ on the cross, and not by works? How does one know that he has done his best? What is the standard? Whose standard is it to use to determine whether one has done his best, man's or God's? If it is man's standard, which one? The Pope's? How can we be so sure if it is his standard to be used, not someone else's? If it is God's, where is it in the Bible that says God commands us to do the best we can and not rely on him for everything without excluding our responsibilities? Where is it in the Bible that God's standard says we are saved as long as we do the best we can? This is unquestionably deadly because in the end, it points to the perfectionist demand of the law where no one can meet, which is warned against by the Apostle Paul in his epistles, particularly to the Romans and Galatians. The meat of what Law talks about is all about doing and there is no mention of child-like dependence and trusting on God's grace in Christ through the Holy Spirit to enable us to follow what Law, in some cases, biblically and exquisitely exhorts to embrace and practice. To properly describe what Law offers here is a mixture of rich food and poison. The rich food is his biblical heart-piercing warnings, rebukes, reflections, illustrations and encouragements, specifically about prayer, fasting, simplicity, modesty, generosity, humility and self-denial that I must admit are too good, too important, and too bitter-sweet, eye-opening of an exposure and remedy to my own weaknesses to be overlooked as well as too precious to be neglected in practice. The poison is his constant insistence of justification by works. For the fullest benefit to be reaped, enjoy the rich food. Let it purify our souls and reform our lives, but spit the poison out. Instead, embrace and enjoy the even richer food of justification in Christ alone, by grace alone, through faith alone, and to the glory of God alone for these are the fountain that enables all true piety."},{"Title":"A serious call to a devout and holy life","review":"Do not buy this hardcover edition.

Today, nearly 37 years later, I still remember some points from the book. That's how much impact the book can have. Possibly the greatest lesson I learned was to ask myself the question every day, \\"Is anything I'm doing today going to have eternal value?\\" He did not teach it in those words, but that seemed to me the gist.Someday all the insignificant and petty involvements of daily life on this planet will pale in view of what is lasting and eternal---what pleases and honors God Himself.

A very popular song was even made based on that premise. A continuous storyline based on that idea is presented in this book and packaged for elementary school children as part of the Weekly Reader program. I would be hard pressed to come up with a better subject for the program.Snoopy is a character that children easily relate to and the text and illustrations will keep their interest. If reading programs for young people are to succeed, the children have to want to read and this is something that they will want to read. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"No Other Star","review":"This is a fabulous book written in the early forties and published in 1948. Jane Williams nee Von Blon a former USHS Student and resident of Upper Sandusky weaves a masterful work of fiction surrounding her home town and Columbus, Ohio. The thread goes to New York City, Belgium and Washington DC. It is a book of growing up, going to school, getting the first job, becoming a reporter and writing a book. It is about love, war, politics and nostalgia in the early 20th Century. I am looking for a copy of the book and if you happen to have one, feel free to contact me."},{"Title":"Dirty Pool: Playing to Win","review":"The author does not get into enough detail for me to be of very much help. If you know the concept of safety play, then you basically know what this book is all about.The author does discuss selecting high percentage shots and practice. Without practice, unforunately, there are times when neither a high percentage shot or high percentage \\"dirty\\" play are available execpt for all but the best players.It's not badly written, and it does have a few witty comments. If you read it you might pick up a few useful tips. I was disappointed with this book, but maybe I expected too much.

But a few days later, when I was in a game with my brother, I kept thinking about some of its advice, and I was actually thinking about winning, like nothing else mattered.I went back and reread the book. It is actually full of sound advice of game winning fundamentals that could help, not only beginners but also better players like me, and I realized that the book's strightforward, easy reading style was at first misleading.Like other pool books I have read, it was good for my game."},{"Title":"Dirty Pool: Playing to Win","review":"It dissappointed me.First of all, the title is misleading: 'Dirty pool: Playing to win'.'Dirty pool' in the book means a couple of examples from common safety play.I was expecting something like practical pool jokes or some extreme maneuvers people have done to win a game.After recovering from the first disappoinment, the second one followed. Issues in the book are lame and cheaply presented.My opinion is that 24,95 $ is a horrible list price from this book. 5 $ would be appropriate. If you know nothing about pool, this book might have someting to offer, but why bother while there are cheaper books on the market, which coversame issues and lots of others more accurately, widely, interestingly, with more pool credibility.The author mentions Capelle's and Byrne's outstanding books, which means he knows the current standards of a good pool book.What was the motivator of producing this book then? I can see only one..cashing people out!"},{"Title":"Dirty Pool: Playing to Win","review":"Excellent. This in going to be one of the best pool books available.

Faith is a topic that seems easy to discuss but difficult to apply. This six week study takes the examples of six types of faithful women in the Bible and how their faith made a difference. Learn about &quot;Extravagent Faith&quot; through the Woman of Ill Repute; &quot;Laughing Faith&quot; through the example of Sarah; &quot;Unwavering Faith&quot; through the story of Mary Magdalene; and &quot;Intimate Faith&quot; through Elizabeth.Each woman has very different experiences. And each has a very different approach. But all of them show the power of faith in their lives. And they all set some great examples for how we are to live.Although created as a group study guide, this series easily adapts to a personal devotional time. Through in-depth scripture study and life applications, this is one series that can change your life."},{"Title":"Strengthening Your Faith","review":"This was the first Bible study booklet that I used for a weekly lunch-hour Bible study for women at my workplace. The women were thrilled to have a study just for them, and soon we had a dozen women signed up for the study.This study on Faith was creative. The discussion questions were probing and thought-provoking. And the Friendship Booster activities, while we had to admit some of them to our lunch-hour, workplace format, were a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Customs and fashions in old New England","review":"First published in both England and American in 1893, Alice Morse Earle's work met with very positive reviews. She pioneered the use of diaries, chruch records, newspaper accounts, letters and household inventories in the preparation of this work. Her engaging writing style made her works very popular. She presents fascinating, unvarnished views of child life, travel, taverns, table plenishments, home interiors, courtship, marriage, sports, diversions, medicine along with funeral and burial customs. The reader will find this work humorous, entertaining, thoughtful and her subjects picturesque, bizarre and curious. To this unabridged text has been added a new introduction along with biographical material on and photograph of the author. This is a widely referenced, widely consulted classic."},{"Title":"Customs and fashions in old New England","review":"Alice Morse Earle's work is a fascinating study of everyday life in 17th and 18th century New England and is recognized as one of the historical classics. She looks at child life, courtships, holidays, marriage, drinks, medicines, letters, sports and diversions. She makes use of diaries, letters, household inventories, and church records to write a history of this period. Earle's choice of topics combined with her melodic style of writing and pioneering use of first person accounts has resulted in a well documented, easily readable classic about our American past, well suited for the researcher and casual reader alike."},{"Title":"Customs and fashions in old New England","review":"This is not a review of the contents of the book. Alice Morse Earle's work should be considered a national treasure.This publisher, however, has merely run an Optical Character Recognition program on a scan of the original book done for Google. They warn you of this, both in the description above and on the back of the title page of the book.I would have been willing to overlook an occasional typo or formatting problem, but this production is pitiful. The title on the cover is not capitalized correctly. Part of the title page has been incorporated into the title of Section 1. The policies and checkout slip for The University of California library have been left at the end of the book. On page 33 (which I chose at random) there are 23 typographical errors including lines split incorrectly and the words \\"P: tl\\" and \\"ii11inix(\\". Page 33 is in Section 2 which is entitled \\"COUKTSHIP AND MAEEIAGE CUSTOMS\\".This lack of even the vestige of a discounted rumor of quality control is particularly irritating since AME quotes diaries and letters from the period with the variant spellings and punctuation common at the time. The lack of effort by the publisher makes the book irritating at best and unreadable in spots.As a sop to those of us who either purchased the book or were given it as a gift, the publisher kindly gives us access to the original scan for free. But the original scan was done by Google not by the publisher. The truly sad thing is that there are other reprints available that are readable and inexpensive including a complete and searchable text file on line for free.I consider the money spent on this book wasted except for the knowledge attained that this is a publisher to avoid.

A Portrait of George Washington","review":"I just finished reading Aspire to the Heavens for the second time. When I first discovered this true gem a few years ago, I didn't understand why it was the only Mary Higgins Clark novel left shelved at my local library during peak lending season. Admittedly I was somewhat surprised after reading Ms. Clark's introductory page stating that this was NOT a suspense novel, but rather a story about the life of George Washington. Expecting to dive into a juicy suspense - imagine my disappointment! However, after browsing over the first few pages, Ms. Clark's writing style (as always) had me immediately intrigued. This fabulous little book took us into Mr. Washington's personal life from his uncomfortable relationship with his own mother, to his lifelong infatutation with his best friend's wife, through to his spunky courtship and marriage to the wonderful and intuitive Mrs. Washington (Martha). Mary Higgins Clark taught us to KNOW George Washington, with all his leadership q! ! ualities and common sense mannerisms, allowing us to respect and admire him for the great person he was (much in the same way that he WAS perceived by his countrymen of the 1700's). This magnificent book gives us history, adventure, romance and a glimpse into a bygone era. A suspense novel it was not - but my, what a pleasant surprise! And once again, Ms. Clark's amazing writing talent managed to wrap up the novel at precisely the best possible moment, leaving me feeling like the characters were good acquaintances, yet leaving me with still another feeling - that I had gained privileged information about a truly amazing person who was not a mere piece of fiction. This is a book you will want to keep in your home library and share with the entire reading community!"},{"Title":"Aspire to the Heavens. A Portrait of George Washington","review":"ASPIRE TO THE HEAVENS was first published in the late 1960's, well before Mary Higgins Clark's meteoric success as a author of mystery/thrillers. This biographical novel breathes life into the stick figure we know as George Washington. Portrayed as a kindly and responsible man with a welcome dash of humor, ASPIRE TO THE HEAVENS covers Washington's career from rash youth to an undaunted and vital old age. Interesting light is shown on Washington's hopeless love for the beautiful Sally Fairfax, wife of his best friend, also illuminated are his difficulties with his controlling virago of a mother. After rereading this underappreciated yet gleaming work of fiction, one can almost feel regret that Mary Higgins Clark did not continue in the field of historical literature, it is to be wondered what she might have done with figures like Jefferson and Adams. ASPIRE TO THE HEAVENS is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Aspire to the Heavens. A Portrait of George Washington","review":"If you are like me, you have often wondered how our most talented novelists would see important historical characters. Gore Vidal has whetted our appetite with his novels about the first hundred years of the United States. In Aspire to the Heavens, talented mystery writer Mary Higgins Clark makes George Washington come alive as a simple man with many personal challenges in his life. Although I was familiar with the material in this book, Ms. Clark did a wonderful job of both making it more interesting and accessible by making his life into a personally focused biographical novel. As a result, I got a lot of new perspectives on my own life that I will benefit from for many years to come.The book's title alludes to a promise that George Washington's mother asked for and received from him. She wanted him to always do his utmost. In her family, that had meant &quot;Aspire to the Heavens.&quot; He took on that promise with her encouragement. Out of his own character, though, he decided to be the most decent man he could possibly be. That latter promise to himself is the one that this book focuses on.The form of this book is to describe George Washington through the lens of his personal life, rather than his public accomplishments. The style reads more as though it is a novel rather than a biography, and there is certainly some literary license in the ascriptions of motives and personal thoughts. Yet, these devices work well as long as you remember not to take them too seriously and literally.Although Washington will always seem larger than life to all Americans, he was a man who had many setbacks in his own life. Before the Revolutionary War, he was certainly not considered to be the great man most now believe him to have been.Life was hard as a youngster. His father died when he was fairly young, and his mother carried a whip to help assert her authority over him and his siblings. She did not keep a very attractive household, which young George resented. Although she loved her son, she put him down verbally at every opportunity. Her opposition to his desire for an ocean-going career was a fortunate one for the United States and democracies everywhere, but a bitter disappointment to him at the time. George sought escape from her whenever possible, especially to the home of his half-brother at Mount Vernon (which he would eventually inherit and buy out from his sister-in-law).An early friendship with the Fairfax family led to a long relationship with the first and greatest love of Washington's life, Sally Fairfax, his proposal to her similar-appearing sister (which was refused), as well as his interest in surveying as a career.His mother constantly tried to discourage his military career, and complained bitterly about the risks he was taking during the colonial campaigns before the Revolutionary War. She blamed the early death of George's favorite half-brother on war-related illnesses.It is fun to read Martha Washington referred to by her pet name of &quot;Patsy&quot; throughout the book. You will also read here a sensitive interpretation of Washington's frustrations as a step-father and in securing Patsy's love and attention. As you may know, the story ends tragically as both step-children die at fairly young while, while the Washingtons never have children of their own. Their step-daughter asks them to adopt two of her children after her husband dies, whom the Washingtons' raise.The book's structure is an interesting one. The main historical thread is the aftermath of John Adams's inauguration and the Washingtons' trimphant return to Mount Vernon to farm. This development is interspaced with flashbacks of key moments in the lives of both George and Patsy.After you have finished enjoying the book, I suggest that you evaluate your own life from the perspective of how you will be remembered as a family member and as a friend. Many people focus too much on their careers and public accomplishments. This book can help you assess the balance you have achieved in your life. All of us can learn from how George Washington came to keep silent when something upset him rather than creating a fuss that would have hurt his closest relationships. He was a fine family man and friend, as a result, as well as an inspiring, steady leader.Show loving support for all those you care about . . . always!"},{"Title":"Aspire to the Heavens.

But, before his early and tragic death, he was able to write some of the most beautiful and gentle poetry about England, the countryside and his fears for the future under the shadow of war. He really is, I believe, one of the most neglected poets of that era and is definitely a find for any poetry lover to treasure."},{"Title":"Kamishibai Man","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. It's like walking through a museum in many ways -- and don't we parents feel great when we take our kids to a museum? We feel like it's worth the admission price to ensure our children know how to appreciate history, art, and beauty.In the introduction, Allen Say writes, \\"When I think of my childhood in Japan, I think of kamishibai. It means 'paper theater.' Every afternoon, the kamishibai man came on a bicycle that had a big wooden box mounted on the back seat. The box had drawers full of candies and a stage at the top. We bought candies and listened to the man's stories.\\"Say was born in Yokohama in 1937, into a very different Japan than what exists now. Back in the days where people didn't have televisions in their homes, children would eagerly anticipate listening to the kamishibai man's stories. \\"Clack! Clack!\\" He would beat his wooden blocks together until he'd drawn a crowd of listeners. His stories were cliffhangers, ending with \\"to be continued.\\" So the children would return the next day to hear what happened next.In this book, an old man who has retired to the countryside remembers his days of being a kamishibai man. \\"I've been thinking how much I miss going on my rounds,\\" he says to his elderly wife. So, she makes him some candies, and he rides his bike back into the city, humming along the way (until he reaches the urban metropolis). Much has changed. The trees and quiet parks have been replaced with concrete and buildings. \\"Who needs to buy so many things and eat so many different foods?\\" he wonders to himself.The cover of the book shows you what his theater looks like. (Oh, don't you love that picture?) He takes out his wooden blocks and clacks them together, just like in the old times. In his mind, he's seeing the happy faces of children running to him. Thus begins a story within a story, and Say changes his style of artwork to preserve the style of the kamishibai man's illustrated cards.He tells the story of what it was like for him when TVs came along and began to replace his job as entertainer. In a poignant scene, a little girl comes to her window and shushes him! You can see her siblings inside, sitting mesmerized in front of a television set. The sadness on the storyteller's face expresses the end of an era.But as the elderly man finishes his story, he looks up to see that he's surrounded by clapping middle-aged people, who remember him. \\"We grew up with your stories!\\" one of them shouts. They applaud him, and he's even filmed by a news station (which is ironic, isn't it?).The facial expressions in the artwork are stunning; you have to look at each picture carefully to notice all the exquisite details. I've watched my five-year-old stare and stare at these pictures. This would be a great addition to school libraries and classrooms -- teachers will love to read it out loud because it's captivating and full of dialogue.In the afterword, a Japanese folklore scholar explains more of the significance of Japan's post-war transition to an electric, affluent society. She writes, \\"The artists who had made their living in kamishibai turned to more lucrative pursuits, notably the creation of manga (comic books) and later anime [cartoons], but they never forgot their roots in kamishibai.\\"-- Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester for Mom 2 Mom Connection"},{"Title":"Kamishibai Man","review":"This story, set in old Japan, is that of a story teller (Kamishibai).

It brings me back to my childhood in Hong Kong, where we kids sat outdoor and enjoyed bowls of sweetened soybean gelatin dessert bought from the door-to-door vendor while lapping up our mothers' gossip and real-life tales. The affordability of refrigerator in each home pretty much replaced the vendor. I remember as a little girl, I too had gone by my window one day and shushed the old man for clacking his clappers and yelling to sell his goods.

And the story's mix of nostalgia and hope is touching. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Kamishibai Man","review":"This book enlightens kids and adults alike to the art of Kamishibai story telling. It would be wonderful to incorporate it into a class unit on Japan, or to read alone. Also, if one wants to learn about some of the lesser known history of Japan. The book further demonstrates the ubiquitous impact TV had on Japan (as well as the rest of the world) and how it nearly eradicated the Kamishibai method altogether. Yet, the gentleman in this story decides to go out one more time to one of his former spots and finds an audience of excited adults who have their fond memories of the Kamishibai Man rekindled.This book inspired me to purchase a Kamishibai stage and stories for my students. I read the book first, giving the kids background knowledge regard Kamishibai and how it compares (slightly) to the ice cream truck and how the kids in Japan would come running when the Kamishibai man was in their neighborhood. Afterward, I revealed that I have an actual Japanese Kamishibai stage (kept hidden during the story) to the ooooos and awwwwws of the students. Ending, of course, with \\"reading\\" a Kamishibai story.Great stuff."},{"Title":"Kamishibai Man","review":"Kamishibai men in were kind of like our ice cream truck drivers if they also told illustrated stories while they dished out popsicles.One day an elderly kamishibai man decided to dust off his bicycle and sets off to a large city with his pictures, candies, and - of course - stories.

But as be begins to spins his tales, he discovers that he's brought back a lot of fond memories among his former - now adult - customers.This is a really charming story, and of course because this is a Say title, the illustrations are magical.

I purchased it directly from the author sight-unseen. I was a new Sunday School teacher and trusted a family friend (the author) had written a book that would help me.My Sunday School student is 6 years old. I find the illustrations helpful: we photocopy them and he colors them in at the end of the hour-long Sunday School session.Having said that, I find the book to be over his head. I also wish it had stories I could read - summaries of the stories with fun details. Like comparison of Elija and Elisha. What makes them fun and interesting? Why would my student(s) want to learn about them?The book is 99% comprised of questions. Like, \\"What country did so-and-so leave his family with?\\" with a reference to where to find the answer in The Bible. \\"Who were the people thrown into the fiery furnace?\\" With a reference of where to find them. (I'm coming up with these off the top of my head: I am not quoting the book.) I do not find this sort of Bible-question stuff helpful.I was looking more for information and less for questions. I feel the intended audience (as far as Sunday School students go) is for a crowd who is older and able to look things up on their own. Able to understand how to use The Bible. How to read paragraphs from The Bible and understand them already.This is not written for young children.

As a cosmetics editor, I found most of the information on choosing and applying cosmetics to be a compilation of the best beauty tips I've come across over the years on the web, in magazines, other books, etc. While I disagree with a few of her tidbits (for example, she says not to 'blush' your chin and cheeks and I find that a little well-placed blusher adds a nice glow), she does have good advice for teens wanting to start wearing makeup and for shaping eyebrows, among other topics. I also find the color photos of her step-by-step makeup application more than a little scary-looking; I'm not sure if it's the lighting or what, but she looks much better on the book's cover.I found the chapters on skincare to be the most helpful, since I've learned that it's easier to learn makeup application than to learn how to take care of your skin correctly, and because skin care products seems to be the area in which most women fall for false claims and spend too much money. Her advice on BHAs and cleansers (combined with her recommendations in 'Don't Go') have resulted in improved skin for myself and my husband. I do think she needs to revise the section on skin types, as I don't fit into any of the categories she mentioned (her definition of combination skin is the typical 'oily t-zone, dry cheeks and jaw'; I have an oily jawline and cheeks and dry skin everywhere else)."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"Every woman should own this book, written by a consumer reporter who has nothing to gain from the cosmetics industry in response to her book. At least, nothing positive to gain from the field! She's had her share of nasty letters from cosmetic companies that want to sell women (and men) a lot of bunk based on sex appeal and fear of looking too old, too young, too wrinkled, having too many blemishes, not being sexy enough ... the list goes on! Paula offers knowledge that beauty does not come in a bottle. I love her advice on taking care of skin. I wish I had this book when I was in my teen years and I tortured my skin because of my acne. I've always had acne, even into my adult years, but listening to her advice has helped reduce breakouts. Her extensive research saves us all the trouble of trying to find out if the &quot;fad&quot; facial cures work -- I wouldn't have known about AHAs and BHAs without this book, and I certainly wouldn't know why and how to use them. She saves millions of women lots of money!"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"I was especially impressed with all the time Paula Begoun spends on adult acne-proned skin. I am forty years old with acne-proned skin, and I have tried every skin-care line out there, and spent hundreds of dollars, and nothing worked. Paula's book intellingently explains what causes acne, and the best products to use to treat it. It turns out the best products DON'T cost a small fortune, they're just simple (sometimes surprising!) products you can buy at any drugstore, NOT expensive department stores. The result has been a dramatic improvement in my skin. My acne has cleared up, and the overall texture of my skin is beautiful. The only drawback to the book is it can get a bit complicated &amp; disjointed. I found I had to go back and read a few sections over a few times, and even took notes as I went along. But I found it to be worth the effort. Paula's done her homework, and has been good enough to pass her knowledge on to the public."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"Finally, a book about beauty that presumes women are halfway intelligent. Paula Begoun is not a model. She's not hawking a make-up line. She just gives you the facts about ingredients -- what works, what's hype. Read this book and you'll save your money and your skin. (The hint about using baking soda and Cetaphil to exfoliate, followed by hydrogen peroxide as a toner is worth the price of the book.)"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"Some reviewers have mentioned that this book is just a rehash of Paula's other book, _Blue Eyeshadow Should be Illegal_. That is somewhat true because technically _The Beauty Bible_ is a revised/updated version of that book, just with a new name. The name change reflects the fact that, in addition to having information on cosmetics and skin care for the face, it has information on body care as well. So if you already have _Blue Eyeshadow_ you may not be interested in this book, since large parts of _The Beauty Bible_ are similar to it.That said, I think this is a wonderful book. Paula explains why fashion magazines will never give an honest critique of beauty products (they can't say anything negative and risk angering the cosmetics companies who advertise in their pages). She explains how most moisturizers are the same, and how any claims that they can lift, firm, or tone the skin are a bunch of BS. She explains why so-called &quot;botanicals&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; products have no special benefits for the skin and are only used as a marketing strategy to make products seem more interesting or glamorous. (By the time the &quot;natural&quot; elements are extracted and bottled, there is hardly anything &quot;natural&quot; left in them.) She explains how toners/astringents and most products that supposedly help acne contain extremely irritating ingredients that can make your pimples worse. She also includes a lot of information on skincare and makeup application. I didn't always agree with her opinions about makeup, but it's still refreshing to see someone willing to speak out against the downright dishonest claims made by cosmetics companies, and to educate us consumers. Every woman who uses cosmetics or skincare products should read this book, as well as _Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me_. These two books will pay for themselves when they save you time and money. You'll learn to be a smart consumer and see right through the marketing hype and ridiculous claims that the cosmetics companies would have you believe."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"I'm a woman about to turn 30 and I am suddenly worried about my skin, wearing makeup, etc. Being completely ignorant about these matters I decided to pick up a book on it.While the title &quot;Beauty Bible&quot; is a bit misleading, it is jam-packed with well-written information focused mainly on skin care, followed by makeup. This won't tell you anything about exercise, healthy diet, etc. which are also essential components of beauty. It will dispel so many skincare myths and point you in the right direction. I am really enjoying reading it.For those of you who love reading exposes on various industries, this is an excellent book on how the cosmetics industry separates women from their money! You will be innoculated to all the hype the cosmetics companies throw at you.Of course I have to point out that Paula puts herself in that place (taking your money) - if you go to her website you can buy her skincare and makeup products (among other things) and a subscription to her newsletter. However if anyone's going to make money off of me, it might as well be a well-meaning businesswoman on her crusade for cosmetic truth, and not a heartless corporation that bases its products on marketing instead of effectiveness."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"Thanks to this book I will never again fall for the sales pitch (&quot;even oily skin needs moisturiser&quot;) or marketing strategy (&quot;developed by such and such famous doctor/dermatologist/scientist&quot;) skin care companies use. All I can say is I wish I bought this book sooner - it is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"Yes, it is true that there's no such thing as a miracle beauty product, and there's just no point on wasting your money in slick, pretty-packaged stuff that claims to be the solution to any problem you have. I only wish someone had told me that before. Anyway, better late than never. I found Ms. Begoun's advice most useful, although she focuses a bit too much on the age 40 plus group. The research she has made in beauty products is very thorough and informative, although the colors she recommends are a bit too drab for my taste, but then, I'm nineteen, so I can still get away with green nail polish and body glitter now and then. Thank you Paula, for helping me save my hard-earned bucks instead of throwing them away in hope-in-a-bottle scams."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"The Beauty Bible is the first book I've come across that explains skin types in more than just the usual 'oily, dry, combo, acne-prone' categories. Begoun gives straightforward, in-depth advice on sun protection, skincare routines to combat acne, hydroxy acids and much more. Her smart advice will save consumers money and her skincare plan can be used by women of just about every skin type you can imagine. The makeup application instructions are the most detailed I've ever seen. She even touches on subjects such as teens and makeup, cosmetic surgery and permanent makeup, all with a common-sense attitude."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"I just finished (and LOVED) Paula's other book, Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me, and this book is just as awesome. The Beauty Bible gives you all the basics that you need to know to take good care of your skin and create a natural look with your makeup. Some of her advice is just common sense but Paula's language is fun to read and easy to follow. She gives sensible, understandable answers to all kinds of skin care and makeup questions. I learned more from this book than any other beauty book I've ever purchased."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"I've bought other beauty books, but never have I read a book from beginning to end and actually felt that I learned something valuable. It's quite the eye opener!..It encompases the best beauty tips I've come across. She gives sensible, understandable answers to all kinds of skin care and makeup questions. Although, I've read some of the other reviews which have not been so great, I beleive this book would help the average user understand thier skin and actually walk up to a beauty counter and not believe the hype or the recommendations of a salesperson! but actually decipher whether or not this product or skin care line will actually help his/her individual skin problem.I do have to say, its a bit confusing, when describing the different skin types, so you have to read it a couple of times and kind of put together your own routine, In my case I breakout on my chin and yet its dry, My nose is slightly oily, but my forehead is slightly dry - then again it could be the products I've been using - this is where Paula Beguoun books come into play!.. I've already order her other book &quot;don't go to the cosmetics counter without me - hopefully is as good as this one!"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"The Beauty Bible is the first book I've come across that explains skin types in more than just the usual 'oily, dry, combo, acne-prone' categories.

Paula Begoun does little more than critcize popular beliefs, many times not bothering to say why they are wrong or what a person might do instead. Her &quot;glossary&quot; of beauty ingredients is also not helpful (she lists many essential oils simply as &quot;irritants&quot;). Her makeup tips are not helpful for anyone under the age of 40 (Ms. Begoun says that no one should wear any colors except shades of black, brown and grey as eyeshadow -- younger people can wear almost any color successfully if applied with artistry.) Before you buy this book, take a look at the scary makeup she's wearing -- there's a color insert -- do you really want to take makeup advice from this woman?Overall, her tone is bossy and self-righteous. She contradicts herself constantly by telling the reader that certain products are bad, then she recommends them!

This is a good one, particularly for young women and teens just beginning to experience the wonderful joy of using and experimenting with makeup.Paula's chapters on makeup application and making the right color choices are superb.

This book is for people who are scared to death of growing old, feeling &quot;ugly&quot;, and who give in to our current standard of &quot;beauty&quot; by the media's definition. Her chapter on makeup begins with how we feel valued as humans if we look good. If that's the case, get counseling, not makeup. Although I agree with the author's insistance on diligent sunscreen use and her statements about the beauty industry luring us in with false claims, I'm somewhat dismayed by her take on what's &quot;good&quot; for the skin, and what's &quot;bad&quot;. Using her own personal OPINION, she claims that aromatherapy oils are irritants (neglecting to mention the scientifically proven therapeutic effects of essential oils, and writing them off as simply &quot;fragrance&quot;), yet raves about Accutane, a damaging, extremely harmful substance. Yes, it may clear up your skin, but at what price to the inside of your body? Her step-by-step makeup application is scary at best. If you look like a completely different person after makeup application,(as the author does)then you've applied far too much. I'm also dismayed to find absolutely no mention whatsoever of the effects of nutrition, exercise, and water consumption on the skin. Any basic anatomy course will teach you that the skin is the largest organ of the body, and shows the effects of a poor lifestyle. No, eating french fries will not result in automatic blemishes, but over time a diet lacking in essential nutrients and plenty of water/exercise/rest will lead to bad skin. Last but in no way least is Paula's pathetic attempt to justify animal cruelty. She's supposedly against animal testing for cosmetic purposes, yet &quot;if it's humane then it's ok&quot;. There is absolutely nothing humane about animal testing whether they are euthanized or not! Get with the times Paula. There are far too many inexpensive, safe, cruelty free products out there that do the trick. Don't waste your money on this supposed &quot;bible&quot;."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"Friends told me to a buy a book called the beauty bible,they actually meant the one by sarah stacey and I bought the one by paula by mistake.However it turned out to be one of the best mistakes I've ever made.It certainly has made my skin look better (and my pocket too). the only disappointing factor was that the subject of hair care was completely ignored.One expects a beauty BIBLE to cover all the aspects of beauty."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"I have read this book that is far from being a &quot;bible&quot;. All this book does is critize products and product lines. Than the author appears to contradict herself saying not to use a product in one chapter and than in another chapter says to use it. I very much disagree that all extracts are skin irritants and that they are unnecessary because this is how it all began, franksense and myrh, right. I am an esthetican and I do know that in this field people are going to have many different opinions but lets also remember that no ones skin is exactly alike. This book is very negative and misleading, definitely not a beauty bible."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"I have this book and two others of Paula's and highly recommend them. I have learned so much about skin care and saving money! I won't buy cosmetics or skin care without checking her book &quot;Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me&quot;. The Beauty Bible has excellent skin care advice. My cystic acne is now gone thanks to her advice and products! Thank you Ms. Begoun for the excellent information!!"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"My skin changed for the better within 2 weeks after following this author's advice. I trust her advice since she has a biology and chemistry background and has been makeup artist for years. I am a nurse and I appreciate her scientific information. Her guidelines are specific and easy to follow. I now see women on TV and easily recognize obvious make-up mistakes or well done make-up. She backs up her information with good explanations. I am confident when I purchase products from the counters and feel I can safely discern between good and bad advice about my face."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"While I learned a few things from Paula's other books, this one seems like a reorganization of her previous material into new chapters under new titles. For someone who is out to save us money, why is she selling yet another book with all the same information?"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"I found the information in this book to be a repeat of her other books. I even found what was in this book to be repetetive - it could have been half the size. I found I was reading the same thing over and over and over. If you've never read any of her other books, then this is a good read. Has some helpful information (even if it is beaten to death). I found Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me to be much more useful and it contains most of the same information, making The Beauty Bible a bit redundant."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"I have all of Paula's other books, and am very satisfied with them. However, this book contains much of the information in the previous books. And if you get her newsletter, like I do, then you already know pretty much everything in here. Feels like a rehash to me. I read it cover to cover and learned really nothing I didn't know already. Still, if you don't have her other books, and you don't need specific cosmetic reviews (i.e., how does the Lancome blush compare with MAC's) then definitely get this book."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"If you have read Paula Begoun's other books, then you will recognize a lot of the material in this book. The information she gives is sensible and well explained. It is easy to read and covers everything from sun protection to acne to skin care. Her tone can get very bossy at times, and if that does not put you off, then this book is a find."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"A book that has the least influence from the cosmetic companies. If you're a man whose girlfriend/wife is spending your $$ on cosmetic products, or you think she is spending too much on those products (regardless whose money she's spending), buy this book for her. If you're a guy/man who find yourself having few things to talk about with girls and women, read this book, discuss it with them, and ask them question if you have any (although I doubt that would happen). You'll be surprised! If you're a person who have skin problems and want some really truthful, objective advices, this is the book you should go for. If you're a person who buy products from any of the cosmetic companies in the world, read this book and know how things really work!! Looking for a present to give your girlfriend a smile? Do I still have to say it? Nonetheless, Asian women should NOT follow the instructions for applying makeup due to different face features. In addition, I personally don't agree with Paula's blue-shadow-should-be-banned idea because, for example, light baby blue goes really well on Asian women's faces."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"Paula Begoun does give some good advice on products in this book. However, I must disagree in her assessment of what makeup colors a woman should and shouldn't wear. I don't believe that EVERYONE should stick to neutral shades and avoid blues and greens or other &quot;unnatural&quot; colors anywhere in their makeup. She adds this well intentioned but horrific photo spread of herself, showing how to put on makeup. The demonstration only helps to make her look muddy, flat and uninteresting. The excellent classic &quot;Color Me Beautiful&quot; by Carole Jackson is a better choice for makeup colors. Go for the rest of her advice but skip the color recommendations."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"I have to agree with one of the other reviews--this is basically her other books but without as much editing--the book is VERY repetitive, to the point where it's hard to read more than a couple pages at a time. I do believe the book could be summed up in a few sentences and the remaining hundreds of pages are just reiterations and examples. I didn't find anything new (and therefore useful) in the book at all. It's rather boring."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: From Acne to Wrinkles and Everything in Between","review":"I have read it and I think it's good but not really worth 20 $ in my case because the level of my skin care knowledge is higher , there was nothing in this book that I did not know already. I wish I could have read it when I was 15 , in that case it would have saved me from making a lot of mistakes.So, I highly recommended for people that want to know more about skin care."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Carolina Coasts : Haunted Lighthouses, Plantations, and other Other Sites","review":"My favorite stories were Body in a Barrel, Presence at Hampton Plantation, and the Keeper's Daughter. The author did a fine job of including details regarding her investigations--right down to microfilm, newspaper clippings, parapsycologists, professional ghost hunters, detectives, eyewitness sightings, etc. My twelve year old son even loved it. He showed it to his teacher and she read some of the stories to the class!"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Carolina Coasts : Haunted Lighthouses, Plantations, and other Other Sites","review":"This is a good collection of tales, some about ghosts, others just folklore. It is intelligently but simply written and allows for easy reading. Some of the tales do not give an exact location and most do not become too elaborate. Great book for a teenager interested in folklore. Will provide enjoyable, quick reading for adults interested in the subject that want an easy read."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Carolina Coasts : Haunted Lighthouses, Plantations, and other Other Sites","review":"I've lived in South Carolina most of my life and never heard many of these stories. I love 'Sunset Lodge' and 'Murder at Cape Romain'! Great accompanying photos and sketches."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Carolina Coasts : Haunted Lighthouses, Plantations, and other Other Sites","review":"Ghosts of the Carolina Coasts is just what it said it is on the cover - stories about haunted lighthouses, haunted plantations, haunted historic sites, people who went missing, mysteries and other unknowns. But at just over 150 pages there is very little meat on the bones. It took me only a few hours to read and each story is nothing but a simple story - no details, just the simple facts that take up two or three pages."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Carolina Coasts : Haunted Lighthouses, Plantations, and other Other Sites","review":"I was disappointed in this book! The writer simply failed to interest me with her tales. The stories, which were only about a page or two each, seemed to be written more for a child rather than an adult; they were too short and lacking in detail. I read a few of the stories and then tossed the book aside. My greatest regret was that I'd paid nearly 10 bucks for this book. There are many other much better true ghost story books out there. If you're looking for some truly chilling tales, start with Haunted Heartland, Historic Haunted America, or USA Weekend's, I Never Believed in Ghosts Until..."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Carolina Coasts : Haunted Lighthouses, Plantations, and other Other Sites","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone, young or old, who loves a good ghost story, especially when it's told so well by a native Carolinian who has obviously spent many years researching and collecting her own favorite tales and who delights in sharing them with us. Some of her stories give you chills, some touch your heart and others make you think, late at night,\\"Something really is out there!!\\".For more intriguing tales also don't miss Terrance Zepke's \\"The Best Ghost Tales of North Carolina\\" and \\"Best Ghost Tales of South Carolina\\", which include not only marvelous regional ghost tales, but also explicit directions to the actual ghost-sighting sites; stories from the winners of her \\"Ghost Watch\\" contest and even detailed and fascinating instructions for conducting your own ghost hunt!Perhaps we could cast a spell on Ms. Zepke to keep her searching for more enticing ghost tales to share with us in the near future. She is definitely the best!"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Carolina Coasts : Haunted Lighthouses, Plantations, and other Other Sites","review":"It is far easier I suppose to write a book that is mostly about the legends of a particular area than to do the exhaustive work involved in trying to talk to witnesses. The best ghost books are quite frankly the ones where the author has spent hours and hours talking to people who have claimed to have had a ghostly encounter. These are the stories that send a chill up your spine because if it happened to these people it could happen to you. In this book there are a few of these stories, but not many. Most are legends that contain phrases like, &quot;since that time people have reported,&quot; or, &quot;shortly after that people started to.&quot; In short, most of the stories in this book are not overly convincing. There are also numerous historical errors to be found in this book but then most people who buy this book are looking for ghosts, not history.On the other hand, Ms. Zepke has a very nice writing style and the book is an easy read. With just a little more legwork she could turn out some really excellent ghost books. Her chapter about Alice Flagg is a superbly told story and includes stories from current day ghost hunters. Still, while the back cover warns the reader to, &quot;Prepare to Be Scared!&quot; there is very little here to scare anyone. There are even a few chapters that mention no ghost at all."},{"Title":"Structural geology of folded rocks (Rand McNally geology series)","review":"Although this 1966 book is outdated in that it doesn't address recent advances in the science, it was and still is a useful reference. Whitten wrote or edited several volumns that were essentially a summary of knowledge to that point in time. This book serves that purpose well. Anyone seriously interested in structural geology will probably find that a copy of this book is worth the price - especially at the \\"give away\\" prices for which it can be purchased today."},{"Title":"Matthew (Believers Church Bible Commentary)","review":"Ever since Dr. Gardner's doctoral dissertation on the Gospel of Matthew many years ago, he has been living out the Matthean text. This book is my primary resource for preaching, for devotions and for study. A particular feature of this series is that not only is a section dealing with how the text intereacted with the original hearers, but how the text has been dealt with in the life of the Church. This gives life to the text, and reflects the words as the Living Word. Dr. Roop engages the text with enthuiasm and brings life to often obscure portions."},{"Title":"Matthew (Believers Church Bible Commentary)","review":"From the back of the book:The author invites readers to explore the dramatic story of Jesus which Matthew tells. He connects that story to the first-century world of its author and early readers. The commentary then shows how Matthew has shaped the church and still speaks to the life of the Christian community. Much of this presentation of Matthew was developed and tested in Christian education settings. The book helps readers wrestle with Jesus' gospel and mission, starting small, but for all nations."},{"Title":"Bad Dog, Andy: A Parody","review":"Who would think that Elvira, Mistress of the Dark would write a children's book that you'd want to have in your home? Not me! But this book is awesome! That's right - Cassandra Peterson, one of the co-authors, is better known as Elvira.Co-author John Paragon has a pet Dalmatian named Andy, who was no doubt the driving force of inspiration for this hilarious book of few words, but non-stop laughs.Cathy Pavia's illustrations are to die for! Andy's expressions are priceless and if you've ever had a dog be naughty, you will understand everything that is going on.Andy's owner is going out to the grocery store and tells Andy to watch the house - but there is a naughty glint in Andy's eye. After the door shuts, Andy runs to the window to make sure the coast is clear, leaving a big nose smear on the glass.Andy has a brief \\"Risky Business\\" moment as he rifles through his master's dresser and dons his briefs and shades and slides into the livingroom. Andy gets into the garbage, smokes a cigar, pukes on the rug, has a female poodle come over to play and generally wreaks havok in the house.When he hears his daddy coming home, he has to clean up - and quick. If only real dogs cleaned the house!As Andy tears up his home - we can see photos of dogs, especially one of Andy on Santa's lap. We see statues of dogs, an Andy Warhol print on the wall (one would guess Andy is named after the artist - his hair is the same color, anyway!) and other clear homage to life with dogs.Life with dogs can be so rewarding and life with a Dalmatian is not for the faint of heart - but not without its own set of rewards. The authors clearly appreciate the fun spirit of dogs more than they disdain their naughty antics. A hoot for children and adults."},{"Title":"Bad Dog, Andy: A Parody","review":"Cathy Pavia's inspired illustrations keep us coming back and finding more of Andy's bad deeds! When is she coming out with her next book? Is she in line for a Caldecott?"},{"Title":"Bad Dog, Andy: A Parody","review":"Have all the &quot;Carl&quot; books and HAD to buy &quot;Bad Dog Andy&quot; to round out the collection."},{"Title":"Sun Dancer's Passion (Sweet Medicine's Prophecy)","review":"HE-WALKS-THE-MOUNTAIN saw more in his lifetime than the change of seasons. He saw the arrival of the gun, the horse, the buffalo. He watched his tribe change from peace-loving farmers to savage hunters. And he remembered how Sweet Medicine, the beloved prophet had predicted that SUN DANCER would become a legend in her time. Even as a child his daughter was special...bright, beautiful, breath-taking. And as she grew, an aura of magnificence surrounded her -- an enchanting, spell-binding radiance. She shunned all the braves who wanted her, waiting for the one she truly loved -- STALKING HORSE who was the strongest and most desirable of the tribe. From the time they were children, they shared everything...laughter, love, loyalty. But innocence gave way to passion ... and betrayal. Would their relationship ever survive the ultimate sin?"},{"Title":"Sun Dancer's Passion (Sweet Medicine's Prophecy)","review":"I first read the Sweet Medicines Prophecy books over 15 years ago. Loved each and every book in the series. If you are a fan of Native American historical fiction you will greatly enjoy these books. The setting and characters are so well developed that you will be transported to another time and place. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Sun Dancer's Passion (Sweet Medicine's Prophecy)","review":"Read this one first and was hooked from there. I just found out there are more but out of print. Going to go for it, can't wait to get started all over again."},{"Title":"Timber Pole Construction: An Introduction","review":"I served some time as a Collection Development Bibliographer for Agriculture at a university library prior to my retirement. Most of the time this amounted to suggesting worthy library materials to support the university's's ever-changing curriculum. Other times I received related reference questions regarding a variety of things. And not a few of these questions regarded the cheapest and most effective way to build both barns and outbuildings. From the early 1970s to the 1990s I continued to search and came up with the same conclusion. Timber pole construction remained the best choice. Some books presented it in a straight forward manner; others featured an array of joinery that only an Einstein could follow. But none of them had done it as well as this book on hand.In keeping with the best in Intermediate Technology principles, the use of what you have on hand to accomplish the purpose, the authors provide diagrams and related text from cutting and preparing lumber to getting the job done. The best parts of this book are the basic methods of joinery, the use of wire, bolts and iron and basic pole construction methods from foundation construction to protect the pole for bean and roof construction. Some woodworking fanatics will respond that the resulting building may not look &quot;pretty,&quot; or the book's presentation is too &quot;simple.&quot; My only response to such people is that the authors' purpose was to present the most economical ways to get the job done. And to heck with aesthetics!Included as well is a presentation on the use of pole construction for fences, retaining walls and bridges. There is a also a concluding presentation of low housing and buildings in Sri Lanka, a Malawi school building as well as a Zimbabwe pole roof being part of a rammed earth structure. The appendix is a chronological listing of library materials for further research."},{"Title":"Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases","review":"A study and conceptual analysis of the key aspects strategic management, strategic planning, corporate strategy, business scope, model building, marketing and sales. Contains topics on concept of strategy and strategic planning, corporate strategy, business policy and strategy, investment evaluation and strategy, business scope, model building, framework for strategy, organization for corporate planning and marketing strategy among others."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"Richard Overy offers his readers a fresh, well researched perspective on the characteristics of Hitler and Stalin's regimes. The comparative method employed by Overy makes it comprehensible and accessible to the average reader. You do not need to be an expert to enjoy this book, but once you complete it you will feel as though you have advanced your understanding of these two dictators significantly.Overy cuts right to the facts in this book. You will not catch this author speculating on the sexual inclinations, intrapersonal relationships, or drug habits of either Hitler or Stalin. Instead, this author chooses to examine the methods by which these two men came to power, their ideology, economic policies, military initiatives, and manipulation of justice. Overy is concise and fair in his representation of the dictators. You never feel as though this author is telling you to what to think. Overy gives his reader all of the facts and leaves the rest open to interpretation.Overall this book was highly enjoyable. I've read many books that focus solely upon the personal characteristics of Hitler and Stalin. It was quite refreshing to finally learn more about the institutions that supported them."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"This book, while too scholarly for some readers, is comprehensive and informative.I was especially interested in his description of the shift from pre-Nazi legal theory to Nazi theory. Likewise, the discussion of the formation of Communist legal [sic] theory to replace Tzarist law was also interesting. I was especially taken with the idea of \\"analogy\\" being used in the law. Thus, a woman in the USSR was accused of murder. Her defense was that she was not even in the city at the time of the murder. Yet, the prosecution noted that since she shared the same ideas as the murderers, she was deserving of being called a murderer. I see this thinking being introduced gradually into American thinking. Since the murder of Matthew Shepherd in Wyoming was a heinous act, then somehow pastors and others who oppose gay marriage are somehow complicit or guilty. Or, the Napolitano report suggesting the danger of domestic terrorism from returning vets referring back to the Timothy McVeigh bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City. This is a type of thinking all of us have to be careful about, but truthfully I see it being applied more by the left-wing in America than by the right.Also, I highly recommend the chapter on the moral universe of the dictators (Stalin and Hitler). One may wonder as I often have how the monsters of the USSR and Nazi Germany could sleep at night or get through a day without the merciless pangs of torment that a person with a conscience might feel. Their ability to function probably indicates that their consciences were seared or hardened to a point of total deadness. Additionally, this chapter shows the strange reversals, inversions, and theoretical or ideological gymnastics that enabled them to justify their immorality. They were working from a wholly different concept of morality. One thinks of F. Nietzsche's transvaluation of values where they consciously and with zealous determination tried to re-write the eternal values inherited from Greece, Rome, the Hebrew Scriptures, and Christianity to construct a new anti-morality morality, where, to use Nietzsche's terminology, good is bad and bad is good. It's a very interesting discussion, and someone who is politically informed may see some similar \\"innovations\\" being presented by various parties in the American political arena."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"Economic history is a tough slog for me, and this book was no exception to that, but Overy does make an interesting argument about the role economic development played in both Stalin's regime and the Third Reich. Honestly, though, I think you have to be an economic historian to really get in to this book. As a social historian, this one was a tough go."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"I found this book to be a good comparison between the internal structures of two societies that both careened off the road of civilization at about the same time. The author does seem to give too much credit to the formal, but unobserved, laws on the books in the Soviet experiment when comparing the two dictatorships. However, his chapter on the economic structure of both regimes helped me understand this aspect of Hitler's rule.After a describing the worst of the camps, I think the word \\"evil\\" might have emerged from Professor Overy as one possible explanation of what occured."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"Overy makes the controversial thesis that Hitler's regime was more revolutionary than Stalin's Russia. Overy claims that the Nazi party began to take over areas of the German economy while Stalin after the nineteen thirties left the economy in the hands of economist and engineers. Also during the war years the Nazi party was taking over control of military operations, but Stalin was ceding control to his generals. The Gestapo was not constrained by any law while the Soviet NKVD in the early forties was scrutinize by some judicial oversight. Finallly the Nazis eliminated ethinic groups based on their race and the Soviets judged other ethinic groups based on their loyalty to the Soviet state. The main weakness of Overy's book is that he skims over Stalin's collectivization drive and how it resulted in the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens through stravation and repression. Despite this weakness, I would reccomend this book for anyone ineterested in a comparason of these two regimes."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"In recent times libertarians following Hayek have suggested that the regimes of Hitler and Stalin were two sides of the same coin. Overy who has written a very good book on the reason why the allies won the Second World War examines the two regimes.One of the more interesting chapters is that dealing with the two economic systems. In some respects there were significant similarities. In the 30's both systems achieved amazing growth figures. The Soviet by around 100% the German by some 50%. In both economies growth was fuelled by massive investment by depressing living standards. In Russia the collectivisation policy allowed for the siphoning of farm income to fund machine imports. In Germany wages were regulated and kept at depression levels. The Soviet system allowed some private enterprise to flourish mainly in small plots and the German system had large state enterprises developing synthetic rubber and oil.Many other aspects of the regimes were similar, the control of culture, the idealisation of the leader the means of repression. However there were also significant differences. Hitler believed in a sort of racial mercantilism where the key to prosperity of society was the geographic size of the country. To achieve wealth a country must have an empire. That empire was to be administered by those of the \\"German\\" race who operated a slave type system in the conquered territories. Inferior races were to be serfs denied education and citizenship. No one of course was going to voluntarily be part of that empire so that one had to have a strong army. In fact the key role of the government, in the Nazi State was to provide that army so that the country could achieve territorial expansion and safeguard the destiny of the race.The Soviet system although having the same concentration camps, the same elements of repression was more a child of the enlightenment. Historically Russia had been a country that had celebrated the role of the \\"Russian People\\" in the development of the Czarist empire. Under the communists the country was not even known as Russia but the more abstract Union of Socialist Soviets. Broadly it was a repellent system but not a racist one. This meant that during the crisis of the Second World War it was better able to mobilise its resources and win. The Germans by their policy of racial exclusivity limited the potential size of their armies and were appalling at using the resources of their conquests."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"If one wanted to do a comparative history of Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, then Richard Overy would not be the worst choice. He is one of the leading historians of the Nazi dictatorship, with his books on the air war, Goering and why the Allies lost. By contrast, his reading skills in Russian are limited, and his archival sources are non-existent, but he keeps a close eye on the scholarly literature. What Overy has done is not write a comparative biography of the two men, but a comparative history of their two regimes. He starts off by looking at the two dictators, and the circumstances in which they won power. Then he discusses the way they ruled things, their utopianism and their attacks on religion. He then looks at official culture, how they organized their economy, how they organized their armies, the way they fought their wars, their policies on nationalities and the regime of their camps.The result is a hugely informative book that provides the latest research on a whole host of topics, and presents a complex view of many issues. Like many recent scholars he emphasizes the way consent, not coercion, undergirded the regimes. He points out that the Gestapo had only 20,000 people to watch over all of Germany, including the secretaries, while once one removed the staff and the border guards the NKVD only had 20,000 people to look over the USSR. Whether it is the Nazi campaign against the Gypsies (not as genocidal as the Holocaust), or the way each side treated the prisoners of war from the others (the Soviets come out better here), whether it is the hierarchies of the concentration camps, or the assassination attempts against Hitler, or the Communists' strategy against the Orthodox Church, on topic after topic we have a thorough, complex and well-researched discussion of the issue. Overy also provides many striking details. When Hitler came to power he promoted the judge who gave him an extremely lenient sentence for his role in the Beer Hall Putsch. Stalin loved hunting, Hitler hated it. For all of Hitler's Wagnerian aura, his favorite opera was actually \\"the Merry Widow\\". At the height of the German Eastern Advance, the Soviet Union could only call upon 23% of the coal output and 28% of the iron output of The Third Reich. More members of the German Communist Politburo were killed by Stalin than by Hitler. For their many minorities the Soviet Union offered 92 alphabets in 125 languages, and for the centenary of Pushkin, produced 27 million copies in 66 languages.Although he is critical of the totalitarian interpretation, Overy tends to emphasize the similarities of the regimes. The dictators themselves, he notes early on, had very different personalities with the empty Hitler who lived only for mass charisma contrasting with the more gregarious Stalin who slowly mastered the party and had to work to achieve his cult. The Nazi Party was more influential, and oddly more lawless, with Stalin's Russia too big and rural and illiterate to achieve the same kind of depth. But both regimes shared a similar utopianism, and a similar hostility to religion, capitalism and intellectual freedom. Of course, Overy points out that while Stalin was willing to use war as a tool, he was fundamentally defensive. There is no question here that the Soviet Union was the victim of an aggressive attack. There is also no question that the Soviet Union, with help from lend-lease, managed an amazing mobilization of its economy, in contrast to the Nazis who could not do so until it was too late. Nazi racism was genuinely genocidal, while the Soviet Union genuinely believed in the diversity of its people, though that did not save it from outbreaks of xenophobic paranoia. In the world of concentration camps, 40% of the Nazi's prisoners died, while about 15% of the Gulag's did. But then most of the Gulag's victims were not political prisoners. (In the Nazi extermination camps, of course, everyone was supposed to die, and at Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor more than 99.9% of them did).There are some criticisms one can make. Much of the case on Hitler's \\"anti-capitalism\\" is based on his rhetoric, or on gestures like the mass wearing of uniforms. (David Cesarani's new biography of Eichmann suggests he was not the low-class beneficiary of Nazi social mobility that Overy suggests.) Overy also relies of Herman Rauschning, a source Ian Kershaw's biography was much more skeptical of, while Richard Steigmann-Gall has pointed out that Hitler's Table Talk, which Overy cites to demonstrates Hitler's hostility to Christianity, has been mistranslated in key places. The conclusion is somewhat mediocre. Science is blamed, while Overy says the two dictators were united by illiberalism, a hostility to the \\"liberal idea of progress\\" and a hostility to diversity. But both regimes supported some sort of progress, and the Soviet Union supported a diversity of cultures certainly as liberal as its predecessors or successors. An emphasis on ideology as a cause overlooks the fact that one reason why the Bolsheviks were so dogmatic, cruel and intolerant was because there was so little purchase under Tsarism, the first World War and the Russian civil war for open-mindedness, charity and mercy. By contrast, nothing in Germany's 20th century experience explains Nazi anti-semitism. Nevertheless, this is the leading book on the similarites and differences of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"Overy is more than a scholar; he is a deep thinker. There is a world of difference. \\"The Dictators\\" is a seminal work comparing how the two greatest dictators of all time exercised control over their political, economic, and military systems all while laying out the implications of this control.It is the painstaking comparison, often paragraph-by-paragraph, that gives this work its magisterial quality. But what really makes \\"The Dictators\\" work is how it builds on Overy's previous work, \\"Why the Allies Won,\\" which assumed that the Allied victory was not a forgone conclusion in 1940 and asked, and answered, probing questions about comparative command structures, production economies, and capital sources.Without this base, Overy's latest could have become just another book on Hitler and Stalin. And a boring one at that. With it, however, we get insights unavailable elsewhere. Having studied Marxism, Leninism, and the Soviet Union for forty years, I was deeply impressed.The next step in this line of scholarship is to put it in the context of falling information costs. Wealth is created when increasing amounts of ever cheaper information can be substituted for other resources like land, labor, and capital. \\"The Dictators\\" describes how Hitler and Stalin did the opposite, systematically lowering the cost of information or themselves and raising it for everyone else.Following Overy's reasoning in \\"Why the Allies Won\\" the question is, absenting world war, was the Dictator system sustainable? If so, for how long? This question is critical to understanding the future of China as it tries to contain falling information costs and keep some semblance of Party leadership. And critical to us in trying to manage our relationship with China. Next book Mr. Overy?Editing: Five Stars. Comparing two systems across so many functions page-by-page and often paragraph-by paragraph can quickly become unwieldy and most would advise strongly against it. Better to keep each leader to his own chapter. But Overy carries this off and his editor wisely let him proceed.Copy Editing: Five Stars"},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"The Dictators, of course, porvided a lot of information about Stalin and Hitler, but one thing was prevailant throughout the book: numbers. The facts Richard Overy presented to the reader left little to be doubted about his thesis, but also it was hard to understand them (and it blocked the flow). I rate this 4 stars because although my criticisms may be harsh, it taught me much about Hitler and Stalin, it will serve as a good reference book, and I may want to reread it when I have a fuller understanding of the two Dictators. (This is coming from a 10th Grade history enthusiast)"},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"Richard Overy's \\"The Dictators, Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia\\" is a wonderful look at two of the most repressive regimes in history and the men who led them. Overy compares how both men maneuvered their way into power in their respective nations. The 'Utopia' both men sought is considered heavily throughout this work- the 'Racial State' for Hitler and the 'Classless State' for Stalin.Overy's comparison of the men of course addresses the events that led to their epic showdown in World War II, and this makes for some of the work's most fascinating chapters. For instance, Overy presents the growing arms race between Germany and the USSR in the 1930s as the natural precursor to the Cold War arms race between the USSR and the United States. The relationships between both dictators and their military leaderships is also very illuminating as both men considered themselves quite adept at military affairs after their service in WWI and the Russian Civil War, respectively.This comparative study of the two regimes is must reading for students of modern European History and stands along side Robert Gellately's \\"Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe\\" as one of the great works on the subject."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"I have seen some criticism of this book, including from professional historians, but I don't see it. I found this to be an absorbing and fascinating look at both Hitler & Stalin, as the author cuts back and forth between their careers. The compare and contrast method really works quite well, and this book also gives Overy a chance to re-look at some of his work on Nazi Germany & Soviet Russia, after Soviet archives were coming available. I think this is a great work of history by a major historian- one who has proved his knowledge of a wide range of WWII matters. Not for the dilletante- its quite long, but for the serious WWII reader its a rewarding experience."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"This book is essential reading for the serious student of 20th century history, or for novices who simply want to understand the monstrous regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Overy tends to focus on the similarities of the regimes to really find how these dictatorships sustained themselves for so long. Readers will be interested to learn how the regimes of each dictator were NOT absolutely controlled by each individual dictator, but were made possible by the service of thousands of men, each with their own reasons for collaboration with the regime.Each chapter examines a different aspect of both dictatorships: one chapter on Hitler and Stalin's rise to power, a chapter on each regimes' ideology, military, art, science, economics etc. I agree with other reviewers that some of these chapters can get a little dry (especially the chapter on economics, partially because I am an economic ignoramus). Regardless, this book is extremely readable overall, and I had trouble putting it down. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It explains not only the defining regimes of the 20th century, how they came to power and sustained their murderous regimes, but it is also a study of power itself, and how it holds sway over otherwise good people and societies. This is possibly the best history book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"Richard Overy's book The Dictators sought to compare the ideological similarities and differences exemplified by Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany. He examines many different factions of both regimes. He starts by looking at how these two dictatorships were able to come about and concludes that without the occurrence of World War I and a little bit of luck, these regimes could not have risen. Overy then goes on to look at the style in which these two dictators ruled. He explains that they claimed the democracy of the West divided the nation into a class system. They wanted true democracy that gives undisputed power to one political party to represent the country. Overy also suggests that Hitler and Stalin were not dictators just for the sense of power, but in order to reach their goal of a Utopia even though their ideas of Utopia differed. Hitler's utopia was a racially pure society, while Stalin's utopia was a classless society. Both of these rulers knew that they faced another inevitable war, and they both heavily involved themselves in the militaristic strategies of their countries. Overy states that WWII would become a total war because it would determine if the ideology of each system would survive. Lastly Overy focuses on the nationalism and racism in each dictatorship, which led to the mass extermination as well as deportation of people. He explains that due to the nationalism and anti-Semitism in both countries it was easy for people to look past the rumors of work and extermination camps.This book in fairly in depth, and a slow read due to the immense amount of information Overy includes. At times Overy seems a little to eager to place Stalin and Hitler in the same category when comparing the two dictatorships, and you must take what Overy says with a grain of salt. He is however clearly very knowledgeable on what he is writing and is very in tune with the ideas he is trying to set across. Overy does not lack data or support throughout his book. If you are interested in how dictatorships come to be and how they are able to keep their power this is a great book for you to read. Some parts are a little harder to get through than others, but overall the topic is interesting and very well written."},{"Title":"The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia","review":"Richard Overy's The Dictator's: Hitler's Germany and Stalin' Russia provides great insight for those lacking in solid history of the time period. Although the book demands some knowledge of the time period, making for a slow read and visits to \\"Google\\" to further ones knowledge of any number of particulars, the book provides a solid understanding of both the two dictators as human beings and their dictatorships. Overy glides over the basic facts of familial history and upbringing to focus on the reasoning behind each rise to power. The books format, although lacking a chronological format, flows well in providing a side by side comparison on topics such as economic systems and cultural control. The book educates the reader on the way each viewed his territories and its people, as well as the \\"utopia\\" so interestingly referred to within its pages. Overy explains how each Stalin and Hitler felt war and conflict was inevitable, yet for different reasons. Hitler felt any dictator had to go through war, as if it was a right of passage. Stalin felt as though to defend his ideological beliefs, war was a necessary measure. Although a slow read, and sometimes heavy; the book leaves the reader with an understanding of the time and the reasoning behind these trying periods in history. The book is long, yet contains many illustrations to break it up and the work entices the reader to reach the next chapter and learn of a new comparison.

It was almost by chance that the city of Moscow would arise to become the leading city of what became Russia. It was founded by Yuri Dolgoruky, a member of a family that would be prominent even up through the 19th century. It was first mentioned in passing in one of the national chronicles in 1147, but some settlement on the site of Moscow was present dating back to the 9th century. From the 1100s, Moscow grew in prominence, politically, economically and culturally up to the 1430s when it was unquestionably the first city of the land. The book, \\"Moscow and the Roots of Russian Culture\\" by Arthur Voyce charts the development of Russian culture and the role that the institutions in Russia played in its establishment.No history of Moscow could be complete without tales of the various rulers. Throughout its history culture has been a state function and this, as Voyce demonstrates included popular culture as well. This was not just the development of churches, the sponsorship of icon painters, and the development of the decorative arts, but also restrictions on culture, particularly that rooted in the pagan past or deemed as unseemly by the Russian ecclesiastical and political authorities.Voyce is a well-known expert on Russian architecture and art and this book is a testimony to his erudition. He focuses not only on the forms that buildings assumed, which owed much to early peasant building designs as much as ideas from Byzantium, but also on the importance that materials played in the development of Russian building design. These factors lead to the development of a purely Russian language of design. A parallel process occurred with the development of painting which was in the period up to 1713, when the book ends, was limited purely to icons. Moscow was a late starter in the development of a school of icon painting, behind both Novgorod and Pskov. Its early efforts resembled those of Vladimir, but by judicious patronage of men of genius such Rublev and Dionisi in the 14th century, Moscow was able to come into its own.While the period of Alexsi I was marked by religious conflict, there was one thing both reformers and traditionalist agreed upon and this was the undesirability of the introduction of \\"Frankish\\" innovations in painting, borrowing concepts common in Western art of the Renaissance and the Baroque. Predictably, the attempts to suppress Western style painting were undone a generation later by Alexsi's son who sent people who wanted to paint in the Frankish style to Europe and laid the basis for the development of a genuine Russian style of painting in the 19th century.One of the book's great strengths was its examination of folk or popular culture. This was both bawdy and lively at the time, well entrenched due to its pagan origins and viewed with suspicion by the central authorities. For much of Medieval Russia life was nasty, brutish and short, but it was at the same time a very interesting place to be, filled with festivals, vulgar theatrical events (including semi-pornographic puppet shows) which made the streets of Russia far more entertaining than they ever would be again. This atmosphere was heightened by the presence of skomorokhi or wondering minstrels who played a role, often delightfully inappropriate in many public events including even boisterous weddings. Music was also a large element of this street culture and the \\"skomorokhi\\" would enliven public events with songs that provided commentary on public figures and institutions that appealed to the lowest forms of humor.The pious Alexsi I and his churchmen did not think much of this popular culture and really this has been the case for much of human history. Both political and religious elites generally desire to control the cultural agenda. One wonders what they would have made of Peter the Great's Mock Synod, a courtly drinking society which spoofed was the state spoofing the rituals of the church and its offices. Had Peter been putting these practices into play he would have run afoul of his father's attempts to outlaw many of the more vulgar aspects of Russian popular culture. And edict issued in 1648 effectively outlawed all of the trappings of skomorokhi culture and with it Russia acquired (as Voyce notes), the veneer of propriety at the expense the culture's vitality and spontaneity.This book is an excellent and short summary of Russia culture and it contains many insightful passages. I suppose it will be no surprise that the section I enjoyed the most was the one dealing with popular culture. This a great book and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Something's there","review":"I borrowed this from the library while still in highshool, and it must have struck some bizarre, adolescent cord with me, because 20 years later I couldn't stop thinking about it and wishing I could re-read it.

But what sinister power lies behind this noble plan? Not merely generic Evil, but the empty spirits of Entropy and Despair, suggesting that humanity's striving for something wonderful and uplifting is doomed by its own nature ... or is it the uncaring Universe itself that crushes hope? A powerful, thought-provoking novel that deserves to be reprinted. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Lords of the starship","review":"Mark S. Geston's first novel Lords of the Starship (1967), written at the age of 21 while he was an undergraduate history student, revolves around a fascinating premise: The construction of a massive (fake) spaceship intended to lift a society out of a crippling malaise. The narrative covers hundreds of years and seemingly innumerable characters. The lack of distinct characters is the most frustrating aspect of the work. However, the extremely dark tone and satirical underpinnings lift the novel above the endless morass of earlier pulp sci-fi.For fans of 50s/60s space opera and more traditionalist 60s science fiction (i.e. lacking New Wave tendencies) with some sociological content...Brief Plot Summary/Analysis (*some spoilers*)Sometime in the distant future society has reverted to an almost perpetual Dark Age after millennia of constant war (at one point with forces nebulously known as The Dark Powers). The landscape is filled with unusual mutants and the relics of past technologically superior empires and peoples: \\"For every legend there are ten actual wonders. The hulks of great ships, aircraft, and machines litter the edges of the World, and not even the legends attempt to understand them\\" (18).Large portions of the beginning of the novel attempt to make manifest the extreme state of malaise - a state of mind where people have completely given up - afflicting the surviving inhabitants of the world. Here I did not find Geston altogether successful. Often he resorts to telling us how society is afflicted rather than showing. After millennia of a lack of new technology, absence of new easily maintained centralized empires, and lesser cultural production than what was produced in previous Golden Ages, one would think that people would eventually just make due with what they have. I'm not sure that they would not endlessly reminisce about some distant past of which they have little to no recollection of. The past would by mythic era rather than a history one could compare to current society. I would argue that Geston is thinking like a historian retrospectively looking at an era and ascribing a historian's conception of so-called dark age to the mental state of the people living in the past. But this is not in itself a major problem but does make a few early portions feel forced.There are slightly indications that what we're reading is a historical text -- suggested by the historical fragment that forms the preface and the vast time and sheer quantity of characters the narrative covers. If this aspect had been played up more -- i.e. the book we're reading is a piece of history -- the ascribed malaise would have to be interpreted through the lens of time and authorial bias. But, such experimental works would come later in the 60s and early 70s.The main narrative is as follows. Sir Henry Limpkin is called before General Toriman, an aged veteran of the Caroline Republic, one of the few marginally successful extant states. Toriman proposes a spectacular stratagem to rile the populace out of their malaise, the construction of a massive seven mile long spaceship. The catch is simple. Those behind the project know that the spaceship is not meant to function -- rather, electrical power, talent, new technology going into its construction will be diverted back into society. For the people the Starship Victory will be a manifest sign of better times to come -- future settlement on a new paradisal planet.The Sir Henry Limplin and future generations of Caroline people working on the new spaceship wage war nearby mutants inorder to utilize a massive river, journey to ancient space yards near the coast where all the necessary parts for the spaceship are mysteriously well preserved, and divide society into those that know of the \\"real\\" purpose of the project (Technos) and the ignorant populace who believe they will be transported off planet when it's completed.Soon rival kingdoms and peoples threaten the vessel. And an array of mysterious signs indicate another power at work....Final ThoughtsI found that the pacing and lack of distinct characters weakens Geston's intended dark tone and blunts his satirical jabs at human nature. The world in which novel takes place is intended to be vast and detailed in scope. But as a result, Geston resorts to lengthy expository passages which often describe hundreds of years in a few paragraphs. I would tentatively suggest that a novel constructed from a series of linked novellas placed at certain important points in the history of the construction of the starship would have been more effective."},{"Title":"Lords of the starship","review":"It's been many years since I first read this book, but not so many years since I read it last...and probably not long before I read it again. \\"Lords of the Starship\\" has been my companion across the decades, and across four continents. The theme of the book is a common one in SF, civilization rising again in a post-apocalyptic world, and even the motifs chosen, the contrasting images of science and fantasy, are not that unusual, but, as with the best of authors, Mark Geston's subtle writing skills turns what might otherwise be lame into sublime. Geston doe not just tell a story, but does so with a point of view that challenges the reader, just as the characters themselves are challenged. \\"Lords of the Starship\\" is a haunting book; although it will not appeal to all people, it will cast an enduring and mesmerizing spell over many."},{"Title":"Lords of the starship","review":"I just finished this book a couple of days ago, and i found it to be acceptable but hardly exceptional. The concept is interesting but it is executed in a somewhat perfunctory manner. For a novel set in a post-apocalyptic landscape and era, for me it failed to conjure up much sense of despair of hopelessness. The characters are all pretty similar and they are given little actual development, have limited emotional ranges and all seem to have the same sorts of characteristics. In fact parts of this read like a narrative of ideas and images rather than an integrated novel. In regards the 250 year story arc, credit must go to the author for brevity. If this novel were written now it would be a trilogy of massive tomes, each outlining every minute degtail such as how many cats the main characters had in childhood and what their names were. That said though each different era of the novel recieves only pretty cursory treatment, sometimes entire generations are skipped because, well, nothing happened. There are elements of the book that are left un-explored and unexplained and ideas crop up and are forgotten within a page or two. The plot twist that some have referred to was telegraphed from only a short way into the book and was hardly a major surprise.Overall, the limited depth, characterisation and somewhat limited scope of the authors expression all serve to hold this book back. Basically, yes, you can feel that this is a first novel from a young man, writing a book with guns and swords and tanks, etc. On occassions the characters take second place to the descriptions of machines and battles. Middling writing, fairly average character development.So, its ok, its not a masterpiece and its not exceptional, its alright, but not great, its so so, the sort of book that you could read amongst a dozen other sci-fi and forget in a week."},{"Title":"Lords of the starship","review":"As a teenager someone gave me this book along with a stack of trashy second-hand pulp sf. Unimpressed by its ... cover and terrible blurb it lay unread. But for some reason I kept it while all the other pulp went straight back to the second-hand shop. Then one summer afternoon years later I took it down off the shelf and I couldn't believe what I'd found. This is a dark, desperate story told with brevity and style and I could not stop reading it until it had reached its terrible but inevitable conclusion.I've read it again many times and have always forced it on friends as some kind of over-looked masterpiece. Do yourself a favour - find a copy and read it. I would also make it required reading for any would be fantasy writer. Before you begin your turgid trilogy read this book, learn from it, and spare us the tedium. It proves that fantasy can be well written and intelligent."},{"Title":"Lords of the starship","review":"One of the best SF books you're ever likely to read, (if you can find a copy), with a breadth and scope which is spellbinding. I first read this book in my early teens and it made a huge impression then: The effect has not diminished over the last 25 years. I found the book in a bargain bin and imagined that I was probably one of only a handful to have read and appreciated it. It's great to see that the book and the author enjoying a well deserved high status in the SF world. I can also recommend the classic 'Earth Abides' if you enjoy apocalyptic fiction, and both the 'Complete works of H.G.Wells' and 'Marchers of Valhalla' by R.E.

The idea of building a starship that is seven miles long and a wingspan of three and a half miles, with the exact purpose of carrying man to the new 'Eden' is what grabs you from the get-go, but the further into the book you travel, the more intensely interested you become, for his world is a unique one, and completely unforgettable.

I was in jr H.S., our S.E. Asian adventure was all the rage and the B-52 was the symbol of man's never ending search for the perfect suicide.

Then a stranger infiltrates the government of a small country and suggests an elaborate hoax: pretend to build a giant spaceship that will carry humanity to a new and better home, and the effort involved will revitalise the people's morale. Somehow over the course of the decades the public becomes convinced that the new world really exists, and by what seems like a miracle the Ship actually begins to take shape. It all seems too good to be true...and unfortunately the inhabitants of this world have forgotten the legend of the Trojan Horse. In this incredible short novel, written at the age of twenty-four, Geston demonstrates not only a tight grasp of plotting, character, pacing and fine descriptive prose, but an almost frightening insight into human weakness and folly.

Some of the anecdotes are real hooters. But it's skinny on the &quot;how to&quot; parts. There's a lot of discussion about setting up your seat and pedals for a comfortable and efficient driving position, but not much about the specifics of choosing a line for this corner, in this car, in this weather, today. Not much about footwork or other aspects of driving technique, not much about car set-up, and nearly nothing about the physics underlying it all. A few glancing blows at topics like contact patches, but disappointingly little.Skip Barber's &quot;Going Faster&quot; is a better textbook, especially for someone like me, an engineer with an analytical mindset.If you want a driving textbook, get Barber's. If you want driving stories, get Bondurant's."},{"Title":"Bob Bondurant on High Performance Driving","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about high performance driving without the cost of going to a school, but roughly half of this book is just advertisement of Bob's driving school in Southern California.

There's even an entire chapter dedicated to how to graduate from his driving school. He also seems to be obssessed with his past glory, which he doesn't mind spending time to talk about.

It teaches you the basic skills such as proper seating and hand placement, heel toe downshifting, cornering and other fundamentals. There is, however, no substitute for actual hands-on training and wheel time, and the book emphasizes this.

But overall, a very good book for beginners."},{"Title":"Bob Bondurant on High Performance Driving","review":"It has been a while since I read this book, but I disagree with those who only see it as a plug for Bondurant's racing school. This is a well-written explanation of vehicle dynamics, and contains a wealth of information that is useful in everyday driving. I have tried to apply what I learned from this book in various low-buck automotive sport competitions, and frankly I just don't have what it takes to excel in motorsports. I do appreciate, however, Bondurant's efforts to explain everything from seating position, to how to place your hand on the sift knob, to proper line through the corner to gain the fastest exit speed.

After reading a lot of other books on this topic I feel that this one is fairly light on actual information and driving techniques in comparison. It is more up to date though than some books written on this topic. I would probably recommend Carl Lopez'/Skip Barber's book \\"Going Faster\\" Or Piero Taruffi's book \\"The technique of Motor Racing(Driving)\\" and similar titles over Bondurant's book.

Yes, Bondurant does toot his horn and promote his driving school, but it's not excessive and, after all, he and his school have earned respect; moreover, Bondurant recommends other competing schools (Barber, Roos, etc.) as well.What matters is that, with a sincere and friendly tone, Bondurant imparts a lot of wisdom which should be helpful to beginning and intermediate drivers interested in track days or racing. More advanced drivers are likely to pick up some useful insights as well.

The karate student has an advantage as they practice several times a week and are usually under the guidance of a watchful teacher and follow a established tradition.Paintball players are at a disadvantage as they play only on occasional weekends and there is no teacher other than experience and watching others. In other words, you wind up being a target for better players until you figure out how to survive and play better.Gun-Fu: The Martial Art of Paintball provides instruction on the techniques, strategy, tactics and training methods that all paintball players need to know.Gun-Fu has information on physical training, drills for running and shooting, bunkering, manuvering, signal codes, field positions, assessing a situation and much much more, There was information on getting a team together, team strategies, entering tournaments and even how to split the awards and prizes.There most interesting part of the book were the parallels made between paintball and martial arts. For example the author likens a paintball player to Japanese bowman shooting an arrow. The paintball player must be calm and relaxed and lead his target. When the time is exactly right he will release his paintball to the target.I really liked the book because it gave instruction on the sport of paintball the way that martial arts books explain certian styles or techniques.I now believe that paintball is as much of a martial art as Karate, Kung Fu or Kickboxing."},{"Title":"Gun-fu: The Martial Art of Paintball","review":"I happened upon \\"Gun-Fu - The Martial Art of Paintball\\" and of course I ordered the book next day and it arrived by the end of the week. I read it in 4 days, lent it out a few times and recommended to my friends and teammates. If paintball is your game this might be your book.Gun-Fu by Terry Adams is a perfect book for those entering tournament play or for those just wanting to step up their game. Mr. Adams does a fine job of translating the complicated world of strategy and self-awareness into this useful guide. I think this is a definite must for the \\"paint in the veins\\" enthusiast. I will say that I particularly enjoyed the analogies between paintball and Martial Arts. The first chapters were absolutely inspiring. I think any level player will find something in its pages. Even someone that has never played can find the knowledge they need to start. For the more advanced player you will find great perspective. The pictures are useful and the lessons are complete. For me, some of the book was more useful than the other parts but I did find golden words that did motivate me.This book pushes technique and training methods that are proven in many other disciplines. The author draws on many similarities of paintball and other competitive sports and introduces training routines that can be incorporated into a successful paintball practice. Mental preparation is a repeated skill that is echoed throughout the pages. The science of competition is illustrated in ways that will challenge you to review your own thought processes when you are on the field and when you prepare for a game.From a disciplined art perspective this book makes for a nice comparison between Martial Arts and Paintball. I realize that this book may find its critics as well. Especially from the Art of War quotes and Martial Art associations. Competition is a negative in many people's eyes as I have witnessed in the last 10 years. I have played in softball, chess, boxing, swordplay, fencing, all on a highly competitive level (some times it even paid my bills) and all of them have their critics. These same people that draw negative opinion don't like us as a sport anyways. Unfortunately to take the game to a competitive level you must draw on learned confrontation. And this is true, not just of paintball but as in any sport that requires strategy and team work. To attack and to defend is the tools by which we wage war that is the nature of competition. But I do think Terry's work was a book about competitive play much more so than it was about paintball. A definite must read for the bunker bound folks."},{"Title":"Gun-fu: The Martial Art of Paintball","review":"In a world that sometimes seems obsessed with political correctness, Terry Adams has managed to write a martial arts book that doesn't even bruise egos! Far too often paintball survival games are illustrated as either pre-pubescent ...training activities or radical X-treme sports. With great organization and a fantastic flair for detail, Terry Adams clearly shows that the games are neither! Instead, he describes a sport that demands the highest levels of discipline, skill, awareness, and a strong sense of sportsmanship. Adams proves that most sports bear these same competitive elements. GUN FU takes lessons from different schools of hand-to-hand martial arts and applies them to paintball. Using these tools, paintball players can take their skills to higher levels; both on the field and-even more importantly-off the field between games. Many of these competitive elements carry over even further into other sports and even into our most routine daily events.

That is, black-and-white, documentary reportage with a hint of magic realism, and replete with iconic images of Che and Fidel.&quot;Rather, Wide continues, there &quot;is the broad range and inventive nature of work, both conceptual and visual, that has been and continues to be done on the island. The work is expressive, sophisticated, and firmly grounded in an international art dialogue.&quot;Covering 40 years of Cuban photography, the work is expressive, indeed. The volume may be roughly divided into three sections, one celebrating the work of such photographers as Enrique de la Uz, Ivan Canas and Jose Alberto Figueroa, who focused on the common man, workers, street scenes, and the marked changes found on the island.Another section emphasizes everyday life after the revolution, and a third area is distinctly different as these artists never lived in a pre-Castro Cuba.While grounded in Cuba, of course, all of these images speak a universal tongue, which is high praise for the artists who created them."},{"Title":"Shifting Tides","review":"As an American photographer who photographs in Cuba I found this book to be both visually exciting and intellectually stimulating.

It is hard to put down, once the reader is in its thrall. Well written in spare, clean prose, it will keep most readers guessing until the very end.The premise is fairly simple. Deborah Robinson, a young woman and mother of an adorable and precocious set of five year old twins, suddenly has the bottom drop out of her world when her husband, Steve, a prosecuting attorney, suddenly disappears without warning. Shortly thereafter, she is stunned to discover that he is suspected of being a serial killer who, for the past eight years, has been killing young women fitting a description that matches hers.Delving into her husband's past, she uncovers information of which she was previously unaware, which causes her to question just what her husband may really have been hiding. Yet, despite all that she discovers, she believes steadfastedly that her husband is not what he is suspected of being.At the same time that this is going on, the man who had fifteen years earlier been convicted of brutally beating and raping Steve's sister, Emily, causing her to be institutionalized, is released from prison and believed to be in the area seeking revenge. Does this also have something to do with Steve's disappearance?Things are not always what they seem, as the reader will discover. There are enough plausible twists and turns in this novel of suspense to satisfy even the most exacting and demanding of readers.

Perhaps the most highly literary of all science fiction writers before the New Wave of the sixties (and still, for my money, a better read than most of that failed revolutionary literature), Smith's single novel &quot;Norstrilia&quot; is utterly unlike any other science fiction novel. Rod McBan becomes the richest man in the universe through the economic warfare of his inherited computer; the novel largely concerns itself with the need to survive the acquisition of wealth. Funny, poetic, and touching, &quot;Norstrilia&quot; is a bittersweet read, because it starts to show how Smith would have continued the expansion and collation of his future history, the Instrumentality of Mankind. Unfortunately, his early death deprived us of what would have been the most lyrical of all future histories. At least we have his stories, which is where any new reader should start (there's a new collection in print now); much of the emotional resonance of the novel comes from recognizing characters from the shorter works, especially the cat-girl C'mell. When you're done with those shorter glories, then come to &quot;Norstrilia&quot; and experience the longest swim in Smith's pool. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"CAUTION: MAKE THIS YOUR LAST CORDWAINER SMITH BOOK! This novel was a rather late addition to Smith's expansive and self-contained literary universe, which he had been constructing for decades, and mostly in his voluminous short stories. All interested persons should first become familiar with the stupendous omnibus collection \\"The Rediscovery of Man: The Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith.\\" (His short stories are collected in a variety of other editions, and at least one is also titled \\"The Rediscovery of Man,\\" but these are partial collections of varying usefulness.) Over his career, Smith built an immense and astonishing future history spanning tens of thousands of years, during which humanity had spread throughout the universe and pockets of human society became isolated. A group known as the Instrumentality initiated the Rediscovery of Man to bring far-flung human culture back together. This is all mapped out in an astonishing array of Smith's short stories, and \\"Norstrilia\\" (his only full-length novel) must be considered an extension of just one portion of that vast literary universe.For the newbie, I'm not sure if \\"Norstrilia\\" fully functions as a stand-alone novel because I was lucky enough to experience the short stories first. Thus I can understand a few of the less favorable reviews here, claiming that the story is diffuse and doesn't make sense. One issue for the newbie is the great source of Smith's genius - his mythology-like non-Western storytelling technique that is laid out more logically in the short stories, while appearing rather abruptly here. That's why fans should become familiar with Smith's progression of short stories first, because then this novel will make more sense, as it's merely piece of a much larger puzzle. Also note that this novel is a bit lighter and more comical as compared to the largely dark and foreboding nature of many of Smith's short stories. In any case, the sci-fi community has criminally overlooked Smith's literary achievements, and \\"Norstrilia\\" fits in perfectly as a masterpiece of social observation and an exploration of the enduring quality of humanity, through the lens of a future history in which humanity has been dispersed nearly to the point of extinction. Smith's universe is astonishing in its depth and breadth, and all serious fans of the genre would find great satisfaction in exploring its wonders. It's just important to remember that this novel may not be the best place to start.

Fortunately for me, both &quot;Norstrilia&quot; and &quot;The Best of Cordwainer Smith&quot; were available in paperback somewhere (used-book store?).Ellison pretty much worshipped Smith, and I pretty much worshipped Ellison, so...Until that point, I had considered Ray Bradbury the best user of language among the authors I read extensively.Cordwainer Smith leaves even Bradbury in the dust. His lyrical narratives would make even mundane stories read wonderfully.Fortunately, Smith's stories -- both short fiction and Norstrilia, his only novel-length effort -- are anything but mundane. His background and interests led him to create worlds utterly unlike any others I've encountered in 2o-some years of avid reading of speculative fiction.Cordwainer Smith was the pen name of Dr. Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger, godson of Sun Yat Sen.He got his Ph.D. in political science at age 23, and wrote extensively about Chinese political issues, worked for the American intelligence community, produced a classic text about psychological warfare that was used by the U.S. Army for decades, and was a professor of Asiatic Politics at Johns Hopkins University and an advisor to John F. Kennedy. He died in 1966, far too early."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"Dr. Paul Linebarger was the son of American diplomats in China (his godfather was President Sun Yat-sen), advisor to Chiang Kai-shek, intelligence analysis in World War II and Korea (he sat out Vietnam), and a linguist and published poet. On top of all that, he wrote science fiction of very high quality under the name \\"Cordwainer Smith.\\" All his stories are set some 15,000 years hence, in a perfectly managed world of perfect, long-lived people and their \\"underpeople\\" servants. And it's all become stale, bland, boring, and decadent. So the Lords of the Instrumentality establish the Rediscovery of Man, allowing disease, accident, anger, and multiple languages and cultures back into the world, just to make things interesting. In this, his only novel, the author brings together all those themes and characters -- Lord Jestocost, C'mell, D'joan, Alpha Ralpha Boulevard, and all the others -- and orbits them around Rod McBan CLI, an enormously wealthy hayseed from the planet of Old North Australia, home of stroon (the drug responsible for near-infinite life), and his leveraged purchase of nearly the whole of Old Earth. Will he find his heart's desire? Originally published as two separate, hacked-up short novels, the whole story is brought back together here. What made Linebarger's work so much above average is that he wasn't so much a story-teller as a myth-maker, creating amazing yarns about larger-than-life characters, telling the history of our maybe-future."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"I encountered Cordwainer Smith when I was very young, in Galaxy magazine (the Game of Rat and Dragon). I was later to learn that that particular story was a comeback story (that page was missing from the copy I read) and that there was a body of work behind the story. And what a body of work!!!!!The mythos of which this is the centerpiece was as richly detailed and inventive as of those of the great worldbuilders (Niven, Tolkien,et al), and the Eastern-influenced storylines by Dr. Linebarger sang. This is one of the best science fiction novels of all time. I own thousands, and this one leaves the shelf more often than most.."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"There's really no way to explain the brilliance of Cordwainer Smith's work; it's so different, so lyrical, and so completely refreshing even now, decades after his death. This is unique science fiction, but it really almost crosses over into fantasy.What can I say? Try it, and I think you'll be hooked.It's worth mentioning that Paul Linebarger (who wrote under the pen name of Cordwainer Smith) was the son of an American diplomat and a godson of pre-Communist Chinese leader Sun Yat Sen. He wrote a definite textbook on psychological warfare, among other things. He wrote mysteries as well, all unfortunately long out of print.However, all of his science fiction has been made available PERMANENTLY by NESFA, the New England Science Fiction Association; \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\", a large hardcover collection of all of his short science fiction, and \\"Norstrilia\\" (which, by the way, is the name of the planet that the hero comes from, which was colonized by Australians and was originally called \\"Old North Australia\\"), his one novel. This is a definitive edition, including all the text from the two paperbacks that were originally released by hacking the original maniscript into two halves. This edition includes all linking text that was written just for the two separate editions, as well as the original version and all variants.NESFA has announced that they have arranged to print new copies of these books on demand. They're quite high quality, too, well bound and printed on acid-free paper.Incidentally, Smith's daughter has set up a web site about him and publishes a newsletter. P>Although nobody else is like Cordwainer Smith, for those who like him I'd highly recommend \\"Lord of Light\\" by Roger Zelazny and \\"Bridge of Birds\\" by Barry Hughart."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"This book has been published several times yet it's always difficult to find. The world created by Smith is fascinating and compelling on every level. Animals fighting for their own rights, benevolent (we hope) dictators pulling everyone's strings, and a young man who corners the market on the most valuable commodity in the galaxy - by accident.If you only read new science fiction I would really recommend that you broaden your horizons by trying this oldie."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"I liked this book, and it was good enough that it deserves a second reading (its also short enough). Some times the story doesn't make sense, sometimes its just really too bizarre. But when you think about when it was written its just amazing to think of how ahead of his time the author was. I would have wished for the story to be more epic because the preface set you up for an epic story and some parts of the story didn't get as developed as they might have. This is mainly because the book has so many characters that it jumps back and forth between, that at points you expect more to be done with a certain character. I would have liked to see more be done with the space pirates which at first you think are going to be major players in the book but then are seemingly cast aside. And with all the villians in the novel the main character never really seems to be in much danger even though the author clearly wants you to believe that he is. Then there are of some stupid parts to the book. For instance, I thought that the old wise catman part was nonsence and never came accross as meaningful as it was suppose to be. Besides the flaws, I think this book has a really cool universe, which has many interesting, yet underdeveloped characters, and a lot of very strong questions on the human condition that seem suprising applicable in the present even though the book was written some 40 years ago. Probably the reason most people wish that the author would have written more novels is not because this is the greatest book ever (because its not) but because it offers so many excellent questions yet never develops itself to the point of answering them. While there are better novels out there this one is so unique, short, and easy to read that no true sci-fi fan has an excuse to not read it."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"Cordwainer Smith belongs to a rare group of truly original voices in the world of speculative fiction. In real life, a covert operative, graduate instructor of international studies at Johns Hopkins, advisor to the President, and all around worldly fellow (right down to the eye patch)...in fiction, a gifted writer of short stories and this one novel...a novel I've read many times over the years and each time I find new marvels...if you haven't discovered CS, read Nostrillia, then move on to his short stories...how i envy the discovery that awaits you."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"Simply put, if you haven't read Cordwainer Smith - you need to. He only wrote the one novel Norstrilia and a host of inventive short stories (collected in a companion volume called \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\" also published by NEFSA.Smith - actually an academic named Paul Linebarger - combines a storytelling style from classic Chinese literature with his own imagination to create a future history spanning from \\"the first men in space\\" to tens of thousands of years in the future. Man changes, loses himself, and rediscovers himself during these years.In Norstrilia, we see this in miniature in the person of Roderick Frederick Ronald Arnold William MacArthur McBan the Hundred and Fifty-First (\\"Rod McBan\\") a young orphaned man who stands to inherit the oldest \\"station\\" on his dry dusty planet of Old North Australia (Norstrilia - founded by settlers who wanted to keep things like the old Australian outback). The funny thing is - all Norstrilians are immensely rich since they raise enormous sick sheep who are infected with a virus that can be distilled into an immortality drug (stroon)! (They keep themselves simple by import duties that range up to millions of percent of the purchase price).Rod (long story) manages to corner about one year's worth of the stroon harvest on the exchanges and is now rich enough to buy much of Earth. All he wants is to see it and possibly get some rare Cape Town stamps (currently the rerest stamps in 2010AD, but a lot rarer now that it's 10,000+ AD and the old world had already collapsed and been rebuilt).Along the way, he meets a lot of odd folks (including himself - don't ask) and realizes in the end that the thing he really sought was much closer to his dry dusty station on Norstrilia.The novel can be read alone from Smith's short stories, but the characters and situations in each are interwoven with the other. Therefore, read it all - it will be a much richer experience!The only thing I can't tell you is which ones (short stories or Norstrilia) to read first. I read the short stories in the mid 70s first and then read Norstrilia right after. Others to whom I've recommended Smith read it in the other order. No one was disappointed! Neither will you.By the way, one of the reasons to read Smith if you love SF is that many of the past and current masters of the genre (e.g., Lois McMaster Bujold) were inspired by Smith in the 60s to launch their careers. Reading Smith is really opening a door to imagination - grounded in strange people and strange societies that for all their strangeness are strangely familiar!"},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"There was a time when science fiction was a very insignificant genre, enjoyed almost exclusively by boys and young men, a situation that changed somewhat when the Space Age began, demonstrating that even the most far-fetched nonsense could become tomorrow's headline. Light adventure and juvenile novels gave way to \\"serious\\" science fiction works that actually \\"meant something\\". Much of this transition took place during the turbulent 1960's, and it is in this context that we should consider Norstrilia.Part One was published in '64, and paints a delightfully barbed portrait of the kind of people who live in Northern Australia - the antecedents of the planet of Norstrilia. In a cosmic irony worthy of Vonnegut, Norstrilia is the only planet that can grow \\"stroon\\" - the prized longevity drug - making it the richest planet in the galaxy, but it is inhabited by a people who are almost painfully rooted in the past; insular, anti-technology, with strong ties to the land, reverent towards their ancestors as well as the unseen Queen of the Commonwealth, and practicing strict eugenics to preserve the purity of their lineage. This latter almost proves the undoing of the protagonist, Rod McBan the 151st, since he was born with a distinct genetic defect, being unable to communicate via telepathy the way everyone else does.Part Two was published in '68, and is consequently faster-paced, somewhat racier, and distinctly more class-conscious. Rod travels to Earth, having just purchased it with the aid of Norstilia's only electronic computer, which has learned how to manipulate the interstellar stock market. On Earth, Linebarger (Smith) shows how all real work is done by \\"under-people\\" - half-human half-animal creatures who are struggling towards the day they can demand equal rights. Is Rod the savior the under-people have been waiting for? Will he find love with the beautiful cat-woman C'mell? And can Rod find sanctuary from the Honorable Secretary, who is trying to kill him?There are plenty of fascinating ideas in this book, but none of them are really developed, so they don't have a lot of impact. Rather than focusing on a central theme, the work has a sprawling quality that in some ways diminishes it. Not only are the two parts somewhat disjointed, but the individual parts themselves aren't unified so much as linear: one thing happens and then another without any feeling of cohesiveness. Characters are introduced and then dropped a few pages later with scarcely another reference, even though they didn't actually do anything.The four-star recommendation is in recognition of the fact that Linebarger's short story collection The Rediscovery of Man adds levels of richness that the immediate text is lacking, and also because despite the book's obvious flaws, it still manages to be a pretty entertaining piece of sci-fi/fantasy. It's a fun read, but it would be better if one has read The Rediscovery of Man first."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"It probably pays to read a few reviews before starting on the works of an author you haven't come across before. Particularly if that author is dead and I say this because I believe Cordwainer Smith was an exceptional Author. I read his later book first and as one review stated I would do myself a favour by reading a collection of his short stories first ( The Rediscovery of Man: The Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith.\\")Norstrilia is unusual by any standards. The style is unique in my experience but the story line-what you can make of it initially-is intriguing and dare I say bizarre. Two hundred tonne diseased sheep give humankind extended existences. The sheep's farmers are rich beyond imagining with a lifestyle that ignores this fact. They live in New Australia, a planet far from old, old earth and what could be more normal than to use your wealth to purchase old earth at the behest of a personal computer.This is just the beginning and you will need to read all to be enlightened, or not, as the case may be.I started of intrigued, thought about quitting at one point and finally congratulated myself on seeing it through. I wanted more and will not get it unfortunately but am grateful for the opportunity and privilege.

The other voices here are almost unanimous in their praise for Mr. Smith, and given my reaction to the book, I don't know whether they are all valid reviews or misplaced sentimentality for a childhood favorite.I'm a great fan of SF, but I really didn't enjoy the book that much, mainly because of the problems mentioned in other reviews (disjoint plot, undeveloped ideas and characters, etc). Sure, it has some unique ideas, but not that unique. If you want to read some great books from the same time period or earlier, check out Philip K. Dick, or Clifford D. Simak, or Alfred Bester. I find their work to be more brilliant, much more developed, wittier, and at times even more strange.I may have enjoyed Norstrilia if I were ten years younger (ah, to be young again), but at my age it just doesn't stand up to it's peers from the same time. However, I certainly didn't hate it, it just wasn't that appealing. Also, given the high praise Mr. Smith has received here and elsewhere (indeed, it has been recommended to me by many), it may be worth your time. Even I may read it again to see if I missed something special."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"A little bit of Australian satire in Norstrilia. e.g. NorthernAustralia.

Then I checked the dates of publication- this was released a year before DUNE was first published.

This is doubly impressive given its age; a lot of old science fiction just doesn't seem original, interesting, or relevant when you're reading it 10, 20, or 50 years after it was originally written. Norstrilia suffers from no such problems. In fact, really only two complaints can be levelled at it, and both of those might just be my opinion.The first is that Norstrilia takes place in a vast and richly detailed universe that Cordwainer Smith details in a series of short stories. The book relies strongly on this background material, a lot is taken for granted, and very little is explicitly explained. While it is never incomprehensible because of this, I also had the feeling that the reading experience was something less than it should have been because of all the references that were lost on me. Reading Norstrilia has certainly convinced me that I should give Smith's short stories a try, though.My second complaint is about the ending. I just didn't like it. More than that, it seemed out of character for Rod McBan, and just generally felt too much like the author was forcing the story to go in directions to suit his own ends rather than where it naturally wanted to go. On the one hand, why would the pragmatic McBan settle for a &quot;dream&quot; with his love rather than the real thing? Why does a citizen of Norstrilia, one who has spent his entire life fighting the system, give up so easily when an offworlder argues that he can't stay with C'mell? The realization that C'mell didn't love him wholly seems to come from nowhere (perhaps it is explained in the shorter fiction somewhere) and seems a half-hearted post-hoc rationalization for not being with her. The sudden realization of feelings for the girl back home had no real explanation. Just in general it felt like the author wanted McBan parted from his money, parted from C'mell, and back on Norstrilia away from everything.(As a side note it would have been interesting, especially given that he is going to live for a thousand years, if we could have seen Rod McBan experiencing the great plan that the Underpeople have the universe. Instead we last seem him only a few decades after we first meet him.)Despite, the wholly unsatisfying ending, everything leading up to it more than made up for it. Now I just need to get a copy of Cordwainer Smith's short stories."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"All the world created by C.S. is full of human feeling, something not much found un the world of SF. Every story is the expresion of your mental state, independly of the time. Is LITERATURE, NOT ONLY STORIES OF COHETES."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"I just finished \\"Norstrilia\\" a couple days ago. Offhand, I can't recall ever being so baffled by how any book became a widely acknowledged masterpiece of science fiction. The claims advanced for Norstrilia appear to be:1. Smith has great imagination.2. His universe is extremely thorough and believable.3. His writing is lyrical and touching.To which I respond: yes, no, and sort of.For starters, \\"Norstrilia\\" leans towards being comic science fiction. Actual moments of humor exist, but they are rare. Perhaps light-hearted science fiction would be a better term. On the imagination side, there are a lot of original ideas in this book, though not really more than what you expect from most good SF novels. The problem is in organization and unity: there is none. Smith doesn't really build up to anything here. Each original idea, after being introduced, is either forgotten or used as a punchline. For instance, we get a one page introduction to a planet ruled by a council of thieves. They then appear only one more time in the book, revealing that the thieves don't manage to steal anything but make tons of money anyway. Ha ha, and that's the last we see of them.The story, characters and writing are all basically average, and nothing stands out for high distinction. We might consider the fact that protagonist Rod McBan buys all of planet Earth in the space of one night. You might be hoping for some particularly clever explanation of how he pulled off such a feat, but no such luck. His computer simply issues a lot of buy and sell commands, and that's that. Then we're off to a fight with a giant murderous sparrow. (Don't ask.) Many books from the 50's and early 60's were lofted to the status of \\"science fiction classic\\" merely because their basic competence was an improvement over the genre's pulp origins. \\"Nostrilia\\", sad to say, was one of them."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"I am another who found this work to be only average, at best. For a supposed classic of the genre I was very disappointed.There are some good points, the ideas and the society created are very interesting.

Though this book should stand alone, it really doesn't and characters pop in and out without the reader ever learning who they are, why they do things and where they came from.Apart from the interesting glimpses of the universe and the society imagined in the work the book did not work for me. The plot is muddled and disjointed. I'm not really sure there is a plot actually. I understand it is actually 2 shorts put together in novel form. The prose which is praised by so many others I found to be pedestrian.For light on plot, new-wave science fiction that shows glimpses of a well envisioned society I'll stick with John Brunner.Hopefully reading his short fiction will make this story more complete."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"The first piece I ever read by Cordwainer Smith was a short story called &quot;The Ballad of Lost C'mell,&quot; a story of intrigue and unrequited love featuring the cat-derived undergirl C'mell (underpeople: animals genetically altered to have human form and human intelligence, oppressed and treated as second-class citizens) and her unlikely ally Jestocost, a Lord of the reigning Instrumentality. My only fault with the story was that there wasn't enough of it. Imagine my delight on finding that there was an entire *book* set in this colorful future universe! &quot;Norstrilia&quot; (short for Old North Australia, the homeworld of the protagonist Rod McBan) has some of everything--intrigue, romance, adventure, philosophy, poetry, complex characters and a detailed and fascinating world. The cast of characters alone is wild and varied: the theatrical Lord Redlady; the godlike E'telekeli and his believing daughter E'lamelanie; the late unlamented Tostig Amaral; Jestocos! t, a Lord of the Instrumentality who has a passion for justice and a secret cause; Rod McBan himself, the sixteen-year-old who bought Earth (with the help of his computer and the galactic stock exchange) and who now wants nothing more than normal telepathy like everyone else and an antique postage stamp; and my personal favorite, C'mell, the fire-haired cat-girl whose beauty is matched only by her intelligence and determination. Others: Crudelta the mental pickpocket. Comissioner Teadrinker, bored with a thousand-year lifespan. The Catmaster, owner of the Department Store of the Heart's Desire. And those are just a few of the people you'll find, to say nothing of what happens to them and what they do. I can give you the plot; I can detail the characters; I can tell you what the story is about. Cordwainer Smith does as much in the prologue. But as he says, that's only what *happens*. For the story (the fun part), read &quot;Norstrilia.&quot; You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"Cordwainer Smith was a lot of things in real life --a professor of Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins by day,a consultant to the CIA by night. Author of thedefinitive book on psychological warfare. A committedChristian. And a guy who wrote science fictionin his spare time.In terms of sheer imaginative energy, it doesn't get anybetter than this.Ross Pavlac"},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"This is more of a recommendation about how to read the novel and get more out of it.By the time I first read Norstralia 20 years ago, I had already read his \\"Ballad of Lost C'Mell\\" and met a few of the Lords. So Norstralia was much more meaningful knowing these stories beforehand. It also filled in some of the background to the revolution and gave voice to a few of the hidden players in other stories."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"If you're searching for a sci-fi classic a bit off the beaten path, look no further. Smith has one of the most unique voices in the genre, but also one of the most versatile. Lyrical, haunting, romantic, heroic. He's got a fresh take on many old sci-fi chestnuts, and there are compelling new ideas on every page. We got robbed that this is his only novel!"},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"Cordwainer Smith is indeed lyrical and enchanting. My husband and I read \\"Norstrilia\\" and the short stories in the late 1970's, and we have reread them from time to time. We refer back to the ideas, most notably, how does a society maintain its culture and survive affluence? The more we see the effects of prosperity in America, the more considerable the problem appears. In many details, Smith/Linebarger seems to have anticipated a lot of the developments since he wrote his stories. Western Civilization may indeed end up as a minor footnote in Chinese history. As for the structural criticisms of \\"Norstrilia,\\" I was never bothered by its flaws, which may indeed be as considerable as its critics claim, because I was charmed by the language and poor Ron McBan's plight, which I took seriously.If one is looking for a book by another writer that might possess some of the same charms, I recommend \\"Fourth Mansions\\" by Samuel Lafferty. For just a charming space opera fantasy, not poetic but imaginative, try \\"The Witches of Karres\\" by James Schmitz. Jack Vance also deserves more shelf space in the book stores than he gets. I also ran across a book, \\"Cat Karina,\\" which I think was an attempt to continue the saga of the underpeople and the Instrumentality by Michael Coney, 1987."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"Like just about all of his other work, this, Smith's only sf novel, is both unique and highly lyrical. Set within his universe of the Instrumentality of Mankind, it's the story of Rod McBan, 16 year-old heir to his family fortune, which is based on the stroon (a drug that provides near-immortality) his family farm produces from genetically modified giant sheep, if only he can survive the testing that all inhabitants of Norstrilia (Old North Australia) must go through to prove their basic competence and genetic purity. But Rod has problems, being a \`broad-band' telepath instead of the normal type, and he can only pass this test after multiple tries. Worse, he's not sure if he really wants to be part of the very conservative Norstrilian society, and concocts a scheme in conjunction with his (proscribed) war games computer to manipulate the galactic futures market, with the net result of his suddenly becoming the owner of Old Old Earth, just so Rod can obtain an old postage stamp. And that's just the beginning.This book sprawls across the landscape that Smith built over the years in various short stories, which are collected inThe Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith, and I highly recommend that that volume be read prior to this, as otherwise many items that are only mentioned in passing here will either not make sense or will not provide the intended resonance. Mother Hitton's Little Kittens, Shayol, the various Lords of the Instrumentality, the Underpeople (most especially the cat-girl C'Mell): each of these has a back-story detailed in some of these other stories. And you'll want to catch each of these nuances, for the story here is as engrossing as it is odd, and the universe it details is something you'll wish you could know more about.There's intrigue and skullduggery, social evils and battling injustice, love, musings on the purpose of life, religion, revolt, and yes, the Store of Heart's Desire, all waiting inside these pages for you to discover and enjoy. All couched in Smith's inimitable style that is like no other author's. Originally published as two rather hacked-up pieces, this volume puts the entire work together again as it was intended to be, a great example of what can be done by a wordsmith of great imagination and great skill.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"As another reviewer noted, it is too bad that the complete works of this great man are not fully available. I discovered him quite by accident in an &quot;annual&quot; of short stories. &quot;A Planet Called Shayol&quot; was the only science fiction story I've ever read that brought tears to my eyes; I had to close the book for a while. That doesn't often happen when reading any book, much less science fiction work.I stongly recommend &quot;Quest of the Three Worlds&quot;; unbelievable that someone could imagine that universe and then write about it so well.That said, Norstrilia is a rolicking good time book with rich underlying stories-within-stories. Fun, but deep stuff."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"As well as agreeing with the other reviews, I would like to comment on the 'feel' of the universe created by the author. It is not just a setting for stories, but a rich tapestry of the evolution of human emotion and understanding. From the first story 'No, No, Not Rogov' to the final 'The lords of the afternoon', it shows the triumph of the homan spirit. These stories move me like no others have. Read his books and you will be changed forever."},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"Cordwainer Smith creates a fascinating universe filled with curiosities for us to wonder at. From Stroon, the drug that prolongs life, to Norstrilia itself, the planet protected by &quot;Mother Hutton's Littul Kittons&quot;. Rob, a broadbander, the Onseck his enemy who wants to kill him and the Girly-Girl C'mell all run together to form a exquisite wine that can be drunk over and over. The book is imaginative and surprising, an example the idea of using a slave of Snake and Human genetics to prevent people eavesdropping on a conversation because it would frighten them too much! I first read this book over 10 years ago and immeadiately fell in love with Cordwainer's writing. If you like your books to be filled with gore, Smith is not for you. If you love poetry, Smith excels at that. Read the book, I feel certain that you will be as engrossed as I was the first time I read it!"},{"Title":"Norstrilia","review":"\\"Norstrilia\\" is about immortality, high finance, outsiders, mutated sheep, Australia, and what makes human beings human. The author, Cordwainer Smith, was a respected member of the State Department, a master of more than 20 languages, a PhD in East Asian cultures, and an expert on psychological warfare. His knowledge of Chinese narrative styles allowed him to create science fiction that is as far away from \\"blazing blasters\\" and \\"making the Kessel run in 12 parsecs\\" as you can imagine. His prose is lyrical, mysterious, and evocative, and his premises are mind bending.Don't let the cover art on this edition fool you; \\"Norstrilia\\" is very different, and very, very good."},{"Title":"Fiery Baptism (Harlequin Presents)","review":"This is one of Lynne Graham's best.

She'd never expected Rafael to walk back into her life, nor had she realized he'd been unaware of the twin's existence.Theirs had been a whirlwind courtship. Rafael loved with passion; he created hauntingly beautiful works of art with passion; and Sarah realized now on a tide of pain and regret, he hated with that same emotional intensity.Rafael hadn't changed - he was still a determined, dangerous man. But with the wounds of the past unhealed within her, Sarah wasn't going to get burned again!\\"First of all, I don't know where in the book the previous rewiewer started reading, but the hero doesn't declare his love from the very beginning. And the heroine not being a doormat? Have we read the same book?This book is almost like two. The first part is the h/h meeting again after five years where we find out just how much strain and stress the young heroine had been under during the marriage - between her overbearing and crazy parent and her overbearing and crazy husband. I mean, for g's sake, her father puts her in a mental institution while she's pregnant to split the h/h up! In any circumstance, though, I don't think it would have been expecting too much to hope that the hero actually made more of an effort to find the heroine when she 'fell of the face of the earth' even if he thought that she had had an abortion~Then we are treated to the hero's double standard of being disdainful of the heroine's sudden sexual drive because of what he believes was her experience with other men during their separation, when he admits to having had other sexual encounters himself but simply dismisses those as having happened when he was unbearably depressed! Why did he never ask why she had been frigid during their marriage? Talk about insensitive!The second part of the book is like your typical HP romance - unresolved distrust and family secrets come poring out until the story ends on a predictably abrupt note with the h/h declaring their love for each other. It is exquisitely maddening and not in a good way!The only part of this book that was remotely interesting was the restaurant scene where the heroine gets drunk and speaks honestly and casually. Of course, that is also dampened a bit by the fact that until she says these things out loud, the hero nevers seems to have the things through~"},{"Title":"Fiery Baptism (Harlequin Presents)","review":"This is the first Lynne Graham book where the hero has proclaimed love for the heroine from the get go,and the heroine is not a dormat either, I hope she writes more like this book.

Although initially drawn to it by its title--also my name, exactly--I was excited to find it was much more than my namesake. Martha Gellhorn's story of a young woman trying to find her place in a world where she doesn't seem to fit in is a universal theme, but given a sincerity not often found elsewhere. The backdrop of World War II provides a believable backbone, rather than just re-hashing a period of history many people may think of as boring and overused. And the interracial love affair isn't tawdry and cliched, but gradually built, starting with friendship and blossoming into something more serious. The multiple subjects are beautifully written together, smoothly creating a whole much more than the sum of its parts. Unlike so many novels today, this one--no doubt thought of as &quot;old&quot; and perhaps worthy only of scorn, being such, by skeptics--is a contemporary classic which speaks of subjects still relevant today and for a long time to come. Personally, I would like to see this book come into the popularity it deserves by being added to the reading list at high schools across the country--its subjects could help to open minds and help those who may identify with them."},{"Title":"Liana","review":"Martha Gellhorn is really incapable of writing a dull sentence. Liana is the story of a beautiful, simple Carribean girl, and two European men driven by the concerns of the modern life and thought. As the story unfolds, the reader is drawn to its aesthetic beauty which is reminiscent of von Trier's Europa, and the elegance of its style. Although the ending can be anticipated, there is no way to anticipate the splendour in Gellhorn's writing."},{"Title":"Codex Telleriano-Remensis: Ritual, Divination, and History in a Pictorial Aztec Manuscript","review":"&quot;The 16th-century Codex Telleriano-Remensis was a rare colonial enterprise: an intercultural exchange between Indian artists and Spanish overseers. It was created in an attempt to understand Aztec culture in light of its transformed present. The result was a well-organized manuscript with invaluable information about the Aztec calendar, mythology, rituals, history, and politics. Through the centuries, the Codex has been a fruitful source of knowledge for academics and a source of cultural identity and power for the diminishing Aztec (Nahua) survivors. This new edition includes a full-color photographic facsimile of the entire Codex as well as an English translation of the Spanish commentaries that explain the work's intense visual imagery. It contains over 100 pages of brilliant visions of bellicose earth-mother goddesses and other mythical creatures. [Qui&ntilde;ones] Keber is professor of art history at Baruch College and The Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York. She provides a comprehensive text that complements these images with core information about Aztec culture and gives the reader a deeper appreciation for the art of Aztec manuscript painting. Most people will never see the original manuscript, now well guarded at the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris, but [Qui&ntilde;ones] Keber provides the immediacy and excitement of actually holding a copy of the ancient text.

Dion, Ron's otheruncle, makes joking references to Gil's lechery. Since Deitz didn'tbother to come up with an excuse for Gil's incarceration (like,perhaps, he was convicted on a false charge), the reader is left toassume that Gil is in fact a perpetrator of violence towards women.When the Welches and Dillons are assembled to witness the passing of arelative, Gil's crime is not an issue and everyone happily hugshim.Another thing that bothered me was Ron and Lew's criminallyinsane sister, who wants to be the new Master.

Be There at Ten Til.: A Collection of Homegrown Wisdom","review":"Reviewed by Paige Lovitt for Reader Views (10/06)Author R. Dean Johnson gained a lot of insight into human behavior by always observing what was going on around him. He calls it \\"homegrown wisdom.\\" He shares his homegrown wisdom with us to teach us to look for these kinds of life lessons in everything. Johnson's writings made me feel like he was someone that I wished I knew personally. He looks at life very basically and offers his musings with a touch of southern class. He offers a lot of common sense. In his book, he takes each chapter and muses about an experience he had and what he learned from it. He talks about the importance of having our basic needs be met. For example, if we have known true hunger, we learn to really appreciate food. If we haven't known true hunger, then we need to appreciate this fact and be grateful for the abundance in our lives.Johnson also writes about how the process of change is important and necessary for us to grow. But he also says that constancy and familiarity feed our souls. Each chapter is enjoyable to read and is a welcome respite from the current times that we are in where people seem to forget about personal accountability and get so caught up in materialism that they lose a sense of the importance of belonging.\\"Life. Be There at 10 \`Til\\" is really an enjoyable book to read. It would make a wonderful gift for all ages. I think that older people would enjoy it for its simplicity and that younger people could learn a lot about life in general from it. For me, I enjoyed being able to sit down with it and take a break from all the stress going on in my world.

Being able to see Sarah everyday helped Mike begin to feel better about his life, which was turned upside down by the accident. The author, McBay,wrote how life can take many unexpected turns when you don't except them to with his creative plot.Even though Mike's family was killed and his legs were amputated, from the car accident, he was able to forget about the horrible past with the aid Sarah's presence. However, the teacher that he never really trusted caused him to lose her as well. Although he was devastated, she revisits him to easy the pain on important days in Mike's life, such as his high school graduation. Life may have thrown many curves at Mike, yet each one only made him into a stronger person later on.Along with the well crafted plot, the author caused the book to flow like a river of words, cascading down and over a waterfall. When I first read this book, my heart went out to each of the main characters, causing me to feel the glee and the sorrow that all of them faced during the hardships of their young lives. The well written words caused the emotions to pour out me. I would laugh whenever something was funny and cry when the sorrow was almost too overwhelming. The time when Sarah ran off, looking hurt, torn and ragged, caused the tears film over my eyes and leak out down my check. Every time that I was going to put the book down to do something else, I was always drawn back. It was as though the words were demanding me to get back as soon as possible, so that I wouldn't have to wait to find out what happened next.Being able to actually feel what a character is going through as though you are that character, facing all the unexcepted turns in their lifes, reflects on how well the author,McBay, has so carefully chosen each word, to create this master piece, Waiting for Sarah."},{"Title":"Waiting for Sarah","review":"Mike's parents and sister are dead, his legs are gone, and his life is shattered.

As a result of the strange mix, I felt that Mike's problems were not really delved into as deeply as they could have been, and the ghost story seemed like a superfluous plot that was tacked on as the author started to shirk away from the heavy subject matter. Had it been just a straight ghost story, the whole issue of loss on Mike's part would have been unnecessary; why would he need to suffer such an enormous tragedy to work on the yearbook?I guess what I'm trying to say is that it seemed like the tragic elements were only added for shock value, and then cast aside in order to tell the ghost story. It could have been either a story of coping with loss, or a standard ghost story. Instead, the two were mixed and, as a result, the book didn't quite work."},{"Title":"Waiting for Sarah","review":"Waiting for Sarah was an amazing read!Mike was in an accident that killed his family and made him lose the lower part of his legs.

The thing about Sarah he doesn't know is that she was murdered twenty years before. I really liked this book. It is probily on of the best books I have ever read.

ON THE WATER spends alomst every page in the preparation, practice and execution of a two man crew boat. He gradually pulls us into that boat with an understanding of the rules of the game and the rigors of the men who row. Then, subtly and with great tenderness he unveils his two young men of polar diferences and weaves a story of the power of sporting competion and the greater power of finding a soulmate. This bonding between lower class gentile Anton and upper class Jew David is engineered by a German Doctor in 1939. This beautiful story of an exploration of place and love is set in the last summer before Hitler destroys Europe. We are left to guess the fate of David while we discover the solitary wandering Anton who tells the story five years later along the banks of the river where they spent the most beautiful time of their lives. This novel gleams with magical poetry and introduces an author (and translator) who seems destined to find an important role in the 21st Century of literature. Read this book!"},{"Title":"On the Water","review":"Anton lives in a new neighbourhood near the Amstel river in Amsterdam in the 1930's. From his early childhood onwards, the river attracts him and when he is about 14 years' old he becomes a member of the rowing club on the other side of the Amstel. Anton is an outsider: the other member are from higher social classes, his father works in the public transport branch. He is also an outsider in other aspects: he observes the others and doubts himself.But then one day the eccentric Dr. Schneiderhahn chooses Anton and David for the coxless two. In Anton's view David is his very antipole: he is self-confident and outgoing. Slowly but surely the two boys become a perfect team. In the summer of 1939 they start competition rowing and they win one race after another. It becomes more and more apparent that they have a chance to participate in the 1940 Olympics in Finland. At the end of the year they promise each other to go on as a team in the next year.The book is written as a oppressive retrospective of Anton who finds himself on the pier of the derelict rowing club in 1944. the reader knows what has happened between 1939 and 1944 and the typically Jewish name David strongly suggests that history has not been kind to him. A beautiful book in sensitive prose."},{"Title":"On the Water","review":"Anton lives in a new neighbourhood near the Amstel river in Amsterdam in the 1930's.

Hans Maarten van den Brink has written a lyric story of athleticism and the body, of a love of water and rowing, of how a young man grows to be a friend, a teammate, a champion. The author is observant of nature, the body and humanity, he knows the challenge and joy of sports and can communicate that experience as far as it can be done even to the couch potato. He has a sure choice for words and felicitous phrasing (the translator, Paul Vincent, deserves much credit and praise as well). I look forward to reading more of him"},{"Title":"On the Water","review":"This was a different type of story that really kept my attention from page one. It takes place in Amsterdam, Holland in 1939 when two young oarsmen train under the guidance of an eccentric German coach in hopes of someday winning the Olympics. Anton, who narrates the story, is from a working class family. David, the other oarsmen in this two man boat with Anton, is an affluent &amp; self-assured athletic young man. The story in beautifully worded images describes the two young men as they become bonded together closer and closer through grueling practice sessions and training to later go on to winning many local races. Anton's description of his obsessive desire to please and do everything perfect for David is almost like a love story and indeed very homoerotic at times. This story is told five years later by Anton as he revisits the now abandoned boathouse. You can tell he is deeply emotional in his remembrances of a time that he describes as \\"the best summer of his life.\\" You get the feeling this is the most important year of his whole life, too. With World War II now exploding all around him as he remembers, you can feel his tragic lost of youth and happier times.I felt this was a sensitive and well-written work of literature. There is so much feeling in Brink's writing about this friendship and the time they shared together. I sincerely hope to read more from this Dutch writer in the near future. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"On the Water","review":"It started slow and I almost put it down. I'm glad I didn't.The author provides a vivid and accurate portrayal of a young man's journey training to be a world-class rower while dealing with life's struggles at the beginning of WWII. I don't know if a non-rower would fully appreciate the frustrations, joy, satisfaction, and pain that are described perfectly throughout the story, but for me it brought back many memories. I miss being on the water."},{"Title":"On the Water","review":"Upon opening 'On The Water', I found myself, within the span of four pages, already regretting that I only had 130 left to read.A magical tale of youth recalled and revisited, H.M. Van Den Brink's story of a young man captivated by the thought of joining a Dutch rowing team is at once compelling and unforgettable.Anton, the narrator, a slight, awkward boy in WW2 era Holland, enlists in training to compete with a local team. He meets and befriends David, who is friendly, self-confident, outgoing...seemingly all things that Anton is not capable of being.But on the water, these two are equal...finding themselves acting, thinking, and reacting as one person, when it comes to the sport they both love.Under the guidance of a slight eccentric coach, who dreams of sending them to into competition beyond their local endeavors, the boys develop a winning synchonicity in their sport, and in their friendship as well.Books such as this are rare and wondrous to find, though, typically, all too short. The tale weaves back and forth between the training and a re-visit by Anton several years later to the boathouse and river, long since abandoned, although most of the 'action' takes place in the past, in Anton's recollections.A gem of a book, thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish."},{"Title":"On the Water","review":"In 1939 in Amsterdam, two young men (Anton and David) train as rowers, led by a mysterious doctor, who dangles the possibility of the Olympics before them. Blending into the time five years later, Anton sees his city barren and reminisces about the golden time during his obsession with rowing, with the physicality of action, with his odd relationship with David and the doctor. For Anton, his entire world revolved around the water and what he was doing with David because of his lackluster family and world. This was his one time to dazzle, and it didn't last. This novella is an eloquent trip down one man's memory lane."},{"Title":"Honey: Stories","review":"A book of short stories, woven together with a thread of commonality.

Not that Ms. Graham copied him in any way, but that her book reminded me of those books. It was a good read and kept me turning the pages long after I should have been asleep on a couple of nights. I only wish it had been longer! A very satisfactory ending and not at all predictable. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a change from the usual run-of-the mill romance."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"I thought this book was very weird, and never really held together. I love good romance novels, but this romance was nonsensical at best, and pathological at worst. The &quot;hero&quot; was a weak, passive jerk, who couldn't even follow through with his passionate declarations of love. He was too weak even to call the woman he supposedly worshipped and tell her, oh, by the way, he was getting married to someone else!He was a pastiche of &quot;hero&quot; pieces, but he never came together. He was an English PhD who didn't know what century Yeats was from; an attorney who apparently drafted the world's worst will (which costs the heroine her land); a father who can't stir himself to go looking for his runaway son and is real relieved when the boy decides not to visit for Christmas (but then he's furious when an elderly bereaved man refuses to become guardian to a little granddaughter)-- oh, well, suffice to say I could not understand him or his motivation. He never seemed real because he seemed mostly just surface. I kept being &quot;told&quot; how great he was, but never shown.The &quot;heroine&quot; makes little sense either. Suddenly, in the middle of the book, there's a passage about some secret tragedy that is clearly just flung in there to give her reason to cry on the hero's shoulder. Nothing ever happens because of this tragedy-- it's never resolved. I don't think it's ever even mentioned again. Oh, yeah, I was very amused when she went to a priest and confessed her sin, and he told her she hadn't done anything wrong. I sure wish I'd had a priest like that when I went to confession in high school!The paranormal transfiguration to me seemed a denial of both women's personhood, but what difference did it make? After all, they were only there to serve the hero, right?I cannot understand why this got such a huge push from the publisher. Maybe they're more cynical than I think."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"I really did like this book filled with a mystical quality, transendential, quite otherworldly. The book is set in Kansas' Flint Hills. The main characters are Ethan Brown, a lawyer, who loves English poetry and loves the Flint Hills where he always wants to live. With his law degree, and a good lawyer he is, he could have practiced anywhere and made much more money. But the Flint Hills was the only place for him.The second main character is Katie Anne Mackey, thirteen years younger than Ethan, a tomboy type of woman, an only child and very self centered. She wants Ethan for a husband. Katie Anne's family is wealthy, Ethan wants to be a rancher and Katie Anne and folks would help him achieve his dream. Ethan has been married before and has a teen age son.The third main character is Annette Zeldin who is a concert violinist and lives in Paris. She has a six year old daughter, Elianna, and has returned to the Flint Hills to attend her mothers' funeral. She and her father had never been close and seem to actively dislike each other. His only grandchild gets on his nerves. When she was younger,she left Kansas as fast as she can. She has been married and had a baby daughter. The baby was kidnapped and Annette instinctively knows she is dead. Then she goes to Switzerland, holes up in a hotel and reads and reads. Her marriage is finished.

Never has a book touched me so deeply as this debut novel by Janice Graham! I thought that it was beautifully written, and the story was gripping and intense and original.

How misleading. Although I know a lot of work went into this book there were some things that just weren't there. After reading it, I went back over the first 50 or so pages looking for a physical description of the hero - a part of Romance Fiction that I see as a great necessity. I found that he was tall, had large hands, a dark brow, was well-educated - but there were none of the stereo-typical &quot;brown eyes, broad shoulders, pouting lips&quot; that most women read Romance for. I also found the dialog to be lacking in believability. Dialog is difficult for some writers to do convincingly and perhaps Ms. Graham could use some practice in this area.I do congratulate Ms. Graham on having accomplished writing and publishing a novel. I will look for other titles from her in the future in the hopes that with more practice she will be able to hone her craft."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"It's painful to slog through this insipid story"},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"I read everything and anything, from Dean Koontz to Kathleen Woodiwiss, and this has to be one of the most memorable I've ever read!

I admire spare prose, but the writing here is flat, reading more like a long outline for a novel than a novel for the first 100 pages. Likewise, there is no story line until a third of the way into the book, and an odd one at that. [I will give points for originality in one plot twist, however.]Until a third of the way into the book the characters never come to a flicker of life--we are told who and what they are, never shown, and kept at a distance from them.The improbable convergence of a Fullbright scholar in literature turned lawyer who just wants to buy a herd of cows and a one-time concert violinist in a small rural town where neither of them grew up strains credibility. The take on the setting is superficial, and we never really get into the heads or hearts of the two main characters.This is a novel that requires a very patient and sometimes forgiving reader.I do think the author, if she can get inside her characters and get a story started much sooner, may do better in the future."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"Received this book in the mail last night from my mom who said I just had to read this as it was my kind of book. She definitely was right! Stayed up and finished it in three hours. I loved it. Can't wait for some more books from Janice. Sure glad I did not read the reviews because part of the magic of this book is all the twists and turns.Lots of surprises that I enjoyed and yet I wished some of them didn't happen. Yes, it is similar to the Horse Whisperer and Bridges of Madison, but I am one to believe each book should stand on its own. Why compare them? I think they were all just GREAT!"},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"Following &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; Review, (8/16/98) I was about to order this book. It sounded like a good, light read with interesting characters. BUT...the Amazon Review ruined the reading by telling the ending. Kirkus Review's first line spoils the chance of enjoying this book as a fresh reader. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"Its surprising that some readers hated this story. What's not to like? The beginning may slowly build up speed, but deep in the plot, the reader appreciates the character development. At first Firebird appears common to other romances- Man agrees to marry under pressure; A new face in town piques his interest AFTER the engagement is announced. Then watch out - a plot twist is about to blow your mind! I didn't see it coming and couldn't believe what I had just read. From there the hits just kept on coming. The plot winds through a labirynth of twists and turns like a serpentine roller coaster ride. The reader is swept along never knowing where the next drop or derailment may be. I have searched for years to find a book I simply could not put down. Firebird was worth the wait. I read it through the first night. I simply had to know how this story could possibly find resolution. Firebird courts the heart and soul. This is Miss Graham's debut novel, hopefully the first of many to come."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"Janice Graham is off to a great start with this enjoyable love story. If you're expecting a tale of heavy romance, deceit, murder and a multitude of convoluted sub-plots, you won't find much in this book. Instead, one man's love, almost like a prairie fire, starts in one place, is blown to another, and is rekindled in yet a third as relationships grow and transform over time.This story shows how death can be a rebirth (remember that title), and how loving a daughter can be as profound as loving a woman. Love's complications lead to grave happenstance; then maturity, enlightenment, and ultimately a deeper love, are born from tragedy. Happens in real life, too.I'm not the type to dwell on hidden meanings or decipher twists in the plot. So instead, I like to let myself be led wherever the story points. In that regard, this book was perfect for me. Yeah, maybe Ms. Graham isn't the world's best at epic storytelling and character development, but the people in this book are pretty strong nevertheless, with the drama really picking up toward the end. And, maybe the Kansas prairie is a little over-glamorized, but there's a great image there. These would be but minor criticisms rather than major detractors. The story flows well, is easy to read, and you'll identify with all the personalities right away. I enjoyed this book immensely, and finished it in only two days (a rare occurrence for me).Start reading, get into the flow, and you will be moved by this story. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"Graham writes well and this is a very sad but intensely moving novel. I thought Ethan Brown was a rather cold, emotionally barren character, who wasn't really worthy of the love of two good women. The thing that annoyed me about the novel, though, is that although Ethan does eventually fall in love with Katie Anne...it's not really her, he loves but her as Annette. The rather selfish, fickle Katie Anne returns from her near death experience a changed woman - she basically acquires all Annette's characteristics; cultured, a loving mother and selfless: I found this transformation to be totally implausible."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"While a good effort for a first novel, Ms. Graham's effort is still frankly disappointing. Although she lives in Wichita, Kansas, and thus within an arm's reach of the Flint Hills, she fails to present them any more completely or originally than a writer based in, say, Paris, who has read all about them in National Geographic. Her attempts to describe events are also fraught with errors of both fact and logic that too often detract from the story. And finally, the story itself is much too trite. It sounds like the makings of a bad television movie, although modifications by a good screenwriter could perhaps make it much better.Now, after having said all that, it's still enjoyable in lots of ways, in presenting (with a pleasant manner) attractive characters and the type of story the romantic in all of us likes to hear. Those who liked &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; will doubtless find something to like here as well, although it's not as tightly written and crafted as Waller's text.Final opinion: It deserves a prominent place on the shelf in the Romance section, but not one next to Austen or Bronte."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"I can still recall the horror and surprise I felt in the middle crisis of this story. I reread it several times to make sure I had not made a mistake. From that point on the story became more trite though it did have a mystical aspect to it. I felt that the author left the reader dangling in the end with a lot of gaps and holes in the plot. Still it was an interesting read but I wouldn't buy the book- get it at the library. It reminded me quite a bit of The Horse Whisperer but it wasn't of the same caliber."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"Firebird is a wonderful read, a romance that strikes so many emotional chords with the reader, involving realistic characters that it's hard not to relate to. There are moments that provoke genuine happiness from the reader(\\"I love you desperately\\") and ones that are so tragic you find yourself reading them over and over, similar to picking at a scab.The main fault comes in the form of what Ethan Brown's thinking is in falling in love with Katie Anne once again, but when reading it, I was so pulled in by the beauty of the rest of the novel that it didn't bother me, and even made sense somewhat.This is definitely worth a read, though for me her later books, Sarah's Window and especially Safe Harbour, are even better."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"I found this book enjoyable and very easy to read.

I don't usually read &quot;romance&quot; novels because they are generally all alike, but this was more than &quot;dribble&quot;, as one reader put it. It was an inspiration for the soul that love can survive and grow. Even death cannot snuff it out. Who's to say what transcends after we are gone. All I know is, this book made me feel a LOT of different emotions and it made me look at my life and my love for the people in my life and not to take it all for granted or waste it. Maybe those (1) star readers need to re-read it with a more open mind--and heart."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"This book is one of the worst examples of formulaic romanticdrivel I have ever read. Ms Graham cannot write beyond the level ofadolescent romance. She fails to convince with her characters, they are all two-dimensional, flat and banal. They behave in truly unbelievable ways, unquestioning of some of life's fundamentals, such as whether to leave your young child alone in order to go out into the hills and make love with someone you hardly know. Having already lost one child to a dubious nanny and some off-stage villains engaging in some hideous barbarity only hinted at, this behaviour hardly rings true.The &quot;noble sacrifice&quot; so essential to this kind of sloppy plotting, is evidenced in the continual suffering of the female characters for the greater good of the men. By the way, is it considered normal these days in America to make a video of yourself dancing naked as a wedding present for your bridegroom? Ms. Graham attempted to make this bizarre behaviour sound cute. All of them, from Annette's dead mother onwards have to give their all in order for Ms. Graham to attempt to progress the plot. To call it &quot;gothic&quot; is an insult to writers of real talent of that genre. I skipped the last third of this book in order to arrive swiftly at the end. It was a complete waste of my time. To compare it to &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; on the front cover is quite inaccurate. Whilst &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; was not great literature, it was a good read, with convincing characters and a story-line you could at least half believe in. None of which applies to &quot;The Firebird&quot;"},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"I turned back to the Kirkus review and other reviews to find out why in the world I wanted to read this book; I still can't imagine why, since I find Waller's &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; so objectionable, and this reminds me of that genre.

Though considered to be an arrogant Parisienne by the townsfolk, Annette strikes a cord within Ethan's heart.However, Ethan does not want anything to change his comfortable lifestyle, so instead of following his heart, he follows his brain. He becomes engaged to Katie. Still, the strings of the heart cannot be denied and Ethan quickly realizes that he has made an error. He tries to end his engagement, but fails. A second disturbance occurs when a tragic fire changes the lives of the people, including Ethan, forever.FIRERAND is a poignant, heart-stirring romance novel that will leave readers drained by all the emotions the book pulls out of them.

But becoming a distance walker forced me to evaluate what I coud be doing while walking miles and miles. While music seemed like one idea, knowing my love for books, listening to a tape seemed a more apporpriate choice. Today I finished Firebird, written by Janice Graham and read by Richard Poe. I must also tell you that previously to listening to this book, I also read the book several years ago.And while I enjoyed the reader, Richard Poe, very much, I had the same feeling about the tape as I did about the book. I sensed in both cases that Janice Graham is a good writer but tends to over do things and tried a bit to hard to covey both emotions and descriptions. Some of her paragraphs and sentences were lengthy and at times bordered on pure sap. And while at times I really felt the emotions or could see the land, it became just too much to absorb them and then continue on to the next passage. I'm not sure I could also believe the love triangle and the outcome of both betrayal and tragedy but I wouldn't say the book didn't have some merit. I guess I just wanted fewer words or less adjectives to describe the land and feelings. All and all if we say some books are too sparsely written, this one really won an award for being too verbose.On the plus side, though, I must have thought that Graham could do better and I recently also read her newest book, Sarah's Window, which I found to be a poignant and well written book."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"A fragmented story line involving unbelieveable characters with minimal (if any) chemistry---it just doesn't work as a romance novel!"},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"Oooohhh, this book by Janice Graham was absolutely fantastic!!!

Implausible? Not if one accepts that life is just not about the physical or concrete, but that our core is seperate from the physical skin we are encased in. Ms. Graham is well equipped to deal with such an issue and experiencing her novel is, indeed, experiencing God and the soul he creates. &quot;Firebird&quot; tells the story of Ethan Brown, a small town lawyer with stronger ties to being a rancher. Engaged to Katie Anne he has doubts about her and their marriage. Attending the funeral of her mother, Annette Zeldin returns home and, in trying to settle her mothers estate, she meets Ethan Brown. The attraction is strong and the two fall in love and begin a passionate affair. Ethan breaks off his engagement to Katie Anne; however, she quickly schemes to get him back and in doing so Ethan marries the woman he does not love. Tragedy, however, strikes both Annette and Katie Anne and, as a result, Ethan is torn between the woman he sees as his wife and the being which lies underneath. Sounds confusing but it is not when the reader reads this novel. There is much promise to this first time novelist and I look forward to future novels. The reason I did not rate this the highest score possible is that I would have liked Ms. Graham's prose to be a little more intricate - this book reads a liitle to simple - not that simple is bad; however, the material Ms. Graham tackles calls for more intricate, thought-provoking writing. Still, it is a wonderful read and Ms. Graham captures both the romance novel and serious fiction in one nice package."},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","review":"This predictable and sappily written book was a total waste of time.

Leibholz says in the book, \\"Bonhoeffer was firmly and rightly convinced that it is not only a Christian right but a Christian duty towards God to oppose tyranny, that is, a government which is no longer based on natural law and the law of god.\\"Great reading for those serious about their faith and wishing to grow in that faith."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"It is more than insight into A walk and relationship with the Lord Jesus, It is a changing, spiritual, powerfull,and highly needed reality of Christ as Lord of my life."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"\\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" by Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a spiritual classic. In a sense, it's an extended meditation on one of my favorite verses of the Bible, Matthew 16:24 - \\"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\\" One of the problems with the liberal Christianity of Nazi Germany, as well as for the 21st century American church, is what Bonhoeffer called \\"cheap grace.\\" Cheap grace is the overreaction by Protestants to the medieval Roman Catholic theology, in which it's possible to have a cheap grace that re quires nothing of the disciple.Bonhoeffer defines \\"cheap grace\\" as \\"the justification of sin without the justification of the sinner\\" and \\"the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession.\\" \\"Cheap grace is grace without discipleship.\\"Living under the weakened, liberal, state Christianity of Germany in the 1930, Bonhoeffer understood cheap grace and thought it more ruinous than a theology of works. He understood the true cost of discipleship to the point of losing his life for Christ. Bonhoeffer didn't only teach about the cost of discipleship: he paid the cost of discipleship.\\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" is filled with challenging words about the need to give our entire lives to Christ and hold nothing back. Bonhoeffer writes, for example, that \\"only he who believes is obedient, and only he who is obedient believes.\\" With such teaching, he provides a more biblical alternative to both works righteousness and cheap grace. He also teaches that every moment challenges us to action and obedience and that we must bear the Cross every day because giving up ourselves is painful. Hmmmm. Sounds a lot like the teachings of Jesus Christ!Bonhoeffer goes on to discuss righteousness as being the righteousness of Christ; as a result, communion with Christ is all important. This leads naturally to a discussion of baptism and the Church. He's right to say that Christ commissioned His disciples to proclaim and do all that He did, and I like how he places the call to discipleship in the context of the Body of Christ instead of making it a purely individual pursuit.\\"The Cost of Discleship\\" is therefore in continuity with the Christian spiritual writers of all ages in rightly assessing what it means to truly be a disciple of Jesus Christ. It's a welcome antidote to the cheap grace of today, just as it was in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"The Cost of Discipleship seems to have been presciently written for our modern and post-modern approaches to Christianity. Whether it is combating the consumerist approach, an enculturated church or a church cheap grace, the message of costly grace and repentant discipleship of Bonhoeffer is timely and necessary for Christians today, especially Christians in western cultures.Bonhoeffer illustrates the call of Jesus to die to one's self and to follow him in the way of the cross. Bonhoeffer's writing may seem harsh and works-oriented at times, but overall it is congruent with the New Testament, the early church Fathers and the Reformers Luther and Calvin. However, it is harsh and alien to much of Christian culture of today that affirms rather than convicts, and coddles rather than challenges, and seeks to make comfortable rather than rejoice in sufferings and hardships.I think Bonhoeffer's writing on grace is on par with Luther's disputations on the theology of the cross versus the theology of glory. Bonhoeffer exposits the Sermon on the Mount as being illustrative of life in the kingdom of heaven under Christ's rule and by his grace. He does not let readers off the hook due to the impossibility of fulfilling Christ's demands; rather, he urges readers to live into Christ's teachings through his grace and his presence working within us and by allowing ourselves to be crucified with Christ.Bonhoeffer emphasizes the communion of saints and how all Christians are being transformed by God into the image of Christ. He writes that before we can experience of glory of Christ we are called to experience the death and suffering of Christ, even as Paul writes to the Phillipians.The Cost of Discipleship ought to be a necessary read for today's Christian."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"For anyone wanting a great challenge to break free from the ho-hum of cultural Christianity, this book is for you! Bonhoeffer is one of those modern day theologians Christians can really look up to and learn from. In the Cost of Discipleship, Bonhoeffer writes about grace, our call to discipleship, and what obedience to Christ should look like. He then goes through the Sermon on the Mount and seeks to unravel this all-important text so that today's Christians can better understand the words of Christ and put them into practice.What many people fail to realize is that Christ did not just come to earth to save people, He came to teach people how to truly live! Bonhoeffer is one who realized this fact and he sought to live out this truth in his life. He wrestled with what it truly means to be saved by grace and understood that we can not simply live however we want after becoming \\"saved\\" but our lives need to be lived in obedience to Christ and following His call of discipleship. Without a life spent in obedience to God and following this call, who can say that they are saved at all? This is nothing short of cheap grace which costs the person nothing. However, costly grace (the grace which saves) costs a person everything!I highly recommend this book for those people who desire something more out of this life than what modern day Christianity offers most of the time. This is not a quick fix however, but this is something which will take years to come to fruition. One thing I promise though: if you take this book seriously, you will never be the same!"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Long ago and far away there was an ungodly, oppressive social and political climate in Germany that is almost beyond comprehension to the minds of today's younger generation. In those days the challenges to following Christ were earth shattering. The crisis of personal integrity and true allegiance to Jesus was unbearable to countless Christians. Multitudes of Christians failed to do what Jesus would do. But there was at least one Standard Bearer of the gospel, one follower of Christ worthy of the name \\"disciple,\\" the man Dietrich Bonhoeffer. His comments, insights, and perspectives set forth in this book are of extreme importance for every single follower of Christ. It is a \\"must read\\" for anyone that calls himself or herself Christian. I cannot imagine that anyone who reads and studies this book will emerge unchanged in heart and mind. Bonhoeffer opens the depths and pure truth especially of the Sermon on the Mount. The book is well worth its purchase for the Sermon on the Mount alone. But be forewarned, this book is not easy fare. It was written in the crucible of life and death and as such addresses profound issues. For maximum benefit the text requires study, reading and re-reading numerous passages over and over again until comprehension dawns like thunder. But it is well worth it! Far from displaying any negative burden or ambiance, Bonhoeffer reveals the personally exciting and inspiring heights of God's love, mercy, and grace towards mankind even in its darkest hours."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"In a book that takes no prisoners on the battlefield of discipleship, Bonhoeffer challenges Christians with the distinctions between cheap grace and costly grace, between comfortable Christianity and a life sold out to the lordship of Jesus Christ. Published when he was 31, Bonhoeffer wrote in the bitterest crisis of German Christianity...the ascension of Hitler to political power and a German \\"Reich Church\\" that saw him as the Fatherland's messiah. It was not a time in Germany to soft-pedal Christian wares nor, in Bonhoeffer's mind, was there ever a time to dilute one's adherence to Christ.A demanding read, it will take time to digest his thoughts and let the challenge of Christ's call on a person's life find its resonance in your soul."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"\\"Only those who believe obey\\" \\"Only those who obey believe\\" A True Christian is one who Follows and Worship the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

If any man will come after Jesus must deny himself take up the cross and follow him. For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for Jesus sake and the gospel's shall save it. \\"It is not suffering per se but suffering-and-rejection, and not rejection for any cause or conviction of our own, but rejection for the sake of Christ\\""},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"A Christian classic, The Cost of Discipleship is filled with countless gems of wisdom that run counter to the prevailing winds today that market the Christian life as one of ease and comfort. The book is not an easy read, but it is an encouraging and is probably more valuable for Christians today than even during Bonhoeffer's own time. The book is more than a call to costly discipleship, Bonhoeffer also dives into the Sermon on the Mount giving incredible insight in to the teachings of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew and also various aspects of the Christian life and the role of the Church. But the first couple of chapters of the book are worth the entire read. Bonhoeffer's radical discipleship can probably best be summarized in his famous line, \\"When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die.\\" We see far too little of Bonhoeffer's commitment and dedication to the denial of self, taking up one's cross and following Christ...The Cost of Discipleship reminds those who follow Christ that sharing in His sufferings is the mark of a believer!"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"When I first read this book I was brought to my knees and tears!

I made a deeper commitment to my Christian Life and have never looked back. This book is a cornerstone of my faith. It is a must read for anyone who wants to be used by God."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer in his classic treatise on the first step in truly following Christ gives anyone who reads this work very little wiggle room to deny what he is saying. Bonhoeffer opens his work with the call of Levi, who was called and followed without hesitation. The author points out to us this call is not a mental decision, it is rather just a decision under the authority of Jesus Christ.This call from Christ, and the subsequent following of Levi, comes with no praise for obedience. The author shows us that there is only obedience, without the expectation of praise for simply doing what we are all created to do; follow Christ. Levi follows simply for the sake of the call, not for what he might get out of following Christ. Bonhoeffer would have us believe this is the ultimate model for us to use in choosing to follow Christ. Through this call, there is significance, but only in Christ, who is the only significance, he alone is important. (Bonhoeffer, 59)It is here that he turns to looking at what is not true discipleship, which included having an abstract Christology, religious knowledge and theological knowledge. If it is an abstract idea, it is not real discipleship. He hammers home this point in saying, &quot;Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably Christianity without discipleship.&quot; (59) This kind of religion talks about God, but not his living and transformational son Jesus Christ.The next part of his essay turns to comparing three disciples and how they reacted to Christ's call. The first, who we already have touched on did not hesitate and followed Christ immediately. The author says that the disciple did not call himself to this chosen destiny, rather Christ alone can call. Our decision lies in whether we follow or not. The second disciple asks Jesus if he can bury his father before he follows him. (60) Although this was the law at the time, Jesus, who is superior to the law let the man fulfill the ordinance in order that he could then follow Christ. Bonhoeffer shows us now that Christ made himself at that point an opponent of the law, above the law, and the only law that matters. (61)The third disciple has his own ideas about what it will look like to follow Christ. This, the author says, is inconsistent because it renders Christ's call into human terms, which it is not. This puts Christ into a box, and, if it worked that way, would let us determine what our path in life would be. Bonhoeffer acknowledges that this is possible, but would not be the true call Christ has for our life. As soon as this disciple expresses his willingness to follow, he does not really want to follow at all. (61)The author then goes into what exactly this call looks like. First and foremost is that the call will change the person's life dramatically. They must leave their old situation. This call must be heard and than acted upon. He says, &quot;The road to faith passes through obedience to the call of Jesus.&quot; (63) He continues on commanding us that Jesus' call is the only thing that makes faith possible. Only the call is important, and this call leads us to faith. He also shows us that faith and obedience are separate but there is a unity between these two in the call to follow Christ.This is where he reiterates that the first step hearing the call and following is the most important piece. Jesus wants us to show him we will follow, not talk about it. It is in this obedience that we show our faith. Bonhoeffer than attempts to show us that if we are trying to keep some part of our life under our own control, we are being disobedient.This document finishes with the author's treatise on the rich young man who came to Christ and asked what he needed to do to have eternal life. Christ knew this about the young man and told him to leave everything and follow him. The young man was presented with this and could not, and went away sad. Bonhoeffer shows us how Christ creates a situation where there can be &quot;no retreat.&quot; (75) This man was confronted with the eternal Son of God, and walked away.Bonhoeffer is completely convincing in his call to discipleship. There is hardly any way one can argue with what he has to say about the life of Christ and what Christ is calling us to do. He backs this up with sound doctrine, using the example of three disciples and how they did or did not follow Jesus' call. The author shows what each man had to do to follow Christ, the perfect example being Levi who just simply hear the call, and went. The interesting disciple is the third disciple who wanted to map out his own course for living, and in that he had lost his way. The author was strong here in showing that we must follow Christ and not set any stipulations along the way. It is all or nothing in Bonhoeffer's view, which he convinces this reader is completely accurate.There is no lack of clarity in the statement; &quot;The road to faith passes through obedience to the call of Jesus.&quot; (63) How can anyone ever learn what true faith is unless we are under the will of God for our lives. Bonhoeffer reinforces my view that unless Christ is transforming us through following his call, our faith is empty and really no faith at all.I highly recommend this work, prepare to be challenged when you read it."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer's demanding book is mandantory for any professing christian{i think he would sqirm at that term.}The idea that one would be &quot;saved&quot; simply by saying so is repugnant to one who saw what was coming.Read some popular &quot;religious&quot; christian literature,then read Bonhoeffer.You will realize that he is speaking of a completely different faith,never mind religion.No fuzzy new-age garbage here.I cannot imagine an adult who would not be troubled by Bonhoeffer,for there seems to be no distinction between what he said, and what he did.Would that be true for all."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Twentysome years ago, one of the first Bible studies I ever authored was entitled \\"Cheap Grace.\\" The study was inspired by an old old song by Steve Camp, who was, in turn, inspired by those same words penned in the book The Cost of Discipleship.So after all those years, I finally got around to reading this classic, written by Dietrich Bonhoeffer. There is much that can be said about Bonhoeffer the man and Bonhoeffer the theologian, but I will leave that to another time, and focus solely on this book which has challenged the lives of so many.The Cost of Discipleship can really be thought of as four short books; for its four main divisions, although all speaking of discipleship, are distinct enough to stand on their own thematically.The first division of the book is both the most famous and the most challenging, being an extended essay on the true nature of grace contrasted with its widespread distorted definitions and the resulting abuse of its meaning and the God behind it. The first sentence of the first chapter sums it up, \\"Cheap grace is the deadly enemy of our Church.\\" There are sentences I have underlined all through these first five chapters:To deny oneself is to be aware only of Christ and no more of self.When Christ calls a man, He bids him come and die.We have watered down the gospel into emotional uplift which makes no costly demands and fails to distinguish between natural and Christian existence.Jesus has to create (with the rich young ruler) a situation in which there can be no retreat, an irrevocable situation.The man who disobeys cannot believe, for only he who obeys can believe.Christ must make it clear from the start that his word is not an abstract doctrine, but the re-creation of the whole life from man.Jesus summons men to follow Him not as a teacher or a pattern of the good life, but as the Christ, the Son of God.The second division of the book is an extended devotion & exposition of the Sermon on the Mount. There are some chapters which are very insightful, such as the chapter on Matthew 6:16-18. A favorite quote: When all is said and done, the life of faith is nothing if not an unending struggle of the spirit with every available weapon against the flesh. Other chapters I felt were uneven or even marginal.The third divison, entitled \\"The Messengers,\\" explores Matthew 9:35-10:42, where the apostles are commissioned to minister to Israel. It is short (20 pages) and honestly could have been shorter.The last division is on the church-the nature of discipleship and the Christian life within the corporate body. Like the first section, there is some profound stuff here:The old man cannot will his own death or kill himself. He can only die in, through and with Christ.Baptism incorporates us into the unity of the body of Christ, and the Lord's Supper fosters and sustains our fellowship and communion in that Body.Now through Word and Sacrament the body of Christ is no longer confined to a single place.If the Church refuses to face the stern reality of sin, it will gain no credence when it talks of forgiveness.The Cost of Discipleship, although uneven in places, shows more than enough genius of writing and profound insight into the truth of Christ to merit it on any follower's bookshelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"I agree with the others who have praised this book; even their minor criticisms I share. I have read it through very carefully twice (once in my 30's; later in my 50's) and have moderated a Sunday School discussion class who took on Bonhoeffer and read him very carefully and critically against the Bible. Bonhoeffer (who, amazingly, wrote this book at age 31) did his Lord proud.This is not an easy book to read. It is meat, not milk. Yes, you do have to be a saint, i.e. a believer, i.e. a disciple in order to be a Christian. Having faith means being faithful. Having faith means bearing fruit. Having faith means being a disciple. Calling Jesus, &quot;Lord&quot; means obeying Him. Jesus, not Bonhoeffer, not the RC Church nor Luther nor Calvin nor whoever else may &quot;speak to you&quot; is the One Who says, &quot;Take up your cross and follow me.&quot; Pastor Bonhoeffer leads the reader through some fairly profound meditations on discipleship. One does not simply read this book as though it were a magazine story; he must read and re-read and re-read again passage after passage as he works his way through it.If you are quite comfortable in knowing you are &quot;saved by grace through faith,&quot; and freed from the tyranny of the works of the flesh and the Law, wonderful. But ask yourself whether Jesus suffered and died on the cross just so you could be comfortable in your &quot;faith.&quot; If it occurs to you that there may be more to faith than creeds, confessions, and church attendance, that you were given the gift - and gifts - of the Spirit for some purpose other than as a voucher for your personal ticket to Heaven, you may find this book very helpful. In any event, should you read it, it will challenge you in many marvellous ways.It is quite difficult, I think, to fully appreciate what the man wrote without understanding and contemplating what was going on (and eventually transpired) in his life, church, country, and world. Thus, I recommend that anyone who reads this learn as much about these other things as he reasonably can, for which purpose there are many options, including books, articles, and films on video and DVD."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Bonhoeffer was a brilliant German Lutheran theologian who was martyred by the Nazis. This work is an intense exposition of his understanding of Christian discipleship. After an initial section dealing with grace and discipleship (in which he presents his classic dualism of &quot;cheap grace&quot; and &quot;costly grace&quot;), he jets into highly descriptive interpretations of the beatitudes and other key Matthean passages on discipleship. The last portion is a discussion of the church and its functions in the world.Good: This is thoroughly uncompromised Christianity at it's finest. Watered-down Christianity does little good to anyone. Bonhoeffer writes, &quot;If our Christianity has ceased to be serious about discipleship, if we have watered down the gospel into emotional uplift which makes no costly demands and which fails to distinguish between natural and Christian existence, then we cannot help regarding the cross as an ordinary everyday calamity, as one of the trials and tribulations of life. We have then forgotten that the cross means rejection and shame as well as suffering.&quot; The whole book is like that: true discipleship is presented in full force. Bad: Bonhoeffer is so intense in his preaching that it's hard to soak in everything he says. This book will be best understood when readings are spread over a period of time. This guy is an old-style Lutheran who uses no illustrations or sermon-helps. A quick read of it will do you little good.Opinion: Perhaps the most famous quote from this work is this one: &quot;When Christ calls a man he bids him come and die.&quot; This book is much more interesting given the backdrop of Bonhoeffer's life: he deliberately passed up several opportunities to flee Nazi persecution for his own safety, choosing instead to stay in his country and attempt to stop Hitler's oppression. This clearly was a man who practiced what he preached."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"In addition to the other reviews listed here:Faith and obedience explained - The most revealing description of the relationship of these two essential concepts of Christianity. \\"There cannot be obedience without faith\\" and &quot;there is no faith without obedience;\\" these two statements are revealed to be concurrently operative through grace. But, read it for yourself... I couldn't possibly improve on Bonhoeffer's work.This book also \\"held up a mirror\\" to me and reflected where I was in my discipleship and gave me fresh insight on where I needed to be headed in my relations with my church, my fellow believers, my world and my Lord. This is a must read for all who feel called to serve, or are serving, as leaders."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Staggering in its theological depth and its unflinching call for the crucifixion of self, \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" is a true classic, an essential book for any Christian library.That Bonhoeffer truly lived what he wrote is reflected in his martyr's death at the hands of the Nazis mere days before the liberation of Germany. Given plenty of chances to leave the country, he instead stayed, claiming that the raising up of pastors in Germany during the time of war was essential to the nation's future.But back to the book...\\"Cost of Discipleship\\" is a challenging call to more radical discipleship. The famous line from this book, \\"When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die,\\" is the bedrock upon which Bonhoeffer bases his entire premise. That Christ paid a penalty for our sins that cannot be acquired by any means except through His grace and faith in Him alone seems like a given in the Christian life. But Bonhoeffer renews a concept that was under attack in his day by the growing liberal theology: following Christ means dying to self. In the shadow of the rise of psychology that simultaneously arrived with the deconstructionist theology, the idea that must one abandon self to Christ seemed outdated, but Bonhoeffer stayed the course. Dying to self flew in the face of what the intelligentsia were espousing and what the general populace were beginning to believe.Bonhoeffer also broke with his Lutheran predecessor, Martin Luther, who once said, \\"Sin boldly, but love God more boldly still.\\" What this book asks is a consideration of the cost Christ paid for us on the cross. What comes with knowledge of this is the realization that to take sin lightly is to trample on the very blood of Christ. Grace is to be had for those that ask for it, but it is not cheap - an enormous cost was paid. To sin boldly shows contempt for the death of the Savior.To this day, \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" has remained controversial. At a time when personal fulfillment and the gratification of self are out of control (even in the Church), Bonhoeffer's masterpiece is a clarion call to a generation spiraling out of control. The cheap grace of hyperdispensationalism and the blas&eacute; attitudes of many Christians concerning their own sin need to be countered, and this book provides that in full.While I cannot comment on this translation of \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" (my copy is by a different translator), Bonhoeffer's words will still erupt from the page. Get this book as soon as possible if you have not read it - it will return incredible dividends in your own walk with Christ."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Years ago, I discovered Bonhoeffer through his rich and tested \\"Letters and Papers from Prison.\\" He gave theological insights that were the flesh and meat of real-life experience, having faced imprisonment and eventual execution at the hands of the Nazis.I picked up \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" and expected to find Bonhoeffer's same sort of humbled yet strong, tested and true, faith. Instead, I found a ponderous volume of theological concepts (and I do agree with most of what he says here) that were penned before Bonhoeffer's ideas were purified by true fire. This doesn't undermine their value at all. In fact, I know that he was addressing many errors, including \\"cheap grace,\\" that had plagued the Lutheran Church in Germany. He was wrestling through some of these fallacies, dialoguing with Karl Barth and other contemporaries, and boldly taking a stance that was necessary, vital, and that still remains ignored by many of his denomination today.For me, the problem as a reader in 2009 is that the writing itself is pedantic and plodding. The truths, although dredged from Scripture, are presented in a way that sounds more moralizing, without the biblical bases always being explored in full. And there is little actual application to real life. This is where \\"The Letters and Papers...\\" makes a huge leap forward, feeling like gritty faith worked out in its most terrible crucible. \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" seems to be more a seminal, yet dated, correction to the errors of religion in pre-WWII Germany.Is this worth reading for personal growth and exhortation? Certainly. Is it still valid as a correcting agent in the mire of stuffy religion? Yes. But will it reach the average believer with truths that apply to daily life and seem to come from a place we can relate to? For me, the answer is no."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"In a day and age, especially in America but even now around the globe, when elements of the church are preaching a prosperity gospel of \\"health and wealth,\\" Bonhoeffer's Cost of Discipleship serves as an excellent challenge, a warning and an encouragment all within this book.Bonhoeffer challenges the church to not be contented in merely dispensing religious and spiritual activities as if it were handing out candy at a fair or carnival. Bonhoeffer warns against the type of preaching and teaching that is lukewarm and calls for no sacrifice or commitment. Bonhoeffer's words also serve as an encouragement to those within the church that are paying a price for their faith.Interestingly, Bonhoeffer acknowledges that there will be an inequality in terms of the cost - for some it may mean even death, for others it may mean something less, but regardless, each one is asked to bear the cost that God gives them.If the Christian life is a social network for you. If the Christian life is an obligation or tradition for you. If the Christian life is just the latest and greatest thing in your quest for spirtuality. Then, I would strongly warn you against reading this book because you will be struck with conviction. Each person that has read this book that I have known have seen dramatic change in the way they think, feel, experience, and live the Christian life...so be warned!"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"I have started to read this book, and I have been challenged by every page.

This book takes on the struggle of all who believe God is just and righteous but created a world of choice. Can a person truly know the love and mercy of God without personal cost? Does the spiritual go at odds with the religious? Cheap grace is determined the culprit. Careful, concise, well reasoned, this book will aid the serious student and faithful follower of Jesus Christ in the effort to better understand the life of faith. The polarized environment of 2012 makes this book a fine addition as discussion of truth is attempted.The e-book edition on the Kindle Fire makes reading this book most enjoyable.

As I read, it was always in the back of my mind that here is a man who walked the talk he is talking."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"The Cost of Discipleship by Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a modern classic which has had a profound effect upon modern theology. It is written by a Luthern clergyman in Germany who was facing death as a member of the German underground and his rebellion against Adolf Hitler. Bonhoeffer wrote in a style that is relatively easy to read and understand. Beware! It strips away much of the facade which we have applied to ourselves over the years leaving our souls exposed and naked before God."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"I had just finished reading \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" and the one thing I am sorry about concerning this book is that I had not read it years ago. I have read and heard many discourses on \\"The Sermon on the Mount\\" but seldom have I ever had it presented so clearly as to make a practical application of it's principles. But as Mr Bonhoeffer so clearly brings out, these teachings are not some nice neat little philosophy to contemplate, but a definite path or way of living that the individual needs to implement into their life by making a decision and taking a course of action. It is NOT the listening but the doing, that determines the choice of obedience. I am half way through my second reading and I have placed so many highlights and notes in the margins of this book that I may half to order a second copy.

It goes counter to the common understanding of what is meant by \\"faith alone\\" among many Christians from Protestant traditions. Faith alone cannot be confused with what Bonhoeffer called \\"easy believism.\\" If it is, then it is really no faith at all. The apostle Paul, in his epistle to the Romans, uses the words obedience and faith as if synonymous (see Romans 1:5 and 16:26) . Faith alone that does not necessarily involve obedience is no faith at all - and so even the great Catholic theologian now Pope, Josef Ratzinger, can admire and quote the great Lutheran, Bonhoeffer as an example for all Christians. One is also reminded of a like mind in the American Evangelical, A. W. Tozer and his great work,I Call It Heresy. Given the works of Protestants such as Bonhoeffer and Tozer, one has to beg the question, why do we remain divided over \\"faith alone?\\" The differences are likely not so great as we might think. By the definition of \\"faith\\" provided by St. Paul, Bonhoeffer, and Tozer, one might include that Catholics and these Protestants agree that salvation is indeed by such \\"faith alone.\\" Anything less is simply the same old heresy."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"The cost of discipleship is an excellent book that will challenge your walk with God, The life of Bro.

I recommend this book without reservation to any and all who would dedicate themselves to reading it."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"might be one way to describe the message conveyed in this book. Dietrich Bonhoeffer relates how we as Christians must \\"carry the cross\\" and by doing so, we must experience some amount of suffering and sacrifice on earth as Jesus did for our salvation. The Lord's grace comes at a price. The rewards of His efforts are not free. We can't assume that mere faith and God's grace will land us a spot in heaven. We have to be worthy of that grace. Obedience and service to Him is paramount.Dietrich Bonhoeffer's book is enlightening and very powerful. It comes as a wake up call to all those that feel comfortable living their day to day lives without any kind of real personal sacrifices or sufferings.

He contrasts the cheap grace (to just believe) with the costly grace by which we are saved, if we continue in obedience to Christ. He brings the reader to the Cross of Christ and takes the Sermon on the Mount as a command rather than an ideal. In conclusion he applies his teaching within the context of the greater community of Christ that is found in the Church.Coming from a Baptist background and having been liberated with Reformation theology I have found this book (particularily sections I and II) to be helpful in dealing with both doubts and self-sufficency. It is by faith alone that we are saved, but that faith is never alone.

Typical of his forceful expression is the passage where he shows how cheap grace becomes just another law to bind people to a selfish lifestyle while all the time masquerading as the gift of God. In his own words \\"Grace interpreted as a principle, pecca fortiter as a principle, grace at a low cost, is in the last resort simply a new law, which brings neither help nor freedom.Grace as a living word, pecca fortiter as our comfort in tribulation and as a summons to discipleship, costly grace is the only pure grace, which really forgives sins and gives freedom to the sinner.We ........have gathered like eagles round the carcase of cheap grace, and there we have drunk of the poison which has killed the life of following Christ.\\"The fine distinction between following a correct doctrine but abusing it and following Christ in the dynamic of grace is masterfully handled in this work which desperately needs airing in this day of cheap grace.Discipleship takes on a new meaning as he discusses the differences between being obedient to Christ by prescription and following Christ in a living relationship with him in a contemporary world. All the more remarkable is this book as we recognize the circumstances under which it was written and the price which Bonhoeffer ultimately paid in order to live by what he had written.\\"When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die\\"- Dietrich Bonhoeffer, The Cost of Discipleship"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Where does one begin?This is a book that will profoundly change your understanding about what it means to be a person of faith in the world. Bonhoeffer challenges us to look beyond the values of this world, and asks us are we willing to embrace the true cost of discipleship? His analysis of cheap grace, and its corrupting influence reminds us that there are times that we have to challenge the powers of this world, that there are times when to be a good Christian means we can't always be a good citizen.Bonhoeffer wrote in the shadow of evil, made even worse by the reality that many so-called Christians were only too willing to serve Adolf Hitler and his evil regime. Bonhoeffer makes it clear to the reader that cheap grace is at the heart of such fatal compromises of faith, that allow evil to flourish. It is through understanding costly grace, that we can embrace discipleship that will allow us to witness to this world in such a way that we are freed from the powers of this world.Bonhoeffer's words are just as important today, as they were in the dark days of the Nazis, and will always challenge us in our faith."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"'When Christ calls a man,' says Dietrich Bonhoeffer, 'he bids him come and die'. There are different kinds of dying, it is true;but the essence of discipleship is contained in those words'. And thus begins this wonderful books and a foreword by G.K. A. Bell the late Bishop of Chichester.Dietrich Bonhoeffer then begins 'Cheap grace is the deadly enemy of our church. We are fighting to-day for costly grace. Cheap grace means grace sold on the market like cheapjacks' wares. The sacraments, the foreignness of sin, and the consolations of religion are thrown away at cut prices.In section 1 he writes about Costly Grace, The Call to Discipleship which I think any serious Christian needs to read and really think about, because here in the west I know few Christians who are willing to die for the faith. He then writes of Single Minded Obedience which I think is also a must read chapter because I truly believe we are not all meant to do the same thing, become the same cookie cutter Christian. This is why the Bible speaks about each of us being given a gift, talent by God.The second section deals with The Sermon On The Mount and the Beatitudes, truthfulness, revenge and other timely subjects.And Hidden Righteousness and then Prayer. These two sections really spoke to me, mainly because as an American I sometimes feel odd, because I don't pray in public or don't do good deeds in a obvious or blatantly visible way. And as such I loved what Dietrich Bonhoeffer does in reminding each of us that when we pray, when we live a Christian life, its to be quiet and natural and not at all like a grand production.This is a book I have read and re read and will continue to re read and glean wisdom from, because Dietrich Bonhoeffer was one of those rare Christians I believe all Christians should be required to know about and whose books should be required or at least suggested reading. The man humbles me. Makes me think. Makes me ask myself if I am really willing to die for my faith."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Bonhoeffer explains clearly what I knew to be true better than I could ever comprehend myself.

Bonhoeffer realized that Believing and Obeying were synonymous and it rocked the foundations of his world. He \`counted' the cost of discipleship and found Grace a Costly Truth. Cheap Grace, as he called it, is grace bestowed on ourselves, preaching forgiveness without requiring repentance, eliminating self denial and the death of self life. Cheap Grace is grace without Discipleship. This book will drive home the important Truth that GRACE is NOT LISENCE to sin. It is the Power of God to Transform a sinful soul into Newness of Life. To continue a habitual practice of sin after coming to Christ would be an \`Insult', to the Spirit of Grace! And it would contradict the very essence of scriptural truth. When the Scripture says Believe and be saved, it is challenging you to OBEY and FOLLOW! This Bonhoeffer clearly spells out in his extensive study of Discipleship. Regardless how his own life turned out, the Truth still stands. Only Total Obedience to Christ is true soul saving Faith, and only the New Birth from above can deliver us from the corrupting influence of sin and make us \`partakers' of the Divine nature. \\"Since you OBEYED from your heart that form of doctrine TO which you were delivered and having been set FREE from sin you become slaves to righteousness.\\" That's the Grace of Scripture.

Sermon like; he brings about ways of reading the scriptures to a new level of understanding. I can't state the importance of this book enough.The book begins with a memoir by G. Leibholz: Bonhoeffer did not take the pacifist line, he felt it was our duty as Christians to oppose tyranny; the liberalized church didn't think so. \\"Thus Bonhoeffer's life and death have given us great hope for the future. He has set a model for a new type of true leadership inspired by the gospel, daily ready for martyrdom and death and imbued by a new spirit of Christian humanism and a creative sense of civic duty. The victory which he has won was a victory for us all, a conquest never to be undone, of love, light and liberty.\\"Bonhoeffer points to: Christ is the cost----the church has only succeeded in cheapening it; as disciples we have no special powers on others, only Christ has the ability, for \\"the word of cheap grace has been the ruin of more Christians than any commandment of works.\\" And he says, \\"How can you hope to enter into communion with him when at some point in your life you are running away form him? The man who disobeys cannot believe, for only he who obeys can believe\\", or only those who believe obey, and only those who obey believe. Powerful are his words on Christ's fulfillment of the commandments (sermon on the mount), for we are to hear the word and obey the will of Christ----it is the same now as it was then. Is it not shameful that so many German pastors did not read or hear Dietrich's words, for if they did, they did not listen.Are we not all commanded to follow Him?, not just the select few; are you? We would give our life for our child, would you give it for Christ (even first)? Ask yourself: do you, or have you, endured persecution and or suffering because of your faith?----you should. What will it be: nature, the state, the self, or Christ? A little of each?; we cannot serve two masters. \\"Indeed it is wrong to speak of the Christian life: we should speak rather of Christ living in us\\"Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Bonhoeffer was a real-life hero. He was a modern-day martyr.'Salvation through following Jesus is not something we men can achieve for ourselves - but with God all things are possible.''For with God nothing shall be impossible.' Luke 1:37The original Greek reads: 'None of God's word shall be without dynamic.' p 85That excludes by definition the words of positive confessionist, Joel Osteen.Before going to Germany to trade blows with Nazism, Dietrich Bonhoeffer characterized American Evangelicalism as 'Protestantism without the Reformation':'God has granted American Christianity no Reformation.

I found it as convicting this last time as I did the first time. If Bonhoeffer wrote this in the midst of a church culture that was making room for the rise of Nazism, it makes one wonder what lies ahead for our own culture. In an age in which so-called Christianity has grown progressively more self-centered - from the prosperity gospel to the free grace movement which requires no change in the individual - \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" is a book that should be revisited often and thoroughly digested upon each visit."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Bonhoeffer has always been an appropriate challenge and reminder to the Western church about the incredible value of the grace of God, and how that ought to radically transform our mindset.This book is hard to ignore. It will either elicit cheers and statements like, \\"THAT'S what I've been trying to say, but I couldn't put words to it!\\" or it will put you on your behind, and force you to come to terms with your weak faith, or both and more.For me, it was the latter. He articulated several things I had been pondering on my own, and he also challenged me to take the next steps in making my life one submitted to Christ more fully. there were times when my inadequacies were very clearly pointed out, and he was always good to remind of where our hope lies - not in our own ability to make ourselves better people, but in the grace of God transforming our lives for His glory.On a more personal note, I do disagree with some of his interpretations of various passages on the Sermon on the Mount, but I do appreciate the consistency he was trying to achieve in reading the passage as a whole.The challenge of Bonhoeffer's life for all of Christianity is one that may remain a mystery forever - how does one so committed to pacifism and non-violence (as is clear in this book) end up in a plot to assassinate Hitler? What caused him to change his mind? Was that the right thing to do? Why or why not?"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Bonhoeffer's words reveal a man willing to die for his beliefs. Passages in this book are strangely prophetic to the death he would die in the aftermath of Hitler's Reich. He draws solely from Scripture as his inspiration for each chapter, including the Sermon on the Mount and others. He reveals an apostle-like reverence for Luther, which seems a little over the top and there is a lull in the 3rd quarter or so of the book, but it doesn't not disappoint. It finishes strong and the end is worth the lull. Most of all, Bonhoeffer's fate validates all that he writes in here, and that alone should convict us about the true price of doing as Christ did."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"The Cost of Discipleship covers several topics, all of which touch on basic Christian doctrine. It centralizes around whom Jesus is and his relation to us. The book begins with a chapter on the difference between cheap and costly grace. This chapter sets the tone for the rest of the book. Bonhoeffer realized that once given to Christ, an individual must do more than just claim religion and attend Sunday church services. He describes the call to discipleship and how we are to relate to Christ after becoming Christian disciples. A hint of an existential perspective can be sensed as the book progresses. Bonhoeffer gives his insights into scripture as he goes through the Sermon on the Mount. The book also relates the purpose of the church and the individual within the church. Bonhoeffer&#65533;s tone has a preachy quality to it as though one is reading a long sermon. Throughout his book, he inserts Latin and Greek words which may mean more to the scholar, but do not do much good for the layman. However, this does not detract from Bonhoeffer&#65533;s points, and the book is not too terribly hard to understand. There is a detailed but brief biography of Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#65533;s life at the beginning of the book. Reading through this helps to put the rest of the work in perspective."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Let me be the first true believer to continue the lovefest over &quot;The Cost Of Discipleship&quot; by suggesting that everyone read a little known book obtainable on Amazon.com called &quot;West Point&quot; by another true believer, its author, Norman Thomas Remick. Why? Because I have caught more bees with honey than with vinegar after reading that book by showing how much I know about, not only religious philosophy, but their philosophy of &quot;reason' --- and shown how the philosophy of &quot;reason&quot; actually is just another way of saying what &quot;The Cost Of Discipleship&quot; says."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"This is all about God.

Thus, I fervently recommend Dietrich Bonhoeffer/G.K.A.Bell's, The Cost Of Discipleship to everyone, not just &quot;the choir&quot;. Having said that, I also know &quot;I am, because I think&quot;. If God only wanted us to believe and not think, he would not have supplied us with a brain. Thus, I also recommend that everyone also read a book by Norman Thomas Remick called West Point: Character Leadership Education...., a book that can broaden and strengthen The Cost Of Discipleship's impact on people's lives by bringing the realities of life into concert with The Cost Of Discipleship's message, joining and reconciling revelation and reason.

There was no one to disciple me, so I resorted to dead men. Bonhoeffer and C.S. Lewis were the people that discipled, challenged and helped me to fall in love with my Lord more and more. This book was essential to this developement. Bonhoeffer aqudaciously shows us how costly and precious the grace of Jesus Christ really is. How our faith is very much an all or nothing pursuit, and is utterly neglected if not viewed this way. Bonhoeffer moves the reader throughout the sermon on the mount and enlightens us to realize that Christianity is far from a joke, and the living our lives are far from an acceptable option. It is truly the book of the disciple, while subtly declaring the awesomeness of God's work on the cross, Bonhoeffer undeniably describes our part in that cross. Leaving the reader with a choice, to become overwhemingly consumed with devotion to the Lord, or to reject the joy of the grace of God and continue to pursue our pointless lives. Bohoeffer does not declare anything special, he just delaclares absolute scripture, and shows us that Jesus was serious when he spoke to us, and is serious still."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"wonderful. a must read by everyone who says they follow and trust in Jesus, the Christ, the Anointed One of God, the Father. what does it really mean to follow Him, obey Him, love Him with one's whole life?

Typical of his forceful expression is the passage where he shows how cheap grace becomes just another law to bind people to a selfish lifestyle while all the time masquerading as the gift of God. In his own words \\"Grace interpreted as a principle, pecca fortiter as a principle, grace at a low cost, is in the last resort simply a new law, which brings neither help nor freedom.Grace as a living word, pecca fortiter as our comfort in tribulation and as a summons to discipleship, costly grace is the only pure grace, which really forgives sins and gives freedom to the sinner.We ........have gathered like eagles round the carcase of cheap grace, and there we have drunk of the poison which has killed the life of following Christ.\\"The fine distinction between following a correct doctrine but abusing it and following Christ in the dynamic of grace is masterfully handled in this work which desperately needs airing in this day of cheap grace.Discipleship takes on a new meaning as he discusses the differences between being obedient to Christ by prescription and following Christ in a living relationship with him in a contemporary world. All the more remarkable is this book as we recognize the circumstances under which it was written and the price which Bonhoeffer ultimately paid in order to live by what he had written.\\"When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die\\"- Dietrich Bonhoeffer, The Cost of Discipleship"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"In a time when we are constantly bombarded with the idea that being a Christian means telling others how to live and living warrior ideals for our beliefs, a true hero of the Christian faith shows us that it's not that easy. Living for Christ means really loving our neighbors, and we don't get to say that those bad folks aren't our neighbors.This book is not easy to read. It's difficult, not just to take in (although you may sometimes need to read a paragraph two or three times to really comprehend its meaning), but to accept, because it's hard to imagine who can really live up to what Bonhoeffer shows us Christ is really asking of us. Nevertheless, I recommend making the effort in both areas."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"The purchase of the Hardcover edition by publisher Peter Smith was to replace my paperback copy from 1974, which has fallen apart from use and age.

This edition failed to meet my expectations of a quality hardback. While it may barely last me until my death I had wanted a copy in which I had placed my notations to pass on to my sons. Except for the hardcover this edition is of paperback quality including acid paper and glued in pages.

Written by German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer on the eve of World War II, it takes a frighteningly direct approach to the call of Christ to discipleship.Bonhoeffer begins by telling the Church that we are preaching grace entirely wrong. Grace is not a license to sin, a pass to live however we want, or an excuse from the law; it is a call to the law, a command to live blamelessly before God. It's a harsh blow, but one that needs to be made. And the blows keep coming.Throughout the book Bonhoeffer takes the life and ministry of Jesus Christ - primarily the Sermon on the Mount - lays the text open, and says, \\"This is what Jesus said. Now, deal with it.\\" The Church has done everything in its power to water down, lighten up, spiritualize, and symbolize the words of Christ. Bonhoeffer calls us to take Jesus at His word and listen to what He actually said.This is an incredibly difficult book to read, not because of the way it's written, but because of what is written in it. The Cost of Discipleship challenges every aspect of Christian life, demanding more than what we ever thought was possible to give.Just like Jesus did.One of the things that makes this book so amazing is that its author actually lived its words. Bonhoeffer challenged the German Christians to take a stand for Christ against Hitler - and eventually, he died for it.This book is beyond powerful. Every Christian should read it."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"To be a part of the World and yet not be of this world? To not cloister oneself from the unredempted, but yet live to please Jesus. That question should be thought of as one reads this work. The book has a twenty-two page biography of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and memories G. Leibholtz of his friend Dietrich Bonhoeffer. These works serve as a letter of recommendation to the reader. The author of this work taught that true disciples of Christ take up their cross daily, and the writer of this work practiced what he preached. A true follower of Christ seeks the praise of God and not the praise of men. Yes, Bonhoeffer left Germany briefly in Germany in 1939, but he felt compelled to return to Germany. He sought to do God's will in Nazi Germany. While other \\"Christians\\" changed their theology to not offend the Government authorities, he did not. The text of this book was first published in 1937; This work may provoke you to search your soul. What cross God may be calling you the reader to carry. He knew discipleship went beyond repentance and the seeking of God's forgiveness. Taking up one's cross had meaning to this man. Yes, Bonhoeffer could have waited out the war in the United States, but he could not and be consistent with the arguments presented in his book titled the Cost of Discipleship.In this work the author bemoans those who seek out the acceptance of man over the seeking to do the will of God. He does not think highly of those who try to separate themselves from the world, so to avoid the trials and temptations of the day to day life. The Life of Martin Luther is brought up. Before his rebellion from the Roman Catholic Church, Luther lived a \\"cloister\\" life. He did not have to deal with the day to day temptations the general populace; Living and working separately from those who raise families and work in commerce. Not because the world is in itself good and holy, but because there is where the Christian is called. The author describes Christian living as hand to hand combat.The main theme of this book is who rules your life? Is it Jesus or your family? Do friends, things or employment ultimately determine what you think or behave in your life? Does your theology conform to the things of this world or to the teachings of Jesus Christ? Bonhoeffer reflects on the teachings in the Sermon on the Mount. He then goes on to teach how the Disciples learned by what Jesus taught. No he does not deal with their weakness and/or failures, but with the final product that was wrought in part through the teachings of Jesus Christ and seeking to live a godly life. This work also tries to answer the question: what it means to be part of the body of Christ? What is the difference to be a part of the visible and invisible community? What it means to be a true Saint and one who is made into the image of the Christ."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"The Cost of Discipleship should be read by all Christians and theological students.

If you are serious about God changing your life then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Leaving Bonhoeffer's life aside, this book itself barely rates a 3. It is best seen as 32 short sermons which are intended to shake the reader's convictions, not a guidebook to be followed. \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" makes the reader think, but it is extreme, as Bonhoeffer himself realized later in his life, calling his book \\"dangerous\\" although he did not totally renounce it.Bonhoeffer responds to \\"cheap grace\\" Christians whose religious life is nothing more than going to church for an hour a week by proposing \\"Costly grace\\". The problem is that he goes from one extreme to another. Now instead of doing almost nothing for God, we become organic robots who live only to serve God and others, not ourselves. Bonhoeffer allows us just enough \\"earthly goods ... which are consumed in use and which meet the legitimate requirements of the body\\". We may consume enough fuel (food and water) to keep performing our function, but never enjoy it. It goes on and on in the same vein, with relationships, etc. The concept is basically 'a monk in Times Square' where we can come as close to being as possession-less and relationship-free as Jesus' wandering disciples were, but while still living in the evil \\"world\\".Costly grace frees us from having to think for ourselves. As he says, \\"Happy are they who... are therefore free from the tyranny of their own ideas and calculations\\"! This \\"freedom\\" comes because the commands of Jesus can be followed super-literally, as if he were standing right in front of us as when he said those words, and as if we were wandering around Israel with him. Indeed, they must be followed that way, because anything else might make things easier, which would be \\"cheap grace\\".The bible research included in the article is only sermon grade, not the level of a research paper (which is logical since Bonhoeffer was an ordained Lutheran pastor). He only quotes those verses which support his view.It is also important to realize that Bonhoeffer wrote this in Nazi Germany in 1937 as the horrors grew. That explains somewhat his perspective.All in all, this is a solid hell and brimstone sermon from someone who walked the walk as well as talking it (although as mentioned earlier he changed his mind somewhat)."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"My life has been touched forever and I am a believer.

This is plain to see in his assertions found within, The Cost of Discipleship. This book sets the bar to which all Christians should aim. He breaks down the wall between those who preach, teach and minister, and the layman. It is the right and responsibility of every God fearing man to suffer for his brothers, his world and his Savior. Do not be beguiled and deceived by the offer of cheap grace, instead, live for the righteousness found only in Christ. Take up your cross daily and follow Him. Bonhoeffer so aptly asserts, \\"When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die.\\" This is the truth of the Christian life."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Fantastic book that rediscovers the meaning of following Jesus Christ. Though the author's death may seem contrary to one of his chapters at first glance, it is still a good read well worth anyone's time. Regarding the chapter in question, one should not look at the individual responsibility of submission to authorities, but of the Christian's responsibility to provide sanctuary for the captive and 'innocent'. Throughout the read, the reader may find themselves disagreeing with Bonhoeffer at the beginning of the chapter because he appears to take an extreme and the pendulum swings to the opposite extreme, but by the end, the pendulums rests comfortably in the center of the argument and they will likely find themselves understanding exactly what it is he saying.

This road to \\"earning\\" salvation is tough and if you think you are successful (you lose your merit just for thinking you are doing something right). In this way one could never be certain of their own true motives (or their salvation). Much is made of Bonhoeffer's martyrdom but he would say it didn't prove his love of God and that it was meritless (just expected). He sees the desciple as detached from the world - and it being an opportunity to do good, die to ourselves, emphasizing we must love God in a superhuman way. I imagine Bonhoeffer like the struggling young Luther - prior to breaking with the Roman church and the rejection of the connection of good works - working so hard to be perfect and to be sure of his salvation. Perhaps this is why the book was required reading in my Roman Catholic College. Grace is a gift - accept it for the wonderous thing it is and it will inspire your love of God. Trying to match or outdo Christ's sacrifice means you can't bring yourself to just accept it. And I agree with Bonhoeffer on this point - nothing you can do will merit your salvation. I found the book a little tedious and vague at parts towards the end with no real focus. It might be useful if you are looking to become St. Francis.

Notable for his uncompromising approach to religion and ethics, this text emanates from that modus operandi, and is important for his discussion of cheap grace vs. costly grace, if for no other reason.Reading German religious philosophy in translation is especially soporific, and in this manner the text does not fail to disappoint. Reading Bonhoeffer will never be easy. Even those greatly interested will, at times, feel that gauzy-headedness one experiences in close encounters with the unintentionally obfuscating.Having said that, the book represents a strong philosophical effort by a man whose likeness is one of those adorning Westminster Abbey, having earned the spot by his martyrdom at the hand of the Nazis at the end of WWII."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"What I've read so far is pretty good.

Over time, though, I have come to the realization that Bonhoeffer's sacrifice -- his failed attempt to assassinate Hitler -- was in itself an attempt at &quot;cheap grace&quot;, the very thing he decried. He isolated himself from his community, and lacked the courage and fortitude to speak out when he had the opportunity. The result of his failed plot may have contributed to the deaths of millions of people, because without his plot it now seems likely that Hitler's generals would have overthrown him as much as two years before the end of the war.Bonhoeffer has become somewhat of a cultic figure in recent years, and that's unfortunate. He was an important but flawed thinker who could never escape the Protestant individualism of his religious tradition.

I've studied the \\"Death to self\\" doctrine and the related biblical phrases, and there are significant problems with it, which I will not go into detail here(I will say that the biblical phrases that inspired this doctrine have a lot more to do with Persecution and Martyrdom than discipleship). The form of Christianity Bonhoeffer suggests however has inspired other 'cult' leaders who have told followers to 'cut themself off' from the world and their families to 'follow' Christ. If one studies Dietrich's life story, however, he himself was a hypocrite in this regard, as he was quite involved in worldly politics and close to his family.One is safer reading the historical and theological contexts of the bible--such as an unbiased commentary-before following the words of someone else."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Great book.I ordered it on Friday.Saturday after lunch the box was on the door step.Very impressed with the speed of normal delivery.Thank you"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"I consider myself a well-taught believer - one sincerely seeking to follow Jesus' teachings each day.

Some reviewers point out that his thinking developed between this book and his final writings.As a book on discipleship, this is a good book. It urges us to count the cost of following Jesus. Most of this book is commentary on the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) and his commissioning of Jesus' disciples (Matthew 10).This is not the easiest book to read. It also can be a little tough on the reader, which we're not used to -- to our loss. Our culture is too self-centered, while Bonhoffer encourages us to be Christ centered.One misconception that some reviewers had is that Bonhoffer is saying we all need to leave everything including our families. That is not the point at all. Rather, Bonhoffer is reminding us that our loyalty should first be to Christ and if there is a conflict of loyalties, all others should bow before Christ.I do disagree with parts of this book, but there is more truth than error, by a long shot.

We need more people like Bonhoeffeer today so everyone will better know what ture GRACE is all about"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"~The Cost of Discipleship~ was profoundly influential on me as I pondered the nature of the call to discipleship. It was to be read and reread. No book save this book and, of course, the Bible has every elicited my tears. Bonhoeffer's dichotomy between \\"costly grace\\" and \\"cheap grace\\" is astounding as he poetically declares: \\"Costly grace is the gospel which might be sought again and again, the gift which must be asked for, the door at which a man must knock. Such grace is costly because it calls us to follow, and it is grace because it calls us to follow Jesus Christ. It costly, because it cost a man his life, and it is grace, because it gives us the only true life.\\"This book expounds upon the costliness and nature of true discipleship. What does it mean to be a disciple of Jesus Christ? It means you must follow him in obedience. One of the fruits of a persevering saving faith is obedience. Bonhoeffer does not attempt to buttress the believer in consolation with feel good theology, but reminds the believer that a servant is not above his master (Mt. 15:24); Christ suffered and so shall we, all those of faith will have to endure are allotted share of suffering and hardship. \\"You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ\\" (2 Tim 2:3).Bonhoeffer makes manifest the costliness of grace and likewise the high price of true discipleship, which is why many shriek at such demands. Some naysayers pick apart Bonhoeffer's theology for various reasons. Accusations abound that he is a legalist abound and others defame him as having unconsciously sought out martyrdom. Bonhoeffer was not perfect, but he was a pious, sincere and devout follower of Jesus Christ. His character and willingness to put his life on the line for the truth is commendable.I will only say that his life and work was exemplary, as was his principled opposition to the anti-Christian Nazi regime. His theology and life work has to be understood within the historical context of his resistance to Hitler ana Nazis. He recognized that the Christian disciple must confront the world, he can neither hide from it nor be conformed to it. The Christian cannot fall into the monastic trap and seek shelter in \\"his closet\\" under the pretense of piety and otherworldliness, because he must confront the reality that \\"his closet\\" is part of the world. Being \\"salt and light to the world,\\" when the world was shrouded in darkness may very well bring martyrdom for the believer, but it was the cost of discipleship. For this reason, Bonhoeffer confronted Hitler and the despotic Nazi Regime. In his other work \\"Ethics,\\" he declares that the state that steps on the Christian mission negates itself, though he struggled himself over the nature of resistance and civil disobedience. Bonhoeffer was executed as one of the Flossenberg Martyrs (after being loosely implicated in the Abwehr conspiracy to assassinate Hitler) just days before the Allies liberated his camp. It really helps to reflect upon the world Bonhoeffer was in while studying this book.Ultimately, Bonhoeffer points the reader to Christ as our exemplar who we should strive earnestly to emulate Christ. Bonhoeffer was adamant that obedience necessarily follows a geniune preserving saving faith and is requisite for true discipleship. God gives us faith, but it is the sinner who must be believe. We have to walk forward and take that initial step of obedience to make effectual our faith, and make our calling sure. Sooner or later, a true faith will inevitably yield in obedience, otherwise it is not a geniune faith. Thus, geniune discipleship is not possible. God gives us the grace and he sustains us, as the author and finisher of our faith."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"WWII gave us a new definition of evil, but it also gave us some bright spots.

He could have left Germany during World War II, and resided in a safe haven abroad. He had the personal connections through his work. But he decided to stay, as the foreword of this book outlines. He decided to stay and confront the demons that possessed the country. He ended up sacrificing his life. This book gives us a powerful level of insight into one human being and his religion. It opens up questions in our own minds about religion and what it means to each of us.

What an incredible synopsis of each person's need for Jesus our Savior from our sins.A most amazing concept too is that this was written by a Lutheran and yet it is not about his denominational beliefs, it is about the basic Truths of the Bible that apply to each christian regardless of their denomination. This book, simply put, focuses on the doctrine of Jesus Christ. I have never read a book so well written and so complete on the doctrine of Jesus Christ...The basic, basic premise being getting and keeping a right relationship with Jesus Christ through absolute Truth, absolute faith, and absolute obedience--this is christianity...The author gives the reader a clear perspective of Jesus, God the Father, the Holy Spirit, and mankind and how each inter-relates with the other. This author has deep insight into what is expected of the christian and what the christian can expect from each in the Trinity.

The book has profound implications for the Christian life. Be prepared to be hit in the face with solid, Biblical truth."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"I recently took a seminary class that dealt with traditions in Christian devotion, and one of the assignments was to pick a classic Christian book and do a report on it. I chose &quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; because I had wanted to read it for some time. Much has been said about the book's power, and I desired to experience that for myself. After finishing it, I can see why &quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; has challenged so many in their walk with Christ.The book's major theme centers on what it really means to be a disciple of Christ. This is summed up by Bonhoeffer's statement that Christ calls us to &quot;come and die.&quot; Christ wants all of us - nothing is to be held back. One is either a disciple of Christ, or they are not. There is no middle ground. The true disciple is dying to his or her life as a whole, and their old life is being replaced with the life of Christ.&quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; is soaked in Scripture, and that is one of its main strengths. This is not surprising, since reading the Bible actually contributed to Bonhoeffer's personal conversion and commitment to Christ. Bonhoeffer constantly refers to Biblical passages to make his points, and he does not resort to storytelling or even personal anecdotes. One can sense his deep love for the Bible and for Christ throughout the book. Another strength is Bonhoeffer's conveyance of how imperative commitment to Christ really is. Bonhoeffer was an early foe of Adolph Hitler, and this book was published while he was being persecuted by the Nazis. Thererfore, he wrote as one who has stood for Christ in tough times, and he knew that Christ is one's only hope. Indeed, he eventually gave his life for his faith, and by all Christian and secular accounts glorified God to the very end. Finally, even though &quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; was published in 1937, every page in this book counters the &quot;easy believism&quot; and license that tempt and seduce many Christians today. Bonhoeffer attacks &quot;cheap grace&quot; and demands a steadfast, deep loyalty to Christ. He illustrates the power and holiness of God in a way that indicates the necessity of a healthy, reverent fear towards God.However, I did have a couple of minor issues with the book. It is somewhat densely written, and therefore may be daunting to the average layreader. Bonhoeffer was a highly educated theologian, and it shows in his writing style. In addition, Bonhoeffer tends to neglect grace in favor of emphasizing absolute holiness and commitment. His moralistic leanings have the danger of encouraging legalism and asceticism if a reader is inclined toward those pitfalls. I'm sure this was not his intent, since it was Bonhoeffer's genuine love for Christ that motivated his passion and perseverance. But this may be a situation where a person takes for granted a truth they have worked through and internalized, and therefore they fail to communicate it to others because it is so integral to them. I think Bonhoeffer loved God so deeply, with all his being, that he never thought to specifically describe loving God as the basis for the principles in this book. However, it is also possible that the times he lived in prevented a more introspective writing style. Bonhoeffer was under persecution by a political regime that he knew to be the epitome of evil. Therefore, he knew what was at stake, and so focused on what needed to be heard about the cost of Christian discipleship, with the assumption (or at least hope) that the reader already had an abiding love for Christ.Overall, &quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; challenged me in a number of ways. First, Bonhoeffer's life and death were inspiring - he lived what he wrote, and I consider him to be an example of faith in action that every Christian should emulate. I pray that I would face persecution with his courage and perseverance. Second, his linking of sanctification with being part of the Body of Christ encourages me to avoid being a &quot;lone wolf&quot; Christian. It's important for my spiritual health to become part of a church so that I can minister to others and be ministered to as well. Third, his love for Scripture reminds me to never forsake reading the Bible, and also not to rely exclusively on the writings of others, or their interpretations of Scripture. Fourth, his focus on a relationship with Christ prods me to examine my own relationship with Him, and to ensure that I don't neglect it. Finally, his statement that Christ bids us to &quot;come and die&quot; leads me to evaluate the level of my own commitment as a Christian, especially in light of current events.&quot;The Cost of Discipleship&quot; was difficult to read. This was in part due to its literary density, but also because of its powerful message about the true cost of being a disciple of Christ. Bonhoeffer's words are relevant, convicting, and challenging to anyone who claims to be a Christian. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"\\"And even in our sleep pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.\\" These words of Aeschylus echoed through me time and time again as I read Dietrich Bonhoeffer's \\"Cost of Discipleship\\". This was not an easy book to read. I do not think it was meant to be easy.Bonhoeffer was a person of limitless courage and faith. Born 1906 in Breslau, Germany to a prosperous family Bonhoeffer studied theology and completed his doctoral thesis when he was 21. He rose to some measure of fame in the 1930s by virtue of his writings and radio sermons.The rise of Adolph Hitler ran parallel to Bonhoeffer's own rise and it was opposition to the evils of Nazi-ism that compelled Bonhoeffer to put his words into actions, actions that cost him his life. As is set out in the introductory memoir in this edition, Bonhoeffer understood immediately that Hitler and his national socialist ideology represented a grave threat to Germans, to Christianity, and to western civilization. In a radio adress he gave in February, 1933 Bonhoeffer denounced Hitler and denounced his fellow Germans for accepting a corrupt and inhumane leader and system as its idol. Although Bonhoeffer spent a great deal of time living in England, safe from harm, he understood that he could not in good conscience \\"participate in the reconstruction of Christian life in Germany after the war if I do not share the trials of this time with my people.\\" Bonhoeffer returned to Germany in 1939 to take up the struggle against Nazi-ism. He had to have known that his return would lead to his death but he knew he could not do otherwise. He was called and he obeyed that call without question.Bonhoeffer was arrested in 1943 after being caught assisting the escape of a number of Jews from Germany. On April 8, 1945, with Allied troops only days from liberating his prison, Bonhoeffer was executed on the orders of Hitler by the S.S. Black Guards. One cannot read the Cost of Discipleship without an acute understanding that his writings on sacrifice, on obedience, and on the cost of grace were mirrored by his actions.Cost of Discipleships consists of a series of set pieces on grace, justification, and obedience to God. This was a tough book to read for two reasons. First, I grew up in a tradition in which words like grace and justification were concepts best left for other denominations. I had to think about the meaning and context of those words in order to understand what he was saying. Second, Bonhoeffer does not speak to his reader in the manner of a kindly, easy-going grandfather. Rather, he speaks in the manner of the strict drill instructor in boot camp whose manner is designed to hit you in the face with your own (and his) inadequacies until you break. As you read further the purpose behind Bonhoeffer's harsh manner evidences itself. Like the drill instructor his purpose is not to be harsh for the sake of harshness but to save your neck once you leave boot camp and make your way to the front lines. The drill instructor is harsh to help ensure your survival. Bonhoeffer is harsh to help one seek salvation through faith.The book begins with a section entitled The Call to Discipleship. Each step of the way Bonhoeffer sets up a test, a test that this reader invariably fails each step of the way. He discusses \`cheap grace', the kind where \\"my only duty as a Christian is to eave the world for an hour or so on a Sunday morning and go to church to be assured that my sins are all forgiven.\\" Bonhoeffer asserts that if one \`believes' one must obey and if one does not obey they cannot believe. He argues that prayer should be hidden, not public. Too often public prayer in churches is nothing more than \`empty noise'. Further, he suggests that our own good deeds, like our prayer, should be hidden. If we perform righteous acts to receive a pat on the back from our friends or family it is valueless to God. It was hard not to recognize myself every step of the way. It clearly must have been Bonhoeffer's intent to have us feel this discomfort and if so he did a remarkably good job of it.Bonhoeffer suggests that too many people feel they must know the path they are about to follow before beginning their spiritual journey. In fact, Bonhoeffer claims the opposite is the case. He argues that we will find out once we begin: \\"plunge into the deep waters beyond your own comprehension, and I will help you to comprehend even as I do.\\"The heart of Cost of Discipleship is found in Bonhoeffer's extensive examination of the Sermon on the Mount. It is at once both illuminating and powerful. Again, Bonhoeffer's own life provides justification for the argument that the call to discipleship is not easy and will likely bring pain and suffering but that it can be done if one so chooses. The fact that I have no doubt that I lack the wherewithal to act in a similar fashion is both depressing and challenging. How does one respond to such a challenge? Such wisdom as I acquire from this book will, no doubt, come drop by drop and with no small amount of pain.This is a compelling book for anyone interested in matters of faith and the role of faith in contemporary society."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"This is an intense work,though not as intense as some of Dietrich's other works.This book lives up to it's title in every way,he pulls no punches as he relates the scriptures to real life and expounds upon the teachings of Jesus.He plainly teaches that there is a cost to following in the footsteps of Christ,just as Christ himself taught that Christ must be first and there is no compromise.This work is so intense,even Dietrich himself later in life,wondered if he was too blunt.Definitely not for those who enjoy sugar coated watered down messages,but if you've got the guts to read it,it will change your life!"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer is without question a hero of the Christian Faith, and one would be well served to study his thoughts, theology, commitment and example. But this is probabaly not the place to start, for two reasons.(1) The writing style of this book is badly outdated and hard to follow and understand. This book badly needs an editor to put Bonhoeffer's thoughts into more modern prose. This book, as it is, is a difficult and at times convoluted read. A new updated editon is badly needed.(2)Secondly, and more importantly, this book is early Bonhoeffer,full of didactic thought, at times morally pompus. A better place to start a study of Bonhoeffer might be his last work, \\"Letters from Prison...\\" written at the end of his life. this work is the more seasoned, more mature Bonhoeffer, a man who has seen to some the degree the mistakes and folly of his earlier thinking.Case in point: In this work, Bonhoeffer says to be a disciple a man must separate himself from the everyday living of life. In the later book, \\"Letters from Prison,\\" he writes, it is \\"only by living completely in the world that one learns to have faith...\\" He says he stands by his earlier book because he wrote it, it is his work, but he makes it clear that if he had it to do over again, his thought would be different and he would express himself in a way much more understanding of the world in which we live.For that reason, \\"Letters From Prison...\\" would be the best place to get the complete, aged and wise Bonhoeffer."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer's Cost of Discipleship explores the challenges of embracing the gospel theme of sacrifice. In a direct, sometimes harsh assessment, he points up the difficulty of actually living a creed which embraces sacrifice of the individual believer called to task by the divine.The phrase &quot;cheap grace&quot; remains the watch-phrase of the work. &quot;Cheap grace&quot; refers to the counterfeit self-acceptance the would-be believer experiences, and is discussed in sharp contrast to the genuine experience caused by the demands of the Christian faith. Bonhoeffer cautions us against 'easy religion' and mere emotive response to the Christian message. He portrays Christian life as demanding unflinching self-awareness and struggle, culiminating in surrender.In later writings, Bonhoeffer himself modified the viewpoints he set forth in the Cost of Discipleship. An argument can be made that the work's stringent tone fails to convey the richness of the Christian life to which his book seeks to call adherents.Nonetheless, Bonhoeffer's construct of &quot;cheap grace&quot; serves as a useful metaphor in a time in which materialism, inequity, and disconnection plague us. We may not choose Pastor Bonhoeffer's iron-clad distinctions as to what constitutes authentic spiritual experience, but we will not easily forget his call to embrace the genuine, and not merely counterfeit assuaged feelings for genuine spiritual experience.Although this is a work of theology accessible to most readers, it is never patronizing in tone. Although one would have only a limited vision of Bonhoeffer's work if one read only the Cost of Discipleship, this is an excellent first Bonhoeffer book to read. The Cost of Discipleship is not a radical work, but rather a work of then-mainstream Christianity intended to provoke the reader into action. Even if one cannot reach all of Bonhoeffer's conclusions, and even if one does not share Bonhoeffer's theology, the inquiry is certainly worth undertaking."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"You want to read about the cost of discipleship?

Bonhoeffer, who wrote the book in the midst of struggling to stand up against the evils of Nazi Germany in the 1940's, provides the reader with a transformational look into Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, and what it means to us as believers today.If you are not inspired and given food for thought and prayer about your journey with God after reading this book, then check your pulse!His message, like the message of the Gospels, when truthfully proclamied, is not easy to hear. He writes something to the effect of &quot;When Christ calls a [person] he bids them to come and die...that they might gain new life.&quot; That is the radical message of Christian discipleship in a nutshell- Christ calls us to give our ALL for Him.The first step of discipleship is putting Christ first, and following- no matter what the cost may be. For Bonhoeffer, his faith cost him his life. He was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp for his open opposition to the tyrrany of Nazism, where he died helping others at the age of 39.If you have not done so already- READ THIS BOOK- it WILL change your life!

Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a martyr for his faith in WWII Germany. He lived out what he wrote and believed.Bonhoeffer understood clearly that Christianity was not a mere creed, nor was it an offer of membership into an exclusive country club. The apostle Paul wrote of his need and challenge to \\"die daily,\\" laying down his own will to do the will of God. Jesus said that whoever would believe in Him must \\"take up their crosses\\" and follow Him. He also said, \\"I only do those things which please the Father.\\" This is the basic framework from which Bonhoeffer builds and shares truth with the reader.This is not \\"light reading\\" and it is not for those interested in being \\"stroked.\\" It's challenging, and at times, maybe a little bit angering. Bonhoeffer had never heard of \\"political correctness\\" and he was not interested in catering to the reader's \\"inner child.\\" He simply lays it on the line for the reader to either accept or reject. But He backs up His challenges with solid biblical research and great passion...not to mention his own personal living example.This book confronts the reader with the reality that we are not just called to believe \\"nice things\\" or even simply to look nice or act nice. It's a radical call to discipleship and to embrace the cost of the cross. Without wanting to sound cliched, I believe this book is a treasure of great wealth for the mind and the spirit...and will produce great things in the reader's life as they receive and embrace these truths.Even if you do not consider yourself a Christian, you will find this book extremely stimulating and enlightening. It gives superb insights into the mindset of many committed believers today."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"For those who wonder if there is more to the Christian life than just living and occasionally asking for grace, while seeing minimal change in your life, this book expains why that is. This is by far the most beneficial book I have read apart from the Bible. Bonhoeffer's view of following Jesus is intense and inspiring (just read the intro about his life). If you want to follow Jesus, I would not miss out on this book."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer was one who knew of that which he spoke when dealing with the issue of cheap grace versus costly grace. Bonhoeffer's commitment to the principles of his vocation and being cost him his life - executed in the closing days of World War II, Bonhoeffer walked a dangerous path through exercising his vocation faithfully in the midst of the twin evils of warfare and Nazi domination of Germany.Bonhoeffer's life, from the earliest days, probably seemed like it was set on an idyllic path - the son of a professional family with strong roots in a prosperous and civilised culture, Bonhoeffer would seem to have \`had it made'. His early days in school showed him to be a minister and academic of great promise. However, his experiences at Union Seminary in New York City, an academic environment very different from the German academy, and at the Abyssian Baptist Church, an African-American congregation, vastly different from his Germanic Lutheran background, prepared a way for Bonhoeffer to expand beyond his upbringing and learning to become someone striving to find God in all people, and the will of God in all that he did.The subject of this book is grace - too often, in Bonhoeffer's day and our own, people seem to look at grace as something free, instead of something freely offered. Bonhoeffer points out that the call of God and the gift of God's grace is not to be taken lightly - \`the call to follow Jesus always leads to death'. This may seem an unusual call in our day; after all, the more prosperous of our churches would seem to espouse a conventionally respectable lifestyle (far from the \`death' Bonhoeffer speaks about) as the reward for following God. However, Bonhoeffer uses the example of the disciples, each of whom faced martyrdom, as did many early Christian leaders, as a touchstone for the vocation.Bonhoeffer also gives a great deal of attention in this text to the Sermon on the Mount, providing interpretations that still speak to congregations today, but also with warnings. Bonhoeffer admonishes those who would pick and choose the parts of scripture, or indeed the parts of the Sermon on the Mount, that fit what they want to hear, disregarding the rest. Bonhoeffer writes that we are not called to interpret, but to obey, giving ourselves up to God, as the disciples did, as martyrs did, and as Bonhoeffer himself would do in the fullness of his lifetime.This edition of Bonhoeffer's great work is prefaced by his friend, Bishop G.K.A. Bell of Chichester, a friend and admirer of Bonhoeffer, who states that, \`Dietrich himself was a martyr many times before he died'. There is also a memoir provided by G. Leibholz, which puts the text in historical context. However, the real substance of the book is in Bonhoeffer's own words. Cheap grace was the deadly enemy of the church then, and it remains a dangerous foe to this day."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"This is an incredibly important book. In many ways it seems to be alive. Over the last decade of my life I've read the book and its passages over and over again, and each time it seems to come at me from a different angle, ask me new questions, and challenge me in a very different and difficult way.It is a rare thing to find a book about following Jesus that is empty of cliche, that does not avoid the difficult (or encouraging) things that Jesus said, that confronts the ways we miss the point and do not believe, or that does not throw out the flesh and blood and costliness of the gospel. This book manages all of these things and stays faithful in a way that few are capable, and this is not a testament to the authors way with words, but to his own faith, hope, conviction and faithfulness.I would urge you to buy this book, even if it is the only book (outside of the Scriptures) you ever get your hands on."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Bonhoeffer was a victim of the Nazis because he was man of principle and faith. In the book, \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\", he teaches the Christian concept that Christ challenges us to lay down everything for Christ, even our lives. Bonhoeffer did exactly that. He also reminds the reader that certain powers belong to God, not to man. One of these powers is forgiveness. Many individuals who have been wronged or hurt by the sins of others will take the position that they refuse to forgive the one who wronged them. Bonhoeffer reminds us that forgiveness is granted only by God. In many ways, this rescues the wronged and the wrong doer."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who calls himself a Christian. I particularly like Bohnhoeffer's concept of 'cheap grace' and how it is our mortal enemy.Cheap grace? To quote Bonhoeffer himself, \\"It is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate.\\" In contrast, 'real grace' will cost a man his life.This concept of grace, as Bonhoeffer showed by the example of his life and just as importantly his death, stands in stark contrast to the pop Christianity 'Happy Church' movement we so often see on Sunday morning TV - or just down the street.Also included is (in fact, most of the book is about) Bonhoeffer's commentary on the Sermon on the Mount. As Bonhoefer wrote to his brother Karl-Friederich in 1937 regarding the perversion of Christianity by the Nazi-backed Protestant Reich Church, \\"I think I am right in saying that I would only achieve true inner clarity by really starting to take the Sermon on the Mount seriously. This is the only source of strength that can blow all this nonsense sky-high. The restoration of the church will surely come from a new kind of monasticism which will have nothing in common with the old but a life of adherance to the Sermon on the Mount in imitation of Christ. I believe the time has come to rally people together for this.\\"By no means an easy read, but worth the effort."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer in his classic treatise on the first step in truly following Christ gives anyone who reads this work very little wiggle room to deny what he is saying. Bonhoeffer opens his work with the call of Levi, who was called and followed without hesitation. The author points out to us this call is not a mental decision, it is rather just a decision under the authority of Jesus Christ.This call from Christ, and the subsequent following of Levi, comes with no praise for obedience. The author shows us that there is only obedience, without the expectation of praise for simply doing what we are all created to do; follow Christ. Levi follows simply for the sake of the call, not for what he might get out of following Christ. Bonhoeffer would have us believe this is the ultimate model for us to use in choosing to follow Christ. Through this call, there is significance, but only in Christ, who is the only significance, he alone is important. (Bonhoeffer, 59)It is here that he turns to looking at what is not true discipleship, which included having an abstract Christology, religious knowledge and theological knowledge. If it is an abstract idea, it is not real discipleship. He hammers home this point in saying, \\"Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably Christianity without discipleship.\\" (59) This kind of religion talks about God, but not his living and transformational son Jesus Christ.The next part of his essay turns to comparing three disciples and how they reacted to Christ's call. The first, who we already have touched on did not hesitate and followed Christ immediately. The author says that the disciple did not call himself to this chosen destiny, rather Christ alone can call. Our decision lies in whether we follow or not. The second disciple asks Jesus if he can bury his father before he follows him. (60) Although this was the law at the time, Jesus, who is superior to the law let the man fulfill the ordinance in order that he could then follow Christ. Bonhoeffer shows us now that Christ made himself at that point an opponent of the law, above the law, and the only law that matters. (61)The third disciple has his own ideas about what it will look like to follow Christ. This, the author says, is inconsistent because it renders Christ's call into human terms, which it is not. This puts Christ into a box, and, if it worked that way, would let us determine what our path in life would be. Bonhoeffer acknowledges that this is possible, but would not be the true call Christ has for our life. As soon as this disciple expresses his willingness to follow, he does not really want to follow at all. (61)The author then goes into what exactly this call looks like. First and foremost is that the call will change the person's life dramatically. They must leave their old situation. This call must be heard and than acted upon. He says, \\"The road to faith passes through obedience to the call of Jesus.\\" (63) He continues on commanding us that Jesus' call is the only thing that makes faith possible. Only the call is important, and this call leads us to faith. He also shows us that faith and obedience are separate but there is a unity between these two in the call to follow Christ.This is where he reiterates that the first step hearing the call and following is the most important piece. Jesus wants us to show him we will follow, not talk about it. It is in this obedience that we show our faith. Bonhoeffer than attempts to show us that if we are trying to keep some part of our life under our own control, we are being disobedient.This document finishes with the author's treatise on the rich young man who came to Christ and asked what he needed to do to have eternal life. Christ knew this about the young man and told him to leave everything and follow him. The young man was presented with this and could not, and went away sad. Bonhoeffer shows us how Christ creates a situation where there can be \\"no retreat.\\" (75) This man was confronted with the eternal Son of God, and walked away.Bonhoeffer is completely convincing in his call to discipleship. There is hardly any way one can argue with what he has to say about the life of Christ and what Christ is calling us to do. He backs this up with sound doctrine, using the example of three disciples and how they did or did not follow Jesus' call. The author shows what each man had to do to follow Christ, the perfect example being Levi who just simply hear the call, and went. The interesting disciple is the third disciple who wanted to map out his own course for living, and in that he had lost his way. The author was strong here in showing that we must follow Christ and not set any stipulations along the way. It is all or nothing in Bonhoeffer's view, which he convinces this reader is completely accurate.There is no lack of clarity in the statement; \\"The road to faith passes through obedience to the call of Jesus.\\" (63) How can anyone ever learn what true faith is unless we are under the will of God for our lives. Bonhoeffer reinforces my view that unless Christ is transforming us through following his call, our faith is empty and really no faith at all.I do disagree with Bonhoeffer on one small point, I believe faith is possible before the call of Jesus, it is faith that even lets us get to the point of hearing his call. But this is a small and semantic point, but one I would raise as a slight weakness in this essay. I do completely agree with Bonhoeffer that obedience is separate but essentially intertwined with faith. Overall the author was completely convincing in his call to discipleship. I have read this essay a few times before this class and each time I cannot walk away and not be challenged by what he has to say. I think if you are living and being transformed by Christ, you cannot ignore this work by Dietrich Bonhoeffer."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"I was pointed to this book, by another great book (Following Christ, Joseph Stowell) and I am greatful for having the opportunity to read such a masterpiece. EVERY TRUE BELIEVER should read this, because our grace isn't cheap, there is a cost to discipleship."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"I agree with all of the praise that the other reviewers heap upon this book. I would just like to add two points: first Bonhoeffer is deeply conservative and his appropriation by liberal theologians of the sixties rests on a serious misreading of him. He reiterates the Lutheran insight that works flow from grace--he is not a &quot;liberation&quot;theologian and he died at Flossenburg because his he had been given &quot;costly grace&quot; not because he was a &quot;decent man&quot; or felt that &quot;he&quot; had to help his fellow man--that is idolatry. Second point: we Catholics ignore this insight at our peril. Working for the poor avails us nothing if it is done out of &quot;kindness&quot; or decency--all ethics for Bonhoeffer--in so far as that word has any meaning for him are supernatural and must flow from Christ the center. My confession has only two writers who stress this: Augustine and Pascal-- and we tend to ignore them. Working in a soup kitchen avails us nothing if it is purely a &quot;work&quot;. Bonhoeffer did not merit salvation because he resisted Hitler, rather as I said he resisted Hitler because of the costly grace visited upon him and that grace is what is salvific. We Catholics could do with more Bonhoeffer--otherwise we lapse into an &quot;I can do it by myself&quot; pelagianism or an &quot;all I need is a push&quot; semi-pelagianism."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":">This brief review is for the Hovel Audio Book recording of The Cost of Discipleship, which is grouped with the book format&lt;The reader (Paul Michael) is exceptionally clear and reads the work in a consistent, enjoyable, and natural way. If you want to hear a sample of the recording, you should visit Audible.com, which also sells this item. What I like about Paul Michael is that he has enough variation in his inflection to avoid speaking in monotone, while using enough subtlety, warmth, and reservation in tone to give the work a sober and fatherly sound.As for the content (i.e., the book itself), I will let the other reviews attest to Bonhoeffer's depth of insight and pastoral heart. All I will say is that after reading this work, I think I hear Jesus' call to discipleship and see God's gift of costly grace more clearly.God Bless you all."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"I had recently finished the biography about Bonhoeffer, by Eric Metaxas and was inspired to read more about and by Bonhoeffer. The Cost of Discipleship seemed a good place to start, and the content is especially interesting to me.I am pleased to have been introduced to D. Bonhoeffer, his life and his work."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"\\"When Christ calls a man, He bids him come and die\\". These words of Bonhoeffer are the grand theme of this miraculous theological work. This books calls upon every professed or confessed believer in Christ to examine him or herself. Bonhoeffer pulls no punches, and he has every right to do so. Focusing on the \\"sermon on the mount\\" Bonhoeffer calls on every christian not to just hear the sayings of Christ but to do them! There are few writers who can truly bring us into the presence of Christ, and this is what Bonhoeffer does in \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\".In these times of false teachings and \\"cheap grace\\" as Bonhoeffer puts it, this is a wakeup call for all christians. Certainly the greatest book I have read on what it means to be a follower of Christ."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"This book addresses true discipleship, and not the superficial type we see so often today. If you are seeking a deeper relationship with Christ, this book is a must read. One reviewer says it is \\"densely written\\", and I have to agree. I am reading each chapter three and four times to let it all sink in. And questioning if I can actually live up to these standards."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"The Cost of Discipleship by Dietrich Bonhoeffer is not new to the \\"Christian\\" book world per se, but it is a new read for me. Technically, I did not read this book, I listened to it. I have never listened to an entire audio book previously, but this was a good one to start with.One of the forgotten doctrines of this age, an overlooked necessity in modern Christendom, is discipleship. Bidding believers, or would be disciples, to 'come and die' with Christ is a central call of the book. Bonhoeffer, fixes on a position that many in today's evangelical climate would not be intimate with, one that listens to and obeys words of Jesus Christ.Stunningly deep at times, this is a book that warrants a second pass in order to fully grasp. Even then, it might be worthy to purchase a paperback copy to wear out. Bonhoeffer's emphasis on personal holiness may put off a few readers who subscribe to free, cheap, unhinged grace, but hopefully, will win them with the work of effort he puts into illustrating true cost counting for Christ.Leaning on Luther in many instances, Bonhoeffer also offers commentary and correction regarding certain emphases in Reformed doctrine. Being a personal believer that the Reformation was only an instance and not an end-all to Christian principle, this book will encourage you to tread lightly on dogmatic assertions of once-saved-always-saved'ism that lack power and proof and rely confidently on the security and call to discipleship given of our Lord Jesus Christ, 'come, and follow me.\\""},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"In reading Bonhoeffer's book, The Cost of Discipleship, I was impressed at the sincerity and depth of feeling Bonhoeffer had toward the subject matter. Knowing of his deep sacrifice and his own belief in being a true disciple of Christ, this made the book even more telling. His explanation of the cost and of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount was an inspiration to me and my own ministry. By his own experiences, he has laid out a model for a Christian to follow in becoming more fulfilled and living for Christ as He wanted us to live. This isn't the first book by Dietrich Bonhoeffer I have read. I found his \\"Spiritual Care\\" to be the best I have read for aspiring ministers of the word. The Cost of Discipleship takes off from that and emphasizes what a Christian is and how you should live your life to fully emulate Christ and all that He stands for. While the first chapter is a little long, the rest of the book comes across with definite concepts and hard-hitting thought. Again, this is a must-read for pastors and other ministers of the Word."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"The exposition of the Sermon on the Mount is fantastic. Boenhoeffer is straight-forward and leaves you no wiggle room in terms of conviction. He has a gift for communicating our thought processes as we try to justify sin in our lives, and I was amazed that his insight was written decades ago in a different country, because they perfectly described the way I think today.The last fourth of the book was a little &quot;thicker&quot; to me, and I did not get as much out of it. The author's thoughts were not as lucid once he got out of the Sermon on the Mount passage, and they did not communicate as much to me personally. However, the first 3/4 of this book is so powerful that I would recommend it to anyone.Be prepared to face your comfortable habits and ways of thought in a new light if you read this book. The Word is a sword, and Bonhoeffer uses it to penetrate us."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"I'm still reading it but it's truly heart opening into what it really means to be a disciple of Christ.

The first chapter which defines \\"cheap/costly grace\\" is worth the book itself, everything else is icing on the cake. What an indictment of our modern day christianty which in retrospect is the very fullfillment of this prophetic masterpiece, describing the sum of \\"cheap grace\\". I am usually a fast reader, but this book pulled the plug on speed reading because the weight of this content could not be digested in one bite!

In a time when many German churches had abandoned any notions of challenging Hitler, Bonhoeffer spoke out against Nazism, and involved himself in active opposition to overthrow the Third Reich. His activities led to his arrest in 1943, and days before the Allied liberation of Germany, he was sent to the gallows in April 1945.Just as he made no compromises in his faith life, Bonhoeffer is relentless in arguing why true discipleship must come at a cost - Jesus saved our souls at a great price, through the shedding of His blood and scourging of His flesh during His Passion. As Christ gave up His life for our sake, so must we, as His followers, forsake our own lives. \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" challenges any church that promises salvation to those who only say with their lips \\"Lord, Lord,\\" since claiming belief in Christ is one thing, but obeying Him is an entirely different matter. Christians would do well to remember one of Bonhoeffer's most famous sayings: \\"Only he who believes is obedient, and only he who is obedient believes.\\" Witnessing the spiritual corruption of the churches around him, Bonhoeffer saw the perils of accepting grace while neglecting discipleship, which led Christians to a life that was absent of sacrifice, and by extension, absent of love and obedience to the Lord Jesus.Drawing largely from Scriptural texts and the writings of other renowned Christians, Bonhoeffer's call for complete obedience to Christ makes \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" not merely an eye-opener, but also a challenge, to all believers. For a Christian who wishes to experience God at a deeper, more potent level, there are few writings that can stir the soul as effectively as \\"The Cost of Discipleship.\\""},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"This book is one for the ages.

He has done an amazing job of outlining the case that Christians must take their faith more seriously by becoming true disciples of Jesus, rather than pervert the message by treating it as no cost fire insurance, and his example (dying because of his efforts to fight the Nazi regime) is a shining example for all of what it means to take one's faith seriously."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"as the way Germany went so goes Americathis book is for someone who is looking to understand suffering, sacrifice, what is wrong with the church in America, and the truth about discipleship"},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"Very good reading of the thought patterns of Bonhoeffer, and how his structure in belief changed over time with the experiences of Hitler's horror."},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","review":"A very difficult book to read and comprehend.

As a latter day martyr who was executed at a Nazi concentration camp, he is a testament to faith. However, I wanted to know more. What did faith mean to Bonhoeffer? How could his faith help me to grow on my faith and understanding? The Cost of Discipleship has provided me with lots of questions to ponder in response to these questions.Bonhoeffer begins this book with a discussion of cheap grace, as opposed to costly grace. I was acquainted with this concept, but this text really brought the point home. For grace to mean anything, there has to be an associated cost. This is the core of Bonheffer's theology. The cost must involve that which one holds most dear, be it status, money, family or whatever. This is the underlying theme that unites The Cost of Discipleship.It is not an easy read, and I have a feeling that I will revisit this challenging and engaging book many times in the future.

He also explains quite well the purpose of a suffering church, which I've grappled with for years. Chapter 24 in this book has done more to help me come to terms with the weight of my own cross than just about any other whole book; excluding the Bible of course.It's quite easy to take the instruction of a man who gave his life in complete obedience to the message he preached.

It is most certainly something that could be placed in the hands of someone who is in need of an analysis of the historical influences that have led to what are now known as the churches of Christ (note the small \\"c\\" in \\"church\\"--that's coC-speak for \\"undenominational\\"). Personally, I believe many perspectives on early A. Campbell (and BWS, and the movement that commonly bears their names) are necessary to grasp the full and correct picture of the man (or men, and the movement); Every historian seems to turn another spadeful of interpretation (although, Lord knows, we have far too many who just parrot the words of other, without careful analysis). I am not a professional historian, but I've read a lot of Campbell--and Stone--and have my own perceptions on his place in the story.Of particular interest is the development of Campbell's \\"change\\" after the death of his young son. I do wish the discussion about AC's \\"change\\" would also consider areas in which Campbell apparently never changes, such as in his views on the nature of the church, convention (aka collective cooperation)--such as was developed in the Harbinger at Campbell's request by Walter Scott)--and related views. I believe this is a critical realization that sheds no small light on the thinking of some more conservative coCers, whom I believe misread Campbell on those subjects. Hughes has done a good job of pinpointing the flaws in the man, also. This is an important perspective, especially in view of the almost prophet-like status accorded to A. Campbell in the Restoration Movement churches (including the Disciples, independents, and the various iterations of those who lay claim to the name/description, \\"churches of Christ.\\"I think Hughes does a good job showing how \\"movement\\" turned into \\"church,\\" even though I think that transition is overstated from a denominational perspective, especially in the context of the more conservative elements of the movement which contend for an \\"undenominational\\" nature of \\"the church.\\" My original reading of the book did not pick up as much of Hughes' argument as that argument deserved.Highly recommended.

I have listened to his audio books. He is always gentle and comfortable to listen to.This book shows you how to tune into the vibration of God which is the source of everything. Wayne says that we need not have to struggle. Life is a state of being. Wejust what is, there is nowhere to go. Life is about giving and serving not getting and fighting.This book has three parts.Part One's title is \` Creating an inner path for Real Magic'. It has three chapters. I particularly like the spiritual dozen under chapter two. Wayne lays out 12 different characteristics of spiritual and non spiritual being. Among the differences he points out are, non spiritual being only believes in the five senses where spiritual being's thinking is multidimensional.; the former believes that he is alone whereas the later believes loving guidance is always available.Under chapter three Wayne shows us how we can create a miracle mind set. He lays out 14 ways where we can do it. Among the 14 is to be non judgemental; learn how to surrender; practice daily meditation and others.Part Two is about applying real magic awareness in our daily life.How real magic affects your relationships, prosperity, personal identity, and your physical health.Part Three is about how to radiate real magic to the world. Wayne believes that we are now at the threshold of a consciousness revolution. There is a new paradigm awaiting everyone of us.If you are spiritually inclined you will like this book. It is a how to book for those who want to lead a \`happy' life. Is \`happy' the right word? Or may I say that Wayne is teaching you how to claim your birthright , just claim it, it is reality itself. The world of five senses isn't real, we are living in illusion.What is silence? Does silence has any meaning? Let me quote the following in page 86 of the book:\\" A note without space is one long sound. Music comes from the silence between the notes. Nothingness! Yes ,but also absolutely necessary in order to create sound in the world of form, no nothingness, no music\\".Wayne is showing us the necessity of having time of silence in meditation, isn't it profound?"},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"An excellent informational audio.

The difference lies in that this book not only tells you the theory on why things like the author describes can and do happen, but almost half the book is devoted entirely to giving you guidelines on which you can also start to bring those things into your life. As a personal example I started to read this book just when I ended a 4-real relationship..I was really depressed. This book changed my life in less than a week! Even before I finished this book, I had already recovered brom that break-up, and people are still amazed at how fast I got over it. A week later miracles were already happening all around me. I begun to feel I was flowing with the Universe, I met new people who were there to help me in this journey, I had a real sharp sense of intuition, and my understanding of things jumped to a new level. I was able to help people, and many of then started to call me their &quot;guardian angel&quot;, which I know I'm not, but I was still amazed at how I always had the right answer for a problem. I was able to manifest things I thought they were impossible before, things that go from &quot;I want a parking space near the entrance&quot; and I found the one which was right next to it, to healing myself from the flu in less than a day, or thinking about how much I needed a car, and two weeks later my dad bought a new one and gave me the one he was using before.

But this is WAY better. 20 years of self-development show the difference here.If you're not still in the spiritual bandwagon, this book will most likely change your life. And if you are already there, it will expand and, especially, nurture your search.As the author says, this book is about miracles, about a new dimension in life. Maybe the most important thing you will find here is a kind of special motivation that is omnipresent throughout the book; you don't know where exactly, but something starts clicking on you and it goes on and on.If you feel either disappointed or eager to learn some secrets of life, you can't go wrong with this book. I have read it three times and I think it is one of the finest works of its kind, and the best book from Wayne Dyer."},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"This book is worth a read but I can't agree that it's a five star book. I find that the author's egocentrism detracts from his message. All the anecdotes are about HIM. The book is supposed to be about how your life can be changed by following Dyer's advice so it would reinforce the message of he were to relate stories of those who have been helped by that advice and the actions/techniques he advocates.He basically rehashes the same message several times in the second half of the book, applying it to different aspects of life ( relationships, money, health ). I think he could have got the message across better by writing a shorter more focussed book.He stresses the importance of meditation but doesn't go into it in sufficient detail. I also think he mixes up discussion of meditation techniques which bring one to a state of mental stillness, and the activities of reflecting on life and creative visualization which could be carried out having arrived at a state of mental calm. He doesn't give much detail here and doesn't provide information on sources where details can be obtained.I think there are better authors of this kind of book out there."},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"This book is so profound that I actually find it difficult to sit down and write about it because I feel intimidated that I cannot give it the justice it deserves and won't be able to aptly express my appreciation of this little yet very profound spiritual gem.I first read this book about 10 years ago. It was the 1st spiritual book I had ever read. Within a few days my life was completely transformed. Yes, I said a few days. Just from following Wayne's very simple advice. It is so simple, it can actually be deceptive. We tend to brush these very simple principles off for more &quot;intensive&quot; teachings. We want something that gets into things like past psychoanalysis or something more &quot;complex&quot; that involves a lot of either writing journals, goal setting or some very &quot;deep&quot; philosphy that is usually quite dry but we force ourselves to read these things due to how supposedly &quot;deep&quot; these thinkers were.Then comes along a little book like &quot;Real Magic&quot; that is basically just teaching you that we can align ourselves with 'purpose'(realizing that we are spiritual beings having a human experience)and living every moment aligned with that and living our lives based on cultivating 'Knowings' instead of fear and doubt.Of course that is just an abbreviation of the teachings, but those are the 2 main points that continuously come up throughout the whole book.I don't know how Wayne managed to do it, but please trust me when I say this book is a very, very special book. I have read almost all of Wayne's book and they are all a variation of the same spiritual theme, but for some reason, I find this book to be just so effective, simple and magical. Even more than all his others to date.Now, even though I said that it changed my life in a few days, that does not mean that I didn't have huge challenges from the time I discovered 'Real Magic', times where I gave up on these teachings and dismissed them due to being &quot;overly simplistic&quot;. No matter how many times I feel that way, I always eventually come back to the foundation of these teachings and realize that these universal principles are so profound, life changing and spiritually enlightening.What I've learned over the years are 2 main things about this book: not to read this book as just another pop &quot;positive thinking&quot; book. That is not what makes this book magical. What makes it magical, is that Wayne found a way to create an extremely accessable book that will bring you closer to Spirit and the power of 'knowing'. The second thing is that like anything else, it takes a certain discipline and persevearance to make this work for a lifetime. It doesn't just &quot;click&quot; for life. There are times when one needs to really use the muscle of intention to keep it together. That is sometimes overlooked because we think that it should just 'flow' always. It doesn't quite work that way. However, eventually, your connection to Source deepens more and more and your connection becomes effortless most of the time.This is really a book about finding your true essence and manifesting miracles in the physical world. The outcome is joy and peace and a world where your deepest desires pop up and you manage the coincidences of your life...I'm not exaggerating when I say that!!You are Light, Spirit and Magic, this book will very simply teach how to access that domain of Heaven on Earth."},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"I've always liked Dr. dyers writing and this particular book is one of his best notwithstanding his occasional self infatuation. Few humans have the ability to be so precise in their visualisation ability as to manifest exactly what they think they want. All of us have hidden agendas which tend to contaminate the purity of the outcome. That's why being attached to the outcome is a limiting factor. Far better to make your request as &quot;this or something greater&quot;. For instance Florence Shin writes of a woman who desperately wanted a specific house to be hers. Her ability to manifest was so great that the owner of the house died and it came available for purchase. Now I'm not saying that she caused the owner to die but it seems to me that it's unreasonable to ask for that which belongs to someone else. The second reason to remain unattached to the outcome is that doing so may very well rob you of a far more wonderful manifestation. Another example would be insisting that a specific person should love you rather than asking for yourself to be loveable enough for the most amazing person to be attracted to you. I hope that clarifys things somewhat since Dr Dyer is apparently busy and HIS visualisation of the desired result has led me to try and answer your questions ;-)"},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"Someone very dear recommended this book, and though I am not into self-help books, I tried it. Didn't get very far, though, until I found the audio. Which I have now listened to 3 times. First time through I thought: this guy is kinda goofy. But there was enough there, that I decided to listen again and really started getting the picture. The author carefully blends a focus on spirituality and thought provoking methods of handling the curves we find in our lives. I will go back to the book itself next, then look for other works by this author. And will be practicing the art of Real Magic!"},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"This is probably one of my favorite books by Wayne Dyer with the other one being, You'll See It When You Believe It. I bought this when it was originally published in hardcover in 1992.Has it already been fifteen years? Geesh...This book really moved me deeply. I really feel that Dyer was at his writing \\"peak\\" at this time. I don't know if that is true or not but there was something very childlike...a spirit of enthusiasm...of joy... that seemed to leap off the pages. Maybe it was just me. Afterall, it was fifteen years ago. I was only 27 years young...not even in my thirties...I still had room in my belief system for miracles, magic, and a willingness to believe that I could change my world by changing my thoughts about it.I still do.He paraphrases a concept that was first \\"thrown out\\" to to the world by Teilihard de Chardin. A Jesuit priest, palentologist, and philosopher who not only believed in evolution, but believed we were in the midst of a spiritual evolution, as well. If you have been in metaphysics/spirituality for awhile now you have probably already heard this quote, \\"We are not human beings who have spiritual experiences, we are spiritual beings who have human experiences...\\"Think about that one for the next fifty years, people. The implications of this seemingly innocuous statement are HUGE!!We laugh now when we hear that there are still people \\"out there\\" living among us who still believe that the earth is flat, that we have never sent men to the moon (that it was all a ploy put on by our government), that the earth is the center of the universe. Of course, these things aren't true. We find them absurdely obvious. Well, why, then is it such a huge stretch to believe that we are primarily spiritual beings? If you have ever gone to an \\"open casket\\" ceremony, you would clearly see that there may be a body laying in that coffin, but that \\"person\\" is not there. We are visible because we are first invisible. We are spiritual beings now. All of these personalities, these behaviors, these habits that these bodies partake in have all been manufactured...created...formed by us! Our biggest challenge is that we have learned to identify with the small \\"s\\" self rather than with our larger \\"S\\" Self...the GodSELF...which is Love Itself...It is through this Love that we are made in and out of that we can be, do, and have that which we desire. Dyer asserts this on almost every page. If it's not written, it is implied. Maybe this is why I \\"fell in Love\\" with this book, because it was written at a time when I really wanted to \\"fall in Love\\"...not with another human being, but with Life Itself...I wanted to believe that it wasn't too late to experience miracles in my life...which, by the way are created by shifting to Love rather than fear...I wanted to believe that magic still existed. I didn't want to be content with what other people accepted as \\"real\\"...I wanted REALITY ITSELF...the stuff behind the appearance, the Spirit behind the creation...I returned to this book recently for some new inspiration...for a deeper inquiry into the Power of Love and what it can do when we consciously and deliberately apply it in our lives. Like I said, I feel Wayne Dyer was at his \\"peak\\" during this time creating books that were not only magical but believable and practical at the same time. In my opinion, it is truly Dyer's best...Peace & Blessings to all..."},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"As Dr. Dyer says, &quot;when the time is right the teacher will appear.&quot; I was so ready for this book, that when I finished it I flipped back to page 1 and started again. I've dog-eared pages that have specific meaning to me so I can go back and re-read them again and again. I realize this will be an on-going process for the rest of my life. &quot;Satori&quot; doesn't happen all the time, some things you just have to keep thinking about and trying to incorporate into your life. I love the message that &quot;everything you need - you already have inside of you.&quot; I never realized that before. I always thought that some things you have and some things you just don't.

It talks about positive thinking, meditation, following your bliss, and singleminded focus as a means of achieving great things in your life. Dr. Dyer calls these achievements \\"Real Magic.\\" This book is beautifully and intelligently crafted.I would recommend this book to people who struggle with sadness and loneliness. Changing your thoughts in the manner he suggests could win you a lot more happiness and friends. If that is the kind of help you seek, this book is for you!However, Dr. Dyer does not focus on the material world or achieving wealth. If you are a person who values wealth as part of a happy life, this book is not for you. You will become quickly frustrated by Dyer's emphasis on the spiritual and his insistence that if you do what you love, the money will \\"follow.\\" I know that wealth only \\"follows\\" if you understand business, investment, and economics or are privy to the advice of someone who does.Whether you are a sharp businessperson or not, positive thinking and focus can only help you. I hope you take something helpful away from this book."},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"This book is very fitting for the current times. The book is about creating miracles in your everyday life in a very transparent and sustainable way and becoming an example to your friends and family.I have put to practice the suggestion to dwell on what you are for, not what you do not want. This makes a lot of difference to the final outcome in your experience as your energy is then focused on your desired outcome.There will be less strife if we all adopt the lessons in spirituality taught in this book."},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"If you are ready for the information and insight that this book has to offer then it will be easily adaptable.

I was pretty skeptical when it came to these things...I don't usually go for the self help guru type, but for some reason, Wayne Dyer just makes sense. His thoughts and ideas are so logical. They touch a chord inside that says \\"Yes, that sounds...right\\". In a very big way, he is not trying to get you to see things *his* way, he's trying to get you to see things *your* way. And when you do that, wow, some pretty amazing things really do start happening.I have read a lot of Wayne Dyer, and in my opinion, this is his best work. It really covers everything, and in a way, it is almost an outline of other books in which he has taken some of these same ideas and expanded on them. Thank God they re-designed the cover!! The copy I had - purchased just a couple of years ago - had an old design with a big rainbow on it...looked very dated and 70's or something.Excellent choice.

In the vast new-age movement, there are many \\"esoteric\\" themes which I tend to be attracted to. While some may consider Wayne Dyer to be esoteric, I feel his writing is very personal and puts into perspective other ways of viewing life, while keeping the focus on what really matters. I have personally given this book as a gift to those I believe would benefit from it. The one message that keeps me grounded is that \\"There are no acidents.\\" Everything we ever experienced, had to happen to lead us to this present moment. We are asked not to judge, but rather observe our circumstances. That at least helps keep things in perspective for me and I can at least try to have a \\"quiet acceptance\\" of what is.Definitly get this book!"},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"Real Magic is an excellent book for those who want to take control of their lives.It has inspired me to do so and to view life from a different and more positive perception.An Inspiration for the down and trodden.Real magic is a book for the masses.Everyday Miracles: Stories That Touch Your Heart"},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"hello.i'm Irena from Maribor(Slovenia) and 6 month ago i read your first book.with this book my life became just like &quot;magic&quot;.i must say that i'm very happy that i read this book because my life bacame better and better.and i must say thank you to You.my wish is that some day i'll see you and hear you.sorry form my mistakes but i'm not so good at english.i'm beeter at germany. nice day. sincerely Irena"},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"As someone who has perhaps been a little cynical in the past, I can honestly say that this book is changing me - the way I think, the way I act - and I'm sure for the better.

The sense that something is missing can hang on your every movement. Real Magic was one of those books that came to me at the right time in my personal growth. A time when I needed to start focusing on what my purpose was here on this earth. Dr. Dyer does not try to win you over with theological arguments or motivational tricks.

It was an interesting read.But there is not a single original thought in this book. Now, there is nothing wrong with that in and of itself. If Dyer had said, 'Hey, I learned from the New Thought movement and applied it to my life, and here is what I learned,' that would be great. But instead he leads you to believe that he invented all of this stuff, that he, through the force of his gigantic mind, created a whole new philosophy. He didn't. Read Ralph Waldo Emerson and you will see. Go to a Church of Religious Science, and you will find a church based on this thinking, founded when Dyer was in diapers, or earlier.Dyer's refusal to give anyone else credit took away from my enjoyment of this book.

I also wanted to address the detachment comments: To manifest something you must have the desire to do so, obviously. But if you focus on what it is you think this will bring you, instead of being so attached to the direct result, your manifestation will come in some form to make you happy in the way you desire. For example, I have a friend who desperately needed a new car. At first, she tried to manifest money and it didn't work. She was attached to the outcome. But when she tried asking for a car, and not being attached to how she got it, a friend of hers was getting a new car and didn't want to fool with selling her old one, so she gave it to her!"},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"This is a charming book about not limiting yourself and letting go of the forces in your life that hold you back. I had avoided Dyer's books for years because I had an impression that they were mass market mumbo-jumbo fluff, and I am kicking myself for being so arrogant. This was the first Dyer book that i have read and it is wonderful.Dyer maps out a specific plan for you to be able to achieve your goals. He gives you specific strategies for how you can attain those goals. He describes the importance of balance in your life, and gives you permission to focus on yourself and your needs and wants. He shows you how the only thing that limits you is yourself, and that when you shed these perceived limitations, anything is possible.I recommend this book to anyone who would like a positive change in their life."},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"I'm a Brit' and I think we tend to find an overinflated ego like Dr. Dyer's a little more grating than our American cousins ( it's our character flaw but it is there ). For me, this tendency of Dr. Dyer's detracted from the message in the book. Others of my ilk might be similarly distracted.There is good stuff in this book but I think Dyer would reach his audience more effectively if he drew his examples from other people's lives rather than almost exclusively from his own. For example, it's very nice to know that Dr. Dyer has overcome fears about public speaking and has actually won a prestigious award in the field. However, I would rather hear him tell me that Mr. X, after applying Dr Dyer's pointers was able to effect a similar transformation. I think the idea is that Dr Dyer has not only been able to effect such transformations in his own life but that he has been able to articulate how he achieved this to others in a way that has enabled them to make similar progress.I also find it hard to believe that a person with such a conspicuous ego can make a claim to be enlightened which I understood implied the disappearance of the ego illusion. Again this detracts from the message because it raises the suspicion that Dr Dyer is to some degree a fraud. In the end it doesn't matter whether he has an ego or not, but it would be better to give the impression that it was under better control since he is presenting himself as the model of perfection which can be achieved by following the advice given in the book.I find that Dr Dyer attempts to be a polished stylish writer yet somehow falls irritatingly short. I think he needs to work a little harder on his style. I think this may be a UK-US thing. There seems to be a lot more leeway over the pond as to what constitutes a grammatically correct or aesthetically acceptable sentence.I would have liked to have seen a little more discussion of meditation. While he constantly returns to meditation as the cornerstone of his strategy to getting to purpose, he leaves it to other authors to provide exact guidance, and alas does not make any specific recommendations ( there's no bibliography ). I also find that he freely mixes up what I might call meditation ( emptying the mind - seems like a misnomer really ) and contemplation / visualization. These are very different activities. I might very well contemplate or visualize after meditation, having used the meditation to cleanse or energize the mind, but I think there's a muddle here.I also think his attempts at metaphysical philosophizing needed a little more editing before getting to print. I am sure he knows what he means, but if he wants to broach such subjects he needs to be very careful to communicate his ideas in a clear and methodical manner.Finally, I think there's a better 120 page book just bursting to get out of this 320 page one. I really think that it would be a better book if Mr Dyer distilled it down to the pure essence which is basically repeated over and over in various contexts.In summary, I would give five stars for the intentions of the book but don't feel it deserves such high praise once those intentions are put to one side."},{"Title":"Real Magic","review":"REAL MAGIC is another work by Dr. Dyer that literally had me absorbed and excited and reading along with highlighter in hand (Which is my highest accolade I suppose).

REAL MAGIC is a real source of bound inspiration - the kind of book I read and think \\"Oh yeah, this is what I need to do to get my life back on course.\\" It reminds me of who I truly am. It's very applicable and very readable and is about miracles yet very much grounded in the real world...which is something I look for in books of this nature.

I wouldn't recommend that anyone look to any one book to answer all of the questions they have about life FOR them ... but if you're motivated to explore the possibilities of your own life and are looking for a great place to start and a book that will provide wonderful insights along the way as your mind begins to grasp your own full potential, this is a book I can strongly recommend.

I would like to add that there are other works, most notably the Seth books (Seth Speaks, and The Nature of Personal Reality), which describe in much more detail exactly how physical reality is formed and our part in forming it. Other excellent books include Lynda Dahl's &quot;Beyond the Winning Streak&quot; and &quot;Ten Thousand Whispers&quot;, Pamela Oslie's &quot;Make Your Dreams Come True&quot;, and Christopher Stone's &quot;Re-creating Your Self&quot;.

I would really like to believe that it is possible to manifest everything I visualise, exactly as I visualise it. But it is common knowledge that this does not happen in life. So many of us have had so many dreams in which we really believed, and tried our best, but they did not materialise. In other words, the outcome was not what was visualised. What does Dr. Dyer have tosay about this ? He says you should not have any attachment to the outcome. That means, you detach yourself from results, and you will feel perfectly OK if your dreams do not come true. That means he does admit that many cherished dreams will not come true. In that case, his claim that everything you visualise (without an iota of doubt in your mind) will manifest, is a false claim. Unless Dr. Dyer can give a sensible answer to the question of unfulfilled ambitions, aspirations and dreams, one is left wondering whether he has told us anything we didnt know or try before.Most of us know the importance of focusing on the goal, perseverance, hard work, and so on, and are also mentally prepared for disappointment, because our experience has shown that things will often not turn out the way you want them to, EVEN IF you wish deeply and truly for them to happen.Sometimes it's your fault, and sometimes it isn't. Hindus believe that it is one's karma, in accordance to one's previous actions, maybe in previous lifetimes. They believe that some of the things that happen to you are inescapabale consequences of your former deeds. (As you sow, so shall you reap). Real Magic is hard to believe in, unless the author comes up with an explanation of why so many worthwhile dreams have not materialised. I would agree with Dr. Dyer if he says that everything we visualise will manifest, but not necessarily in one's present birth. Maybe in a future birth. I hope the author will post a reply.

For every recovering anorexic who achieves long-term health, there are untold numbers of others who don't make it. There's an old saying among therapists that there are four barriers to recovery--health, wealth, youth, and brains. Unfortunately for Jennifer Hendricks, she had an abundance of all four. Part Shakespearean-style tragedy and part psychiatric case study, Jen's story is both fascinating and disturbing all at once. With the loving help of her father Gordon, Jen's voice rises from the grave through a series of journals kept over a ten-year period, from her high school days until her untimely death at age 25.On the surface, the Hendrickses lived a life you see only on television. A close-knit family with five children (Jen is #3), the father had a nice steady job; the mother devoted herself to home and church. The two oldest children had already spread their wings and headed off to college. Jen herself was an honor student who later graduated valedictorian of her high school class. She had everything to live for. So what on earth would cause Jen to develop such strong pervasive feelings of disgust and self-loathing and to wish she were dead? There is no single answer, although her therapists certainly tried to invent one.Jen bounced from many psychiatrists, therapists, and treatment centers. At one point she encountered a rather bizarre self-proclaimed faith healer, who attempted to perform a slipshod exorcism. Nothing seemed to help. Anorexia is like alcoholism in many ways. It is strong, chronic, and vexing, and it defies rehabilitation. There is considerable debate over whether anorexia has a biological base, is an outward symptom of deeper pathology, or is the result of external conditioning in a society obsessed with weight and beauty. Does an anorexic really \\"choose\\" to stay sick? Jen tries repeatedly to answer these questions herself. Maybe deep down she truly wanted death, because she lacked the inner resources to cope with life. Jen tried to hasten the process on a couple of occasions by cutting herself or swallowing pills. But she survived every overt suicide attempt, as someone always found her in time.Although anorexia literally means \\"without appetite,\\" Jen was hungry, hungry, HUNGRY. Starved for love and approval, she seeks them from an emotionally distant mother and equally distant and sometimes cruel psychiatrists and mental health workers. Jen often flashbacks to graphic images of profound physical and sexual abuse suffered at the hands of both relatives and family friends. In some parts though, it would appear that Jen developed a severe case of False Memory Syndrome. I personally believe she was somehow traumatized as a child; however, her memories may have been magnified and embellished in therapy. One reviewer surmised that Jen had Borderline Personality Disorder; while Jen may have displayed BPD characteristics, I am not qualified to make such an assessment. There is no doubt that Jen had Major Depression, and no one could come up with an effective treatment plan.Jen may have reached numeric adulthood, but she remained a child, both in body and in mind, and a wounded child at that. She kept saying she wanted to get better, but anorexia was too ingrained in her very identity. And no one would or could help her carve out a new self-image that did not include anorexia. By the time Jen reached a real turning point--that she was \\"sick and tired of being sick and tired,\\" and we see a true glimmer of hope for the first time ever, it is too late. Jen's body shuts down, tormented from years of abuse and having cannibalized itself just to make it to the next day. There was nothing left.Overall, I am glad I read this book, for giving me new insights into the mystery of anorexia. Jen left us a valuable gift. However, my criticisms are based mainly on presentation and style. There were times when Jen went for months without a single entry. Gordon Hendricks attempts to fill in the gaps by recreating scenes and dialog that he personally witnessed, as well as hypothesizing what went on in Jen's therapy sessions. The connections are very choppy in places, and I had a hard time following--sometimes having to backtrack several pages to remind myself of where we were.Also, while Jen's entries are dated, year stamps are noticeably absent. I suspect this was done intentionally, to give the book a \\"timeless\\" feel. However, there are clues as to the time period (e.g. references to movies, TV shows, etc.). My guess is that the action takes place from 1979 to 1989 or 1990. Anorexia was only just starting to come into the public consciousness. Without defending poor medical practice, which is pervasive throughout, if Jen's health team seems ignorant of anorexia, it's because they are! We have come a long way over the last twenty or so years.For that reason, I am less concerned about fledgling anorexics using this book as a \\"how to\\" manual, and more worried that some people might see this book as Exhibit A of anorexia treatment. This in turn might prevent patients and their families from seeking the help that they so desperately need.One other thing--we need to remember that Jen's story is viewed strictly through the lens of a sick girl and her grieving father. I would have liked some commentary from the mental health profession, like from a psychologist or psychiatrist who specializes in eating disorders. There were times when Jen's parents were advised to stay away from her, but that recommendation was likely more for the sanity of the parents than for the treatment of Jen.Verdict: It's not a literary masterpiece, like \\"The Diary of Anne Frank.\\" However, it deserves a spot in every high school, public, and medical library, as a chilling testament to one girl's life that went hellishly wrong and the betrayal by the very safeguards that had been set up to protect her in the first place."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"&quot;Slim to None&quot; is a very compelling read, but should also be a very disturbing one for anyone involved with the treatment of eating disorders. Jennifer's diaries, interspersed with commentary from her father and narrative history of some of her treatment experiences, provide a fascinating glimpse into the inner life of a young woman caught up in the throes of a serious, and eventually fatal, eating disorder. They also provide a clear insight into how far off-track the treatment for these complex and difficult disorders can get, and how devastating the results can be. Doubtless a useful warning for many. However, the book also poses, indirectly, many important ethical questions which would probably in some cases apply to many mental disorders. Chief among them is the whole issue of when a patient should be allowed to refuse treatment, even if that refusal is tantamount to a slow suicide. Unfortunately the book never addresses the question directly, leaving the reader hanging in mid-air on this issue. I also would have liked to have read some of the views of the doctors and therapists who tried to work with Jennifer during her illness. The insights of the patient and family are valuable, but it would have been interesting to read how the professionals viewed her illness and the treatment available to her.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who works with those suffering from eating disorders. Unlike some other customer-reviewers, however, I would strongly discourage anyone currently in the throes of an eating disorder from reading it. I think the many emotional triggers it contains could actually harm some sufferers."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"I am a recovering anorexic. I was hospitalized numerous times before something inside of my mine just snapped and I was ready to let go. Really ready. And I am one of the very few lucky ones.I love this book. Jennifer's father reminds me of my own and the struggle he put up to keep me alive.My father never gave up. Jennifer's father held on until the very end when he finally gave in and knew she was going to die. My heart breaks for him, and for Jennifer.Eating disorder treatment has come a LONG way since Jennifer's struggle, but it is still severely flawed. Insurance companies are atrocious and refuse to pay for long term care. Families without means to pay for repeated and extended treatment are left stranded. Every single person in my family, including extended family, took out a loan and combined their money to pay for my treatments. One private hospital took me in for free after my dad pleaded with them and my doctors had said I would die. This hospital, my family's love, and luck saved my life.It shouldn't be so difficult to obtain treatment for a fatal disease. That's the message Jennifer's father is trying to get across. I've read some other reviews who express concern that people criticize treatment, and may be less inclined to seek it after reading this book. But I think it is a powerful statement that has been a long time in coming.When are we going to view eating disorders as biological illnesses that cause psychological illness? When are the doctors and hospitals and insurance companies, not to mention society in general, going to see eating disorders for what they are?Medical. Fatal. Diseases.Like cancer of the mind. They must be fought early and aggressively. And it must be POSSIBLE to do that. For anyone who suffers with an eating disorder.Thank you, Mr. Hendricks, for writing this book. Thank you."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"As the parent of an anorexic teen I commend the author of this book for his courageous exploration of the nightmare world of eating disorders. Slim to None is a devastating story of family and personal trauma that makes real an illness that is often dismissed as silly and superficial. This book provides meaningful insight into the family interactions surrounding the disease and validates my own personal experience. Many of my friends who read this book found it difficult and disturbing. For me, it describes the reality I face on a day to day basis. I found most compelling the father's acceptance of his daughter's choice and fate. The author has defined with compassion the very difficult position of a parent in letting go with love. Ultimately, this book gives me hope.I recommend this book to anyone who faces the crisis of a family member with an eating disorder and for those intimately connected with the issue. It is impossible to get inside the head of an eating disordered individual. I think Slim to None provides that insight and an opportunity for understanding as well."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"Slim to None is the first account of anorexia that I've ever read to be true.

This book gives hope that there one day will be some kind of intelligent insight into this aweful illness."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"Slim to none is the diary of an anorexia patient, Jennifer Hendricks. This is a difficult and frustrating read. Jenny is totally confused through must of the book, due, not only by her severe eating disorder, but also through all the crazy \\"therapies\\" to try to heal her. It is an important story to be told to see just how misunderstood the disease was, even by doctors. Everyone had a different idea on how to heal Jenny, and most of them exceeding is only making her worse. The worst shame of it all is that Jenny tried so hard for so long and spent most of those years that she writes about, in one hospital or another. The last years of her life are revolved around her troubled thoughts and lost hopes of a normal life. I think this book is important for all doctors and families of people struggling with eating disorders. Also, anyone who is studying about eating disorders. As far as the story part of the book goes, it is repetitious, especially in the beginning, but keep reading, it is worth it in the end."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"I honestly could not put this book down. As a former anorexic, I really related to the thoughts, expectations, and actions that Jennifer had when she was going through her life battle. I thank her family and especially her father for sticking by their daughter in such an extreme time and continuing to show care, love and attention. I pray that males and females alike will never have to go through this struggle, so read this book in awareness of the constant struggle and hold that an eating disorder has over your entire life!"},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"This book struck a real chord with me. I am overcome with sadness and sympathy for this poor girl and her father-who obviously would have done anything in the world to save her. You get the feeling reading it that she couldn't be saved, and it seemed to me one of her doctors, who may have been able to save her early on-ruined any chance she had at recovery.Another thing that seemed evident to me is that the right treatment must be sought early on-because things become more hopeless the longer it goes. I would have liked to have had a section with photos of Jenny and her family. A sad but amazing book."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"Ms. Hendricks gives a wrenching account of what it's like to struggle with an ED from both sides - the victim's and the family's. She also hopefully helps to expose the often-ineffective and downright inept attempts at \\"treatment\\" that some sufferers have experienced - \\"behavior modification\\" and outright punishment by some therapists that can often result in regression once the patient is discharged."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"Before reading this I thought &quot;Wasted&quot; was the best book on eating disorders. Now I have found its' match.Jenny starts dieting at a young age, never suspecting that it will lead her down a road of misery and hopeless treatment. She deals with hospital after hospital, treatment after treatment approach, none of their attempts helping Jenny in her road to recovery. She never gives up, and faces her eating disorder with a determined mind set. However, no matter how hard she tries, Jenny cannot seem to pick herself up long enough to accomplish long term health, and slowly becomes more and more ill, devastating and puzzling all those around her, until eventually everyone gives up and decides to let her die.This story had me in tears. It exposes the raw truth of anorexia and what its' victim goes through. I related to much of Jenny's story and would recommend it to anyone who suffers from an eating disorder or has experienced seeing a friend or loved one deal with one."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"I read this book in just one sitting. Jennifer Hendricks offers in painstaking detail and honesty what it is like to be anorexic. For anyone who has any kind of history or flirtation with this disease, or any other for that matter, the author offers insight to educate people about the causes, treatments, and lingering mysteries of this horrible disease. Eloquently written, the author gives us the gift of her innermost thoughts, her private struggles, and will to live -- and die. Readers will be forever moved and forever changed after reading this book."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"Jennifer Hendricks had a disease that ultimately killed her. However, the strength and courage she displayed while battling anorexia are very humbling. This book allows you to see the disease from the sufferer's perspective, rather than an &quot;expert&quot; perspective. When she knew she was dying, she asked her father to keep the journals she kept during her long battle and to try to do some good with them. He has kept his promise...the book is mostly taken from her journals with a few notes from her father to help clarify. It is an eye-opening experience to read about all that Jennifer suffered, both from her anorexia and from the attempts to &quot;cure&quot; it that ultimately failed."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"Anorexia is a disease that affects teenagers in every high school. Slim to None helps us to understand this terrible disease. It gives us ideas of some of alternative treatments that could help young girls overcome their obsession with food. Unlike the other books on eating disorders, Slim to None tells the reader exactly how she feels at the time of her deepest sorrows. This gives the reader a real idea of what this terrible disease is about and how it affects an individual both physically and mentally. This book is clearly going to educate readers in a way that no other book will be able to. Slim to None should be read by not only those directly involved with eating disorders, but by everyone. All high school libraries should have a copy available at all times."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"&quot;It took three weeks for my body to shut down. When I was close to the end, I couldn't see very well and could talk only in hoarse whispers because my mouth was so dry. I slept most of the time. But I didn't feel sick. I felt at peace, finally emptied of all the mind and body filth. No more terrifying flashbacks. No more disgust with my body . . . with me. Nothing hurt. I wasn't even hungry. And I didn't have to worry about how guilty I feel when I eat and throw up, and even worse, how anguished I feel when I eat and don't throw up.&quot;--Jennifer Hendricks, age twenty-fiveGreat Book..everyone should read it if they like memoirs of anorexia."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"Depressing. I had to put down the book a lot because I felt to sad, depressed, hopeless, and pathetic to read it. This book did trigger me in the fact it gave me \\"there is no hope in me recovering my eatting disorder\\" thoughts. I don't know why. The second time I read threw it, the same thing did NOT happen. My best bet was I was triggered at that point anyway. The book was okay. I liked all the journal entrys and those parts but I found the parts the father wrote to be rather- dull. Not very good writing. All and all this book was okay. Worth reading but definitally not a favorite by far."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"The best thing about Slim to None is its detailed and honest first-person account of an eating disorder. It does a good job of chronicling Jenny's emotional pain, and her father's comments make it clear that he loved her very much and make the book pretty heart-wrenching. It's also somewhat unusual among eating disorder books in that it talks much more about Jenny's emotions than her eating behaviors, and it probably wouldn't be too triggering for those in recovery. However, in terms of providing a clear overall picture of Jenny's anorexia, the book is not terribly successful - the only two people we hear from are Jenny and her father, and neither of them is able to offer any coherent explanations or theories about why Jenny got sick or what might have made her better. At the end of the book I felt sadder than when I began, but still just as much in the dark about what actually happened, and it's a lot of pages to read to gain so little psychological insight. As the title suggests, the book definitely makes its point that current treatments are unsuccessful, but it doesn't really explain why they don't work or offer any suggestions or solutions."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"As tragic as this story is, I was completely moved by its power to inspire and educate. I learned so much about eating disorders that I've never read before, and perhaps that is because there is a book finally written by someone who is telling us the truth about it -- instead of some Lifetime movie that always turns out happy in the end.Jennifer Hendricks was a beautiful writer and I feel I got to know her really well and connect with her, which I haven't done with an author in a long time."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"I am just starting down the long road of treating anorexia. Believe it or not, my father, at the ripe age of 86, has developed a severe case. Not knowing much about the disorder, I bought books and started reading. This was the third book I read. I got it because it was about a father/daughter and thought it might shed some light on what was coming for us. But by page 36 I was questioning the \\"treatment\\" Jenny was getting. I found myself, even with my limited knowledge of the disorder, questioning what kind of therapist would ever say or do some of the things that were happening here. Finally, by around 50 pages into the book it dawned on me that despite a 2003 publication date, these events must have happened decades ago. It was hard to find the years these things happened in, in her journal entries you see only months/days. Eventually, by mentioning a movie she went to see and by closely looking at the clothing and hair style on the cover photo, it became clear these events took place in the 70's and 80's. Now these ridiculous \\"treatments\\" and \\"approaches\\" made sense, the knowledge base and treatment facilities at that time was in it's infancy.Unfortunately, I was not interested in knowing how things were done 25 years ago when this disorder first became public, I need to know what to expect today. So while it is an interesting read, the \\"wasteland\\" of treatments they speak of is from the 70's and 80's and not current. I feel that should have been made perfectly clear early on and it is not."},{"Title":"Slim to None : A Journey Through the Wasteland of Anorexia Treatment","review":"I READ THIS BOOK AND WAS IMPRESSED WITH IT.

But page after page about a self-absorbed brat with a pathetically devoted and brainwashed father enabling her 14-year suicide was disgusting, frustrating, and depressing.I understand that anorexia is not a choice, but I don't think this book is about an anoretic. It's more about someone with borderline personality disorder and how effectively that can wear on people's -- even professionals' -- patience. And how effectively it can manipulate the willing, even in getting them to publish sappy memoirs posthumously. I agree that the book brings up ethical questions about psychiatric care that need to be addressed. It made me wish someone would just take her to a shelter and put her to sleep so I wouldn't have to read any more of her whining, false-memory-spewing nonsense."},{"Title":"General Stand Watie's Confederate Indians","review":"If you are not familiar with the american Indian (Particularly Cherokee) role in the war between the states, then this is a good place to begin learning."},{"Title":"General Stand Watie's Confederate Indians","review":"....one of the worst of which is that the Confederacy was a white, Anglo-Saxon monolith. The truth is that the Confederacy pioneered the idea of giving blacks and women positions of authority [the Matron Law], placed Jews in positions of power, and put General's stars on a Mexican. And, we had the first American Indian General; this wonderful book is his story.Stand Watie was born in Georgia in 1806, and went west on the Trail of Tears. In Oklahoma, he became a rich, powerful, slave-owning rancher. [Yes, Indians owned slaves; so did Jews, Mexicans, and, surprise, Blacks]. He also gained both friends and enemies; as one of the two rival Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee Nations, he headed the Mixed Blood faction, which some thought got along a little too well with the government. [The other Chief, John Ross, was also a rich slave-owning rancher, living in a mansion, married to a white woman; he had less Indian blood than Watie]. Sort of like the Pure Bloods and the Mud-Bloods in the Harry Potter stories, only this wasn't funny........When the Civil War came, both sides wanted the Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes in present day Oklahoma; enter another of the few Civil War characters who provide a measure of comic relief, Brigadier General Albert Pike, sent by the Confederacy to recruit the Indians; he did a pretty good job, too, capitalizing on the very real beef that the Indians had with the US. Pike's Civil War career is a minor footnote to a long, productive life. Today, he is best known as the philosopher of Scottish Rite Masonry. Pike resigned in late 1862 [Maybe---another topic], and was replaced by the more conventional, but less colorful, Douglas Cooper. Cooper said that Pike was either disloyal to the Confederacy, or was insane; Masons know which was the case.....Oklahoma saw action all thru the war; the battles aren't as well known as the eastern ones, but the troops gave just as much, and the dead were just as dead. Stand Watie was a hero of Wilson's Creek, and proved to be an effective leader the whole way. Indeed, this was a theatre of operations where the Confederacy remained viable right to the end. Stand Watie was rewarded with General's stars in 1864, and was the very last Confederate General to stack arms.This book is a true classic, a well written account of a part of the Civil War that most people don't even know existed..

Still, a wonderful little book to give as a gift to oneself or to a treasured friend or relative: it makes Christmas more special than our style of celebration can provide."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"I first met this story many years ago in the excellent TV production narrated by Truman Capote and starring Geraldine Page. I thought it came closer to capturing the meaning of Christmas than anything I had seen on TV. I immediately bought a special gift edition of the book for myself and for many of my friends. Every year since I have read it and watched it on tape and now DVD.I wanted this year to get a book for the five college students in our family that they might cherish from year to year. This edition with its lovely drawings is exactly that. The added DVD of Celeste Holme's reading the story is a bonus.Capote tells a very simple story of how an older cousin and he prepared for Christmas, baking fruit cakes, hunting the perfect tree, and making kites as surprise gifts for each other. As they fly their kites on a beautiful Christmas Day, she tells him that she suddenly realized in the beauty of that moment that the Lord was already come, &#34;that things as they are, just what we've always seen, was seeing him.&#34; Isn't that what Incarnation means."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Capote did a nice job on this book which was later turned into movi, twice. It is a true story of Truman when he was a little boy and his relationship with an old aunt. The highlight of the story is the making of the Christmas cakes. &#34;It's Christmas cake weatha&#34; calls out the aunt to Truman as they go out picking up walnuts and then all of the other ingredients that are needed for all of the cakes. She has saved all year in order to get the few dollars that she needs to buy everything. She gives them all away every year to people. lovely story"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"This Christmas book is a treasure, beautifully illustrated, and a joy to read. The CD is nice but I was disappointed that a female voice is the narrator. That doesn't fit, as it is supposed to be in Buddy's voice, the young Truman Capote. So I would have preferred a male voiced narration."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"This was a gift to someone who had never read it. Written by Capote before his decent into drugs. Very tender & heart warming."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"I love this &#34;A Christmas Memory&#34;, by Truman Campote. It is another that I could read with my 9 year old Grandson and we could share the story and discuss what we liked or disliked about the story. We both agreed, it was very enjoyable. The &#34;Old&#34;Cousin was a very vibrant and entertaining character."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"I purchased this book &#34; A Christmas Memory&#34; by Truman Capote for a friend. I have my own copy and I love it. I place it on a par with Dickens Christmas Carol and I'm sure many people would relate very readily to each of the characters, particularly Aunt Sook.. The story is beautiful and the illustrations also. Agnes Lorentzen"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Since I first discovered this story years ago it has been a favorite. Capote has put together words that create strong emotions to a reader. For those of us old enough to have some parallel remembrances this story is a treasure."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"I loved this book about a young boy, his kind old cousin, and other relatives that just didn't understand her eccentric ways! Capote gave us a deep look into the loving and giving heart of his elderly cousin--a heart that few people ever took the time to really see. A beautiful story and a memoir of Capote's early life in rural Alabama. I will read this book again and again and give it as gifts to my friends. For adults and children. Great read!!!Denise GeorgeAuthor of: Johnny Cornflakes:A Story About Loving the Unloved"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Truman Capote was arguably one of America's best writers of this century. Once quoted as saying that writing for a living is like being a professional &quot;pool shark,&quot; he was weird, witty, and wonderful. But this warm simple story stands in sharp contrast to his public persona. Try reading it aloud with a dry eye. A perfect addition to any family's Christmas tradition"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"The price is steep but these stories are spectacularin the way only Truman can be. I found many readerswho had ruled out truman after being forced to read&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; in school were willing to give himanother try with this volume. This is probably dueto the fact that the book is nicely made and short.I really think it's worth owning and worth givingCapote another shot."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Truman Capote is a successful author, especially in the novel The Christmas Memory. This novel is guaranteed to bring strong emotions! If you ever read the novel, you'll even agree that this writing will point out to all the audience that it teaches us something about grown ups need to spend more time with younger kids and all ages. Older people can always inspire kids if they try. Sook is a old woman that has no friends. Buddy being around helps her out more than it does him. The old woman being around Buddy helps him learn to be a good young boy. Buddy keeps Sook company. So she doesn't get depressed and lonely as much. It made me realize how important it is for all families to get along and get close. Everyone is a better person that way. They're no arguements in the family then. The other part of the family does care about others, but dont take time out to understand others. The proof of others not caring anymore is when they want to send Buddy off. He could do just as good there. They just wanted to get rit if of and to be rude to Sook. I think this novel is a perfect novel to show others how important your family can be to you."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"The story is good, as others have said, but please study the writing itself: exquisite and, in my opinion, the model for all writers--clear, fluid, seemingly simple, but every word perfect, with deep emotional weight, fine observation, indelible images. Two kites entwined? Unforgettable. A perfect gift for any writer, and hold onto your own copy, too."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote is sure to make you think about relationships and love between friends. The overall plot of this memior made me involved in the happy relationship and story, then I shared in the sadness also. The loving, childish relationship between two cousins, Sook and Buddy, made me react strongly to this story. Furthermore, scenes like the adventerous encounter with Mr. Haha and Sook's childish personality overtook my emotions and made me more involved in the story. A Christmas Memory is a novel that can certainly make you experience love, happiness, adventure, and sadness and feel it strongly in perhaps a real-life situation."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote is the most moving and truly sincere book I have ever read. The sincere love Buddy showed toward Sook was entirely inspirational and unique in all aspects. During the time that Buddy was at military school, Sook showed her devotion to him by sending him letters (with a dime for a picture show) and fruitcakes. Buddy was growing up but he still loved Sook and refused to revoke his love for her. When the horrorindious news arrived one day, something in Buddy had already told him it was so. Buddy looked toward the sky, as he expected &quot;rather like hearts a lost pair of kites hurrying toward heaven. A Christmas Memory may be just a story, but once you enter the pages of the book the lives of these people come to life and entwine with your own."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas Memory, by Truman Capote, is a heart-warming Christmas story about the special relationship shared between a young boy and his best-friend (his elderly woman cousin). Buddy, the young boy, has lived with his cousins since he can remember. Through the years he has developed a special bond with his elderly cousin, Sook. Only his mean, old, witchy cousin, Jenny (whom I did not like very much) makes him go off to Militery School right after Christmas. When it came down to the day when Buddy had to leave, Jenny (the old bat) wasn't going to let Sook walk him to the bus stop. Buddy and Sook didn't know if they were ever going to see each other again, and they knew that that was probably going to be their last Christmas together. Buddy's other elderly cousins, Sebone and Calley, didn't want Buddy to go. Calley tried to explain to Jenny that Buddy made them feel young. But being the mean, old person that Jenny was, she just didn't understand. And sent him away anyway. Sebone and Calley had their strong feelings about him leaving, but they weren't going to stand up to Jenny. A Christmas Memory is guaranteed to make you grab for the tissues. If you are like me, you will defintely shed at least a tear, unless you're in front of a bunch of other people. But even then you might still let one slip. I know a few people that did. I will defintely read this story to my kids, as well as my grandkids to let them feel the emotional moments I felt when I was their age."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Truman Capoete's A Cristmas Memory really made me have so many different emoitions. My gandma owns a Nursing Home, so I have been around elderly all my life. This story reminds me of so many different realtionships that I have had with diffent people. In the end when buddy was taken away struck my emotions the hardest, because a lot of the people that I have been close to in the Nursing Home has been taken away in death or in another way. This story book made me laugh and made me edgy at certain points. it was kind of like what I would be feeling if i was actually one of the chracters in the story. I loved it when they went to Ha Ha Jone's cafe, I thought that something was going to happen to them. The little edginess that I felt left when they went home, and got the dog drunk. This book is a true classic. This story made me think about the people that have been taken away. It brought sadness and cheer to my heart. After I read it, and started thinking about the people I was once so close to. This book might stir up some emotions about the different people that have been in your life, it did for me. But it is such a wonderful book, everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Three short stories about memories of Capote's childhood in Alabama with his dear elderly cousin. Sweet, heartfelt, and well-written. It's perfect cozy Christmas reading. :)"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote is sure to teach you to cherish life and the people that make you who you are. Sook was always there for Buddy and with her childish behavior and personality it made Buddy love her that much more. Exciting parts in the story include the scenes where Sook and Buddy went to Mr. HaHa Jones' house to get the whiskey for the fruit-cakes. Sook showed her love for Buddy by being by his side throughout his life with her. Sooks childish personality took over my mind. It was amazing that she was so intelligent yet she was a child at heart. The incident with Mr. HaHa Jones was frightning because of the grumpy attitude he had toward other people. A Christmas Memory is a novel that will surely make you make oyu understand the how wonderful it is to have a best friend that loves you a lot."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"The book, A Christmas Memory, by Truman Capote, is an exremely emotional book. It is full of great characters and sad situations. I put myself into Buddy's shoes and imagine if I was him and being sent away to military school, how would I feel? I would feel like I was not wanted and I was being sent away. Sent away from the people you love and make you who you are. This part of the book made me think about how difficult it would be to leave everything you love. Buddy and Sook spent all their time together and suddenly Buddy was being sent away and Sook felt like she was losing him like her old friend who died also named Buddy. This book is a very strong and moving novel that I would recomend to anyone."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"The only fault with this little book is just that. It's so short and suddenly...it's over. Fun to read but somewhat of a disappointment considering the other works of the author"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Truman Capote's picture book A Cristmas Memory was a great book because it taught you that life isnt always good. They were sending Buddy away to a military school and they were getting very emotional because they knew they wrent going to see each other ever again It made me feel mad because the &quot;higher power&quot; didn't care about their feelings about each other I felt bad because it would be horrible if you lost your best friend to a military camp. This book makes you cherish the things that you have in life."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote will make you realize how deeply you care for someone special in your life. When Buddy was told that he had to go to military shcool this changed the whole mood of the story by causing a conflict. I felt that the way they stuck together though the rough times. I felt that he did not deserve to go becuse he was where he wanted to be and that was home. A Christmas memory is a very emotional book that will make you feel some very strong emotions."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"The novel A Christmas Memory written by Truman Capote will give you strong emotions. One thing that I acted strongly about was when his cousin was going to send Buddy off to military school. It made me angry at his cousin when she thought that was what was best for a seven year old child. Sook, his friend started to sob, its just not right. A Christmas memory will make you feel sad and angry, but I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas memory by Truman Capote makes you have many diffrent strong fellings. Buddy's aunt choose to send him to a military school. He didn't want to go but she thought it was best for him. In the book Buddy had a friend. She was his cusin. They had been together every since Buddy was little. This was their last Christmas together. He didn't want to leave his friend but he had to. When he leaft that was the hardest part in the book. A Christmas Memory can certainly make you be sad and mad at diffrent times. Your emotions change real fast."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"&quot;A Christmas Memory&quot; is truly one of the most enduring and heartwarming holiday tales ever to grace the pages of American literature. This soothing bit of classic Americana written by Truman Capote is as warming on a cold winter night as a steaming cup of hot, mulled cider in front of a crackling fire under my grandmother's afghan. The touching and refreshing friendship between Buddy and his &quot;friend&quot; is not only delightful but something to cherish as one teaches the other of the old timeless traditions of the past and the new wonders of the future. Buddy's total acceptance of his &quot;friend&quot; and her somewhat offbeat perspective on life and the changing world around them is what drives this story throughout it's moments of childlike magic to it's ultimate bittersweet conclusion. The belief in love and the bond that can exist between two people of completely different generations and the hope that wherever we go and however many miles may come between us, that bond can never be broken is the foremost message of this precious tale. Given the events of resent months, a story like this helps to heal as well as entertain and is more then just another book to be put away on the shelf. &quot;A Christmas Memory&quot; is a blessed gift to be read again and again, year after year and to be welcomed into home and hearth as a dear, old friend unexpectedly visiting on a chilly Christmas morning."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Before I read the text of Capote's masterpiece, I saw the 1967 television production with Geraldine Page and literally fell in love with it. Long before the short story was adapted by many literature anthologies, I read it aloud to my students between Thanksgiving and Christmas. In fact, I had my freshmen students write letters to Mr. Capote in 1977. We were very surprised to receive a postcard of thanks from him in his distinctive, delicate script. The card is a treasure of mine to this day. Now that I have left the classroom, I take out the story and read it aloud to myself at this time of year. It is a gem. I have yet to read it without tears in my eyes when I finish. No piece of literature has ever affected me quite the way &quot;A Christmas Memory&quot; has. I can't imagine any Southerner reading it and not nderstanding the era and locale and the mystique of &quot;fruitcake weather.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Almost 20 years ago, I first saw the film made from this story. It was late one winter night and I couldn't sleep. I turned on the television and found a story with a play type of format. The film had been on for who knows how long, but no matter, I was intrigued by the characters very quickly. The television guide had no listing for what I had seen. I almost felt as if it was a story meant for me alone. After it was over, it haunted me for quite some time, and it took some library research to find out the title and that it was written by Truman Capote. Since then, I've read this story many times, and always enjoy each and every page.This is such a heart warming tale and the simplicity in which it's written is truly brilliant. It's told through the words of a seven year old boy and relates his memories of Miss Sook Faulk, and the Christmas tradition that they shared during the Great Depression years. The story is autobiographical, and the boy is Truman Capote.Miss Faulk was Truman's elderly cousin, but she always called him &quot;Buddy.&quot; This was in memory of another Buddy who died long ago when she was a girl. Miss Faulk remained a child herself in many ways. The story centers around their Christmas tradition of making fruitcakes for the people that they admired and loved.This book can be read to or by all ages. The story endures because the love between the characters is so real, and the delight that they have in sharing with others is what we all want Christmas to be."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A CHRISTMAS MEMORY is Capote's autobiographical short story about an orphaned, 7-year-old boy named Buddy; his fun, elderly woman cousin; their dog Queenie; and their disapproving relatives. It's mischievous, inspirational, and somewhat sad, with a real sense of the 1930s setting and a peek into what likely stirred the writer in Capote.NOTE: I inadvertently ordered this \\"Tale Blazers\\" edition. It is intended for instructional use and includes the text of the short story plus questions and quizzes about vocabulary and reading comprehension. If you're only interested in the text, you can find the story online. But for a more pleasurable reading experience, I recommend theillustrated edition."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"I ordered this book after first reading the story in a collection of Capote stories from the library. I knew I wanted to own it and share it. I ordered one for myself and one for a friend who loves Christmas so she could enjoy it and share it with her friends and family. I haven't listened to the CD that comes with it, but that was a nice surprise. The only thing I didn't like about the book are the illustrations. After having read more about Capote and seeing photos of him and his aunt, the pictures just didn't seem to match. They seemed too charming to me, not conveying the reality. For someone without a preconcieved idea of what the characters should look like it won't matter and this book is actually geared towards children, whereas the original story was not. I enjoyed my initial reading the most being able to create the scenes in my mind with his beautiful descriptions and my own experience with elderly relatives. I plan to search for version with no illustrations."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"This is a Christmas story, but it really is a book about bonding. About how you can create a bond with a person that lasts your entire lifetime - and how it can affect you.Although it of course can be read at Christmastime, Truman Capote has written a tale that can be read anytime you want to sense just how close people can be, despite age or time."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Toward the end of his life, Capote squandered his incomparable gifts. This beautiful story was written long before those terrible days. If you love the very spirit of Christmas, you will treasure \\"A Christmas Memory.\\" I envy you being able to read this for this first time - it's that kind of discovery."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"this book is an overlooked small masterpiece. the drawings in this particular edition, softly and delicately accurate, make it a perfect book for family reading. it's a beautiful story that makes me cry reading it every time. there is also a short movie version of this story--read entirely by truman himself--that is also a joy to watch. i cant imagine ANYone not being touched by the message of love in this book."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A warm tale of bonding across a generational gap. I am confident that this is one of those stories that will stand the test of time. A delight for any reader and I suggest it as a great read aloud to be shared with pre-pubescent children. This is Capote at his writing best."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A gorgeous tale of just how meaningful childhood memories are. These memories give us a look into a relationship between a child and an adult that builds real - honest - and long-lasting memories of love! Such a beautiful tribute to the meaning of a beutiful relationship - so neccessary in childhood! A real treat for readers of all ages. Love! Lovely!"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"I thought this was a very good book. I read it in one night. It was written really well. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"It is one of my favorite books and has been since I got my first copy back in the 80's. Truman Capote is a trulygifted Southern writer who evokes the South during the 1930's with charm, wit, nostalgia and sensitivity. I cansee and smell everything he describes. I remember the relatives who populated my own Southern childhood(who are now dead many, many years)when I read A CHRISTMAS MEMORY. The story of his relationshipwith his elderly cousin trancends time and place. I consider this short, sweet book with its wonderful illustrationsa classic in the same vain as Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Reading this little book reminded me of my own childhood aunt who was just a little different from everyone else. After reading it, I purchased a copy of the 1966 TV dramatization, which I remembered having seen. I also sent copies as Christmas gifts with the hope that their reading would also bring back childhood memories."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"This was my late wife's favorite Christmas story. She would put out a copy of it every year and read it at least once during the season. I decided to use memorial funds from her funeral to fund Little Free Libraries in my community and this Christmas I bought ten copies of A Christmas Memory to place in the libraries so that others may enjoy this beautiful story. Do yourself a favor and read it sometime &#8211; and be sure to have a box of tissues handy."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"just love all of truman capote's works. He was a true story teller and knew how to keep you involved in his story"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"This exquisitely illustrated book was written as a chidren's story. Written by Truman Capote as an autobiographical account of a childhood experience, Christmas during the Great Depression era of American history is celebrated as a holiday for gifting with items hand-made expressly for their recipients. I bought this edition for its cover. This Christmas classic should be in every child's library."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Many of us recall the really nasty Truman Capote of his last years, the one appearing, for example, on late night shows drunk, the Truman Capote who went about writing truly awful things about people who were supposedly his friends. But there was that other Truman Capote, the earlier one when he wrote such amazing prose. And this story is one of his best. And, yes, I bawl every time I read it aloud. Or silently."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"This is a sensitive, touching memoir about Capote's aunt Miss Sook.

The original movie, now on dvd is hard to find and once again Amazon came through!"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"I read Capote's In Cold Blood earlier this year, my toes appropriately curled up in horror the whole way. But I've always heard the legend of Capote himself, the troubled young socialite/writer who tattled tales on all his celeb friends and fell out of favor. A personality like that intrigues me and I wanted to read more. I picked up a copy of The Thanksgiving Visitor and Christmas Memory at Landmark Booksellers over in Franklin, TN. The little book felt like a treasure in my hand, light and precious. It's a time of year when I reach for comforts--down comforters, hot cocoa (damn these 60 degree Decembers in Tennessee!). This little book was another comfort, though a disquieting one. The stories are autobiographical in nature--we know that tragedy is waiting for him as we read about his 7 year old self. But it's hard to not fall in love with his best friend, a woman in her 60's called Sook, a woman who is childish and childloving, qualities we should value more when we find them. She is able to go with the little boy into the woods, hike for seeming miles, and return with a lovely Christmas tree the two of them down themselves with a little ax and haul home in a baby carriage. They make whiskey-soaked fruit cakes from ingredients they've saved all year to buy. And then Sook gives her 7 year old cousin a little nip and they have a very festive little dance party, just the two of them. It was such an innocently horrific gesture. I love it. I know I am cheating by reading all of these little short books here at the end of the year--but sometimes a little space is all you need to say wonderful big things. When Sook dies, Capote says he already knew without being told: \\"And when that happens, I know it. A message saying so merely confirms a piece of news some secret vein had already received, severing me from an irreplaceable part of myself, letting it loose like a kite string. That is why, walking across a school campus on this particular December morning, I keep searching the sky. As if I expected to see, rather like hearts, a lost pair of kites hurrying towards heaven.\\""},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"went to Monroeville, Alabama to see the courthouse and town from \\"to kill a mockingbird\\" and saw the exhibit for Truman Capote inside the courthouse. didn't realize he grew up next door to Harper Lee. his story was fascinating and the book relates some of his early experiences with his beloved cousin. truly heart warming. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"There is often confusion about the publication history of Capote's beloved \\"A Christmas Memory.\\"It was first published in the magazine Mademoiselle in 1956. Since then it has been bundled and re-printed in several collections, including The Selected Writings of Truman Capote.The first stand-alone edition (a 1st Thus) didn't occur until Random House released it in hardback in a slipcase in 1966! (Some confused cataloguers claim that this is a 1956 1st edition; it isn't -- the 1956 copyright appears but the book was released in 1966 w/ LOC number 66-21461.The fact that the publisher published this story in a rather classy binding many years after it first was released is a testament to the growing cult status of Capote in general and the reputation of this piece of prose in particular.Probably the most satisfying aspect of the first stand-alone edition is the slipcase's inclusion of the photo of young Truman with his best friend Sook. And, just as Capote's prose recalls it, her face does have a weathered dignity reminiscent of Abraham Lincoln.Best two closing sentences ever: \\"That is why, walking across a school campus on this particular December morning, I keep searching the sky. As if I expected to see, rather like hearts, a lost pair of kites hurrying toward heaven.\\""},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"This is one of the greatest short stories ever written. If this doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you have no heart. It's a \\"have heart\\" test. Capote had a gift and it was on full display in this book. I also recommend his companion short story - \\"A Thanksgiving Visitor\\". This is great to read to the family during the holidays. You won't be sorry with these reads."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas Memory is a heart touching story that involves many emotional moments. When reading the story, I felt an urge to cry because of so many feelings that Buddy had for Sooke. I could feel the emotions race in my heart from word to word. The most heart touching moment, was when Buddy was forced to leave his best friend, Sooke. The way Sooke felt when Buddy had to leave meant everything. Sooke felt as if she could do somthing to make Jenny let him stay. Buddy may have been a young boy ,but he understood how Sooke felt. The scene when they were giving gifts from under the tree, Sooke and Buddy gave each other a kite which they flown the next day for their last time together. The moment when Jenny, Buddys aunt talked to Sooke made feel as if now she would be alone. After the talk with Jenny, Sooke thought that all she could do now was walk Buddy to the bus and say her goodbyes. A Christmas Memory will certainly make you experience strong, emotional feelings.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Truman Capote's story of himself and his country Aunt celebrating Christmas together is one that should remind all of us of the meaning of love and caring for each other this season."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"My English teacher handed this story out to us today and told us to read it.

My mother was the one who inspired us to read. But one Christmas,when someone had read it to him(probably my mother) my father read it to us. He cried, and so did we. I ache to have his intensity of spirit and I long to pass that spirit on to my children. Sharing this story with them, as I have with others, will be one way we elevate the holidays above the consumerism that replaces tradition. This story is powerful and small, and wonderful. I think if you aren't sure about Truman Capote, this book, along with &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot; will push you into fandom."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas Memory, by Truman Capote is a really great book to read. It has a lot of emotions shown that makes you react to each situation. Buddy's aunts want to send him off to Military School. They feel that he is much smarter than any ordinary young boy and he needs extra schooling. Buddy didn't want to go to Military School. He thought that he had enough education and didn't need to go to Military School, he had all he needed where he lived. Buddy should have a choice if he had to go or not. If he didn't want to go then they shouldn't make him, but if he wanted to go then they should let him. Sook and Buddy where best friends. They needed each other to live and to go on though life. They couldn't live without each other. A Christmas Memory, was a great book! It shared a lot of emotions that a young kid goes through when they are young. The book will make you laugh and cry, it has a lot of emotional parts. I would recommend anyone to read this book!"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Actually, I never realized that Truman Capote had written anything about his early life.

Truman Capote's classic A CHRISTMAS MEMORY receives Beth Peck's warm holiday drawings, a cd narrated by Celeste Holm and returns the 50th anniversary of a classic holiday story to print. A Christmas ritual of baking fruitcakes symbolizes the story of Buddy and his eccentric, elderly cousin. It first appeared in 1956 as a memoir of Capote's childhood but makes a simply love story for new generations."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Why more people don't know about this great book, I don't know. I could hardly believe it when I found the story at the end of Breakfast at Tiffany's. I was thrilled when this version came out, with great illustrations.A beautiful family story about love and friendship and fruitcake.The young boy and his distant elderly cousin, both unwanted by the rich people in the larger house, are confined to a cottage, to mostly fend for themselves. But they have a great deal of freedom and an amazing and touching bond. I hate to sound corny, but this story is so sweet and moving and as my 6 year old says, happy-sad.As Christmas approaches, they go about their annual fruitcake making activities, from gathering pecans, to counting up the pennies they saved throughout the year, to purchase fruit and even whiskey from an ominous Indian fellow in the bad part of town.Based in part on Capote's own childhood, this is a story I can whole-heartedly reccomend for all children."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Truman Capote's A Christmas Memory is sure to remind you of a time you've shared with a special friend. Buddy and his friend shared, almost, every moment together. The fact that they were so close made me feel very happy. Then the &quot;ones who know best&quot; decided that Buddy would be better off joining a military school. As a result, I felt very sad because Buddy and his friend would not get to see each other again. A Christmas Memory is truly an emotionally charged, unforgetable novel."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas Memory, by Truman Capote, is a novel sure to tug at your heart strings I felt sorry for Buddy when he had to go off to military school, thus seperating him from his friend. The others, who thought they knew what was best for him, actually caused him a lot of pain. I really don't know what I would do if I was seperated from my friends, not knowing if I would ever see them again. Don't read A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote unless you're ready to experience some really strong emotions."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote is very heart warming. The book is very touching from the part Soot and Buddy are friends to the part they are seperated. To the day Soot and Buddy were in the field flying kites. Since they were both happy you could feel the love between them as the kites were floating easily above them as if they were being held. A Christmas Memory is a novel that will make you realize what friendship is."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"The book A Christmas Memory is sure to make you show your emotions and feelings for a young boy named Buddy. Buddy was torn apart from the family that he had grown up with ever since he was young. It was sad that Buddy had to be out on his own at such an early age. I was amazed that Sook had the courage and bravery to take Buddy to the bus stop when he had to leave. Every year while Buddy was in military school Sook would send Buddy the best fruitcake of the bunch. Unless you are ready to feel some strong emotions I would advise you not to read A Christmas Memory."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote was a captivative and moving story. It shows the powerful bond of a friendship, no matter the age. Sook was like Buddy's grandmother, however, they acted the same age. It was heart warming, even though I also felt outraged at Jenny for being so heartless. A Christmas Memory is a great book to read if you like touching stories"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"This year our Winter Party for Book group chose to read this book aloud. As we sat around the table, we took turns reading the story. Truman Capote's writing is so eloquent, the changing of reader's did not influence the story. I was captivated by his experiences. I am waiting for a &quot;30 fruit cake day&quot;."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"I first heard of this story through a PBS production about eighteen years ago. My six year old son and I watched it and were both keenly aware of the special bond between this young boy and his older, somewhat excentic aunt. They were related but spoke to each other as individuals sharing a special love for each other, more as friends by choice. You become aware of the simple appreciation they have for anything that strengthens that bond. The sincerity of their caring is a wonderful model for any child or adult. They are rich for the experiences they share, not the circumstances within which they live. It is a secular holiday story that anyone should be able to find meaningful. Sometimes such stories can deepen faith! Even the way he deals with the death of their beloved dog, Queenie, eases the saddnes of her passing. I frequently purchase this as a gift for friends and they report back it has become a favorite to reread. Everytime I read it, tears well in my eyes."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"I have been reading this book to my children every Christmas season since they were old enough to sit still for a &quot;long&quot; picture book. They are now teenagers but still like to hear the story.

This simple, unforgettable story of a young boy, growing up poor, living in a family with a childlike cousin, reinforces the meaning of Christmas: making gifts from the heart and giving with love.

Not only have I read this many times, I've discovered that the story doesn't get old, it simply becomes more familiar; more distinctive in the way it seems to pull your own memories of childhood out into the room and that says something about author Capote. Boy, could he evoke a mood, mix in some heavy emotions and serve it all up just in time to lay in an ending that will leave you full and satisfied and a little uncomfortable too.This particular story is one of three short stories that are all wrapped around two central characters; a little boy of seven, Buddy, and his distant cousin, Soot, who is sixty-something. Buddy is haunted by his parents bitter divorce and equally nasty custody battle, so he ends up living in a rambling old house with a gang of unsavory older relatives who seem to have a silent power over Buddy and Soot and frequently make them cry. Yet their bond of friendship is one that will wind its way into one and all of Capote's novels because this is truly the story of Capote and it proves once again the influence our childhood memories have over the rest of our lives.\\"...Her face is remarkable--not unlike Lincoln's, craggy like that, and tinted by sun and wind; but it is delicate too, finely boned, and her eyes are sherry-colored and timid. \\"Oh my, she exclaims, her breath smoking the windowpane, \\"it's fruitcake weather!\\"Making thirty fruitcakes and then sending them off to strangers the two of them perhaps only met once, adds more charm to this timeless tale. Occasionally they receive a thank-you card and these are carefully added to an old scrap book that's more like a window to the world neither one of them ever intends to visit. With Hershey-bar tin foil (remember that?) and a pile of colored paper, they spend days together creating ornaments for their magical Christmas tree. Though they are pauper-poor, it is obvious they're rich in their love of the season and all the joy it can bring--and their time together--this is the gift they give one another.And kites.Each year they share what they would really like to give one another; Buddy would give her a pearl-handled knife, a radio, a whole pound of chocolate-covered cherries and Soot wishes with all her might that she could give her Buddy a bike. But the night before Christmas they steal away from each other's company and make what they do each and every year--a kite.Though the ending (I'm not telling) seems abrupt, it also seems true and that's what a Christmas memory should be.Wishing you a Christmas filled with magic that will give you wonderful memories too..."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","review":"Capote's \\" A Christmas Memory\\" forever captures the pain of loneliness and of being unwanted-pain made bearable by an enduring, unconditional love-heartwrenching!

My only regret was that the illustrated treatment of this book, makes it appear to be a book for a very young child.

Ron Hubbard's \\"Brass Keys to Murder\\" and \\"Cargo of Coffins\\" back to back and reveled in his mastery of pacing and characterization. Originally published in 1935 and 1937, both tales are now available as part of the Galaxy Press \\"Stories from the Golden Age\\" series. It's important to note that Hubbard was restricted by space limitations when these stories made their appearance prior to World War II. With that said, Hubbard managed to exploit the \\"short novel\\" (or novella) with his pacing.\\"Brass Keys to Murder\\" and \\"Cargo of Coffins\\" are crime novels not unlike those great Warner Brothers gangster films of the late 30s. I could easily imagine a George Raft or Humphrey Bogart roaming through a gloomy set as the action unfolds. And this is another aspect of Hubbard's writing that fascinates me, i.e., his timeliness and his apparently intuitive grasp of structure. He always seems to know precisely when a gunshot should happen or when a fistfight should break out. And his characters all embody the era when these stories were published.These are hardboiled little gems. In \\"Cargo of Coffins\\" you'll find lines like: \\"He examined his .38 and found it in good order. He slid it into his waistband and smoothed his crisp white jacket over the bulge it made.\\" Similarly, in \\"Brass Keys to Murder\\" he describes the hero, Steve Craig, in this fashion: \\"His jaw was as square as a clipper's mainsail and his eyes were the shade of an arctic sea.\\" He uses simile and sharp images to establish his characters and to set the scene. This is a talent lost to many of today's successful but less talented writers.And because these stories were intentionally short - he often published in a magazine called \\"Five Novels Monthly\\" - the pacing leaves one nearly breathless. Hubbard used his mastery of pacing to good effect throughout his career and I couldn't help but recall how superbly he demonstrated this skill in \\"Battlefield Earth\\" which clocks in at over 1,000 pages in paperback. There's not a dull page to be found in \\"Battlefield Earth.\\" But that masterpiece was still well over forty years in the future when Hubbard penned \\"Brass Keys to Murder\\" and \\"Cargo of Coffins.\\"These Galaxy Press reprints are wonderful and I hope they found the audience they deserve. Hubbard's legacy is assured. He stands beside Ray Bradbury, Lester Dent, Walter B. Gibson, H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard and Edgar Rice Burroughs as one of the American Masters from the glorious Golden Age."},{"Title":"Cargo of coffins (Classic fiction series)","review":"During the 1930s and 1940s struggling writers would make some extra cash by writing fiction for the many pulp magazines that were on the market at the time. Pulp magazines didn't have to rely on fancy glossy paper with expensive artwork or the superior production values. What they did rely on was the well plotted stories from real storytellers with crazy villains, plot twists at every corner, and adventures set in faraway lands. The authors didn't get paid much, mostly a penny per word, so many of them wrote like crazy and had their stories appearing frequently. Some of the most popular pulp writers of the time were L.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Raymond Chandler, Ray Bradbury and L. Ron Hubbard.Galaxy Press has been releasing the short stories written by L. Ron Hubbard to paperbacks and audiobooks under the Stories from the Golden Age, in which they nicely sent me a free audiobook in exchange for an honest review.Cargo of Coffins first appeared in the November 1937 issue of Argosy Weekly and is set on the high seas. The story centers on two bitter rivals Paco Corvino and Lars Marlin, and by chance, they both end up on the same luxury yacht. Paco is the smooth-talking, con man that sent Lars to a penal colony in the French Guiana. Lars escaped prison and wants revenge, but now a twist of fate has lead him to Paco.Another twist of fate leaves Lars as the Captain of the yacht where Paco is working as a steward. Paco over hears a group of passengers that want to meet someone that is royalty. Paco fakes his death and leaves a letter informing the crew that he is actually royalty, but it is just one of his cons as he eventually shows up alive. Now everyone is treating him as if he was royalty. Meanwhile, Lars cannot do anything about the situation because Paco is blackmailing him to make a stop at the penal colony island to retrieve some coffins. Paco has a devilish plan in store for the passengers and crew, but Lars has plans on stopping him once and for all.Cargo of Coffins is a fast-paced intriguing tale of revenge. It's the best plotted story from L. Ron Hubbard that I have listened to so far. The voice cast and sound effects are top notch! I actually felt like I was right there on the yacht with bullets flying at me. If you are looking for an adventure tale, I recommend Cargo of Coffins."},{"Title":"Cargo of coffins (Classic fiction series)","review":"Awesome story! Just the title alone made me read this book!

This time around I gave another Sea Adventure a listen.While Hubbard knew how to write in the twists and turns in a story to keep a reader on the edge and eager for more, the folks at Galaxy Audio know how to take these exciting stories and produce them into audio dramas that not only keep the story true to the original form but also seem to push the listener even closer to the edge. With superb voice acting, dynamic sound effects and original music, these audio books could easily be promoted as audio dramas and find a place on the radio waves. In fact with the fun character actors and excellent narration these audio books have the feel of the old radio dramas of the mid-20th century.This time around the Sea Adventure takes us across the ocean. \\"Cargo of Coffins\\" was originally published in the November, 1937 issue of \\"Argosy.\\" Lars Marlin is out to seek revenge on Paco Corvino, he vows Paco will die at his hands, but a fluke of a moment finds Lars as Captain of an ocean going yacht where Paco is working as chief steward. The wealthy family on-board all wish they could meet someone of royalty. Paco fakes an illness and eventually his death. He has expressly forbidden anyone to open certain envelopes in his cabin unless he dies. With what seems like his death the crew opens the envelopes to find Paco is actually royalty, at least that's what he wants them to believe. After a day Paco \\"comes back to life\\" and is immediately treated according to his new-found position.Lars knows this is a scam but under threat, by Paco, does not wish to expose his background, having escaped from a penal colony island. Paco orders the ship to dock at the same penal colony where he loads aboard the yacht some coffins, under the guise of returning the dead men to their home soil. It turns out Paco has alternate plans for the yacht and passengers and Lars is set to prevent that from happening before the ship can pull into Casablanca.In an exciting story that will keep the listener wanting more, Galaxy Audio will place you on an ocean going yacht with action that seems so real you will be ducking bullets and hoping not to get seasick.[...]"},{"Title":"Power Journalism: Computer-Assisted Reporting","review":"Please, never assign this book to a student again. Using sources over a decade old is frowned upon in every other discipline; surely, text about using internet as a source for journalists, is even more outmoded as technology is changing faster than research can keep up with.Pros for the book--it's well written, well constructed, and gets information across with ease even if you are not the most tech-savvy writer.Cons--Again, it is completely outdated. The concepts are fine and good, but all the examples are shown (I'm fairly sure) in DOS.Remember: College students today have never lived in a world that wasn't wired.Instead of this text I would HIGHLY recommend Journalism Next: A Practical Guide to Digital Reporting and Publishing by Mark Briggs.

Otherwise, use it as a door stop, boat anchor, or birdcage liner.Seriously, there is little of interest for the thoughtful reader, one who is reasonably well educated and knowledgeable about history, politics, and human nature. A major flaw of this book is that there is little actual diversity of thought and opinion, most of the essays could have been written by the same person and we never would have known the difference, so similar are the authors' world views. Why weren't other voices added, such as Colin Powell on foreign affairs or Alan Greenspan on economic matters? Instead we get this syrupy goo, the literary equivalent of &quot;can't we all just have a group hug and sing 'Kumbaya' together?&quot;. Sorry, but the world, and our role in it, demands a more serious, realistic, and sober minded approach. The problems we face heading into this new century, issues like racial tensions, terrorism, and the struggle of societies trying to preserve their cultures and values against the relentless march of the high speed cyber-economy cannot be resolved with airy platitudes and Utopian dreams. After all, I too can imagine what the world will look like in 50 years, and while there will undoubtedly be improvements, especially in technology, the basics of human nature will change not one bit. We will still have to deal with tyrants, political and religious fanatics, criminals, drug and alcohol abuse, corruption, ethnic strife, and a host of other problems, none of which can be solved with a pie in the sky &quot;Can't we all just get along&quot; approach."},{"Title":"Imagine: What America Could Be in the 21st Century","review":"We can all agree that the world would be a nicer place with more personal connection, a real sense of community, freedom to pursue dreams, security to safeguard those dreams, pluralistic tolerance, etc, etc. I do. But in a haphazard series of essys, beyond platitudes and some bad science fiction, I see little in the way of real thinking about the problems that confront the world, or well-reasoned, rigorously analytical responses to those problems. Instead, they range from the laughable to the dangerous--see one author proposing a monolithic Department of Peace with millions of officers devoted to everything from crime to regulation of interpersonal communication to domestic life to workplace interactions. How can somebody who claims allegience to personal freedom cry out for something so Orwellian? These liberal-minded egalitarian essayists would invest more unilateral power in government than John Ashcroft ever had wet dreams about.The prose, often stilted, blowsy, pretentious or oblivious to its own ridiculousness, is workmanlike. To those that seek out the book, the pronouncements will be comforting. The implementation of its ideas--imagine!--will not be."},{"Title":"Imagine: What America Could Be in the 21st Century","review":"I almost did not buy this book, and I say that because an awful lot of really smart folks might be inclined to turn away on the basis of the title and the possibility that this is a fairy tale wishful-thinking la la land kind of book. It is not. It is practical (and political), it is enriching, and it is over-all a very high quality endeavor that has been well executed.Four &quot;great truths&quot; are articulated many times over across the various readings, and they merit listing here:1) Campaign finance reform is the absolute non-negotiable first step that must precede every other reform. Until the people can reassert their great common sense for the common good, and restore the true democratic tradition, nothing else will happen.2) Neighborhoods are the bedrock of both democracy and sustainable development, and we have spent fifty years building in the wrong direction. New legal and economic incentives must be found to redirect both urban and suburban real estate management back in the direction of self-contained neighborhoods.3) Local production of everything, from electricity to food to major goods like automobiles) appears to be a pre-requisite for deconflicting high quality of life needs from limited resource availability. The book includes several very intelligent discussions of how this might come about.4) Networking makes everything else possible, and by this the book means electronic networking. I was especially fascinated by some of the examples of near-real-time sharing that electronic networking makes possible--everything from a neighborhood car to scheduled hand-me-downs of winter coats from one family to another. We have not progressed one mile down the road of what the Internet makes possible at a personal and neighborhood level, and I would recommend this book for that perspective alone.The creative editorial role must be applauded. From the identification and recruitment of the contributors, to the selection of the photographs that each tell their own story, to the quality of the paper used to create the book, all testify to the competence and knowledge of the editor.Lastly, it merits comment that the book serves as a very fine calling card from something called The Global Renaissance Alliance, a spiritually-oriented group that nurtures Citizens Circles and uses a web site to provide pointers to resources and other like-minded folk."},{"Title":"Imagine: What America Could Be in the 21st Century","review":"For anyone who, like me, has gobbled up the works of writers like Deepak Chopra, Neale Donald Walsch, Thomas Moore, Caroline Myss, James Redfield and Barbara Marx Hubbard, this book is a must read. It includes essays by each of these authors and many more of equal stature. In the essays, the writers take the ideas and principles they have developed over the years and apply them in answering the question: &quot;In the realm of highest possibilities, what could America look like in 50 years?&quot; The result is a comprehensive, readable, light-filled blueprint for America's future. Some of the essays are poetic, lyrical. Others are grounded in hard hitting facts and statistics that will blow your mind. (See Paul Hawken's essay) Make no mistake. These are not airy-fairy essays recycling the previous works of these writers. They are clear, disciplined, thoughtful responses to the question posed. In fact, I believe the essays in &quot;Imagine&quot; may very well be the best work of many of these writers. I was blown away by what they delivered in this volume. Hats off to the editor, Marianne Williamson for assembling this phenomenal group of writers and for her skill in weaving these beautiful essays together."},{"Title":"Imagine: What America Could Be in the 21st Century","review":"Developing scenarios for how worthy goals might be accomplished is one of the best ways that people make progress. The circumstances never end up being like that, but the insights prove to be worthwhile nevertheless. This thought-provoking book of essays uses that method to come up with many worthwhile observations and useful ideas. If you know the particular essayist's work, in most cases you won't find much new. Some, however, have created new materials that are extremely insightful.The volume's main weaknesses are two: the viewpoints of the essays' authors aren't varied enough, and the &quot;desirable&quot; outcomes are too easily assumed in many cases. I graded this brilliant book concept down two stars for these weaknesses in execution.Almost anyone would find benefits from reading this book. Even if you disagree with its premises, you will end up learning about the thinking of a lot of America's top authors.I was honored to receive this book as a gift from one of my sons, reflecting his knowledge of my desire for assisting social progress through personal effort.The book contains almost 40 essays, grouped into the following sections:The Soul of a Nation (What it means to be an American)Pillars (The basics that we need to flourish from health to meaningful work)The Rewoven Fabric (Community and identity)To Whom We Belong (Our relationships and ways of relating from family to divorce to aging)In God We Trust (Spirituality)The New Civitas (The new American governmental system)Each author was asked to think about America 50 years from now in creating a more positive environment. Two essays in the group stood out to me in capturing the essence of the issues throughout the book. The first was by Peter Senge (of Fifth Discipline fame). He points out that there are three ways to think about the future. First, extrapolate current trends. That doesn't work, because &quot;aspects of our present ways of living . . . are not sustainable.&quot; Second, we can create a vision of the opposite of something we don't like now. He calls this &quot;reactive imagination.&quot; This is &quot;only a disguised version of the present.&quot; He correctly points out that many of the essays are of this nature. Third, we can &quot;become agents of creating a future that is seeking to emerge, by becoming more aware of the present.&quot; &quot;How did we get where we are?&quot; is a question that begins this investigation. From those roots, we can help establish the foundation for moving into a better direction.If you read this book, start with Senge's essay. The book will make a lot more sense if you do. It will give you a star to guide by. This essay inexplicably begins on page 167, rather than at the beginning.The second key essay is at the end by Margaret J. Wheatley (starting on page 401). She did a little experiment. She recruited a group of teenagers to think through these questions about what they want for 50 years from now. Basically, they want a fairer, more cooperative, and more sustaining world. They see a &quot;networked, boundaryless world&quot; unconstrained by the geographical and psychological limits of America. Read this essay second. It gets past a lot of the personal agendas in most of the essays into touching closer to what is universal in our visions. Young people always seem to get these points best.Few of the essays made it into Senge's third category. As I read the better ones (such as those by Dean Ornish, Lance Secretan, and Peter Gabel), I came away with a vision of our suffering from poor decisions because people are not yet good at thinking through the consequences of their daily decisions. We optimize what is visible and closest to us, even when the distance effects (in time and space) are vastly counterproductive to the modest benefits we receive from what we choose to do today. (An example is eating poor quality food to save money individually, and having society incur hundreds of thousands of dollars in health care costs to &quot;repair&quot; us from our own misguided &quot;money-saving&quot; efforts.)In a sense, I came away with the notion that if we all learned from Senge and Wheatley, it wouldn't take long to arrive at a better society for all. After you master those lessons, be sure to read Sam Daley-Harris's fine essay on &quot;Activism.&quot;Make the future into what it can best be, consistent with the visions of both those who agree with you . . . and those who do not! Read Thomas Moore's views on &quot;Religion&quot; for useful thoughts about this perspective.Imagine a better world in Peter Senge's third way!"},{"Title":"Imagine: What America Could Be in the 21st Century","review":"This is a truly amazing book.

And these thinkers come from all sectors of society: from John Robbins, a whistle-blower of the food industry, to the actor Peter Coyote; from Eric Utne, founder of the Utne Reader, to educator Dee Dickenson. What Marianne Williamson has assembled is a collection of ideas covering all sectors of society representing the viewpoints of very unique individuals each with differing backgrounds. And the beauty of this diversity is that all the contributors are unified in fundamental ways, all visualizing a more accepting, more loving, more grounded future that can truly celebrate the individual. It is a vision of what can WORK given our true natures, and given the tuggings of our soul for a more love-based world. Everyone in the world ought to read this book! If you're skeptical, go ahead and buy it and try it out. You'll be glad you did, even if it provides fodder for a time for all the reasons you dislike new-agey spiritual types.

I finally found a classic crime noir novel that I really liked...This is book #2 in the Phillip Marlowe series. Marlowe bumps into a huge man named Moose and unwillingly sees him murder a man while trying to find his lost love. That is the beginning of a fairly complex, well plotted story.Book #1, The Big Sleep was also well done, but what was missing for me was a glimpse of the human, softer side of Marlowe. This book filled in the missing pieces with the aid of a genuinely good woman. Marlowe's ability to see her good qualities rounded out the tale for me - I got a little of everything I needed to enjoy it.I have to say, there's a lot of prejudice in these books. I suppose it was more common for the time period, but I'm hoping I never get used to it. And there's slang that I don't understand, but I'm catching on slowly. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Dodgy dames, crooked cops, one charlatan, one Moose and plenty of booze.Philip Marlowe is a pretty bright tough guy private eye in Los Angeles, when he is hired to be a bodyguard on a very strange assignment involving supposedly a jewellery ransom buyback.He is soon crossing paths with various police departments, the rich and powerful, and crimelords, not to mention saps and drugs, as this book improves throughout with some entertaining phraseology."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Chandler is great fun to read. He structures his sentences and paragraphs with such metaphoric precision that he turns the mundane crime noir into literature. His hero is none other than perhaps an alter ego of Chandler himself Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is the straight talking, honest PI that will not accept any money until he is on the case and everything is legit. I wondered as I read this if Chandler didn't wished he could live his life in the honest and opened fashion of his hero. In \`Farewell, My Lovely\\" Marlowe searches for Velma a nightclub singer and love of ex-con Moose Malloy. Murder, dope dealers, gambling ships, femme fatales and the always questionable police keep Marlowe on and off his toes.This is another of Chandler's canon that is worth adding to the reading list."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Phillip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's classic noir hard-boiled private detective forever literarily associated with Los Angeles and its means streets is right at home here in his search for the inevitable \`missing woman' (\`dame' for the non-politically correct types) of an ex-convict who will not take no for an answer. And a \`missing woman\\" who wants to stay missing and will not take no for an answer. There is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the identity of the above-mentioned \`dame' that caught me off guard. Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day. As always with Chandler you get high literature in a plebian package. Read on."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Farewell, My Lovely was my first Raymond Chandler experience, a novel I first read back in junior year of high school, and one that will forever be known to me as the novel that defines noir, hardboiled detectives and gumshoe novels.In this classic, detective Philip Marlowe gets hired to recover stolen jewels, which in turn has him running into the rogue gallery of gamblers, con men, crooked cops, and (of course) femme fatales. With this said, the story is completely character-driven, making it full of action and narrative. Just flip the book open to any page, and you'll clearly read slick, muscular dialogue and snappy comebacks. Chandler is a benchmark author for stories stripped of any literary fat.Besides Dashiel Hammett, Chandler is the perennial writer of gumshoe detectives. And Farewell, My Lovely is the perennial gumshoe novel."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Marlowe is in a tough spot.

Fatal debs seem to assault him from every angle, and Marlowe is beaten, drugged and abused mercilessly, but somehow he never gives up and keeps doggedly pursuing the truth about corruption and death in Los Angeles.Chandler's use of language is brilliant as always, and the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, but really, with Chander at work, who needs plot? The book is beautiful and the prose is blossoming with unusual and evocative images. Chander ranks as one of the great American masters of prose.Read this and weep..."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"This novel is simply the best detective novel by the best writer of American detective fiction.

The rich descriptions of the seedy side of pre-WWII LA is enough to make this book a winner. Our hero (Marlowe of course) gets drug into a bar and almost witnesses a murder, then gets hired by a rich playboy who drags him to another murder scene. He meets a spunky young lady, gets hired by a rich dame (to use the language of the genre), and runs into a pyschic and other strange characters. How does it all tie together? Does it even matter? Just enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Private Eye Philip Marlowe's curiosity for affairs that are none of his business sets him on a trail of murder, blackmail, jewels, women and a man who would always need a shave.Subsequent to Raymond Chandler's first novel, The Big Sleep, this second installment from Chandler oozes class and atmosphere that is absolutely unparralelled.Farewell, My Lovelly is a book that grips the reader from the first paragraph and where The Big Sleep slacks and breaks apart in the middle, the book picks up the pace with astonishing prose, particularly the way in which Chandler starts and finishes a chapter makes it hard to set the book down.Marlowe gets involved in a case of murder involving a man named Moose Malloy who is searching for his old girfriend. The poilce take over the murder case and Marlowe is hired by a mysterious client for an evenings bodyguard work which ends in a nasty way.By the time Chandler had set to work on his second novel it is clear that his skills as a writer of detective fiction had improved and he was virtualy unparallelled and unstoppable.Chandler's character creations not only remain fresh and quirky, he has set the standard fom many more titles in the genre; The hard boiled P.I, the cop who is too dumb to fuguire anything out and of course the femme fatal. The key character Marlowe is a slueth on a trail he did not expect, Chandler writes with tremendous naturalism and his genius creation of Marlowe comes forth through the dialogue and attitude fully conveying his hard boiled persona.The prose and description furnish this book with undertones of classc dusty Noir which have become the benchmark for generations of writers and while the movie may have been a hit, it hardly compares to the book.I was lucky enough to stumble upon Farewell, My Lovelly through a reading list from my university and I was not dissapointed, the tension and themes along with the twists and turns leave the reader gripping their lip with thier teeth. The Big Sleep may have been the novel where Chandler broke out into the literary world but this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"This is my favorite Raymond Chandler book and that's saying quite a lot. It has a sense of mystery to it that transcends the mystery genre."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"This review is for the CD version of Eliot Gould's reading.I love Chandler's writing and have read &quot;Farewell&quot; at least four times. Gould does a good job of reading it, too.What's frustrating about the CD version is that the disks are not indexed. There was no effort to make a disk begin at the beginning of a chapter, for instance. Also, each disk holds one track only. That means if you want to pause for the night at the end of chapter 5, good luck finding your place when you return to listening in a few days.Breaking the audio into tracks is a very easy thing to do, so primitive a technology that it makes it seem that this CD box set was mastered in the 1980s.There is no competing product as of June 2003, however. Devotees may want to make their own MP3 files and then donate the CDs to a library."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Farewell, My Lovely is one of several Philip Marlowe detective stories from Raymond Chandler known for their smokey, 1940s L.A. feel. Philip Marlowe is the private eye whom ladies love, but he seems to be more interested in solving extremely bizarre crimes (and not getting paid for his time) than in romance. Sometimes Raymond Chandler does a brilliant job in building a story around the Marlowe character, as he did with The Lady In The Lake. However he misses the mark with Farewell, My Lovely.Why? Hmmm, let's see. Well certainly the story scores well on the bizarre-ness scale. Marlowe finds himself in a pickle complete with killers, boozers, psychopathes ... the usual lot. But Raymond Chandler does a poor job with building on these characters; there are simply too many of them with only cameo appearances. The author fails to give his Marlowe character much to do other than waltz into one improbable scenario to another. Naturally in the end the story comes together, sort of. But Farewell, My Lovely sadly falls into the &quot;curious but forgettable&quot; category of mystery novels.Bottom line: Raymond Chandler on a bad day. Passable entertainment."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"In Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler, an everyday detective, Marlowe, gets wrapped up in a hermeneutic search that could eventually cost him his life. Everything he does affects what will be and, in turn, he winds up changing the course of his search as he becomes caught in its very tentacles. Leading from one murder and scandal to another, this mystery novel addresses corruption and deceit in all of its forms. While it is occasionally difficult to understand because of Chandler's creative habit of inventing new detection slang, it yet creates for an engaging read as it keeps readers in suspense and \\"in the dark\\" until the climax of the book, during which time everything is revealed. More than many other detection novels, this one follows a more Sherlock Holmesesque method of detection by revealing and explaining all in a very short, descriptive, \\"aha!\\" type of moment, which is exciting to the reader who has been trying to solve the mystery all along.However, while the eventual mastermind turns out to be a cunning, selfish woman, the overall portrayal of women in this 1940's novel is daunting. Although often depicted as intelligent, they are also often depicted as needing and revering men. Furthermore, Marlowe's sarcastic confidence and desire to rescue women just gives an overall bad taste to the novel as he looks at women as burdens, sex objects, and inferior beings. In fact, he doesn't very highly esteem African Americans, either. In conclusion, while this book is an interesting read, it is too great a reminder of gender and racial inequalities to be enjoyable."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"The vague product description on Amazon may lead you to think this product is an audiobook of Raymond Chandler's classic novel, _Farewell, My Lovely_, but it is not. It more closely resembles that of the radio programs of the 1940's-1950's, an art mastered by Orson Welles.The dialogue on this CD shows good character, though often a bit exaggerated; this is common in radio performances as you have no other means of conveying emotion but inflection of voice. The plot of the CD mostly follows the book, but much has been omitted. The background soundtrack contains sound effects and music, though the level is well-balanced in effort to reduce the amount of distraction from the dialogue.It is not substitute for the novel.Raymond Chandler's novel, _Farewell, My Lovely_, may be one of his most stylistically clever works. Brimming with sarcasm, repressed anger and sexuality, and criticism of both upper and lower classes, Chandler's prose makes any audio adaptation challenging. For those who love old radio programs, this will do for a few hours enjoyment."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"This is the best book I have read in ages. I don't read everything start to finish. I like to be taken in, and to finish a book, I usually feel compelled to do so. This book had me eagerly flipping page after page. I couldn't wait to find out what would unfold next. It was the highlight of most of my recent days. Chandler's failed career as a romantic poet shows admirably in this prose. It's really beautiful, to the point, and not pretentious at all. It was fun. The pace was quick, and you are trying to put the pieces together with Marlowe as he brings you along. I don't usually read mysteries. With Chandler, I at least plan to read all of his. This is better than the best noir films. If you dig noir films and literature, read this book. (It's also clear why so many people idolize Marlowe from this one, a man's man if there ever was one..."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"I read mostly at night in bed and I'm tired because I could not put this book down. I kept looking ahead for convenient places to stop, but blew right by them instead. The combination of Chandler's pace and piquancy is simply irresistible.Farewell, My Lovely isn't the most believable of books, but just like The Big Sleep, it doesn't matter. Indeed, there's a tongue-in-cheek charm that peeks out quite often from behind the hardened facade. Chandler excelled at caricature. He danced on the edge of parody. But, he did it so exquisitely well that he detracted not a whit from the earnestness of the story.A paroled con comes back to LA in search of the woman he loves. Philip Marlowe, our protagonist, stumbles into the plot thus derived. Conspiracy and murder follow among the landmarks of the Los Angeles area. There's a magnetic pull to 40's-era LA and Chandler takes full advantage of it. Farewell, My Lovely is quintessential, it is provocative, and, in places, shamefully vulgar. And, still, I recommend it highly, because it is worth every bit of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"According to Wikipedia, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY (1940) was Raymond Chandler's second novel and created from three short stories--\\"The Man Who Liked Dogs\\" (1936), \\"Try the Girl\\" (1937), and \\"Mandarin's Jade\\" (1937). This makes a lot of sense to me, since Chandler's great creation, Philip Marlowe, seems more like a character from a short story than the deep and complex creation that a great novelist can achieve.Yes, Marlowe is certainly a well-defined in FML. He's a guy with high integrity, down-beat and droll, lyrical in his descriptions, relentless and lonely, and he drinks too much. But why is he this way? And what greater issues do his struggles touch upon? Here, Chandler offers next to nothing, unless you have a film-Noir vision of life and view all winners as corrupt and brutal. Instead, he stays small with Marlowe, a highly focused creation developed in short stories, who offers a perfect streamlined literary voice to tell a novel-length story of crime.This is not to say that Philip Marlowe is ever an uninteresting character in FML. But does he really have a very interesting mind? Take away his lyricism and the grouchy humor of his metaphors and his limits show--he's everybody's sour uncle, boyishly uncompromising, for whom things didn't work out.Of course, you can't really separate character and voice in fiction. And, Marlowe's voice, its absolutely uncanny metaphors and amazing lyricism, explains why Raymond Chandler, among hundreds of crime-fiction writers, is the guy I choose to read. (I'm usually bored by mysteries and crime fiction.) Here are just two examples from FML.\\"He wore a brown suit of which the coat was too small for his shoulders and his trousers were probably a little tight at the waist. His hat was at least two sizes too small and had been perspired in freely by somebody it fitted better than it fitted him. He wore it about where a house wears a weather vane...A tie dangled outside his buttoned jacket, a black tie which had been tied with a pair of pliers in a knot the size of a pea. ...He had a big flat face and a highbridged fleshy nose that looked as hard as the prow of a cruiser.\\"\\"Then there were no more houses, just the still dark foothills with an early star or two above them, and the concrete ribbon of road and a sheer drop on one side into a tangle of scrub oak and Manzanita where sometimes you can hear the call of the quails if you stop and keep still and wait. On the other side of the road was a raw clay bank at the edge of which a few unbeatable wild flowers hung on like naughty children that won't go to bed.\\"In FML, I also enjoyed the brief Hemingway parody and was surprised to encounter--SPOILER COMING--a multi-bullet suicide. This was something Martin Amis used to make a point about crime fiction inNight Trainwhere the narrator is, like Philip Marlowe, burned out but amazingly lyrical."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's second novel, Philip Marlowe gets embroiled in a complex plot involving murder and lost love.Marlowe's on the wrong side of town when he gets drawn into watching a murder in a bar that blacks frequent. As usual for this day and age - this is decades before civil rights, remember - the white cops brush it off as meaningless. Only Marlowe shows some interest in what is going on, and the lug of a man that desperately misses his lost love.Marlowe, pretty down on his luck and drinking hard, pries into the situation as much out of intellectual boredom as anything else. He's not after money, and indeed half the time he's not getting any. He's after making some difference in the world, no matter how small. He's after doing his part to help out those in need. These qualities of honor are taken up by many detectives who came after Marlowe, and are admired by millions of movie viewers who saw the movie version of this book.The gritty world that Marlowe lives in, the desperate state that many of the characters are in, the racism and disregard for the poor and drug use were all harsh realities of Los Angeles in the 1940s. In that swamp of despair roamed Marlowe, barely keeping his own head above water, but determined to do the right thing. It's his doggedness and his adherence to his own rules that make him a man to be admired throughout the ages ... and it's Chandler's brilliant writing style that brings this world to life.Those reviewers who cringe at the drinking, the despair and the racism should thank Chandler for bringing these realities into such clear view, instead of blaming Chandler for showing them a glimpse of a life beyond their air conditioned living rooms."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"After reading The Big Sleep, I was weary about picking up another Chandler book. I was told that his writing style matures and is easier to follow and grasp in later books. And yes, that is true in his second book.Farewell My Lovely is a novel about a hard nosed L.A. detective name Phillip Marlowe. Marlowe is the master and snappy one liners and sarcasm. Chandler brings Marlowe to the L.A. area and delves him into the world of 1940s noir crime, with excellent description and tons of ambiance befitting the genre.At first, Marlowe encounters a murder by near accident, and without giving away the plot, he is entwined in a much deeper scandal with many different type of characters throughout the area, from a curious woman, to psychics, corrupt cops, organized crime leaders, and crooked sanitariums.Near the end, the book become a little harder to follow, and the plot turns and twists become a little too much, but all in all, it's a great detective novel."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"I'm not much of a fiction reader, but I have just about everything Chandler ever wrote, including a copy of his screenplay for &quot;Double Indemnity.&quot; Every couple of years I go back and read everything all over again. How many mysteries can you do that with?The thing is, of course, that you don't read Chandler for the mystery, which is just as well, because it's hard to figure out the story line in his books sometimes. You read, and re-read, Chandler because he created a whole universe in his novels - an image of a Los Angeles with a seedy underside, which suited perfectly the milieu that was associated with the town in the 1940's - the movie people and the parasites that lived off of them, the internal immigrants that flooded California from the Midwest during the Depression, the alienation under a bright sun. A lot of people got their image of California from Chandler.You also read him for the irresistable charm of his protagonist, Marlowe, the shopworn Galahad with the relentlessly absorbing internal monologue that has been imitated by everybody from Jean Claude Belmondo to Garrison Keillor. For a while, Hollywood couldn't get enough of Marlowe, and well into the 70's movies were being made of his books - several of them have been made into movies twice, including this one. I sometimes think that the Marlowe character appeals very strongly to men, or at least a certain type of men, and that's why so many actors - Bogart, Robert Montgomery, Robert Mitchum, and especially Dick Powell - really wanted to play him on the screen.The story starts out with Marlowe just walking down the street and not minding his own business, as usual, and ends up with multiple murders (some of them totally senseless), unspoken mistakes in judgement ( a favorite device of Chandler's) and a lot of unanswered questions. You always find yourself with a sense of brooding emptiness at the end of a Chandler book, a feeling that you've been through an incredible struggle to no purpose at all, and yet you're always glad you were along for the ride all the same.This may very well be the best of the Marlowe novels; it's in my top two for technical perfection along with &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, although I have a personal emotional attachment to &quot;The Long Goodbye.&quot; My advice: try them all."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"This book is a good rather than a great read. The story got a little over complicated as Chandler tries to tie in and link too many threads - all connected to the gigantic villain Moose Malloy. There were times when I scratched my head a little despairingly as I tried to work out what these connections were. There were also times when sentences and paragraphs made no logical sense to me at all. I put this down to the language of the time but it did leave a feeling of bewilderment.However, I did enjoy this book and the character of Marlow is strong and amusing. His one liners did on occassions grate a little but nevertheless his overwhelming sense of optimism rang through and made me laugh.Although written many years ago - it still had quite a modern feel to it."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"While working a job that never pans out, PI Philip Marlowe is drawn against his will into a bar called Florian's by a very huge man. Moose Malloy has just spent eight years doing time, and he's looking for his girl Velma. Well, it has been eight years, and the bar's changed hands since then. The new owners and employees know nothing of any Velma, but Moose gets mad and someone gets dead, and Marlowe finds himself in the middle of something he never bargained for.Being a good PI, Marlowe calls the police, and the case goes to a fellow named Nulty, who tries to inveigle Marlowe into helping him solve it. Marlowe says he'll let him know if he thinks of anything, then decides to follow up on the Velma angle. He goes into a hotel near the bar, asking about the previous owner, and learns where the man's widow still resides. So Marlowe decides to pay her a visit.Mrs. Florian is a house-bound soul with a fondness for alcohol. It isn't hard to pry information out of her, armed with a bottle and a willingness to suffer being her drinking companion in order to get her to talk. The widow plays coy, but when she learns Moose is on the loose, she grows pale. Velma is dead, she says, so no use looking for her. Marlowe informs Nulty and goes back to his office.There he receives a phone call about a job, although the caller is being very vague and mysterious about what he's to be doing for his money. Money is money, so Marlowe gets the address and agrees to meet the client that night. His name is Lindsay Marriott and he lives in the better part of time. He wants Marlowe to go with him while he does something, but he isn't to be seen or do anything. Marlowe doesn't like that and makes no bones about it, and then he lays down his rules. It seems that Marriott is paying to retrieve some stolen jewelry--very valuable jade, to be exact. It was taken from a lady, and the thieves are holding it for ransom.Marlowe agrees to the job, for a hundred dollars, and instructions are received, along with directions. However, nothing is simple, and Marlowe gets sapped. By the time he wakes up, there's a strange girl there by the name of Anne Riordan, and Lindsay Marriott is deceased. Marlowe checks the man's pockets and finds something interesting--marihuana cigarettes in a cheap case. However, by the time the police arrive, those are no longer there.Turns out Anne's father was once police chief of Bay City, so she can't help but be nosy about what she's stumbled across. Marlowe finds her attractive in a more than pretty face kind of way. She returns the cigarettes she stole to him, and he makes an interesting discovery--hidden inside are the business cards of a local psychic, Jules Amthor. So Marlowe sets off to investigate.A dead man, an escaped convict, a missing girl, graft in high polices, a crooked doctor, gambling--all these things and more lie in wait for Philip Marlowe. The question is, has he bitten off more than he can chew, and are there people who are determined that he not find out the truth, no matter how they have to silence him?Farewell, My Lovely is the sequel to The Big Sleep. It's another great read from Raymond Chandler. I'm really enjoying Marlowe's adventures. He's not a super hero, he's just an ordinary guy, doing his job, and as such he's not beyond getting hurt--and he does, because he keeps sticking his nose where it isn't wanted.One thing to keep in mind when you read this is that it's a product of its times, much as Huckleberry Finn. Some of the terms used would be considered racist now, but they weren't then, so you have to realize that and either not be offended, or not read the book. Those don't detract from the enjoyment of the story.Chandler has a definite way with words that I enjoy. For example, in talking about Marlowe's first sight of Moose Malloy: \\"He was looking up at the dusty windows with a sort of ecstatic fixity of expression, like a hunky immigrant catching his first sight of the Statue of Liberty.\\" His description of scenery is also unique, pure Marlowe: \\"I got down to Montemar Vista as the light began to fade, but there was still a fine sparkle on the water and the surf was breaking far out in long smooth curves.\\"This story has a lot of twists and turns, and I didn't see the ending coming until it was on top of me. Raymond Chandler set the bar for detective stories, and he set it pretty damn high. I recommend this to anyone who loves mysteries and detectives, and to those who haven't put your toe in the water, try it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"I don't read a lot of thrillers and this is the first Chandler I've read. As many have said before, this is a step and a half above your average good thriller, the reason being the wit and intelligence of the prose, the elegance of the descriptions and the understanding of character which is compassionate, passionate and cynical all at the same time.His flip one-liners aren't just clever, but oil the wheels of the plot. Some of the references I couldn't understand, they belong to the period or the locality, but the plot moves along because the characters find common ground by means of their expressions in the shifting sands of what is acceptable and what is not in the way of behaviour.Another thing is that reading this is a bit like watching a film, Los Angeles comes to life before your eyes.On the downside there's a slight sense of not looking very far beneath the surface, it would slow the book down."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"If you like incomprehensible story lines, improbable plots and connections and an overtone of misogyny then this is your book.If not this is book best left unread."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Oh how I wanted to hate this. It's racist, sexist, rude and absurd. But man oh man could Chandler write. He dragged me down into the seedier side of 1940 Los Angeles, and I couldn't get out until he let me go at the end of the book. The plot? Not so much to it in the end, really. Just a basic hunt for a killer who hunted for the girl he once loved. The twists and turns along the way just provided excuses for more wallowing in the seamy side of life--decadent rich, smelly poor, liars, cheats, and killers. If you asked me, I'd say it wasn't my cup of tea. But the man could describe everything from people to houses to a crawling pink bug in a way that kept me mesmerized. Read this if you want to know what hard-boiled is supposed to sound like."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"A hard-boiled detective novel featuring Philip Marlowe. A great read with a surprise ending. I really enjoyed Chandler's description of people and situations -- very colorful, like \\"he stood out like a pair of spats at an Iowa picnic.\\" At one point in the book the author has another character speak like Marlowe, whereupon he says, \\"that sounds like something I should have said.\\" not surprising how popular these became, along with the whole film noir genre. I can almost hear Humphrey Bogart speaking the lines!"},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Essentially, in this book, Marlowe just keeps getting his a$s handed to him in every way imaginable and you have to wonder what Chandler was thinking when our hero gets beaten down over the skull for the sixth, seventh and eighth time. I kept thinking he was going to die from internal bleeding or a serious head wound but instead he just pines for another long shot of whiskey.The story is actually a bit thin but still interesting. Historically, some have complained that this book bleeds into areas that have racist overtones and ideas, but it's a time-capsule look back into the past more than it ever will be a damning piece of evidence against Chandler. I' sure some literature of this day and age will be thought of as racist or troubled when read fifty or sixty years on.A long and tangled story, but a beautiful read full of some of the best dialogue between characters ever. It's no wonder everyone aped him in every other genre ever after. Chandler was as bold as he was blunt and could could write literature disguised as Noir Detective fiction better than anyone or since."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"It's nice to read a mystery novel without all the blood and violence that are part of today's fiction. The writer's ability to create the suspense and keep the reader interested is what makes good novels. This is GOOD!"},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"In case you were wondering that Raymond Chandler's \`The Big Sleep' was a fluke, wonder no more, go and read his follow up \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\". It is hard to choose which one is the best, because they are both so good. In this new adventure of his best character Philip Marlowe there are many more adventures, thrills and mysteries than in the first novel.In this second step of the noir literature, Chandler has built up and developed his style and characters, so he spends no time with that. The novel begins with plain action, and it takes only a few pages for the writer to set the main mystery of this narrative. Once it is done, he has all time in the world to make the weirdest people cross Marlow's path.Like in the previous book, the prose is dry, there aren't many descriptions --only of some characters, but nothing that evocative-- and it is not a bad thing. by using such a device Chandler is able to write non-stop action making the main plot more and more intrincated, until its solution. A great book, highly recommended to readers who like mistery novels of high quality and beautiful prose."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Can YOU feel the pain from a right hook thrown in a darkened alleyway at 2:00 a.m. on a cold April Thursday, or the well-worn warmth of a ragged wool carpet runner tacked to the seventh floor of a well past acceptable rent-up in pre-war Los Angeles against the leather shoe sole, or perhaps your face? Read Chandler and you very well might be able to."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Phillip Marlowe is over on Central Avenue, searching for a barber who left his wife. He notices a big man walk into double swinging doors, almost immediately a youth is thrown through the air into the gutter. Marlowe looks in, and is taken upstairs by Moose Malloy. More violence breaks out while Malloy searches for Velma. Marlowe calls the police to report the problem. The police lieutenant strongly suggests that Marlowe should look for Velma. Marlowe gathers information, and looks up Mrs. Florian, wife of the now dead owner of this bar. Mrs. Florian says that Velma is dead, and gives Marlowe a picture of Velma. Marlowe gives her his card, and reports back to Detective Lieutenant Nulty.When Marlowe returns to his office, he gets a phone call hiring him by a stranger to act as his bodyguard. Marlowe accompanies Marriott to a deserted country spot to pay off a jewel thief. Marlowe leaves the car to make the payoff, but nobody is around. When he returns to the car he finds Marriott dead. A young woman shows up and gives Marlowe a ride to his car. Marlowe returns to the West Los Angeles police station to report another murder.Marlowe continues to gather more facts. Marlowe has meetings and adventures in pursuit of the truth. The story effectively exposes the crookedness of Bay City politics, and the corruption of the rich and powerful. The ending seems tacked-on to meet the moral conventions of the time: nobody gets away with murder, not in fiction. The author sort of admits this in the last chapter: \\"we'd never have convicted her\\". If the trial and scandal hurt her older husband, she'd be a rich widow. If not, they could move away from this scandal and notoriety."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"After reading &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; I knew that I was going to read more of Raymond Chandler. After reading this book I know that I will continue to read even more.A very interesting and entertaining crime yarn. I will give it the 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's crime world, everyone's got a gat (a gun) - even sickly old women (&quot;I feel like Death Valley&quot;) and nice daughters of former coppers. People are led to locations where their screams will not be heard. Drinking establishments are respectable if there hasn't been a knife fight in the past month.****Chandler's detective, Philip Marlowe, is looking for a case that pays. But the action starts when he's not on assignment. He follows a stranger into a &quot;Negro dinge joint&quot; for no other compelling reason except that it wasn't any of his business. The dinge joint turns out to be a homicide scene, and Marlowe continues to follow the case without a real client in sight. Even the police aren't overly-interested in his participation.****He's a smart-mouth. An almost-heel. He frequently talks to himself out loud. Sometimes he hears a voice replying and realizes it's his own. This guy's a freak.****It's not hard to imagine how a recent writer like Jonathan Lethem could create a detective who has Tourette's Syndrome in &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; (Vintage Books, 1999). A detective is really just a man with serious quirks - he's also smarter than you think he is and likable enough to get the girl, at least for a little while.****Marlowe's a special brand of freak. He notices with exacting detail and describes in kid-like exaggeration what people wear. He fixates on the body musk of henchmen, the desirability of women, and a pink-headed bug crawling around an office.****There are &quot;agents&quot; in the universe - men with fluid positions that we merely call private investigators. Marlowe can fall into a scenario not of his creation. He can be as one character describes, &quot;a late comer to the show,&quot; but just in time to be in on the action. He carries the arc in a story and brings clarity. If he can't figure things out, there is no solution to be had.****&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; is typical Chandler - tough, sardonic, thickly sliced but smartly dialogued, and oddly, funny as hell."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"This is a great novel for so many reasons. The dialogue is clever without descending into cuteness. The supporting cast of characters is a truly fascinating one. The descriptions of places are vivid. Be they the homes of the obscenely rich or rundown slum dwellings. The intricate plot unfolds in a way that really holds the reader's interest with a couple of nice plump red herrings thrown in for good measure.As always, Marlowe himself is tough as nails and completely hard-boiled. Except that towards the end of the book, he surprises us by becoming sentimental. This uncharacteristic sentimentality is not directed toward either of the two female love interests. But rather toward a tall, violet eyed boatman named Red who helps Marlowe in his hour of need. You really have to admire Raymond Chandler for knowing just when to interject the unexpected.I would love to give Farewell, My Lovely 5 stars, but I have to deduct 1 star. The reason? I can't for the life of me understand what the killer hoped to gain by commiting murder in the first place.If Mr. Chandler were still alive, I'm sure he would address that particular concern in the manner of a college professor talking to a kindergartener. I can just imagine him saying: \\"Reality is not straightforward. Only in the world of fiction are motives clearly defined and unambiguous. My writing is meant to reflect real life.\\" {From The Big Sleep (1939)- \\"It had the austere simplicity of fiction rather than the tangled woof of fact.\\"}"},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"I finished THE BIG SLEEP in a few days and was so impressed by the book, I immediately bought FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. Another great novel by Chandler.The book begins with Marlowe being pulled into a barroom mishap when an ex-con is looking for his girl. Once Marlowe finishes with the police reports, he thinks his day is over. At the office he receives a phone call from a man who needs his help. The man asks Marlowe to accompany him to a 'business' meeting. This is only the beginning of a twisted mystery which Marlowe is faced with solving.Once again Chandler does a great job of weaving various stories and characters in an effortless manner which takes the reader easily through the mystery. I look forward to reading another Marlowe mystery...they are pure joy!"},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler's creation, Philip Marlowe, is a character that has influenced modern fiction greatly. Without Marlowe the archetype of \\"private dick\\" would not carry the cultural weight that it does today. It is true that the plot lines of many Chandler works are contorted to the point of no return, but it is not the plot that counts. The reason why these books are so successful is because we the reader become enthralled by Marlowe and his immediate knowledge of all things that surround him. Because Chandler made Marlowe such a carefully wrought character, Farewell, My Lovely becomes an examination of the human character rather than a list of dastardly deeds committed by crooks without depth. Every scene is an interaction between fully developed characters. He defines himself in relation to the people and actions that whirl in and out of his life. Marlowe offers us plenty of insight into his opinion of his relations. Because he is such an endearing person we want to believe every word he says. He is a product of the LA scene where he works. We the reader build confidence in our hero because he is capable of sizing up any situation immediately. Slowly we learn to trust Marlowe's way of navigating the underbelly of LA. I truly enjoyed Farewell, My Lovely because Chandler forces through Marlowe an undeniable wit and charm. He will make you laugh and draw you into his brand of thinking about other characters. I wonder sometimes when reading Chandler about how Marlowe would size me up. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about interesting characters and loves a wry wit and dark charm."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"I hated how 1940 racism suppurated in this story and nobody saw anything wrong with it.I didn't like how sometimes I didn't understand what was happening, but then neither did Philip Marlowe.By the time I didn't understand I was mesmerized by red neon flashing further and further across grimy hotel ceilings, the damp smell of sage in the canyons that flared my nostrils, the scraping of pebbles pulled by the ocean tide.I liked seeing how words can be magic.Here is a random paragraph (truly) about the same as you'll find on any page in this book: \\"After a while there was a faint smell of the ocean. Not very much, but as if they had kept this much just to remind people this had once been a clean open beach where the waves came in and creamed and the wind blew and you could smell something besides hot fat and cold sweat.\\"I loved seeing how paragraphs can also be poems."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Given Chandler's enormity I'm feeling (as I did with Austen) more like I'll be reviewed than him - and this is complicated by the fact that I've been too busy lately to get to the review soon after reading the book. Anyway, with these disclaimers I'll push on.Great stuff - Chandler really has his own voice, mood and characters. Indeed, he's quite self-conscious in this book, having Anne Riordan remonstrate with Marlowe about how he *should* have run and concluded his investigation in a more traditional and elegant fashion:\\"You ought to have given a dinner party ... and you at the head of the long table telling all about it, little by little, with your charming light smile and a phony English accent..\\"Marlowe responds for Chandler, \\"It's not that kind of story. It's not lithe and clever. It's just dark and full of blood.\\"Interesting that Chandler felt he had to justify his deliberate departure from the classic mannered English detective story - or was he just enjoying highlighting the contrast?And it's not *just* dark and full of blood: there's flirting, camaraderie, humour, honour, and even a romantic ending. Still, along the way Marlowe takes a hell of a beating given his somewhat inexplicable method - which involves identifying particularly dangerous individuals and locations and just walking in without preparation, protection or backup. If you somehow manage to still be breathing after they've pounded you for a while, you've got some more clues to your case. And you even get the (nice) girl on your own terms:\`You're so marvellous,' she said, \`So brave, so determined, and you work for so little money. Everybody beats you over the head and chokes you and smacks your jaw and fills you with morphine, but you just keep right on hitting between tackle and end until they're all worn out. What makes you so wonderful?\`Go on,' I growled, \`Spill it.'Anne Riordan said thoughtfully: \`I'd like to be kissed, damn you!'So who's reviewing this book - me or Chandler?Marlowe is a pretty cool pro, but anything but a schemer. He throws himself in the ring and improvises. He blurs the lines, liking some of the bad guys a bit much, being rough and coarse - but then bugging the good guys by showing he's read a bit and can show more chivalry than they do. And just what was going on with \`Mrs Grayle' and the midnight assignation which could have ended very differently:\`I bet it's fun to be played by handsome blondes,' Anne Riordan said. \`Even if there is a little risk. As, I suppose, there usually is.'I didn't say anything.He's quite a contrast with the cold, aloof (but still troubled) Sherlock Holmes. If getting involved might cloud his judgement a bit, hey, what the hell...Chandler has a knack for making his characters shine - Marlowe is actually a bit of a soft touch, he can empathise, and from his perspective we find things to draw us to them the way he is. An odd thing in his in other ways very bleak, rough world."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; is such an amazing book. From the first page, this novel does what all Chandler books do-- transports you to a whole 'nother world, so real it feels like you're actually there. FML is such an awe-inspiring accomplishment for the immensely talented man of letters, Raymond Chandler. Most of the time I was absolutely floored, just sitting there with my mouth wide open, marvelling at his genius. Writing is hardly ever this good, and when it is, the great stuff usually isn't the abundance of the book (as RC's is), rather, it's in little snippets here and there. There must be a God, because Chandler's writing makes me realize the potential of us humans to transcend the ordinary and be what he is-- extraordinary. Not to mention that the mystery will have you guessing all the way through, and even without the cynical prose (yes, I said prose) which manages to be beautifully ugly and positively negative at the same time (I told you he was a genius), is excellent in of itself. So, I urge every person who hasn't yet done so to read Raymond Chandler. He is not just a mystery writer (which usually means sub-standard literature) but he totally, without a doubt, transcended the genre. I guarantee his writing will blow you away. His clever, cheeky remarks, his sarcasm, his minimalistic prose, his cynical outlook, the dames, the coppers, the criminals-- that and more is what you can look forward to in this masterpiece of the English language."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"For me the main pleasure of reading this novel derives from wisecracks zinging on almost every page. Here are a couple, plucked randomly:The coffee shop smell was strong enough to build a garage on.A bogus heartiness, as weak as a Chinaman's tea, moved into her face and voice.And here is another one, a shot at Hemingway, as Marlowe explains a corrupt cop why he keeps calling him by that name: \\"A guy that keeps saying the same thing over and over until you begin to believe it must be good.\\"Hemingway may not be a great writer -- I'm not a big fan -- but he was a far better one than Chandler. That little charming fish story of his alone has (rightfully) much greater literary acclaim than all of Chandler's works put together.Still, Raymond Chandler is a pleasure to read. He has a tremendous gift for storytelling. The wisecracks, the colorful characters, and the snappy dialogue make reading this novel, as well his other ones a pleasant experience, especially on lazy, boozy weekend afternoons. Nothing wrong with that."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Being a fan of \\"modern\\" mysteries, I always enjoy picking up a \\"classic\\" such as \\"Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"I,the Jury.\\" THis was my first Chandler novel. I won't say I liked this book as much as the others mentioned yet reading it made me think of a dialog line from the first \\"National Treasure\\" film where Nicholas Cage reads the Declaration of Independence and says \\"they just don't talk like that anymore.\\" The same holds true here; the characters, the way they talk, and the way a bottle of booze can take care of everything captures the time and makes you understand what made Chandler so revered up to this day.As so many great novels do, the story line is secondary to you getting engrossed in the time period, the city of Los Angeles, the hero(??), private eye Philip Marlow, and those he meets up with. As some have mentioned, the plot seems somewhat disjointed early on. It almost borders on Quentin Tarantino movie territory in that you have to wait awhile for a couple of separate incidents to come together in order to grasp the entire story. Marlowe literally stumbles into the middle of a couple of murders and the women, bad guys, and good guys that Marlow comes across makes for a sometimes confusing yet very interesting novel.A good novel but, for me, not as much fun as Spillane or engrossing as Hammett's classic work. Still, this is the kind of book you read, enjoy, and say as you are closing that book cover, \\"they don't make 'em like they used to.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"I started reading Raymond Chandler after the author of one of my favorite new authors of last year, Richard K. Morgan, was compared left and right to him. The comparison was apt, and Morgan should be flattered, because Chandler is a genius.Farewell, My Lovely is Chandler's second book, and features his hero, Philip Marlowe, a smart-mouthed, hard-boiled private dick who is straight as an arrow. I had read that The Big Sleep, Chandler's first book, was his best, and that they descended in quality chronologically. But after reading this book, I know that is wrong. This is one of the best stories I've read in a long time. not only is the wonderful noir narrative there, but the mystery is first-rate."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Ah Chandler. And Phillip Marlowe his private eye. This is the second time for this novel, but it's been so long it was like reading it for the first time. The characters, descriptions, and plot are vivid and complex. Marlowe witnesses the murder of a bar owner in the black side of town (1940s LA) by a big lug ex-con, Moose Malloy. Malloy is in search of his lost love, Velma who used to sing here when it was a white bar. This simple set-up embroils Marlowe knee deep in connected crimes. Well done, by a master."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Raymond Chander's second novel is both more and less successful than his first. THE BIG SLEEP suffered from a plot that fell apart in midstream; FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, however, is much more consistent throughout. On the other hand, for all its twists and turns, THE BIG SLEEP was quite plausible; FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, however, is about as farfetched as you can get. But once again, such criticisms are almost beside the point: the great attraction is still Chandler's knock-you-flat prose, his tone of voice, his often imitated but seldom equaled style, and it is so powerful that it keeps you turning page after page after page.In general, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY once more finds street-smart and super-savvy California P.I. Philip Marlowe sticking his nose where it has no business being--and when curiosity leads him to follow a massively built white man into a black nightclub he finds himself embroiled in a murder no one cares about solving... at least not until it begins to figure in what seems to be a completely different case with a high-society spin. And encounters with stolen jewels, a spiritualist racket, police corruption, and a gambling ship quickly follow.Along the way Chandler again paints a gritty portrait of the seamy side of life. On this occasion, he takes a passing look at race, and makes the point that from a police point of view two standards apply: the authorities care nothing about the murder of a black man, but they treat a white man's murder very differently indeed. This portion of the novel is intrinsically controversial, for Chandler uses the slang and racial slurs common to the mean streets of his era--but it is worth noting that although Marlowe uses the same language, his attitude toward the blacks who appear in the novel is considerably different from that of the authorities, who could not care less about the murder of a black man who don't much care who knows it. And once again, Chandler graces his pages with dames and dandies, broads and bums--and he makes them live with remarkable vitality. The famous prose is as rich as ever, although noticeably less witty and quite a bit darker than that found in THE BIG SLEEP. We've stepped off the curb and into the gutter, Chandler seems to be saying, and we're walking in it all the way. Impressive stuff and a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Farewell My Lovely, Raymond Chandler's second novel in the Philip Marlowe series, transcends the genre it helped to create, and is now (deservedly) viewed by many as literature and as social criticism.Chandler creates moods and telegraphs emotions via the poetic ramblings and outrageous similes from the mind of Philip Marlowe, the protagonist/detective/narrator who is picked up by the collar and dragged into a murder mystery that exposes not only the hypocrisy beneath the surface in the lifestyles of the rich and beautiful, but ultimately, the depravity of the human condition. And all of this is delivered with a caustic sense of humor, a wry wit, and a hypersensitivity to the visual world and it's translation into the language of the mean streets.Although Chandler died shortly before I was born, I grew up in L.A., and I can say that the L.A. Chandler wrote of is in many ways the city of my childhood memories, so well did he capture the ambiance and ambivalence of the 'city of angels'.Some have criticized his plotting and plausability, but emotion, action, and detail were what interested him the most, and in these he excelled. FAREWELL MY LOVELY must be viewed within the context of it's era (published in 1940) to be fully appreciated, but the flow of action, the visual aspect of it's language, and the insights into the very human conflict of corruption verses conscience are timeless.This book, like the first in the Marlowe series (THE BIG SLEEP) was written at the height of Chandler's creative career, and exemplifies the style that has made him a writer's writer, possibly the most imitated author of the past century."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler was such a master at his style of prose that you only have to read the first two paragraphs of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY to know exactly what sort of story you're in for. Those two paragraphs perfectly set up the plot that follows: a thriller crossing in and out of the racial divisions of 1940's Los Angeles involving seedy speakeasies, and off-shore gambling, with double-crossing as far as the eye can see. Wonderfully gritty stuff.This particular Chandler novel has a lot going for it. The hero, Philip Marlowe, is as entertaining as ever. The setting is the familiar scene of other Chandler stories -- alive, heavy and oppressively Los Angeles. The plot is logical, but jumps around a lot, which is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the more it moves around, the more room Chandler has to incorporate evil-doings; I quite lost track of exactly how many crimes are committed or alluded to during the course of the book. No matter how farfetched it is, Chandler's prose is utterly gripping and absorbing.I think Philip Marlowe must drink his weight in cheap liquor several times over during the course of this adventure, but you can't help but like the guy. He punches, he shoots, he boozes. He even solves the case by the end. He sure takes a beating in this one, but he keeps coming back for more. He's everything a pulp detective should be - angry, arrogant, determined, and with just a hint of pathos to make him interesting enough to carry the story.The book as a whole is just too appealing and entertaining not to be a fun experience. Chandler is pretty much the benchmark for these sorts of stories about guns, police, and corruption, so if you like the genre, you might as well read the man who invented it. Tough guys yelling, \\"Beat it!\\" at each other might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Chandler is so good as telling the story that any inadequacies in the conventions of this genre are wallpapered over with some slick dialog and snappy comebacks.I read FAREWELL, MY LOVELY more for the great atmosphere and tone than for its overall plot. The fact that the storyline wraps up nicely at the end is merely a bonus. But the real way to enjoy this book is to just let the atmosphere, the characters and the prose just wash over you."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Only THE LONG GOODBYE merits higher place in the shining canon of prose-poet Raymond Chandler. This violent, shabby, hilarious, and ultimately very moving novel rockets P.I. Phillips Marlowe through the darkest, seamiest side of Chandler's textured world Los Angeles. In no other novel does Chandler's razor sharp and witty prose slice so sharply, and his sense of tragic irony (&quot;It isn't funny that a man should die, but it is funny that a man should die for so little&quot;) reaches its zenith. Hard to put down, impossible to forget."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"This is the second Raymond Chandler novel I have read after \\"The Long Goodbye\\". I rarely ever read fiction but I can not overemphasize how much I enjoy reading Chandler's novels. These stories are most definitely NOT \\"page turners\\" and I mean that as a compliment. A \\"page turner\\" leaves the reader in suspense about what is going to happen or what is going to be revealed, often leading me, at least, to superficially scanning much of the prose in order to move ahead more quickly. There is some of this suspense in \\"Farewell My Lovely\\" (actually more than in \\"Goodbye\\" which spends more time philosophizing) but it is in taking every sentence as it comes, rolling it around in your mouth and savoring the flavor that gives the real pleasure in these novels.What particularly stands out in this story is the shades of gray of everything. Whereas many detective stories try to fit all the pieces together at the end and show us good guys and bad guys, Chandler's protoganist PI Philip Marlowe sees the world in shades of gray. He doesn't attempt to get to the bottom of people's motivations, and that includes himself. At the beginning of the story, he sees a big white man enter a black nightclub and then sees a black man come flying out the door. For no apparent reason, and admitting that it was none of his business, Marlowe goes in to see what is happening and gets drawn into the mystery. We see people commit murders and yet Marlowe feels that they are not \\"all bad\\". Marlowe encounters some policemen who are good, some who are bad and some who are in the middle. In the end, Marlowe figures out more or less what happened, but admits there are holes in his theory, and he can't completely explain why the characters he encountered acted the way they did. This is the way the real world operates and Chandler/Marlowe is telling us to be honest with ourselves and to admit that we often don't know why we do the things we do and whether we are being really consistent.I find it interesting to note that although this story was written almost 70 years ago, it shows a world that is pretty indistinguishable to our own. The story does not seem \\"dated\\". We see the materialist Los Angeles society that I grew up in during the 1960's and 1970's, and the type of people who live on its fringes. The only jarring note I encountered showing the changes in technology since 1940 was when Marlowe mentions he saw an \\"ice truck\\" parked on the street. Well, I guess time does move on.In closing, this novel has one of the most famous Chandler-quotations of them all: \\"I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat, and a gun.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"The tough-as-nails writing of Raymond Chandler has overtaken mysteries to so great an extent that it's easy to forget his role as a trailblazer. 'Farewell, My Lovely,' just Chandler's second novel, already burns with the rot of Los Angeles that spawned countless other imitations and had a far-reaching effect on both crime fiction and moviemaking over the next thirty-five years.'Farewell, My Lovely' is a typically Chandlerian novel, using first person narrative and a slew of characters. Thirtyish private investigator Philip Marlowe starts with a dull case, before he gets pulled onto the scene of a murder at one of Los Angeles's Afro-American bars. The huge, White assailant Moose Malloy has recently left prison and is searching for his lost girlfriend. Marlowe finds himself beside a dead body and a load of curiosity. Helping with police investigations, he enters a labyrinth of the Los Angeles underworld, including crooked cops, hot blondes, swindling psychics, and racketeers.Chandler's storytelling in the first person narrative of Marlowe is hard-boiled crime before it took on clich&eacute; status. The writing style is crude by necessity; found here is the private detective's rough and cynical attitude that influenced later antiheros like Peter Gunn and the noir style that dominated Hollywood movies. Besides several adaptations of Chandler to the big screen, other directors have paid homage, such as Roman Polanski in 'Chinatown' and David Lynch in 'Blue Velvet.''Farewell, My Lovely' is a well-constructed novel, but not without flaw. Chandler lets none of the characters go to waste, each holding a pivotal role in Marlowe's detective work. This novel stays consistent with his first project, 'The Big Sleep,' in having Marlowe revisit the same territory of earlier chapters. There is no predictability at all and Chandler creates genuinely tense moments.Marlowe, however, is steered by chance far too often and there are times when the action seems contrived, or without inevitability. The easy-going narration helps to smoothen over farfetched elements, such as the unlikelihood of Marlowe getting shoved into Moose Malloy's bar brawl, which is needed just to launch the story. The climax is also rather disappointing, taking place in an unimaginative location.While dealing with the social realities of 1940s California, Chandler's novels still need to be considered as great entertainments rather than full-fledged literature. The novels make generalizations about human life but are mostly driven by plot. It is pulp fiction of the highest rank: well-written, often humorous, and highly dependable. This novel, like others of Chandler, should hold its place in the detective genre for ages to come.The Chandler novels have been republished in an attractive collection by Black Lizard, the crime subsidiary of Vintage Books. 'Farewell, My Lovely' is 292 pages long, in a nice art deco format. Imperfect but highly entertaining, the novel is a must for crime fiction fans."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"From the first paragraph to the last, I was held hostage by Chandler's writing. The action comes at you faster than a bouncer's fist and is just as relentless. This was the first Chandler book I'd read and though I'd heard a lot about his stature as a noir writer, I have to say he did not disappoint in the least. Marlowe is a man's man. He doesn't back down from a challenge, he enjoys the women he likes, dismisses those he dislikes, fights the good fight, and he always tells it like it is!I worked my way through Hammett, Thompson, Mosley, and others, and now it looks like I'm going to work my way through Chandler."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"In &quot;Farewell, My Lovely,&quot; Raymond Chandler's second Philip Marlowe novel, Marlowe reluctantly agrees to help a careworn police detective search for a nightclub girl named Velma, a former girlfriend of an ogreish ex-convict named Moose Malloy who is wanted for murder. Marlowe's first lead is the nightclub owner's widow, whom he plies with liquor, only to find out that Velma's whereabouts are being kept a guarded secret. Then, in what initially seems like an unrelated subplot, Marlowe is hired by a man who wants &quot;backup&quot; while he delivers money to some jewel thieves. The man ends up murdered, and Marlowe meets a mysterious girl at the scene of the crime. To think there's no connection between this event and Velma's disappearance would be to underestimate Chandler's genius at plot construction.Chandler cleverly plants false leads to twist the already unpredictable plot and subtle clues that make sense at the end. His colorful characters are masters of deceit; the reader imagines that these people must have great poker faces. They know a lot more than what they're telling Marlowe, and it's exciting to know that Marlowe will eventually be able to guess what they're leaving out. Like J.R.R. Tolkien's Gandalf, Marlowe is one of literature's greatest magicians; the fun of reading the book is waiting for him to pull the rabbit out of the hat at the end."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's \\"Farewell My Lovely\\" we see the stereotypical detective, sitting in his detective agency, at his desk, looking out of a rain-streaked window, pondering something, something we will probably never figure out. The detective here is Philip Marlowe, Private Investigator, and he is presented with what seems like a simple jewelry theft case. Marlowe, with his wit and charm, instead confronts crooked cops, fraudulent psychiatric hospitals, blackmailers, con men, and beautiful and deadly women. Marlowe jumps, almost literally from situation to situation. Each scenario is highly entertaining, but a little difficult to believe. Either Philip Marlowe manages to fit thirty-four action-packed hours in one day or I don't know what. It's interesting how witty the character of Marlowe is and how unaffected he seems to be by all the events going on around him. Even when he is beat up, drugged, and almost killed, he gets up, and carries on. It is difficult to determine whether or not he does this solely for the money, or if he feels he has a personal investment, or perhaps desires the glorification. Chandler incorporates wonderful descriptions of sunny Los Angeles into his novel as we follow Marlowe around the city chasing after people, details, and a solution. He also uses a great amount of similes and metaphors, comparing everything to some strange seemingly unrelated object. Yet, when it comes down to it, this quintessential detective mystery fulfills all my requirements for a good book and left me guessing up until the end."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"With the exception of Charles Dickens, has any writer has more influence on narration than Raymond Chandler? Dozens and dozens of writers -- not always crime writers -- have tried to sound like Philip Marlowe. Dozens of movies have featured Philip Marlowe-like narrators, including the theatrical release of BLADE RUNNER, where Rick Deckard sound nothing so much as a 21st Century updating. And perhaps there have been even more parodies. Either way, we all know what detective narrators are supposed to sound like, and we know this because of Raymond Chandler.Raymond Chandler did not invent hardboiled detective fiction. He essentially took Dashiell Hammett's invention and focused nearly all his attention on prose style, character, and detail. There is an almost tactile quality to many of his stories, to the extent where you feel you could almost reach out and wipe the dust off a desk with your finger. There is, also, an almost wanton disregard of plot. If you read Raymond Chandler for plot, you are misreading him. I'll admit that in several of his novels I'm still unclear what happened. But who cares? The brilliance is in the texture, the detail. Take smell. Read virtually any other detective, crime, mystery, or hardboiled novel and look at how often other writers mention smells and then look at Chandler. He is constantly telling you what places smell like, whether mesquite or sage or sandalwood or whatever. Chandler wrote with heightened senses. I frankly can't get around to caring that his plots aren't very tight because other things absorb all my attention.FAREWELL, MY LOVELY is one of my favorite Chandler novels, perhaps only behind THE BIG SLEEP and his flawed masterpiece THE LONG GOODBYE. It featured many of his most memorable characters, especially the doomed Moose Malloy, and many of his most unforgettable scenes. Because of Chandler's ability to sketch a scene in such astonishing detail, there are scenes in his books that are as easy to visualize as it is a scene in a movie. He is that vivid and precise in his depiction. A great example is Marlowe's visit to Mrs. Florian in his search for Velma. It would be a person of very poor imagination who didn't get a strong sense of what her house looked like, smelled like, felt like.This is also one of his best books because it is one of the most tragic. The end of the novel feels almost like the end of Hamlet, with nearly all of the major characters either dead or at least shattered. And like with most of Chandler, there isn't an overly nice resolution of the mystery, whereby the detective magically makes everything nice and tidy and correct. Marlowe gets to the bottom of things, but often what he finds when he gets there is an abyss. And speaking of Chandler's influence, can one imagine the end of Raymond Polanski's CHINATOWN without Marlowe?As a side note, there have been two very good film versions of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. The first was made by RKO while Chandler was still alive and was originally released with that title. It tanked at the box office, mainly because it starred former Warner Brothers boy crooner Dick Powell. His style of musical had gone out of style and no one wanted to see what they assumed was a musical. So RKO renamed it MURDER, MY SWEET, which obviously could not be a musical, and re-released it. It was a box office success and was crucial in launching the second half of Dick Powell's career, this time as a serious dramatic actor. Chandler himself was horrified at the casting of Powell as Marlowe, but later proclaimed that he thought Powell was outstanding in the role. By the way, the person that Chandler himself thought would have made the ideal Marlowe was Cary Grant. The second version of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY was released in 1975 with Robert Mitchum as Marlowe. With apologies to Humphrey Bogart, Mitchum is my favorite Marlowe. He was a tad too old for the role, but apart from that he absolutely nailed the cynicism and latent nobility of Marlowe. My only regret is that Mitchum didn't begin making a string of Marlowe films when he was 35. As it was he was too old in his second appearance as Marlowe in a bizarre version of THE BIG SLEEP set, of all places, in London."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"The second Philip Marlowe novel written by Raymond Chandler, and also the second one read by me was already familiar to me, having seen two film versions. Therefore, this story was the first real introduction to the character (Robert Altman's version of The Long Goodbye bears very little resemblance to any Marlowe novel I've read).I walk away from a Marlowe novel with an incomplete understanding of all the intricate mechanisms of the plot and how they fall into place (although Farewell, My Lovely is more straightforward than The Big Sleep in that respect) although I leave the book fully cognizant of a world created in a specific time and place with a self-contained atmosphere and a self-contained and pulpishly poetic language.In Farewell, My Lovely, Philip Marlowe is trying to mind his own private eye business but somehow ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time, somehow running afoul of crooks as well as cops. A simple case of tracking down an old flame for a massive ex-boxer turned convict is never going to be simple with Marlowe. His encounters with seedy crooks, smugglers, dope peddlers and gambling joint operators provide the reader with a tour of, to use an overworn phrase, the \`underbelly of society.' With Chandler, the law enforcement officers and the laws of the government they are sworn to protect are often as corrupt as any of the pseudo legitimate businessmen/crooks.Culturally and sociologically, this is an interesting depiction of the U.S. in 1940. The racial attitudes are probably pretty typical of the time although aside from occasional uses of the n-word, Chandler doesn't exploit stereotypes as much as most of the films of the time period. Marlowe's attitude toward marijuana also seems to be fairly non-judgmental, unlike what one would expect of many of the law enforcers of that time.Marlowe is a collection of contradictions. On one hand, he can be as brutal and deadly as he needs to be although I don't recall him intentionally killing anyone. In this novel, I don't believe he kills anyone at all. On the other, he is sensitive to washed up losers such as Jessie Florian and he seems to want to believe that others are as principled as he is. Unlike many other popular private eyes, he seems at least somewhat cultured and even quotes Shakespeare on a couple of occasions. If one accepts the prose style as the creation of Marlowe rather than as simply the mouthpiece for Raymond Chandler, then Marlowe has a very poetic view of his world and describes it in metaphors that have been parodied to death and yet Marlowe has used the perfect set of words to describe what he sees.Chandler's plots have been criticized for their contrivance and implausibility. Implausible they may be, but plots are not why I read Raymond Chandler's Marlowe stories. I'm reading them for the reasons I enumerated. I am reading them for the unique world view of a character who wears the necessary armor to do battle in a corrupt world and yet wants to believe in a world of chivalry and moral order."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler creates a world of grime and crime in his second novel Farewell, My Lovely. Protagonist and private detective Phillip Marlowe falls into a case when he's taken into an old nightclub with a large ex-con named Moose Malloy.

Malloy winds up killing a man there, unable to control his temper, but that isn't Marlowe's only trouble. He goes along for the ride on a jewelry ranson deal where his client is brutally beaten to death. Things get stranger and stranger the more things happen, and plenty does.Even if you've seen any or all of the movie versions, you'll probably find yourself guessing to the very end. How? Because Chandler creates a world like no other, a world truly his own. He preferred Dick Powell as Marlowe in the 40s noir film Murder, My Sweet, an adaptation of this book.Chandler has an amazing grasp of the Marlowe character. Every line is distinct and memorable. Despite the lurid setting, you'll probably find yourself laughing at Marlowe's wit and sarcasm. This is no childrens' book, but it's an indulgent read.

I bought this solely for Ed Bishop being in it. It turns out I really totally enjoyed this book being dramatized. I have since purchased the other Marlowe plays available. I love the honesty, though brutal at times, of Marlowe's character. To me he is a dedicated, likeable guy who gets the job done and done well. For anybody who enjoys the old radio plays from years ago..this is a must for you. Any mega fan of actor Ed Bishop, (like me who totally fell in love with him years ago) this is also a must to own!

This novel reads like a Quentin Tarantino production where every one seems clich&eacute; cool, moves swift, and screams with devious intentions. The main detective Philip Marlowe knows the underground world around Southern California as he is initially recruited to find stolen jewels but ultimately stumbles upon a murder case full of twists and turns. Crime follows everywhere he goes as he meets gamblers, fraud, vixens, con men, prostitutes, poor, and rich. This books relishes in the criminal underground and that is exactly what makes this novel such an enticing read. Perhaps one of the greatest attributes of this book is the fact that Marlowe, like the rest of us, is not flawless. Rather than being the astute Sherlock Holmes, this gifted sleuth has normal problems which we all can relate to. He never seems invincible and always seems to be on the verge of trouble which ultimately makes the book more enjoyable. The only drawback is by the end of the book I had already guessed the criminal, but then again, I may have just gotten lucky."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Farewell My Lovely puts Chandler's detective hero, Philip Marlowe on the trail of Moose Malloy, a hulking ex-convict who's looking for his ex-girlfriend Velma. Marlowe stumbles upon Malloy as he tears up a bar looking for her. Velma had worked there when the bar had a white clientele. The place has the same name but is now for coloreds only. Molloy murders the bar's owner. The police are uninterested since the victim was a person of color. Marlowe looks into the case on his own initiative, even though no client has hired him to do so. A mysterious wealthy playboy hires Marlowe to be his bodyguard at a ransom exchange. Marlowe is knocked unconscious and his client is murdered. The story proceeds from there with all the loose threads being tied together at the end. There are a lot of plot points that don't make much sense.Bay City is a fictitious town abutting Los Angeles where a good part of the story takes place. It is a haven for crooked cops, corrupt politicians, quack doctors, phony psychics, and illegal casino gambling. Marlowe makes a huge effort, risking his life several times, to meet Brunette, the mob boss that runs Bay City. That effort seems worthwhile only in hindsight. The climactic confrontation between Marlowe, Molloy and the missing girlfriend seems contrived. All of that is unimportant. Raymond Chandler's novels are appealing more for their witty dialogue and clever metaphors than for their stories. Farewell My Lovely's best line describes Moose Malloy's girlfriend: \\"It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window.\\" Molloy himself is described as follows: \\"He looked as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.\\" Pure genius."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"With smooth moves across the literary dance floor, author Raymond Chandler has his way with his partner, the fortunate reader. Without a word too much or too little, Chandler created a style both casual and elegant. His lead character in this work, private detective Phillip Marlowe, must solve a murder, one that is connected to gambling, beautiful women, guns and danger. If you like the sleek style of the 1930's or 40's, then this writer is probably the one for you.\\"She got out a gold cigarette case from her bag and I went over and held a match for her. She blew a vague plume of smoke and watched it with half shut-eyes.\\"Sit close to me,\\" she said suddenly.\\"Let's talk a little first.\\"\\"About what? Oh...my jade?\\"\\"About murder.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"I recently listened to the unabridged version of this book narrated by Elliott Gould, and while Chandler's glimpse of 1940's era Los Angeles was surely entertaining, I still like Dashiell Hammett's \\"Continental Op\\" novels better. In Farewell, My Lovely, private dick Philip Marlowe starts out working for a barber on a minor job and unrealistically stumbles onto a murder by a hulk of an ex-con, looking for his old girl Velma in a club where she used to work. Marlowe then is mysteriously contacted out of the blue to provide security for a shady jewel transaction, in which a rich dandy is to attempt to buy back some precious jade from the thieves who stole it.The novel moves at a brisk pace, and while some of the plot twists seem a little forced, they are entertaining nonetheless. One of my main problems with the story is that Marlowe seems to spend most of the novel putting his life in danger, getting knocked out, shot at or drugged, without much of an incentive to get involved. He often seems to be acting on his own, without a paying client, despite warnings from the police to stay away coupled with the obvious dangers. Hammett's continental op, in novels like The Dain Curse, at least had a paying client ordering him to snoop into the multi-layered mysteries, with significant insurance money at stake.Ultimately, without giving away too much of the story, Chandler does a pretty good job of throwing a lot of balls in the air and wrapping up most of the loose ends by story's end. Some threads are left unresolved, like the whereabouts and motives of the mysterious doctor and psychic in Bay City, but most of the rest of the plot makes sense. LIke another reviewer said, at the end of the novel, while you may have enjoyed the ride, you are left with somewhat of an empty feeling.As for the narration, I expected a little more from Mr. Gould, an accomplished stage and screen actor who seems to sleepwalk his way through the beginning of the book as if he was handed a copy of the novel, a microphone, and told to read. He later changes pace a little, adopting different voices for different characters, but I found the voices ill-suited to the characters and sometimes caricatures of policemen or gangsters, as if the novel was a scene from a \\"Bowery Boys\\" episode."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"Tough guy, hot woman that might leave you with a bullet lodged in your back, lies and double dealing all served up on a corrupt California landscape.

Usually it is when you think they will get away with it.R HemingwayPast Twilight"},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"In this his second adventure, private detective Philip Marlowe - more or less in between cases - pokes his inquisitive nose where it doesn't belong. Encountering a behemoth of an ex-con, Moose Malloy, on the street, Marlowe follows the big man into a bar and witnesses a murder. And before the reader can ask, \\"Where's my Velma?\\" - the question makes sense when you read the novel - Marlowe finds himself embroiled in police corruption, a blackmail scam, chasing a gang of jewelry thieves, another murder and encounters a young female who becomes his pseudo-partner, a psychic con-man, a crooked doctor and is propositioned by beautiful young woman who is married to a much older and very wealthy man. All the while Marlowe attempts to keep tabs on Moose.If possible the plot/story-line of Farewell, My Lovely is even more convoluted than its predecessor, The Big Sleep. Marlowe meeting new players with each twist and turn of the investigation and getting physically bounced around on a regular basis. (For the politically correct there are a handful of racial slurs which may make the reader cringe.) But somehow the author ties it all together in the end with maybe a not so neat bow.This being a Chandler novel there are plenty of classic \\"Marlowe-isms\\". After being called to a rich client's home, where \\"the carpeting almost tickled his ankles\\", he describes the den he is escorted into as \\"a room where anything could happen, except work.\\"When embarking on a night's work he makes the observation, \\"I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance. I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun.\\"Ahhhh - to be Philip Marlowe."},{"Title":"Farewell My Lovely","review":"A giant of an ex-con, bursting out of his costly, tasteless and ill-fitting clothes shows up at a nightclub one day, looking for his ex-girl, Velma, and takes Raymond Chandler's intrepid, wise-cracking detective, Philip Marlowe, along for a rather bumpy and dangerous ride, in this tale of crooked L.A. cops, gigolos, mediums, gamblers and gang betrayal. Moose Malloy is bigger then nearly everyone else and not overly bright but he is dead set on finding his Velma, last seen eight years before when Moose got turned into the cops for a bank job he pulled with some others. Marlowe witnesses Moose in action, while on a case, and gets sucked into the search for the big guy and his long lost honey by one cop while being warned off by another. But Marlowe is too bull-headed to do anything but keep pushing and, surprisingly, not particularly bright, since he keeps getting suckered and hit over the head and put at serious risk of his life. Situations he ought to see coming, as an experienced detective, he seems to persistently misread, perhaps because his liking for liquor has blurred his senses or maybe he just isn't a very good investigator. But, whatever the case, he stumbles on, from one life threatening situation to another. He also can't seem to get his arms around the fuzzy set of coincidences that follow hard on the heels of his run-in with Moose as he gets a job offer that anyone in his business with half a brain would walk away from . . . and then mishandles it badly. The seedy atmosphere of L.A. is very nicely handled and the characters sharply limned and convincing, but the perpetually soused Marlowe, with the self-defeating wise-cracks and nasty mouth is a little tiresome. I had a bit of trouble acclimating myself to the racist mindset that Marlowe and his cohorts present in this 40's milieu, too, since I thought it was somewhat gratuitous and even mean-spirited, but maybe that's how some folks thought in those days. More troubling was my profound sense that Marlowe was just not bright enough, or slick enough, to be a half-decent private eye. He seems, in this book, to have a death-wish, a bad trait for someone who hires himself out as bodyguard and investigator. He takes chances a green kid shouldn't take and never seems to see the blackjack coming. Still, he manages to stumble along, thanks to a combination of apparently undeserved good luck and just plain hard-headedness, until the cause of all his troubles unfolds itself before his and our eyes. Surprisingly, given his drink-induced obtuseness, he solves the mysterious set of coincidences that have led to so much murder and betrayal, and gets the girl who wants him though he's too tough to ever openly acknowledge wanting her. This was a very odd detective tale, if ever there was one, and yet, for all its irritations and flaws it kept me reading to a most satisfying conclusion that pretty much wraps the central problem up in an almost too-tight, neatly tied bow. Moose finds what he was looking for and Marlowe figures out how to find Moose and the killer of Marlowe's mysterious client is unmasked. Marlowe, of course, has another drink. -- SWM"},{"Title":"Stereophonics: High Times and Head Lines","review":"Writing in a concise and descriptive style, Mike Black analyses the rise of this stylish group, looking at their lives in the tiny Welsh village of Cwamaman, and looking at what led to them becoming one of Britain's top rock groups.

Oh no, you might be saying, but it is presented very simply. For instance it presents a handful of common verbs and their conjugations. So on one page you can see how to say \\"I have,\\" \\"he has, \\" etc. and \\"I like,\\" \\"he/ she likes,\\" etc.The rest of the book is split between an English-Russian dictionary (130 pages approx), a Russian-English dictionary (70 pages, approx.), and a 20 pages menu reader. What makes the English-Russian dictionary pages unique, though, is that most every other page (at least) has dialogue boxes relating to the most useful word(s) on that particular page. For instance, when you thumb through the book for the word \\"live,\\" you get the word itself, but also the phrases \\"I live in...\\" and \\"Where do you live?\\" It'll take you 10 minutes to find such a phrase in Berlitz or Lonely Planet in their \\"getting to know others' section. But because Rough Guide is structured as a dictionary, with hundreds of really useful phrases highlighted in boxes within, you can access something you want to say rather swiftly...and actually deliver it just a minute or so after looking for it. Add the grammar section, where you learn useful verbs and how to conjugate their past tenses, and the number section, and you can learn easily to chat with someone about where you are from, where you are going, where you have traveled thus far, what you like/liked, and so on. Likewise, knowing have to say \\"have\\" make sit easily to ask whether a hotel has rooms, whether the room has a shower (after thumbing through the book for the word for shower), etc. And when the answer comes back that the hotel doesn't have, or say \\"we have,\\" you can actually catch what they are saying.If still not persuaded, next time you're in a bookstore compare a Berlitz, a Lonely Planet, and a Rough Guide language phrase book side by side. Lonely Planet Russian, for example, is basically several pages of basic grammar followed by many sections of phases you won't likely ever use. For instance, the guide provides several pages each of lists of occupations, nationalities, college majors, items of stationary, jewellery, colors, insects, flowers, aquatic sports(!), electrical appliances, camping terms,and so on. Also provided are pat phrases to employ at a hotel's front desk, at a doctor's, at the optometrist, and eating out, among other mini-sections. The book, in effect, is set up to be taken out to be used once a day, if that. It's an improvement on Berlitz phrase books, but not by much. (Berlitz simply divides their books into 10 or so color coded sections such as: \\"sightseeing,\\" \\"relaxing,\\" \\"shopping,\\" traveling around,\\" \\"money,\\" \\"eating out,\\" etc.)So, if you just want a book for emergencies (say, breaking a leg, etc.) then Berlitz and/or Lonely Planet phrase books will serve you well...in your pocket until you are faced with such a situation, since they do have many more specific terms (like 50 different parts of the the body), but if you really want to be able to say some things in Russian on a daily basis during your trip you'll be much better served by Rough Guide Russian.

No, it's not a complete guide to learning Russian ... hey ... it's small enough to fit in a shirt pocket. What do you expect? But as a handy reference for phrases and vocabulary, this one is the best of the ones I have seen. Many of the books I picked up in the beginning were filled with errors my partner noticed just thumbing through them, both in terms of spelling and other basics.

We quickly gave up, and I wrote a Cyrillic interface to Google Translation that we just carried around on a wireless netbook. I ended up giving the book away to another host family.This dictionary might have *some* use for travelers as it seemed to have a decent number of food-related words. I liked the idea of the pronunciation guide but, try as I might, the few words and phrases that I found that were useful were not understood by our Russian-speaking visitor.

There are all color images or screenshots on almost every page. One feature that I found very handy was the color coded chapter tags on the left hand side of the pages. On the right side listed the chapter you were in making finding things easier.The red part of the cover is actually a separate piece and I found myself using the ends as a bookmark. No big deal but nonetheless a useful feature.The book handles all the basics in an easy to understand manner.

They are adult enough to be realistic but without sliding into soft porn. Luke Starbuck seems to have a realistic grasp of just what is involved in a gunfight. He lacks the casual cavalier attitudes of so many of the protagonists of the western genre. He seems to understand that when you are facing multiple opponents, it is best to delay the fight, fight from cover or use deception. He is a pretty tough hombre given his fistfight with Tate. It would be nice to have a protagonist that can get his butt kicked in a physical fight. Luke has an attitude and his sarcasm is juvenile at times that takes away from his appeal.This is the first of the Luke Starbuck series and I was impressed with the nod to issues of conscience regarding the mass hanging of the horse thieves. As the older member of the surviving gang stated as he was about to be hung; \\"Hanging us is lots worse than what we done to you.\\" There is an issue of proportionality in the dispensation of justice. It was customary to hang horse thieves in the Old West and the custom was based on the necessity of the strongest possible deterrent to the crime. Stealing a man's horse could be a death sentence to the owner of the horse. The horse provided the only reliable means of transportation in a harsh land of vast distances, few places of habitation, and an occupied numerous two-legged threats. In this story, none of the horses stolen were taken from a person that depended on them for their life. They were rustled from range stock and nobody was left afoot. It might be putting too fine a point on it, but the punishment was harsh indeed. Perhaps we should consider similar reactions to car theft. One might draw the distinction between stealing a parked car and a car-jacking.The fact that rancher Ben Langham went back on his word to Chub is bothersome. It seems to taint the integrity of Luke. Nonetheless, Matt Braun tells a western the way it should be told. Reasonable plot development, simple characters, enough action to make it a western and the pace of the reading is excellent.Nevada Storm"},{"Title":"Hangman's Creek (Luke Starbuck Series)","review":"Luke Starbuck is born in this book.

Is it Ben Echhardt, Chub Jones, Monty Hall? All are suspected at first but it turns out to be Dutch Henry Horn. Luke uses a quick draw, fist and his natural smarts to get to the bottom of the mess. A fairly quick read, plenty of action and Luke comes to find out he enjoys doing this type of work. I would have given it a five except for the last several pages. I got the feeling Braun was just trying to end the story. It was good, then bam, the ending came very quickly.

Now we come to the Jouineau/Jean-Marie Mongin series. Wow, what great books for [item price]. For [item price] you get the uniforms of the Imperial Guard Calvary in color with lots of detail. One of the drawbacks (if you can call it that) is that they are computer generated images. This makes it inexpensive to produce numerous different unifoms.

This is exactly how I was beginning to feel about Oracle's XML documentation (primarily on TechNet) -- tons of what I needed, with no degree of coherency or focus to task.I eventually gave up on wading through countless Oracle URLs and READMEs and simply decided to wait for the release of Steve Muench's book. I'm glad I did.Steve takes us on a journey of well-documented *examples* that explain the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; of the Oracle XML API, not just the &quot;what&quot;. Especially good is Chapter 5, the PL/SQL XML API - great for long-time Oracle dweebs that have yet to polish up on Java.I have few criticisms - I had hoped to see an electronic version of the examples on the included CD (any maybe they're there but they were not immediately apparent). I also recently purchased O'Reilly's XML Pocket Quick Reference - it does a bit better job at concisely explaining XML and XSL syntax. Rather than dis Muench's effort, I prefer to believe that the Quick Ref is an essential companion to this otherwise stellar find.If you plan to &quot;do XML&quot; with Oracle, you MUST BUY THIS BOOK, period. 'Nuff said."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"First, I must say, when I picked this book a few weeks ago, I already was working with XML/Oracle/Etc for almost a year. At the time the variety of books in the market was very limited (I had to learn XSLT from a site in the Czecz republic because no book offered a decent coverage!). So, I picked this book to see what I had missed, and what I was doing perhaps not in the best way. This book was everything that I expected and more. It covers *a lot* of material, XML, XML Storage (How to use Oracle Clobs, for example), XPATH, XSLT and more - the authors don't cut corners, they explain everything thoroughly, and that's why the book takes more than 700 pages. The examples are excellent - concise and right to the point. The material is written in a clear and comprehensive way. Usually programming books take a lot out of me - but not this one! I thought I knew a lot about XML, but I learned much I didn't know from this book. To summarize, this is how a programming book should be! Simply above and beyond the call of duty. I also think it would be useful for people which intend to use XML with databases other than Oracle."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"Steve preaches words of wisdom and exhortation to the many would-be software development practitioners endeavoring to claim the promises of Java and XML. His book is second to none with regard to explaining Java-Oracle-XML because(1) he provides deep and wide coverage of the concepts (2) he provides meaningful example code for nearly everything discussed in the book (3) he has a command of Java, PL/SQL and XML that enables him to speak fluently in any of these languages. Consequently he becomes an ambassador from any of these camps to any of the others.The book shelves are crowded with XML, Java and Oracle books that dabble in the nexus of these technologies - applications. Where they all fall short of describing the intersection of these technologies in ways that are germane to business (Oracle XML Applications) OXA succeeds.Especially noteworthy are the many examples of using LOBs to store, manipulate and retrieve XML documents and his treatment of XSLT in chapters 7 and 9. After taking great pains to explain the use of XPath he then goes to great lengths to show how it is used in XSLT to transform XML documents into HTML, XML or other document types. Pay special attention to the explanation of the operation on page 279.Those who read his book will certainly benefit from its disclosures."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"This is perhaps the best book on XML written so far. Stepping out from the stereotype model of writing a book in XML, the material provides deep insight into the Oracle XML capacities by providing real world examples and issues faced with reading/writing XML datagrams from databases through Oracle XML capacities and covers a wide gamut of issues (mostly performance) faced by application developers in using XML as the format for data exchange and solutions to counter most of these issues. The best part of the book are the chapters on XSLT and the numerous examples that shows the power of XSLT in rendering and transforming XML data. The book is highly recommended for both beginners and experienced programmers in XML(/Java). There is something for every level of reader interested in using XML for B2B applications."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"A fine book, strongly recommended. No laborious explanations of the obvious, treats the reader as intelligent. Well chosen examples, all related to practical and real-life situations. If you work in an Oracle shop this is the one book you should read on XML.Only criticisms are (i) the high level of XML awareness assumed by the book, (ii) it is a fairly comprehensive tutorial on XSLT, but isn't quite structured right as an XSLT tutorial (material is scattered through the book), and (iii) lack of discussion on scalability and performance of XML technologies. It would also have been nice to see some personal opinion on how Oracle's XML technolgies fit in the wider world, and where things are likely to head with 9i, given the author's position."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"So you've made the decision to tackle your next big IT project with a powerful threesome: Java, Oracle, and XML. Then this the book for you. I echo the comments of another reader who found wading through technet.Oracle.com's assorted tutorials and scattered documentation frustrating -- this book puts it all together in one place.Though Java isn't in the book's title - it probably should be. I found chapter six, &quot;Processing XML with Java&quot;, to be the most comprehensive and valuable chapter in the book. The author describes and builds a set of Java applications for storing XML as CLOB objects on the server, importing (via parsing and JDBC) XML documents into a relational schema, and its complement, exporting query results into XML, among other things. I also found running and working with the source code examples (downloadable at oreilly) to be a learning tool.One caveat is that this book should be used as a starting point -- not a final reference -- for using XML with Java and Oracle. The pace of development with XML means that some of the classes the author used, like those from SAX 1.0, are already deprecated. But after reading this book, and working through the examples, picking up the the new stuff shouldn't be hard."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"This is an essential book for anyone working with Oracle and XML. There's no other book which comes close in these topics.The examples are clear and well-explained. Within the book Steve Muench develops a package of XML utilities which accompany the examples. These utilities are extremely useful in their own right, and are sure to become a standard part of your toolkit.Both Java and PL/SQL developers will find the book useful as Muench covers the examples from both angles. The coverage of the Oracle XSQL technology is unique.I highly recommend this book and have pointed more than a few developers towards it already. After reading just the opening chapters you'll be itching to get started using the Oracle XML tools on offer.A must have for any Oracle/XML developers bookshelf."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"This is an excellent book for developers wishing to use XML with Oracle and Java, C++, or PL/SQL.

The one thing I would like to see more of in this book is coverage of Oracle's handling of XML Schema, since XML Schema appears to be the eventual replacement of DTDs.The book is great for beginners since the author starts the book and individual chapters with basics, but it is useful as a reference since the author handles many of the complexities that more experienced developers will eventually run into when using Oracle and XML together.The included CD-ROM does not include the fabulous examples (it features JDeveloper 3.1 for Windows/NT) in the book, but these examples can be downloaded from the O'Reilly site (referenced in book's preface, pg. xiii).While there are excellent chapters focusing primarily on XML, the real beneficiaries of this book are people who need to integrate XML with Oracle and a programming language such as Java. Not only has reading this book increased my knowledge about integrating Java, Oracle, and XML, but it has also provided me with working code that I can start using in my applications."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"Finally, a comprehensive guide to Oracle 8i's support for XML. Excellent examples, clear and yet complete narrative as is customarily found in the O'Reilly series. Also includes the best overview of the XML standard that I've read. The sections on the interMedia extensions were great. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"Unless you're still running 7 or 8i, I can't recommend this book. As another reviewer noted, Oracle has added a lot of XML features in 9i and 10g. The content itself is great -- the authors should consider a second edition that covers the current Oracle XML features."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"It is an amazing book on XML side of Oracle.

I already had some understanding of XML and related technologies, but needed to figure-out how to solve certain problems.This book demonstrates a variety of approaches to get an XML document into a database.

But: every single chapter starts not with the introduction of the packages supplied by Oracle but with some Steve Muench helper packages. Then You are forced to work with them. If You really are after learning XML at its source and, heaven forbid, want to build Your own packages, You must delve into Oracle packages on your own."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"This book is excellent and the author's proficiency in Oracle/XML is second to none. I like his News Portal and Pager explanations. This is the first book I've seen to talks about the issues when paginating result sets using XML or otherwise. I particularly like his approach to using XML as the model and clearly separating the presentation from the model. He preaches this throughout the book and demonstrates how to do this effectively using XML and XSLT. The one critisim for me as someone who isn't 100% committed to using Oracle is that he makes a lot of use of PL/SQL and Oracle features. I accept this because it's after all a book about writing Oracle XML applications but it takes away from the reusability of his examples for me."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"The first 16 reviews probably gave you the impression this was a greatbook.

This is not only the best book on the subject, it's the best O'Reilly book I've seen in a long time, if ever. Plus, the author is very active on the Oracle developer forums.

I haven't read the new Wrox book on the subject but would be stunned if it's anywhere near this book. 10 stars."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"This book was written in 2000, prior to 9i, which has added a lot of functinality. If you already know XML well and need to augment the rather pathetic Oracle Press books and Oracle On-Line documention, then this is the best book I have read. Many of the examples used in the book do not reflect the real-world examples I have had to deal with, so keep an open mind.Many XML details are assumed by the author or are skipped-over entirely, so if you do not know XML, pick-up an XML book at the same time.The book is dominated by Java; relatively little PL/Sql coverage."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"This is one of the best Oracle books I've read for the last 2-3 years. It combines the importance of the subject with the depth and clarity of presentation technique. For instance, Ch.5 can serve not only as XML with PL/SQL but also as a great source of the PL/SQL scripts and approaches. The author deserves very high marks for the job he's done. I wish I had more books like this.Vad Roytman,Oracle DBA"},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"I'm going to get gushy here. I've been reading computer books for 20 years now, and this is one of the best content-specific ones ever.Steve uses examples that are brief but extremely relevant. He approaches topics much like programmers do - by stating a real (not toy) problem, then giving successively more elegant and functional solutions. Gradually my thoughts shifted from &quot;XML is hype&quot; to &quot;XML is very useful!&quot;On top of all this, the book is cheap! Some recent O'Reilley books have disappointed me, but this one restores my faith. It's destined to become a classic."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"This is a great book for those who have knowledge of XML and Oracle, but aren't entirely sure of how to get the two of them together. Lots of excellent code samples and concise explanation of the technology. If you're ever going to do any work with Oracle and XML, don't look past this one."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"I absolutely loved all of the examples and the fact they work directly with straight Oracle 8i and Java instead of requiring a bunch of additional software packages. I thought the examples really demonstrated well the technology on which the book focused. This book is a must read for anyone interested in understanding and applying XML!"},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"Steve's book does a simply amazing job of weaving practical business context and pinpoint technical implementation. It covers in detail everything the Oracle XDK readme's and samples miss. If you need to work with XML in an Oracle environment (either PL/SQL or Java) then you must buy this. It will save countless hours and provide the depth of knowledge that few if any books I've read have been able to convey."},{"Title":"Building Oracle XML Applications","review":"It is really good book that describes development of XML/XSLT Applications and contains examples of building XML Applications using Oracle technology."},{"Title":"Eternity and time","review":"W.E.Best is one of those rare Christian writers,that when you read one of their books,you always come away with numerous fresh insights(and a deeper understanding)of God's Word,no matter how many books you have read on the authors subject.What are time and eternity? Do they have anything in common? How can they be distinguished from each other? There are satisfying answers to these questions in this treatise.Those who have little or no interest in 'the things of God' do not pay much attention to the concepts of eternity and time. But surprisingly 'the people of God'do not often give the close attention that eternity and time warrant.The terms are often used by Christians but rarely is there even a feeble attempt to give a precise definition of them.The first third of the book defines and contrasts the subject at hand.Chapter 8 'Man Was Created In Time To Live Eternally' has an illuminating discussion on Dichotomy and Trichotomy. The writer gives a strong apologetic for Trichotomy. He elaborates further in Chapter 9 on the difference between spirit and soul(dichotomists assert that they are two terms referring to the same thing).An excellent point is made that animals have a soul but not a spirit and this is a significant distinction of man from the animal world.On p.59 Mr.Best writes \\"Through his spirit,man attains God consciousness;through his soul self consciousness; and through his body world consciousness.From this point of view man is Trichotomous.\\" A part of man being made in the image of God is his tripartite nature.Mr.Best gives the best defense for Trichotomy(and refutation of Dichotomy)that I have come across.In the second third of 'Eternity and Time'(in various places)the author gives a sound refutation of soul sleep and the idea of the soul being bodiless between a persons death and the resurrection on the last day.This is the type of book that will help a believer set his mind and heart on the things above and is very deserving of a wide hearing.It is a weighty spiritual treatise and very unique in its subject matter. It is presently out of print(but can be obtained used)and I hope some publisher or individual has the foresight to bring this valuable work back into print someday soon."},{"Title":"A road to self-knowledge: And The threshold of the spiritual world","review":"The one-star rating is for the Kindle product, not for Steiner's writing.The Kindle product is not the 220-page text as advertised. It consists of 8 \\"meditations\\" and would probably total about 30 pages of a printed book. (Kindle does not show page breaks.) The printed book contains the 8 meditations (collectively titled \\"The Road to Self-Knowledge\\") plus a number of other essays collectively titled \\"The Threshold of the Spiritual World\\".If you want the complete text, you will have to get the printed book. Later editions of the book were printed under the titleA Way of Self-Knowledge: And the Threshold of the Spiritual World, again containing both the 8 meditations plus the Threshold essays.There is a better description of the book under the other title \\"Way of Self-Knowledge\\", and the price of that title is lower.

This is a great storyline and concept, however, Mr. Williams fails to deliver with a solid plot line and unfortunately the writing fails to provide the adequate hooks to hold a reader in place.

Everyone who has an interest in philosophy or religion ought to read his masterpiece,Saving the Appearances. This book on Lewis doesn't belong in that category, though I recommend it nonetheless because of Barfield's graceful way with words and the occasional interesting anecdote concerning Lewis. You will learn something of Barfield's own philosophy, but less than a reading of his masterpiece will teach you. So: a qualified recommendation. If you really want to deepen your knowledge of Lewis, read his correspondance."},{"Title":"The Ginger Star (The First New Adventure of Eric John Stark)","review":"The Dark Mark cometh.As part of a most excellent Brackett 'Space Opera Noir from the master' ebook bundle, from Baen.The title refers to the color of the sun of the planet Skaith, where this series is based.Stark ventures there looking for an old friend and mentor, someone who was pivotal in his survival and upbringing.Then it gets stranger. Skaith is a backwater, and speakof the Dark Man and other such Robert E. Howard appellations - that is what a prophesy suggests Stark might be - a pivotal figure in the planet's conflict.Once he arrives, he could be in a Burroughs or Howard story, Witchfire story, backstabbing madwomen, tough guy enemies - ok, apart from the telepathic hounds, perhaps.Certainly monster fighting and sword swinging to be done, however.The book, is introduced by Algis Budrys, and he sets the scene for those not around for the 1974 publication, and a glossary of people and places is given at the end, for this a little out of the ordinary planetary romance on a dying world setting.Not a brilliant book by any stretch, as you would probably guess, but it is very compelling, as he who was N'Chaka the wild man, the Wolfshead (has anyone been called by the titles of two Howard stories in one book before?), searches for his friend among many deadly enemies on a planet full of people disinclined to believe in the existence of the outside Galactic Union.I think you can get them from Paizo and Planet Stories, too, as another option.I don't think anyone who likes the whole family of space hero/planetary romance supermen type of story will regret reading these books for a second, as Brackett certainly has more talent than most of the writers of the same.This is a 3.5+ if you like.3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"54 Ways You Can Help the Homeless","review":"&quot;54 Ways You Can Help the Homelss,&quot; is, to be sure, a text of boundless optimism. It describes exactly that detailed in the title, along with real-life examples of how almost every suggestion has been applied. Some are sensible; some inspiring; some self-promoting; some unrealistic; some are stating the obvious, and some appear to take much, much, more time and commitment than the average person may be willing or able to give.Some of the fifty-four ways listed make so much sense, it's a wonder they're not more widespread practices. for instance, Mr. Kroloff suggests that citizens carry fast-food gift certificates with them to give to panhandling homeless people in lieu of bills or coins. When handing out cash, many people wonder if their money isn't going to be used to buy crack or booze. With gift certificates, this coubt can be eliminated.While the obvious repetition of suggestions in &quot;54 Ways You Can Help the Homeless&quot; tends to cause some ideas to lose their clout, the more personal stories accompanying some pieces can be haert-wrenching. A few go a long way towards encouraging readers to take action, such as the child who reported that he didn't eat breakfast because, as he said, &quot;It wasn't my turn.&quot; These are not, however, the norm.Mr. Kroloff's book also has a tendency to engage in shameless self-promotion: two of the fifty-four ways to help the homeless are titled &quot;Buy This Book,&quot; and &quot;Give This Book.&quot; Personally, I think a foreword or just one self-dedicated category would have sufficed.Mr. Kroloff seems to believe that the average person's life revolves around helping the homeless, or would if only they knew how. He even goes as far as to suggest that instead of engaging in scavenger or treasure hunts at birthday parties, children should go door-to-door collecting food for the homeless, someething most people would realize to be an unlikely event. Furthermore, he showed himself to be a teensy bit out of touch with the state of public schools' funding when he suggested that proceeds from school fundraisers be routed towards homeless shelters.Several times, &quot;54 Ways You Can Help the Homeless&quot; urges readers to volunteer at shelters, soup kitchens, and other homeless organizations, but lists each as a separate category. This may not have been necessary, as in my experience, volunteering is the frist thing that comes to peoples' minds, along with donating money, when it occurs to them that they should do something to help the less fortunate. A single category might have done perfectly well, exept that subsequently it would not have been possible or at least honest to include &quot;54&quot; in the title of the book. &quot;54&quot; is important because it is a multiple of 18, a number representing life in Judaism.While many of Mr. Kroloff's fifty-four ways to help the homeless can be executed in mere seconds or minutes, maybe a few hours, some are completely unrealistic in that they would take days or months of work, more time than many people may be willing to give. While people who care very deeply about the issue of homelessness may indeed be ready to commit themselves so full, as they say, &quot;everyone has their own agenda.&quot; Everyone cares passionately about different issues, be they education, abortion, gay rights, the WTO, medical marijuana, or homelessness, and a gay rights activist, for instance, is less likely to put an extreme amount of time into an issue he may not care as much about. An example is the idea Mr. Kroloff gives to start a thrift shop for the homeless, which would take a considerable amont of time.This is, however, truly the book of eternal optimism. Not only do the words seem to imply that ending homelessness is very possible, if only everyone would help them a bit more, the very tone of the book is positive and upbeat. Mr. Kroloff speaks of the great rewards of helping the less fortunate and of the compassion and motivation of the American people to aid the homeless, a concept very much contested in other articles I have read. His bright outlook also shines through whn, as mentioned above, he expects ordinary people to commit extraordinary amounts of time tohis cause. He never seems to doubt the likelihood of completing the task he seems to have set out to complete: eliminating homelessnesss altogether. Other sources have informed me that tis is probably not possible. Opinion? Absolutely--but opinion based on fact, nonetheless.while Mr. Kroloff seems to have the basics and more of writng conquered, his prose is nothing truly exceptional, and if the book wins any awards upon the subject matter alone they will be based. He is only one of the many, many people of this earth who feel free to write a book on whatever riles them and experience, however little their voiced needs to be added to the melee of authors clamoring for our attention and time. Not that &quot;54 Ways You Can Help the Homeless&quot; was not a useful and well-intentioned book; far from it. Charles Kroloff simply may not have been the person most qualified to write it. Then again, he may have been. It really is difficult to say. Often, just because one person can put pen to paper more dkillfully than the next does not mean that they have anything better to tell.&quot;54 Ways You Can Help the Homeless&quot; was a book that provided essentially good information and advice on a topic not well known by the general public. Although many areas could have been improved on, making it a hard read to continue at times, the spirit and optimism of the book is something to be appreciated."},{"Title":"54 Ways You Can Help the Homeless","review":"This book is just a small one that packs a HUGE wallop to our conscience. I thought I had been doing all I could to help the homeless....until you have read this book, you have no idea how many more things that we could be doing. Painless methods of taking giant steps to solve a problem that touches all of us. Anyone who enjoys the &quot;Chicken Soup For the Soul&quot; books will LOVE this one. It would be the &quot;Chicken Soup For the Homeless&quot; alternative, literally. Each of the 54 methods of helping the Homeless includes a little heart warming story of how this method has worked. No soapbox, just the plain truth right up front.Please don't get the idea that this book has been written by Rabbi Kroloff just for the Jewish community, indeed, this is the most integrated effort I have ever seen to bring all of humanity into the effort to save ourselves! All religions and all efforts to bring our communities together on this issue have been addressed equally!This book has been written to be shared. In all ways possible this work of humanity needs to be passed around like a chain letter! There are simple methods and examples of each one provided to illustrate what has and is being done to provide a solution to the Earth shattering problem of homelessness. Simple and straight to the point, you will wonder why this hasn't been written before.&quot;54 Ways You Can Help The Homeless&quot; won't take long to read, and it may not change your life.....but I'll bet it WILL change someone's life! &lt;VBG&gt; I just wish it were a little longer...and guess what?

After all, they are the real ACT tests.The answers after each test offer some explanation if you missed the question, but since this book doesn't tend to brush you up on any skills in the beginning, it won't do it in the answer, either. If you miss a hard math problem, the answer won't offer as much explanation as other books do.If you're planning on using this book to review for the ACT a few nights before, don't bother. The information is organized as if you were taking the real test, question by question. It tells you what type of question it was, and how you should have answered it. The night before the test, I would find it more helpful to go straight to your math notebook and brush up on your geometry instead of trying to memorize types of questions.Overall, this book really does seem like it was written by \\"the Makers of the ACT.\\" Explanations and directions on how to approach a question sound like they come right out of the test its self. This can be helpful if you haven't taken the test before, but for those of us who have and simply want to improve our scores, this information is just repetetive.In conclusion, if you want to buy this book for it's practice tests, you'll be satisfied with it. I suggest also picking up a sample practice test along with your registration packet if this is your intent. But if you want to buy this book to help you better understand sine, cosine, and tangent, and cram information right before the test, don't bother with it."},{"Title":"The Real ACT Prep Guide (The only guide to include 3 Real ACT tests)","review":"Everyone studies for the ACT in a different way but the one thing that everyone needs to do is practice. This book offers 3 practice tests published by the College Board. Getting into the ACT offers 2. My advice is get both of them. When I did 2 practice tests before this book I got 28's on both. Then I worked through the 3 tests in it and saw significant improvements each time. When I finally took the ACT I got a 31 on it so from personal experience I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Real ACT Prep Guide (The only guide to include 3 Real ACT tests)","review":"I purchased this book before taking the ACT for the first time. I figured it would be a good idea to get a review book with full-length tests included because unlike the SAT for which I took the PSAT, I had never taken the PLAN exam because my high school does not offer it, and I was completley unfamiliar with the ACT format. The book is very extensive, which is helpful if you have the time to read through the whole thing, but I for one did not: I waited until after taking my SAT to start working on ACT prep so I wouldn't be trying to prep for two different tests at the same time and therefore I only had a few weeks to review. This may seem like a long time, but anyone who is a junior in high school (especially those who attend college prep. schools) knows that there is little time left to do much of anything after homework and extracurriculars. I only cracked open my copy of the Real ACT Prep guide ot get a feel for what on earth this \\"science\\" section is all about, to see how scoring works, and look at how the ACT optional writing differs from the SAT essay (in my opinion, the ACT writing prompts are less abstract than the SAT ones).I did most of my prep work from Kaplan's \\"Procrastinaters Guide to the ACT\\" purely because I WAS short on time and it covers topics in a much more concise fashion. It does only include one full practice test, but when I registered for the ACT via mail at my school, we were given a booklet from ACT with a practice test, so I actually had two tests outside the \\"Real ACT prep guide.\\" This was plenty under the time constraints I had.I will probably re-take the ACT simply because I can do so and choose which score I want to send (unlike the SAT). This time I will have more time to prepare so I will use the \\"real ACT Prep guide\\" to especially look over the math and \\"science\\" sections in more depth.In short, if you have plenty of time before you take the test, this is a very good book. If you haven't got a whole lot of time, go for something more in the vein of \\"The procrastinator's guide.\\"*note: I put the science section in quotations simply because the section has little to do with scientific knowledge; all it really measures is how quickly you can analyze table and graphs to make conclusions and beat the clock--emphasis should be put on the -quickly- part!"},{"Title":"The Real ACT Prep Guide (The only guide to include 3 Real ACT tests)","review":"I needed a 32 on my act score, and got a 31 before, so I checked out a few books from the library on ACT test review.

As a teacher who helps prep students for the college admissions tests, I know what most students are willing to do. Hours of study and review over a long period of time may be the ideal, but it is an unrealistic ask of most teenagers. Their most efficient use of time is to take practice tests and then look over the problems missed. This book has real questions direct from the source combined with good explanations of all answers. The overall review sections are short and to the point. Students may take practice tests one section at a time to avoid burnout (but must understand why they missed each question). A few hours spent preparing with this method will raise scores, probability of admission to certain schools and the amount of scholarship money a student is likely to earn."},{"Title":"The Real ACT Prep Guide (The only guide to include 3 Real ACT tests)","review":"The ACT is quickly becoming an equal competitor to the SAT college entrance exam. Accordingly, the test prep industry is growing up around this relative newcomer-turned-regular on the admissions scene.This book, published by the ACT organization--the makers of the test--is a fantastic resource for any student or teacher working on test preparation. But, in all honesty it is only worth the [...](a pretty reasonable price) because of the three real practice tests included inside. The rest of the book...the introduction, the strategies, and even the question answer explanations...have been done better by other organizations. It's no slight to the ACT company, but they simply did not choose to share the best strategies to beat their own test.Still, this book contains the only published real ACTs, and all other companies cannot match their faithfulness to the test (some companies unfortunately are very, very far off). Similarity and accuracy are essential for practicing, because the format, style, and difficulty level of practice problems can vary immensely. Since the best way to practice for the test is to work out real problems, this book is a must-have resource for any student or instructor.Hopefully the ACT will publish some more tests soon. In the meantime, you can also try and get a hold of their free \\"Preparing for the ACT\\" guide which comes out every fall. Each one contains a full practice test, so try and get your hands on them.

When first published Blish basically started with what fans voted as the most popular episodes and eventually worked his way through the show's three seasons. However, for the 25th Anniversary editions the adaptations were reorganized so that there were not only three volumes, each representing an entire season. Therefore, &quot;Star Trek: The Classic Episodes, Volume 1&quot; represents the first season in 1966-67.The volume includes an introduction by D.C. Fontana, and the prefaces that Blish wrote for his original paperbacks, along with the forward Judith Ann Lawrence wrote for &quot;Star Trek #12.&quot; The first season episodes are arranged in order of their television appearance: &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before,&quot; &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver,&quot; &quot;The Enemy Within,&quot; &quot;The Unreal McCoy [The Man Trap],&quot; &quot;The Naked Time,&quot; &quot;Charlie's Law [Charlie X],&quot; &quot;Balance of Terror,&quot; &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?,&quot; &quot;Dagger of the Mind,&quot; &quot;Miri,&quot; &quot;The Conscience of the King,&quot; &quot;The Galileo Seven,&quot; &quot;Court Martial,&quot; &quot;The Menagerie,&quot; &quot;Shore Leave,&quot; &quot;The Squire of Gothos,&quot; &quot;Arena,&quot; &quot;The Alternative Factor,&quot; &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday,&quot; &quot;The Return of the Archons,&quot; &quot;A Taste of Armageddon,&quot; &quot;Space Seed,&quot; &quot;This Side of Paradise,&quot; &quot;The Devil in teh Dark,&quot; &quot;Errand of Mercy,&quot; &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever,&quot; and &quot;Operation-Annihilate!&quot;The most memorable story is &quot;The City on th Edge of Forever,&quot; because as Blish notes in his footnote the script for the story different drastically from Harlan Ellison's original version (which Harlan shared with Blish). Blish attempted to preserve what he thought were the best elements of both scripts and freely admitted that he might owe apologies to everybody. Ultimately Blish is forced to go with Gene Roddenberry's televised version, where McCoy is the person who gets accidentally gets injected with cordrazine and it is Kirk who acts to let Edith Keeler die, but he does manage to work in Ellison's original ending where Spock speaks to Kirk about offering the universe for love. For years this was the only indirect look we had at Ellison's original script, which was reprinted in an obscure science fiction collection until he included it in a published diatribe against what Roddenberry did to the episode.Blish was a well-known science fiction author, who has won the Hugo Award for his novel &quot;A Case of Conscience,&quot; and what he brought to these adaptations was a great ability to flesh out both the characters and the actions. In many ways these adaptations hold up better than the original episodes, where the special effects are less than what an eight-year-old can do on a home computer today. But throughout Blish shows an understanding of both the characters and the Star Trek universe that was being created, which explains why he was also the author of the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; original novel, &quot;Spock Must Die!&quot;"},{"Title":"Star Trek: The Classic Episodes, Vol. 1 - The 25th-Anniversary Editions","review":"James Blish began adapting the stories of the original Star Trek television series in 1967 in a series of 12 books. Bantam books has collected these books into three volumes, reorganizing them in the process. James Blish passed away many years ago, to the great chagrin of his fans, and D.C. Fontana introduces this collection.This book is the first book of the set. There are 27 stories, representing the first season of Star Trek. Each story has a title page with a black and white picture from the television episode. The title page also lists the writer or writers, the director and guest stars.James Blish needed to modify some of the stories a little because of the differences between a television show and a written story. However, the stories match the television shows quite well. Blish does explain in the prefaces to the original books, all of which are provided at the beginning of this collection, the kinds of changes he made and the logic behind them. While he was afraid that fans might be upset at the modifications, these books were well-received when they came out, and the original stories remain prized.These stories range in quality, as did the original television show. \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was one of the best shows in the first season, with Joan Collins as a beautiful social worker. Many other episodes challenge a viewer's mind. \\"Miri,\\" guest starring Kim Darby, had adults aging rapidly, becoming paranoid and psychopathic. How could McCoy and Spock identify and cure the disease in a one-hour episode? In the \\"Squire of Gothos,\\" we learn about childhood from a different perspective. In \\"Devil in the Dark\\" the crew of the Enterprise discovers a new definition of life, and that life is as protective of its children as we are of ours. There are other stories that were weak, and yet, this television show was the best science fiction available in the 1960s. We treasured each and every show.Star Trek will forever be one of the ground breaking shows of science fiction. The show was a promise of what was yet to come, and helped to inspire many people to become scientists and engineers. These wonderfully adapted stories, each running about 20 pages or so, are fun to read again, both for fans that saw the shows when they first came out, and for new fans. This book is a wonderful addition to any Star Trek fan's library. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Star Trek: The Classic Episodes, Vol. 1 - The 25th-Anniversary Editions","review":"They have key points of the episodes, but not a lot of descriptive detail in the stories.

The book is tough to summarize.Earley is an angry author. Economic elites, the media, and minorities are among his many targets.He is especially scornful of the flag-waving, right-wing politicians who avoided the Vietnam War.He argues that the USA did not earn its current hegemony; it was lucky to inherit the world role of the British Empire. He accuses Americans of being clueless. Compared to the Soviet Union and Great Britain, Americans suffered comparatively little in World War II. Yet, Americans believe they are great warriors.He asks whether a strong China of the future will forget that the United States of the 1930s sold raw materials to Japan at the very same time when the Japanese were slaughtering millions of Chinese civilians.Earley contrasts the Jewish and Japanese memories of World War II. Jews want no one to forget; the Japanese prefer that everything be forgotten.These are among the many topics Earley covers. His book will offend the squeamish, the politically correct, and the politically incorrect."},{"Title":"War, Money & American Memory: Myths of Virtue, Valor & Patriotism","review":"The one group of people forgotten by every other.Richard Earley confronts the greatest taboos in American culture by challenging icons and the trend-setting \\"elite'\\" self-perception of nobility and bravery.He demonstrates how Blacks have not been held publicly accountable for the fictions used to comfort their consciences and justify their crimes. These fictions have been fomented and supported by a dishonest academia and Jewish-dominated media class, while the white lower and lower-middle classes have borne the brunt of Black crime. Earley says this does not concern wealthy white gentiles who believe that their money will protect them, yet lower-class whites are forced to live and die like the flies of summer.Earley documents the evasion of American wars by two groups responsible for determining the content of modern American culture: Upper class WASPs who have cowered in the campuses of Harvard and Yale, and most pertinently Jews. This has elicited the uproar of many who consider the revelation of nasty truths to be worse than the death of American soldiers.Using Jewish or American government data, Earley has established the evasion of war by American Jews. White gentiles died at 6 or 7 times the rate of Jews in both the Civil War and Vietnam. In World War II they died at a rate more than 50% greater than Jews. The same pattern is found in World War I Germany. Yet the Jews of Germany died for the Kaiser at almost 10 times the rate their American kin died fighting the Germany of Adolf Hitler. Earley asks if American Jews fled from fighting Hitler, would they ever fight like their countrymen? The answer is no. He says that this has not stopped Jews from being fierce advocates of American intervention when Jewish or Israeli interests are at stake.Earley contends Americans have forgotten how we supplied the Japanese war machine prior to Pearl Harbor, but that Mao did not forget and neither have the Chinese leaders of today. China claimed 35 million dead to Japanese barbarity, but a Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times reporter revised that number to 10 million dead. Not one letter was published about the disappearance of 25 million Chinese dead - more than 4 times the number of dead claimed by Jews during the holocaust. Earley claims the post-war world has witnessed Japan wanting its depravities forgotten and Jews wanting to be remembered as the war's only victims.A greedy plutocracy has pushed globalization and moved wealth-producing industries off shore, most notably to China. The balance of world power is shifting once again to the Orient and a renascent China will remember past assaults and insults. As an expanding world power, China will inevitably have its policies collide with the United States, the declining power. Even in their most decrepit state China never accepted the American claim to the mandate of heaven. Earley claims the lack of concern shown by the Chinese for Israel deeply worries American Jews, who are positioning China as a potential adversary.As the Chinese say: Interesting times lie ahead.Buy this book."},{"Title":"War, Money & American Memory: Myths of Virtue, Valor & Patriotism","review":"-Richard Earley, a retired military officer, is a keen observer, an astute researcher, a purposeful, sometimes stinging writer, and an able historiographer; he is also a philosopher. Earley's conclusions, based on prodigious research, are frank assessments of America, its peoples and its past, with clearly posted advisories for future heavy weather. Earley, provides 38 pages of notes supporting his positions and documenting historical references, all from good, solid sources, which he has skillfully assembled, organized and analyzed.The author pokes holes in gasbags, kicks some butt, and deflowers some heretofore virgin territory, as he tugs, drags, and then pushes the reader--perhaps kicking and screaming--into the revealing glare of truth. He probes such subjects as: Jews, their war records through history, and their penchant for censorship and control; Blacks, their crimes against Whitey, and upper-class WASPs, who cowered in Harvard and Yale during America's battles. The media, SAT scores, entertainment, religion, Ivy League schools, and Academe in general, are all bathed in Richard Earley's cleansing truth.What a delight it is to follow the author, as he plows into one after another of the wealthy, the famous or infamous, and the foolish in America's past, and in its present.The book is organized into 19 chapters beginning with \\"Pearl Harbor and Before,\\" running through \\"The War in Vietnam,\\" and concluding with \\"Religion and Morality in American Life.\\" These chapters are further divided up under various rubrics such as:Harvard at WarYale at WarAid to IsraelSense of Being JewishDraft Evaders and Other Tough GuysBooker T. WashingtonBlacks and CrimeThere is very little praise, pussyfooting, or reason to celebrate anywhere in this book, but Earley's research and documentation sustain his conclusions, and the truth of his message is almost palpable.Richard Earley is an iconoclast of sorts, and he did not set out to write a paean to folk heroes -- except that the men who fought and died in the Vietnam War hold a special place in his heart. This becomes clear upon reading the dedication of the book:Dedicated to the American dead of the Vietnam War.Their country and countrymen were unworthy of them.In Earley's view, the Jews are the most egregious transgressors, and he points out many reasons why other Americans have reason to question Jewish motives and behavior. Simply being Jewish in America has served to deflect criticism, for no matter how damning the evidence against a Jew, it is ignored by American's cultural elite. In addition, being a Jew in America has allowed many to ignore, even flout, standards of conduct, which others are obliged to meet.Earley points out that after the death of leftist journalist I. F. Stone, it was revealed that Stone was an agent of the Soviet KGB. In spite of the damning evidence, America's media and cultural arbiters ridiculed and vilified the man who brought this startling news to the attention of the general public: the very people who may have been harmed by the traitor. The elite preferred to ignore the traitorous behavior of I. F. Stone.Despite being found guilty by an American court, the guilt of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg has long been denied by their adherents. Their children can always rely on having letters published [in the \\"New York Times\\", and elsewhere] denying the truth of their parents having been Soviet spies. Thus, Earley shows how legitimate, well-earned criticism of Jews is \\"deflected\\" by their media sycophants.One example of a different \\"standard of conduct\\" for Jews involves a leading opinion maker, Richard Cohen, of the Washington Post. Cohen admitted that he does not support the principle of \\"proportional military response\\" where Israel is concerned, because Israel as a small country can not afford a war of attrition....However, the United States, Cohen thinks, is a populous and large country, which should adjust its military response, so that factors other than deterrence are considered. Apparently, on Richard Cohen's scales, the lives of Americans do not carry the same weight as the lives of his fellow Jews.The author believes that, historically, Jewish citizens and residents of America, have not only failed to serve America, but they seem bent on its destruction, for the benefit of Israel.Richard Earley's efforts in creating this book certainly establish him as a scholar. He frequently quotes, or discusses, such luminaries as: T. S. Eliot, Edgar Lee Masters, Rudyard Kipling, H. L. Mencken, Pat Buchanan, Ezra Pound, George Santayana, George Bernard Shaw, and others.Mr. Earley, himself, is not to be taken lightly when it comes to insightful, quotable observations and comments. Consider these remarks:Academia in America has long been notorious for its self-righteous declarations of concern and probity, while it has long been short on courage.The WASP hierarchy escaped the travails of the Civil War. They cowered in the campuses of Harvard and Yale.The drift from Euro-centric America to multiculturalism will not bring peace or happiness to the dominant Caucasians. They will react in increasingly violent ways.Mr. [William] Buckley has never understood the difference between an aristocracy that honors its obligations, most especially when its country is at war, and a plutocracy that feels money entitles its citizens to buy themselves out of danger and duty.\\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine is written for virtual illiterates, and it is published by a Jewish draft evader, who left his wife and kids to move in with a man.\\"War, Money and American Memory\\" is a remarkable work!

There were facts left out that intelligent readers should know were omitted that contradict certain findings.Sometimes the percentages and straight numbers were overkill to read.There were some very good and interesting points taken from other countries with solutions that were innovative, although the book seemed to determine that these were the 'correct' solutions and failed to factor in major differences in the societies and legal factors.There were good points and interesting reads, but the half-truths and seemingly purposely omitted information seemed to look for an uncrittical audience to persuade the reader to the left.

The other three are: The Psychoanalysis of Fire (1938), Water and Dreams (1942), and the two \\"earth\\" books (The Earth and Reveries of Rest (1946), The Earth and Reveries of Will (1948)). If the reader wants to see Bachelard the philsopher of imagination at work, Air and Dreams may be the best place to start, since it is here that he posits his philosphical positions a little more clearly and explores them in more depth than he does in other works.To Bachelard, imagination, as a fundamental psychic value, is what makes human freedom possible. To imagine is for our psyche to experience \\"openness\\" and \\"novelty,\\" and in this regard, imagiation and perception--habitual way of seeing things--are antithetical. As he writes in the Introduction: \\"Imagination allows us to leave the ordinary course of things ... To imagine is to absent oneself, to launch out toward a new life.\\" Such \\"form of human boldness,\\" however, is never an escapist lapse into fantasy, since to Bachelard the materialist, \\"the imaginary is immanent in the real\\" while \\"in the realm of the imagination transcendence is added to immanence.\\"Since the advent of psychoanalysis, sickness of normality or normality of sickness in our mental life are taken for granted. Everybody is neurotic, more or less. So, Freudian psychoanalysis is generally credited with revealing the dark recesses of human psyche, giving it the name of \\"unconscious,\\" and hence with accepting 'unreason' as a strong force in our mental life. But has it explained 'unreason' adequately? Bachelard says no. To him, the blindess of classical psychoanalysis is that it misses the \\"aesthetic\\" aspect of dreams. With its essentially rationalizing tendency, psychoanalysis usually turn dreams into a text of symbols, which in turn is made into an array of concepts. Hence, to rational psychoanalysts, dreams of flight always symbolize erotic desires, which can be explained with a variety of conceptual tools made for anayzing human sexuality and its repression.Limitations of such approach are obvious when we read, for instance, images of flight in Shelley's \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" or images of ascending, or conquering vertigo, in Nietzsche. All testaments to a profound and simple life, to the power of imagination as a liberating force, these images have little to do with the poets' voluptuous desires, repressed or not. Indeed, neurosis to Bachelard is essentially a mal-function of imagination. As he notes in the Introduction: \\"A person deprived of the function of the unreal is just as neurotic as the one deprived of the reality function. It could even be said that difficulties with the function of the unreal have repercussions for the reality function. If the imagination's function of openness is insufficient, then perception itself is blurred.\\"The chapter on Nietzsche (\\"Nietzsche and the Ascensional Psyche\\") would be of particular interest to Nietzsche students. Here we see how Bachelardian attention to imagination can reveal the hidden law at work behind the apparently accidental arrays of literary images. In the case of Nietzsche, his numerous images of conquest and domination, his intoxicated affirmation of will to power, were generally seen as indications of his megalomania, perhaps inevitable but still an uncomfortable aspect of his philosophy. Walter Kaufmann for instance thinks of such element as clearly an expression of Nietzsche's \\"snobbery\\" and \\"infatuation\\" with domination, which, he is quick to add, are perpetually sublimated and spiritualized. To Bachelard, these images of Nietzsche form an \\"experimental physics of the moral life,\\" which lets us experience an \\"accelerated becoming,\\" or \\"transformation of energy.\\" They are ones that faithfully follow the destiny of Nietzschean soul.With this tour-de-force chapter on Nietzsche, Air and Dreams has many more magical chapters, chapters on individual poets such as, yes, Shelley, and Poe, and more theme-oriented ones on \\"sky,\\" \\"clouds,\\" or \\"trees.\\" The book can be read as an implicit plea for curing the ills of modernity, and in this sense, would be read fruitfully together with such notable critics of modernity as Adorno, Benjamin, or even Lukacs."},{"Title":"Air and Dreams: An Essay on the Imagination of Movement (Bachelard Translation Series)","review":"If you've never been taught to fly, this is a great place to learn. Bachelard will show you how to discover your buoyancy, remove your reliance on the intellectual feathered wings of angels, and make a pure leap into thin air, supported only by dreams. It's one hell of voyage to take with this wonderful man. It's frequently bewildering, and oftentimes leaves one longing for the solid ground of a more traditional discourse. But if you can find your way through the poetic fog to meet Bachelard on his own terms, you may be lucky enough to rediscover the boundless terrain that is poesis, to unleash your imagination from intellect's grasp, and then discover verticality as you take flight in the metaphor that is subtle air, as I did.

The problem with the book is the author - his protestant and unorthodox Christian Faith. Protestantism is morbid Christianity, with teachers who do not communicate the fire of true Christianity. What I mean by this is the fact that they rely way too much on the human intellect to interpret the Bible. But the #1 main reason why Protestantism is faulty is because they have fallen away from Traditional, Ancient, Apostolic Eastern Orthodox Christianity and the Sacred teachings and canons. This Church has had 8 Ecumenical councils which have ONCE AND FOR ALL defined what Christianity is. The Protestants have over 25,000 different denominations who all preach different doctrines. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, and in all of TRUE Christianity, there is only one teaching and doctrine. Because this is the only Church of Jesus Christ, there is only one universal teaching and Faith. The Christian Faith is One confession and not a diverse number of confessions (like protestantism).Check out the Eastern Orthodox Church to understand what is apostolic, ancient, traditional Christianity.

Lossing, is a book virtually every American should be familiar with. Published originally in 1848, the book is indispensable to anyone who wants to know their nation's history.I can't say that I have much faith in the American school systems throughout the land. But considering the excellent public education I received in the 50's and 60's, most of the names in Lossing's work are unfamiliar to me. Obviously most of us are familiar with Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, etc. However, it is the less well known names that really tells the story of America's founding; how such a group could come together and put their individual desires aside for a greater good. The stories told in Lives of the Signers should set the example for our current batch of Congressman; many of whom won't make a decision without taking a poll.Lives of the Signers is also an example of the type of materials published once in this country.I highly recommend Lives of the Signers to every literate American.Peace to all."},{"Title":"LIVES OF THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE","review":"I was very impressed with the information provided in this book. One of the nice aspects of reading a piece such as this is the fact that as it was written in 1848,it was only around 64 or so years (1 full generation only) since the Revolution. Considering this fact, the information provided is pretty closely knit to the time frame of those men actually involved; thus the reader receives a sense of both a writing style and substantive endeavor of an author living in the era.The author isn't afraid of utilizing the current \\"politically incorrect\\" comparative label of just who led a \\"Christian\\" life, and each \\"signer\\" is placed in a light where his works are clearly presented; some of which might just surprise you.I would recommend this work to anyone seeking an excellent historical reference of The American Forefathers who sacrificed both their very lives and well being so we could have the blessings we enjoy in America today."},{"Title":"LIVES OF THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE","review":"This was a very impressive book.

Some of the conflicts continue to this day. And that is an important lesson. These men found the common ground that allowed them to stand as one and sign the declaration.

J. Lossing is a unique epic that traces the lives of fifty-seven of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. From John Adams , Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, to the lesser known men like Dr. Benjamin Rush. Lossing first published his book in 1848, a time when the new nation was young, and fresh. This book was used for many years in our country's public schools. I am pleased that this book is now available again from Wall Builders Press. Permit me to list just a few of the many men whose lives are sketched in this timeless volume.Josiah Barlett of New Hampshire 1729-1795William Whipple of New Hampshire 1730-1785Matthew Thornton of New Hampshire 1714-1803Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts 1744-1814All of these men were brilliant statesmen; they had a mind capacity that would far outreach many of our politicians today. These men understood law and government. Not only did they sign the Declaration, many drafted the U.S. Constitution years later. I believe this book belongs on every home-school family's shelf. This is a great read-aloud for the family because the short sketches are easy to follow, and it is very educational. There are many books like this one, for instance, A Worthy Company M. E. Bradford; however, Lives of the Signers is possibly the more in-depth. I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"LIVES OF THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE","review":"Ever wonder what happened to those men to which we, as Americans, are so deeply indebted who signed a document stating that they were willing to sacrifice their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor? Well, according to the historical accounts presented in this book, many of those men we commonly refer to as the Founding Fathers, actually did sacrifice greatly to help establish and preserve this great nation and the fact that far too little is known of their great sacrifices is a tragedy in itself.The book walks through the lives of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence in the order in which they signed - from the three delegates from New Hampshire to the signers from Georgia. Obviously some names are familiar such as John Hancock, John Adams, Samuel Adams, John Witherspoon, Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson. But little is known even about these great men regarding the extent of their personal sacrifice to the cause of this nation.However, the essence of this book is in examining the lives of those lesser known men who gave up just as much, some even more, in the cause of freedom. Men such as Dr. Matthew Thorton from New Hampshire, who interestingly enough was absent on the Fourth of July when the vote was taken on the adoption of the Declaration, but who, approving of the measure, was subsequently given an opportunity to sign it personally. Many of these men were imprisoned during the Revolutionary War and some even suffered tremendous financial distress as they served as the primary funding for the conflict - several never regained their pre-war financial status and some passed away penniless! Most of the men served in various elected offices following the Revolutionary War - from Governors of their newly created states, to Congressmen or Senators representing their state in the national government.The book is a wonderful historical display of the importance of these fifty-six men who stood in the gap from just a time as this and did what was necessary to confront and combat tyranny in the face of tremendous personal and professional hardship. It is an outstanding reminder to us all that the freedoms that we have an enjoy are not free - they came at great personal cost to many - and it should be a challenge to every American to continue to invest into the maintenance of this great vision for the world - the land of the free and the home of the brave."},{"Title":"LIVES OF THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE","review":"I really enjoy reading books from this era (1848) for several reasons. First the style interests me. Second the positive and negative characteristics are sharply different. For example many of the signers are stated to have been good examples of piety. I am forced to wonder what a modern writer would have to say in such regard.The topic of this work was also of great interest. One thing that struck me was the familiarity of the names. Counties streets, schools all sorts of things have very similar names. Also the amount that these men gave for all of us to enjoy what we do today is astounding.

The story has an inimitable style. There are various characters involved with the life of Karna and the author had brought them to life by actually making them tell their story. And the continuity about the life story of Karna is not lost. This is the wonderful part of narrating a story where each important character speaks to you and expresses his or her story, their roles. The story has really done a justice to the characters and the role model that Karna played in the great epic. This style of presenting a story I believe was first introduced by V. S. Khandekar in his Award winning novel &quot;Yayati&quot; (which is another stupendous novel). And was adopted by Shivaji Sawant. The best part of the story is the years of research that went in developing this story from a 4 thousand year old epic. The book presents the story in its best possible authentic form. It is hard not to lose yourself in the world created by the author which though thousands of years old is made contemporary by the human feelings and thoughts that are timeless. The characters in the book have not been glorified as pious heroes and helps to make it easier to identify to real world then to some mystic story. The great story telling power of Shivaji Sawant and his thought provoking underliners about the duties of man are an eye opener. This was the first Marathi novel that I read and fell in love with it and with it the Marathi literature.

When I started studying the history of AA I came across that list and am picking up some of them now. It is easy to see how the use of these spiritual works played a role in not only formulating the 12-step program but how the wording of the AA \\"Big Book\\" was influenced by those same works.

This book offered me something extra - and opened my eyes to a wonderful new truth - mainly this - that love is enough.Never having been trained in the social graces, I always felt like a bit of a clutz in social settings such as dinner parties and even simple get-togethers.Drummond makes the point that if you have love - if you can feel and express love - you have it all. So instead of focusing on which fork to use for the shrimp and salad, I started focusing on how much God loved me and everyone around me.And that little simple truth enabled me to feel more at ease in every circumstance and in every situation.Drummond's book is about grace, love, truth, Universal spiritual laws - it's got it all. From little things (like social graces) to big things (like loving our fellow man - irrespective of his lot in life) this book will change your life.This should be required reading for everyone."},{"Title":"THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD","review":"In response to the person who said this book was dangerous because it downplayed faith when compared to Love. Does he/she truly believe Faith is greater than Love??? Think about that! I would say that for once the author of this book had a real grasp on what Jesus stood for and if more people lived their life with the values in this book the world would be a much, much more peaceful and loving place.Too many people get side tracked with worrying about their faith and thinking everyone else needs a strong faith rather than practicing what really matters in life. What really matters to Jesus. In my opinion it's been too much emphasis on faith that has caused most of the problems in this world and not enough emphasis on simply loving your neighbor. The book teaches that it's not just about doing good deeds, but practicing love until it comes natural. In order to know God you must truly feel love flowing through you as a force so powerful you can't help but be profoundly moved.Drummond emphasizes that it takes an incredible amount of effort and time to truly learn how to love in a mature way. In the way God loves. If you practice Love and begin to truly feel Love and see the good you are doing in the world then most certainly a strong faith will follow. The only way to truly know God is to feel love, for God is love. Love comes first and faith second for without love as Paul's said &quot;...if I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love I am nothing.&quot;In my humble opinion this book truly is a masterpiece and perhaps the most powerful and beautiful book ever written. Jesus' teachings were simple not complex and if you own this book and follow it's simple teachings you will never need to open your Bible again. Yes, this book is more powerful than the Bible because the church did not corrupt it, and it expresses the simple teachings of Jesus to perfection.To have love in your heart is by far the greatest complement to God for God is love. The only problem is that if everyone had this book and followed its simple teachings it would put the TV evangelists and powerful churches out of business. The teachings of Jesus were simple and they are all you need."},{"Title":"THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD","review":"I read this book at least once a year to keep me focused on what's important in my life.

In my profession as a teacher, it really helped! I saw the troublesome kids with eyes of love, and their rebellion melted away. I am reading it again this year before school starts to get my head in the right place. Love is more important than being right. Love is more important than believing the right things. Love is more important than anything you say.

I have read 1 Corinthians 13 many times before, put I just thought of it as poetic. I never realized it tells us plainly LOVE is greater than faith and hope. Without love our faith and our hope is worthless junk. This book is an easy read, and short, but full of insight and intelligence. It gives the reader a new perspective on the greatest thing a Christian can have; LOVE"},{"Title":"THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD","review":"This book has been a treasured friend since it was given to me as a gift many years ago. Drummond, a nineteenth century Christian missionary, lays out his case that Love is the key ingredient to a successful life with precision, logic and eloquence. Usually a logical approach fails to stir one's soul but his writing is as beautiful as it is persuasive. It is also an urgent message for us as individuals and as a society. We cannot call ourselves Christians if Love is subsumed by self-righteousness, hatred and judgement.

The authors reveal a past that is not at all smooth. The challenges of settling this land and building a new nation are shown in their harsh reality. Equally, the faith that strengthened the people for these challenges is presented as inspiration for tomorrow's citizens and leaders. Review questions in the back of the book helped my children explore their own values and beliefs about their country. There could be no better way to raise responsible citizens than to have them investigate our Christian heritage through this book."},{"Title":"The Light and the Glory for Children : Discovering God's Plan for America from Christopher Columbus to George Washington","review":"This book is a must read for children to get a proper perspective of history.

Children love it, but best of all, it tells history accurately while filling in the gaps that a secular education edits out. Religion was an important part of everyday life for Columbus, Washington, Franklin. Secular education takes an atheistic viewpoint and cannot mention this, leaving huge gaps and partial truths.

This is our text book this year, companioned with the activity book."},{"Title":"The Light and the Glory for Children : Discovering God's Plan for America from Christopher Columbus to George Washington","review":"As a devout Christian, I am appalled at how casually the authors \\"speak for God.\\" The book is rife with examples of where the authors report an historic event or circumstance . . . and then speak authoritatively about why--from God's perspective--the event happened.The guiding framework behind the authors' interpretation is simplistic and arbitrary. Most of the time it seems they are operating under an extremely simplistic system where Bad Circumstances = God's Judgment. (This is, of course, horrible theology, as some very bad things happened to Jesus and to the Apostle Paul in the course of their ministries--beatings,crucifixion, shipwrecks, etc.) But sometimes they report bad circumstances and claim that the people involved were actually blessed by God, and were merely experiencing a setback. For example, in chapter two, an American-bound ship is beset with storms, and the authors write, \\"God had been with them.\\" In chapter four, another American-bound ship is beset with storms, but this time the authors state that this trip was attempted \\"without God's blessing.\\" Same circumstance, different conclusion. I want to know where Marshall and Manuel are getting this very special insight into the mind of God. In the absence of any explanation, are we just supposed to believe that Marshall and Manuel are divinely inspired? (Perhaps so: in the final chapter, they state that the Constitution is divinely inspired.)Even if the authors get all their historical facts right, I can't stomach the implied theology, which is chaotic and irreverent."},{"Title":"The Light and the Glory for Children : Discovering God's Plan for America from Christopher Columbus to George Washington","review":"Great and educational book.

I bought it for my daughter, who is homeschooling her children."},{"Title":"The Light and the Glory for Children : Discovering God's Plan for America from Christopher Columbus to George Washington","review":"This is a children's adaptation of the 1977 adult book \\"The Light and the Glory\\" which attempts to prove (or just assume) that the United States is the New Israel, (and thus entitled to special blessings and privileges as God's special nation) and the founding fathers were a bunch of card carrying Evangelicals. In 1999 at Wheaton College, which is a well-respected Evangelical liberal arts college, we spent three days in our political science class addressing just a fraction of the numerous historical and theological errors that this book presents as truth. The professors thought this was necessary since so many of the students from Christian and homeschool backgrounds had been fed this nonsense since childhood.I was very disappointed to see that Sonlight, a major Evangelical homeschooling curriculum provider, has added this book to their third grade history core. Parents should be aware that unlike most of Sonlight's selections, which manage to stay away from overt national/political and denominational bias, this book is pervasively and blatantly biased. I found its theology completely untenable and sometimes offensive. The most basic principles of biblical exegesis and hermeneutics are routinely violated to bolster their outrageous claims that Americans are the new chosen people. If parents are going to read this with their children, they should also check out Mark Noll's \\"The Search for Christian America\\" to help address the skewed perspective that this book presents. It may be a \\"Christian\\" version of American history, but that does not make it accurate."},{"Title":"The Light and the Glory for Children : Discovering God's Plan for America from Christopher Columbus to George Washington","review":"The adult version of this book changed my whole understanding of the Pilgrims and I've loved having the children's version in my homeschool.

I recommend it highly for the lion lovers in your life."},{"Title":"Modern Times: Journey Through History","review":"When you see the cover of this Journey Through History volume is about \\"Modern Times,\\" but shows a couple of people dressed in what you would think of as clothing from the period of the American Revolution, you might do a double-take. But for Gloria & Oriol Verges \\"Modern Times\\" means the 17th and 18th centuries. The series consists of six books written for young readers that are designed to encourage their interest in the study of history. Originally published in Spain (\\"Edad antigua\\"), these books do provide a slightly different perspective on the past that you get from American historians. \\"Modern Times\\" is the fifth volume, following \\"Prehistory to Egypt,\\" \\"The Greek and Roman Eras,\\" \\"The Middle Ages,\\" and the \\"Renaissance.\\" What the Verges do is to follow groups of children during a specific period as a way of touching on topics of historical interest and significance.So it is that we have a couple of young children growing up in France, Holland, England, America, and Spain (France gets the most mention). The book starts off with the notion of absolute monarchies and ends with the Industrial Revolution, so it only touches on the radical transformation of societies during these two centuries. Other points covered are Baroque art and music, the rise of the European bourgeoisie (without using the word \\"bourgeoisie\\"), the new theories of French philosophers, the birth of North America, daily life in the 18th century, the great political change in France, and the applications of the steam engine, which led to the Industrial Revolution.The focus on these books is more on defining elements of the culture and reinforcing those, than providing lots of details, so the value here is as supplemental volumes to your main classroom history textbook. If anything, this particular volume keeps things rather too general in the main text, which makes it the weakest one I have read to date. Compare the two-page spreads in the book with the elements covered in the guide for parents and teachers in the back, and you will learn more there because there are more specific discussions of things like Baroque music. The final volume in the Journey Through History series is devoted to \\"The Contemporary Age.\\" All six of the books are written by the Verges, with Carme Peris illustrating the even numbered books, and Maria Rius providing the art for the odd numbered volumes, including this one."},{"Title":"Modern Times: Journey Through History","review":"The Renaissance book is the best, then the Middle Ages, the the Greeks, and then this one is last as far as interest level goes.

Now she is the headmistress of a school his niece badly needs to attend so both are on their best behavior but the attraction and their history remain volatile.The latest Treadwell Regency romance, THE AFFAIR, is an enjoyable tale that sub-genre readers will appreciate as the plot is freshened by starring the headmistress countess as the lead female protagonist. Though the chasm between Christiane and Gannon opens at nuclear weapon meltdown rapidly depletes into a fly swatter, readers will still take delight in the relationship between them.

Most of the book is just payment tables, which you could easily calculate yourself using a calculator.The book has summaries at the end of each chapter, which are not useful at all. For example, in the first chapter about choosing the right car or truck, part of the summary reads \\"If you are buying a truck, make sure it has a rear bumper.\\" What? First, the chapter never said anything about bumpers, so that's hardly a summary. Second, in a chapter about choosing vehicles, is this really a salient point?The organization of the book is really hard to follow.

The plot is simple and compelling, and the portrait of a normal person being twisted by obsession and a desire to escape his mundane life was believably drawn. I picked up Littleford's second book (Death Duty) on the strength of this one.Oh, and to the reviewer who said the book would have been better had the protagonist been a lesbian: If you'd read the book carefully, you might have realized that the turning point in the story (I won't spoil it by saying what it was) hinges on the main character being male.

Instead, it's the AUTHOR'S THINING STYLES AND PROCESSES that impress me most. The author explcitly, and skillfully, articulates how he came up with each idea in the book. This makes me, as a reader, feel that I was having a face-to-face conversation with the author when reading. The author analyzed his own thinking processes like an open book(just an analogy here, don't take it literally hehe), like a psychology surgeon dissecting his own thoughts. Also, the readers may not only benefit from the concrete knowledge from the book, but also, more importantly, from improving the readers own thinking abilities by modelling the author's.

Huang and \`Statistical Mechanics' by S.K. Ma. In my opinion, most books on the elementray principles, including the book by K. Huang, are too complicated for beginners. The best treatments as far as I know are given by \`Statistical Physics, part I' by Landau and Lifshize and the one by S.K. Ma. Another weak points in Huang's book are the discussions about ideal quantum gases. It presents formal mathematical methods to study this problem. I think that this approach is also too complicated for beginners and sometimes bury the relevant physical ideas. In this part, the best treatment for the ideal Bose gas is given by \`Statistical mechanics' by T.D. Lee (in Chinese), and for the ideal Fermi gas given by S.K. Ma.For these parts, I should give 3 stars. However, the strong parts of Huang's book is the chapters on the advanced topics. The writting is compact and clear. They can be served as a good introduction to the modern theory of critical phenomena and superfluidity. Further, they are useful references for research. In addition, the formal manipulation for quantum ideal gases is necessary for research though it seems a little bit complicated for students. For all these, I gave 4 stars to this book.Finally, I should say that the approach of Huang's book is not based on the kinetic theory though it spends a few chapters on this aspect. The reason why the kinetic theory is put before the chapters on SM, in my opinion, is to emphasize the important role played by collisions between particles to establish thermal equilibrium and the validity of the basic assumption of SM, as indicated by S.K. Ma in his book. I think previous reviews about this are misleading."},{"Title":"Statistical mechanics","review":"I just completed a class taught from Huang. It was rocky. If this is your first time through a serious stat mech class, you have difficulty with thermodynamics, or you are the sort of person that learns by doing, then this probably isn't the book for you.That being said, if you have a strong background in stat mech and thermo, you'll probably find Huang quite enlightening. Huang's approach isn't the most pedagogically sound, but he is more insightful than most. (In the sense of what he presents, not necessarily how he presents it.)Additionally, while there are errors in the book, there aren't so many that it makes it unreadable -- the book is hard to read based on its own construction.I managed to do well in the course, but it was by constantly referencing other books. If this is your first time through, I recommend reading the material of the current chapter in another book first, running a couple of example problems from that book, and then reading through Huang. It seemed to work better as a reference into usually uncovered topics than as a textbook. The first few chapters on thermodynamics and (non-quantum) statistical mechanics are probably best learned from another source."},{"Title":"Statistical mechanics","review":"As repeated by reviewers below, this is NOT STANDARD textbook on statistical mechanics because it stresses the kinetic theory.

It is more usual the case that a statistical approach is adopted, in which the canonical (or other) ensemble is arrived, and subsequent results somehow refer back to the the ensembles. Huang seems to wish to proceed from a strongly microscopic and kinetic point of view. There must be great strength in his approach, as statistical phenomena, in reality, is built up from this semi-classical sort of physics. If you like kinetic theory, then buy it. However, for those of us who find more comfort in relating to a more statistical approach, this book is fearsomely unreadable.But do read it for a description of the Boltzmann Transport equation."},{"Title":"Statistical mechanics","review":"I would suggest that the previous reviewer get him/herself a tutor.

First of all, there is a very nice exposition of Lars Onsager's own solution of the 2D Ising model which I found easy to follow. The book also contains a nice illustration of renormalization ideas with the 1D Ising model.

The book was almost immediately translated into Russian which emphasizes its significance."},{"Title":"Statistical mechanics","review":"I am an undergraduate mathematics student and I have been assigned this book for a third year SM course. It's not perfect, but I am really enjoying it and find the style terse yet clear, and fairly thorough (most of the questions which arise in my mind are covered in the text). There have been a few points where I didn't get the proofs, but on the whole I have found it extremely useful (and much better than my lecturer). I really don't get people's problem with this book. Someone said that it lacks physical explanations. This is supposed to be an advanced mathematical theory. If you don't appreciate rigorous proofs of conclusions and prefer handwaving and reams of empty text saying the same thing in 50 different ways then put this book down and go play in a sandpit."},{"Title":"Statistical mechanics","review":"Huang approaches the subject as a series of proofs: he does not make physical arguments, and his writing is wooden. Instructors--avoid this book!Some have said that this book approaches stat mech from the refreshing view of kinetic theory. But it leaves out the Fokker-Planck and Langevin approaches, by which the Boltzmann equation is usually solved. Anyone interested in this approach would be *far* more rewarded by Landau's Physical Kinetics.Anyone interested in Gibbs theory should consult Landau or Sommerfeld.Anyone who wants good problems (and real applications) would be better served by the canonical McQuarrie.Anyone who wants a feel for what the subject *actually now is* should see Kadanoff or Chandler. Actually I think allowing students to leave stat mech without seeing the monte carlo algorithm or solving a stochastic equation is a crime."},{"Title":"Statistical mechanics","review":"The reviewer below who said that this book pursues primarily a kinetic theory - Boltzmann Transport Equation approach, got it right. It really is a fearsome, and by and large, pointless read. Our professor used this book in our stat. mech. class back in 1992. He also used Mahan's Many Particle Physics book in our solid state course and de Genne's Superconductivity text in our superconductor course, so that gives you an idea of what kind of person likes Huang. Most students I've talked to feel that this text is the worst sort of student pain. The pain you feel when after exerting colossal effort trying to understand, you realize at the end of the semester that you didn't learn anything, and that you could have, if only the instructor had chosen one of any number of better books. I am completely mystified as to why and how this book has reached a 3rd edition. Perhaps there are too many physics professors out there who don't care about pedagogy."},{"Title":"Statistical mechanics","review":"This is a so called &quot;minimalist textbook&quot; where derivations and discussions are brief outlines. Great frustration descends upon the individual who seeks to labor through every derivation and develop a meaningful understanding of the subject. Such a difficult subject deserves more careful and thorough treatment than that which Huang gives. The book is almost completely devoid of examples and worked out problems. The only positive aspect of this book is the range of topics covered. I suspect this is the reason Huang is used as a text at many graduate programs. Statistical mechanics is a discipline desperately in need of a good text book. I would however recomend a book by Greiner. Greiner does not cover all of the topics that Huang does but it is an excellent text."},{"Title":"Statistical mechanics","review":"We are using Huang in Physics 262 (Statistical Physics).

But, I will tell you a few things which might come in handy:The book is utterly confusing and baffling. While most other physics textbooks explain things poorly, you can usually still pick up at least a few things from them. As you can see by my review of Jackson's \\"Electrodynamics\\", I have no love for that book.This book makes Jackson look like Shakespeare.I used the book in a one-semester graduate level class while I was working on my PhD at one of the top ten physics programs in the US.I don't know how to explain this, but let me try:Physics is hard, OK? Typically, you might read something in a grad level textbook and not get a darn thing the first time. Then you start slowly and go line by line, and slowly understanding comes upon you. The reason it happens this way is because you, the reader, don't understand the physics at first, but the author of the book does. As you focus and think on the text, you gradually understand.With this book, it doesn't matter how long or how diligently you focus on the text--- you won't understand. The reason for that in this case is because the text is utterly illogical, pedagogically terrible, filled with baffling nonsequiturs, and so disconnected from physical reality that it seems like a math textbook.See, the thing is, though, it's NOT a math textbook-- because math textbooks use logic and deductive reasoning. This book is just a bunch of really badly-done math-like gibberish, both disconnected from physics as well as logic.It is utter garbage.Please, professors, the only reason you should be assigning this book to your students is if you all need some kindling for the end of semester bonfire. That way you can at least use it to demonstrate an experimental example of Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics.That is the only useful purpose to which it can possibly be put."},{"Title":"Statistical mechanics","review":"The worst part about this book is not that the text is unclear. It's not that Huang glosses over important topics. It's not even the uncreative problems at the end of each chapter. THE TEXT IS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS.

In page 82 there is a funny formula, which says &quot;log n! = n log n - 1&quot;, and I will assume that this is what all the previous reviewers have been talking about. Now, in the first place, does anybody really think that Kerson would spend ink writing that &quot;-1&quot;, thinking that somehow it improved his approximation? No way! It must be a typo. I believe that no one who writes a book on stat mech can look at this funny formula without a shudder, or maybe an urge to laugh. Second, there is no mistake in the derivation that appears in page 82 and leads to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The Stirling approximation is used to transform log N! - log n1! - log n2! - log n3! - .... into N log N - n1 log n1 - n2 log n2 - n3 log n3.... (I apologize for my cumbersome typography) Here is the way to do it. Use the correct form of the approximation, &quot;log n! = n log n - n&quot; , and remember that &quot;n1 + n2 + n3...= N&quot;.

It is written in an unusual way. And much of the text consists in her citations of what other family members have said. It tells the story of her family in Turin, and goes up through her adult life. It is also unusual in that she does not really give her opinion of anything or anyone directly, or probe deeply into herself in any way. In the brief preface she makes it clear that she is engaged in an act of exact remembering. And she says that she has used all the names , the real names of the people in the story.The two major characters are her parents, the father who is Jewish by origin by not by religious practice, is a scientist and engineer. He is a lover of mountaineering, and a man who seems to have no idea of how to make or deal with money. He is violently opinionated, and his outbursts are one central strand in the memoir. The mother is a different soul entirely, a happy person by nature whose best friend is Ginzburg's older sister, but who brings a tone of understanding to all her five children. The story is of the five siblings also, and their eventual careers and marriages. And it is also of the extended family. And in the latter part of the book there is a lot about anti- Fascist activity of family and friends. The work has a kind of authenticity that comes not only from the ' sayings' but from its matter- of- fact descriptive and objective tone. The problem with this, and I feel with Ginzburg's voice in the work is that it is not personally deep enough, and not somehow loving enough. But again there is a texture of great richness, a feeling that what is being described is a whole world. And then too there are so many incidents and events, so many happenings that the reader has a sense of seeing life ' as it really happens'.This work gives a great deal. There is a certain sense however, and perhaps I am wrong here, of it somehow not getting to the deepest depth , of its holding aloof from where the heart is. One great example is the way Ginzburg talks of her first husband. She speaks of him as if he were just another character in the whole story.Nonetheless the reader of this review should know that my review does not begin to touch upon the many characters, events and true complexity of the work.This is a worthwhile and meaningful book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Cancer Dictionary","review":"Everything you need to know about cancer is in this book. I am a CTR(Certified Tumor Registrar) and I work with cancer patients charts daily and I have used this as a resource a lot! Great book to buy!"},{"Title":"The Cancer Dictionary","review":"This book is so much easier to have on hand than a Nurses reference book. It simply and directly defines just about all cancer terms and most diseases. It also has a reference section in the back that gives you addresses and phone numbers of important cancer organizations. I like how quick and simple it is to use. More pictures and drawings would be nice. But the ones they used were the most important ones for me. Don't leave this one off your list."},{"Title":"The Cancer Dictionary","review":"This book is an indispensable tool in anyone's efforts to better understands cancer treatment terminology. With this book I also highly recommend another cancer book I found at amazon.com. &quot;World Without Cancer&quot; Especially to the cancer sufferer, these books helped our fight with cancer. We found the information we needed to make educated decisions about treatment."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"i absolutely love this book. i read it when i was in elementary school and i thought it was great! it's mysterious and thrilling and i definitely recommend it! (: one of Christopher Pike's best books. also check out Monster by Christopher Pike."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Quite simply, this is the most amazing book I've EVER read. It had everything a horror fan could ever want. Definitely a must read. The characters are described so carefully and with great detail. I'm speechless. You've just GOT to read this book for yourself."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I was never that much into horror books until i read this. I stayed up the entire night to finish this book because i was dying to know what happened to Roxanne. While i was reading this suspenseful novel i felt like i was going through everything with Rox, it was totally creepy. The ending was totally creepy in a way. You've got to read this book.It is one of Pike's best."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I started reading Christopher Pike books when I was 15yrs.old and in the eighth grade, now I am 22yrs of age and still reading Mr. Pike's wonderful novels. This book, I really liked because it kept me reading and reading. It also kinda... like spooked me out, like what is around the next corner or ben. You could just feel what was going on. The book drawed a person inside,right to the inner core of a person's imagination, well, Mr Pike that is. Very well written Mr. Pike. I think Mr. Pike should write another novel &quot;Whisper of Death II.&quot;"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Christopher Pike's Whisper of Death was the scariest book I've personally ever read. Not only that, but unlike other horror books churned out at an impossibly reeling pace by one author, this book proves itself to be intelligent, beguiling, and EXTREMELEY scary. Also, the storyline is fresh and original. I am not at all a usual reader of horror, but you big time horror fans will immediatley recognize how free of cliche's is this story. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"After watching the miniseries &quot;The Stand&quot; by Stephen King, I was enthralled by the end of the world theme and tried to find a book that wasn't as long as the &quot;The Stand&quot;. I found this one. I had been a fan even before this book, but with the whole theme of &quot;no one's around&quot; it gave me endless chills and hope he gives more and more chills."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and that's really saying a lot. I read it when I was 11 and I am still a fan at 18. This is very mature book disguised as a young adult novel. Very adult themes are discussed, which makes it so much more real. The twists are creative and unpredictable. There aren't many books out there that can get a true emotional response after reading them, but this is one of them. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I read this book several years ago and I loved it! The ending was a real shocker, I would never have expected it! This was the first book I read by Pike and its my favorite!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"This book must be read more than once to catch all the foreshadowing.The ending,when you realize who the real villain is,is quite shattering and very terrifying."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I'm a fan of Mr.Pike. This was one of the best books he's written! The only reason I gave it four stars was because the end was hard to understand.
