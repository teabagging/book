After all, she was a grown woman - a college graduate, married to a man she loved, and the mother of a small daughter - when that happened. Sometimes the memories seem faded, though; and sometimes she can't afford to let herself dwell on them. This reality is so very different, and so very dangerous for those who don't submit to its demands.Her husband was divorced, so in the eyes of Gilead's God (who doesn't recognize second marriages) she's a loose woman in need of rescue. Since she still has viable ovaries, that rescue takes the form of retraining for life as a handmaid. A baby machine, assigned to one of Gilead's powerful \\"Commanders\\" whose Wife cannot bear children. Even Wives are no longer allowed to hold jobs, control money, or read and write. Women in this society exist only to service men, in one manner or another. Handmaids are nothing more than walking wombs. With even her name taken away (\\"Offred\\" being literally \\"Of Fred\\" - an appellation she'll leave behind when her posting to this particular Commander's household ends), the narrator of this bleak and frightening novel struggles to keep herself alive on all the levels that matter.Although I'm told the author denies she intended to write a work of speculative fiction, I can see why THE HANDMAID'S TALE is sometimes called a companion piece to Robert A. Heinlein's REVOLT IN 2100. However, Atwood's dystopia combines elements of several different Fundamentalist movements (including clear Muslim echoes); while Heinlein's future U.S. traces direct roots to Christian Fundamentalism. There are many more differences than the obvious one of viewpoint, between Atwood's 30-something female protagonist and Heinlein's innocent young hero.I often wanted to put this book down, but couldn't. Disturbing yet brilliant, it calmly charts the many ways in which women can be set against each other once their personhood had been taken away. That, more than anything else, makes this one of the scariest works of fiction I've read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Great read. Looking at a scary future that could happen. Thje only criticism, I wanted more. It ended to abrupt."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book she be included with some of the great sci-fi books of our time. It shows a scary dystopic future in which fundamentalism is allowed to flourish here in America. It is a great warning tale about the subjugation of women under such fundamentalism as that in the Western Judeo-Christian tradition when taken to extremes."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A great story although quite unsettling at times. A story, set in the future, about a want to be perfect society gone wrong. About the control of many by a few. An unknown society for most Americans (other than our political system) but probably not so far off for other current societies around the world."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Very good narration, taking the reader back and forth to the past and present of the protagonist and also to the facts and the feelings. Also an approach to an ethical dilemma faced by certain societies, not only in fiction..."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"When we were assigned this book for my English class, my first thought was one of interested. I, like many, have always heard of the \\"Great Canadian Author Margaret Atwood\\", and I eagerly began to read the book. As I waded my way through awkward prose, and over symbolic plot devises, I came to realize that if this was a \`great Canadian author' I shudder to think what the not so great are like. I found it rather odd that the only form of rebellion the \`enslaved' women took was swearing, thinking and committing sexual activities, and dreaming about beauty products. To think that in a book with such strong feministic undertones that these would be the only dreams, thoughts, and activities of women who are denied such things as reading, and the pursuit of knowledge, seems almost as flawed as the prose she uses to declare them. I was greatly disappointed at Margaret Atwood's writing, and wonder why the truly great Canadian authors, such as say Robertson Davies, are not made a larger part of the education system. In short this was one of the largest disappointments I have come across in my lifetime, and look with fear towards the next of her books I will be forced to read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Atwood deserves to be on the Wall. Just kidding, but basically, the book put me to sleep. I disliked the way she kept flashing back and forth between her memories and the present time. The ending left you hanging, which I REALLY HATED. If I hadn't been forced to read it, I never would have given it a second glance. The movie is better."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book was flat and boring! I hated the character especially Offred. I don't know what message Atwood was trying to send and by the end of the book I didn't care."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Before reading this, you should know that this book is extremely anti-Christian, and full of nonsense. This is a future world where very few women are fertile, and \\"Christian\\" religious right men are in charge. Because so few women can have children, those who can are used as \\"handmaids\\"-essentially, they have babies for the men and their sterile wives. Now, there is no mention in this novel of why egg donors and implantation aren't used, or why fertility treatments aren't employed. There are also women used as prostitutes-those who are defiant about the existing order. This is a paranoid feminist novel, one completely unlikely to happen, and one that will piss you off to read. It isn't even a good story. I had to read this for school and hated every minute of it. There is no truth in it, just a rallying cry for NARAL. If you're conservative like me, skip it. It will only make you angry."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The story, IMO, tries too hard to gross out the reader. Plot is all over the place, and though I have read more than 60 percent of the novel on my Kindle Fire, that's the best I can do. I enjoyed the frequent wordplay in the novel, but that couldn't carry me through the whole novel."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"For some reason I found this book kind of boring. I understand her life was boring, and that all she had to look forward to was a sneaky romance. The reality of this to ever happen in the future is unrealistic. It's a story to be easily forgotten."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I had to read this book for english class at school. I reallydidn't like it. I found it confusing how offred went back and forthfrom present time to her old life. It was disgusting how she discribed the ritual for her to get pregnant. What kind of author would actually write about beig a handmaid, especially if it's not true? I heard there's a movie that's based on the book, and they end different. Thank goodness the commander doesn't die in the book like the movie, that would have made me hate this book more. I can't believe people would actually enjoy this book. I think your ratin was rather high, seeing as it's kind of a strange topic."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Perhaps the most frightening book I have ever read.Should be required reading."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book has been out for some time, and I expect the plot may have been scoffed at by some when first released on the grounds that \\"it will never happen.\\" I won't summarize the plot here, as other reviewers have done so already.Reading the book now, in the context of the current administration (c. 2005) and the rise of fundamentalism in the US, it's clear the book's plot is closer than you think.Here's one small, but jarring example: the handmaids in the book shop for their robes and veils at a 'lilies of the field' store. A store very much like this, with the same name, already exists in the US - it even has a web site.Read the book for what might be a preview of the future of the US."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Neither subtlety nor realism necessarily rank among the most important ingredients of a successful polemic, but one largely devoid of both cannot claim much merit. Having said that, it is just about possible to read Atwood's book against itself as a parody of a certain sort of contemporary American feminist writing.The saddest thing about 'The Handmaid's Tale' is that Atwood is clearly a highly intelligent, educated and cultured individual. She *must* know *herself* that 'HT' is ludicrously over the top. Why on earth she chose to offer it to a publisher remains a mystery to me."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I have recommended this book to everyone around me. Though the story was only so-so, the beauty of how it was written made this a must-read.What are you waiting for?

But as a story, it took me a little while longer to get through than most books. It's plot kind of drops off into a lull in the middle. Just not what I expected."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Of course this is a classic. It is a lot for all women to think about, and will definitely put you in touch with your inner feminist, no matter how it might be buried these days.

It's a stunning combination of absolutely amazing social commentary and just plain fascinating fiction. I sound like I'm gushing, I know, but this book really is that good. If you've never read Atwood, start with this one; if you've never read it and don't like some of Atwood's other work, read this anyway. It's wonderful, and very eye-opening. Just read it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book took me 3 days to finish... over a one year period, that is how long it took to continuously muster the willpower to finish it. I don't know where to begin with what's wrong with this book, a much shorter list would be what is actually good about it and that is the few pages between Offred discovering the fate of her fellow handmaid Ofglen and discovering her own fate. But even this is problematic, much like the characters and the entire plot, this occurrence is underdeveloped and hurried. This book might as well have been a series of unrelated short stories, as each chapter is somewhat disjointed from the next. Simply put: Muddled use of flashback, rubbish ending with no closure to the preceding sequence of events and overall no perceivable plot. In addition to a painstakingly slow buildup to some sort of anti-climax at the very end of the book, with an abrupt ending leaving many unanswered questions."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read because of a book club that I am a member.

(Copied from my Goodreads review)"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I didn't think it was that great. Atwood is a good writer, and there are some beautifully written passages in the book. Overall it was hard for me to get through. Mostly, the lack of logic in the plot annoyed me. And I got really sick of the narrator character. Basically the whole book takes place inside her imagination, which is a place I would rather not be. She didn't seem very smart, and I thought she was a pretty boring and weak person. Also, I'm not a big fan of reading about racey infidelity.Also, I prefer stories about people attempting to fix their problems instead of just whining about them. I know that negative stories can often teach us things. But I don't feel I gained much more than a headache from reading this particular story."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book has been made into a cheesey \\"opera\\". That should tell you everything you need to know about this book.The plot follows. An extremist religious group gains control of the US military and overthrows our government. They then establish their own theocracy where women have no rights and they persecute members of other religious groups, not much unlike modern day Iran (2002). If you don't know why this is not very imaginative and laughably impossible you need to spend more time in reality and less time in fantasy land."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I've read 1984, Brave New World, Utopia, Catch-22, Fahrenheit 451, Slaghterhouse 5, A Clockwork Orange and dozens maybe even hundred's of other books. From classics like War and Peace to A Tale of Two Cities to modern writers like Micheal Crichton and Carl Hiasson. Through all these books it has been a rarity to put one down and not finish it. Well here is one that is a waste of time. If I wanted to paint a picture based off of the main characters life her descriptions would suffice. I was hoping for an exciting journey to a future world that would have me turning page after page. Instead I have endless ranting's about pointless jibberish, that add's little if anything to the story. It's boring, dull and and doesn't seem to go anywhere. I've only heard and read postive things about this book, so maybe I was just expecting too much. I would like to point out that few books would inspire me to write about them in a negative light so this is not common for me. I made it to page 140 and I just couldn't take anymore, it seemed to be a waste of time and truly not fulfilling. However, if it suddenly picks up pace and turns into the page turner I thought it would be, I do apologize. Although at this point the only way I think that book could pick up pace is if you threw it from an airplane. Out of all the books I've read probably less than five were written by females, books like this one reinforce why I stick with reading male written material. Wait now, before you send me too much hate mail I would like to add that one of the very best books I've ever read was Atlas Shrugged by Aynn Rand. It may be the best written word I've read next to the Holy Bible. I just couldn't let some readers know that this book isn't all it's hyped up to be. I may have missed the point but I doubt it since, as you can tell, I'm kind of a fan of the genre!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This novel is not a work of genius designed to make you think.

However this book actually reveals a thriving subculture of feminist underground revolt. In a way, I think, it parallels our own society. Seriously, how many female generals do YOU know? Oh, zero? Precisely. And I bet the male ones you know have mistresses. PRECISELY. The society depicted in this book is supposed to be an &quot;extreme&quot;.

It seems as if all our culture revolves around anymore is sex and having a Junior English class read it just validates that statement further.

In the near future after some cataclysmic war, a major part of United States is controlled by some fundamentalist Christian regime. The book deals with many frightening and disturbing aspects of that regime, but the most extensively with the policies that are designed to control and exploit women. Due to some unspecified environmental factor, most women are infertile and the few that are still capable of childbearing are held in captivity under the conditions that are a cross between a prison and a convent. The book is told from the point of view of one of these women, the so called \\"handmaids,\\" and the first-person narrative is a major factor that contributes to the overall chilling effect of this book.For the most part the book is an interesting and suspenseful work of fiction. The reader is genuinely interested in the travails of the protagonists, and is eager to read more after each completed chapter. Unfortunately, the ending of the story leaves a lot to be desired, and a lot of loose ends are left untied. From that point, the book does not achieve all that it could conceivably accomplish and with a more satisfying plotline this could have really been a major literary achievement.I think that the main reason that the book does not completely work as a cohesive narrative is that it might have originated as an exercise in the worst-case fears stemming from a feminist ideological viewpoint. As such it is very interesting, as the worst case scenarios almost universally are, and Margaret Atwood managed to create an interesting narrative and character to personify individuals functioning under such extreme conditions. However, I feel that just expanding on those ideas may not be enough for a fully structured plotline."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is a great dystopian read that I discovered through my sister. She had to read it in high school and when my school never assigned it I got curious.After a military coup creating the Republic of Gilead from the once powerful United States of America, inhabitants find themselves in a strict, domineering caste system based on the hell, fire, & brimstone from the Old Testament of the Bible. They believe that all their problems (rampant infertility, land deterioration, and an amoral society) can all be solved by returning to their close-minded roots.What this means in practice for the men and women of Gilead is a complete overhaul of their social hierarchy as they know it. Now, your place in society is determined by your rank within the new infrastructure and the power you wield. Women are even lower in this caste system, as dictated by the ruling body and their twisted sense of ideology, and are subservient to the male figure in their life. While this isn't necessarily awful for most women, for those who belong to the \\"handmaid\\" class it is a nightmare. They are used for breeding purposes only, as if they were an animal.This story is told from the point of view of Offred, a handmaid in Commander Fred's home. As a first generation handmaid, Offred knows what the world used to be like. She used to have a family, consisting of her, her husband, and their child. Now all she is solely cogniscent that it is her \\"duty and obligation\\" is to bear a child for the Commander and his barren wife Serena Joy. A mating ritual, involving all three participants, takes place monthly in the hopes of conception.Offred moves about her daily routine often catching glimpses of things hinting at the existence of a resistance. She is shocked to discover who all is involved. And when the times comes for her to make a decision, she moves with fluidity in her chosen direction.A shocking and scandalising tale, this book was a bewitching read. I found myself imagining what it would be like to be in Offred's shoes more often than I wanted to. Her life was quite a miserable existence, but she maintained hope. She clung to memories in her darkest hours and pushed on with life.It's truly a book about feminism in that the main character is a female fighting in a patriarchal and orthodox society. Her strength and courage is a testament to the power that resides in all of us. We just have to call on it. A mesmerizing read that most will find haunting and captivating, The Handmaid's Tale is a classic."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I love to support Canadian authors any way I can because as is any media outlet in Canada, it's completely overshadowed by the American market. This over-saturation means less money is put into developing anything Canadian. That being said I love Margaret Atwood and enjoy most of her books (by most I mean you can forget about The Blind Assassin. I've tried picking up at least 10 times and can't get past the first 50 pages), but this is her absolute BEST! No doubt about it, the world Atwood creates here is so far from reality yet so close to it at the same time. It's impossible to believe it could happen, yet it is in fact completely possible. Definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"When I start a new book, it generally takes me a few chapters to really get into it. However, with The Handmaid's Tale I was immediately sucked in. It was almost startling how much I connected with the narrative, considering how disturbing many of its elements are. Atwood's use of first person narration and a modern setting allow the story to be that much more accessible, which also makes its claims that much more appalling.The character of Offred is someone we can sympathize and relate to, even though the majority of aspects of her life are foreign to us (being a part of a society where your value is determined by your ability to breed is hopefully not something many of us can relate to). Even so, the first person narration allows us to know Offred's heart, and how much she has truly lost in the transition to this new life of a handmaid.Atwood writes a rich and thought-provoking story. Though many parts are difficult to grapple with, the questions she raises about our own values in society and religion are extremely interesting to consider. If you are interested in exploring these queries within yourself, or even if you're just looking for a thrilling read, Atwood's book would be a good one to pick up."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I had to read a book for a class assignment and had the option to choose this book. I read small reviews praising the book and the plot seemed very interesting. After I picked it up, I could not put it down. The reviews were right.This novel shows a first person view on the effects of a dystopian government. The novel's main character, Offred, is a woman who has to take the role of a very important person to this society. Other women take this role too, but it only focuses on her. It also shows the way how high ranking people in a society like this, also have problems even though it seems they have an easier life than lower ranked people.The story is told in a peculiar way. It goes back and forth in the story timeline. It does that because the main character has flashbacks of the time before the Gilead(the government who took over) and of events that led to where she is now. This does not make the story confusing. On the contraire, it builds up the suspense because it shows what aspects of human life the government took away.Later in the story, we find out reasons why the Gilead was formed. This adds even more suspense to the story. Reasons stated show that the probability of this happening in the U.S. is very real. I cannot say why because I do not want to give away the story.In the end, I recommend this novel. It may move a little slow timeline wise, but it is a good thing because it helps you understand the effects of the Gilead. This book can teach you a lot of things about the world, you just have to pay attention. One thing I just want to point out about those lessons is: The ability to adapt is something humans strive for. You will see that a lot in the effects and foundation of the Gilead. Read it, it will do you good. And as the Houston Chronicle said, \\"...Read it while it's still allowed.\\""},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The two best words to describe this book are fascinating and horrifying. I was completely blown away by this novel. I was thinking medieval based on the title, and I was not expecting near distant future at all. Nevertheless as I read it, I was drawn into it, fascinated and unable to put it down. The use of color was astounding and phenomenal, with red, blue, green, and black representing different class and social positions. I actually felt like I knew what it was like to live as a handmaiden with a white head-dress on, sneaking glances from inside of it. The world created is astounding, vivid, and partly horrifying. Beautifully written, it seems plausible, like it could actually happen and that is why it is slightly terrifying. Human nature is put underneath extreme circumstances--a world in which many women are infertile--and the outcome of handmaidens used as concubines to produce children is an appropriate, realistic outcome. It makes me appreciate the society that we live in. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The story is told from the perspective of a woman whose life utterly changed in her mid-twenties due to a gov't coup in the US that left the executive and legislative branches dead. A totalitarian regime is put in place that controls women as breeding resources. The only thing that really bothered me about the book was that I found the timeframe unbelievable, that in 5-10 years society could be completely upheaved to where people accept this new power structure and imposed religiousness. I kept feeling it'd make a better story if the main character was one generation removed from the coup, but so much of the story as delivered depends on the woman's experiences pre-coup. I, too, was disappointed in the open ending; though the fictional \\"historical notes\\" addendum gives you some indication of what happened after the story, you still don't get any specific indication of what eventually happened to the main character."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is a futuristic story about a thirty-three-year old prospective surrogate mother (re)named Offred, after the man to whom she's been assigned. As she's on her third tour of (impregnation) duty, she knows the consequences of failure to conceive and the rewards of success.The decline in women's status in society started slowly, with a change in the law; women were disallowed access to their financial assets and property ownership. Like all Handmaids, Offred underwent almost army-like training to learn the ropes of her new role. Along with other chosen women of child-bearing age, she is expected to follow a whole host of rules and participate in odd-seeming rituals (the creepiest involving a certain intimate act) while worrying about the fate of her long lost husband and child. Although initially the author keeps readers in the dark about the history behind the handmaids, eventually, all is revealed. Offred, not your ordinary run of the mill \\"two-legged womb,\\" learns of the existence of an underground, anti-government movement and must decide whether attempting to further the cause is worth the potential punishment.Although I love Atwood's short stories, the memory of this one has stuck with me more than any of many other books of hers that I've read. It's definitely my favorite. I recently read this book for the second time after happening upon the movie on TV. My advice: don't bother with the movie unless you've read the book. It's interesting to see what they tried to do with it, but they made several changes, including to the ending. Also good: The Stepford Wives by Ira Levin, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, and The Giver by Lois Lowery."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"What happens when a race faces extinction? How should one solve the problem of low fertility rates? Should an entire civilization leave the all-important task of self-sustainability to mere chance when sexual diseases and irresponsible lifestyle choices compound the problem?The answer is to create a system to stem the problem before it propagates. Individual freedom? In an ideal world perhaps. Gender Equality? Bah! The fact is, when push comes to shove, these frivolous statutes need to be sacrificed for the greater good.Atwood's novel deals with these salient issues and imagines a society that has found a chillingly viable solution to ensure its survival.The Republic of Gilead has founded their procreative system on the employment of handmaids, who are young women hand-plucked to serve the households of the top echelons of society. They are primarily concubines of those distinguished gentlemen whose wives are not able or no longer able to conceive.One surefire way of ensuring that these handmaids are of productive stock is to choose those who have already had children before. To give this perverse idea a veneer of self-righteous respectability, those chosen are the \`blemished', who had children out of wedlock or not by their first marriages.They are then garbed in Amish-like dress, but instead of being austere black, these are red to convey ripeness and fertility. (The wives in turn are colour-coded in royal blue while other women decked in other colours to serve different functions). These are the lucky ones - the others pronounced as \`unwoman' are sent to die in colonies either of hard labour or toxic radiation.The story is told from the perspective of a handmaid, whose real name is never revealed to the reader. Her newly-bestowed name is derived from the first name of her owner, Fred, eerily referred to as The Commander. She is literally called \`Offred', as the other handmaids would be called \`Of-master's name', to connote she is only property.The reader is made to feel Offred's emotions at each turn of the story. We see her being re-educated at an instructional institution where she and the other girls are herded like cattle by sadistic Aunts.Atwood never does quite establish the setting or storyline for the reader with any intrusion as the writer. Instead, the reader only finds things out in morsels as Offred relives her memories, that are more often than not, sparked by what was happening at her Commander's household.Purportedly the first in a trilogy of dystopian novels (the second being \`Oryx and Crake', followed by 2009's \`The Year of the Flood'), \`The Handmaid's Tale' stands out as a masterpiece in storytelling. What is disturbingly compelling about this moral fable is the idea that all this is possible and that all it takes is for someone to meddle with the precarious balance of right and wrong and everything falls apart."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I am a serial re-reader -- If a book really gets stuck in my head, I revisit it like an old friend over and over again. I may read it from cover to cover or only spend time getting reaquainted with my favorite parts of the story. That said, I've read The Handmaid's Tale at least 10 times -- and counting. I love dystopian literature, and this is one of the best in my opinion.The novel tells the tale of the heroine Offred (not her real name -- in Atwood's future, women are addressed by an explanation of who they belong to, i.e., \\"Of Fred.\\")Society has crumbled, and some unexplained global tragedy has occurred leaving most women sterile. Those who can still conceive -- the Handmaids -- are forced to bear children for those who can afford it, society families, military men and those in good standing with the new uber-spooky government. Big Brother is hard at work in this book, which still terrifies me every time I read it. One of my Top 20 books without a doubt. Just writing this review makes me want to pick it up and begin the story all over again."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Wow. What a great read. I read a review where someone said this book was a piece of trash. Obviously, the person knows little about the stylistic techniques that are weaved in works to make them deeper and more meaningful. I have just completed an in-depth project for my AP English class where I was required to choose a book, analyze every aspect of the story as I read, and present it to the class, pointing out literary techniques and my analysis of each technique. I chose The Handmaid's Tale because I had read it before and loved it, but I wanted to reread it very carefully and look at all of the hidden meanings. I had no idea what I was in for. The first time I read it, I loved it just for the story; the whole Gilead concept was just so intriguing. This time, I loved it for how deep the significance of every little thing in the book is, which is something I had missed the first time. Atwood has to be a genius to be able to coalesce all of the underlying meanings, images, allusions, and recondite symbolism that is waiting on every page. Things like reason for the red outfits are obvious, but before careful thinking and analysis I was unaware that such things as the flowers in Serena Joy's garden and the egg that Offred describes just before the Birthmobile arrives represent much intricate, deeper ideas and desires. This book should be appreciated if not for the plot, which is entertaining in itself, then for being an excellent example of a work that subtly weaves together an excellent &quot;Level III&quot; meaning that can only be appreciated by the most erudite and interested readers."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"First, let me establish that The Handmaid's Tale is not a purely or even primarily political book. It has a great deal to say about the difference between the genders, contains beautiful poetic sequences (one can tell it's written by a poet), is well-constructed, deals accurately in powerful emotions, and is intellectually stimulating. To call this book primarily political, or \\"propaganda\\" as some have, is to openly display one's prejudices and biases.I would like to discuss the political side of this book, however, particularly the plausibility of the coup. I'll focus on this because that appears to be the cause for a majority of the dissonance in this book's Amazon reviews.While this novel's story does seem unlikely, it is far from impossible, and there are several things from Offred's description of the coup that are undeniably similar to recent events, if certainly more extreme. (Beware, spoilers ahead.)Congress and the President were gunned down, and the catastrophe was blamed on Islamic fanatics. The Constitution was temporarily suspended, Newspapers were censored, and roadblocks began to appear requiring \\"identipasses.\\" A significant circumstance that helped the coup was that all money was electronic--down to people using credit cards to buy groceries.A much milder, but still similar, version of this has happened in real life. The real version of the catastrophe (9/11) really was committed by Islamic fanatics (unless you subscribe to conspiracy theories), and this is where the similarity is the weakest. However, many civil liberties have been temporarily suspended by the PATRIOT Act, border security has been tightened, identification is becoming increasingly necessary, nearly all money is now electronic (not as a result of 9/11; neither was the electronic money of The Handmaid's Tale), and while newspapers have not been censored by any means, there does seem to be an attitude among some that the news media is less trustworthy than the government. Incidents such as Newsweek's Guantanamo-Kuran-flushing gaffe, or specifically the reaction to said gaffe, demonstrate this plainly.It's been claimed by another reviewer that the US Military would never support a theocracy such as Gilead. That's quite debatable. The U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, according to a column by Jonathan Chalt, is under the leadership of a \\"born again\\" commandant and \\"a group of like-minded chaplains.\\" \\"At supposedly nondenominational services,\\" Chalt writes, \\"the academy's head chaplain has urged cadets to pray for those who didn't attend, and to remind them that 'those not \\"born again\\" will burn in the fires of hell.' Younger cadets who skip the prayer services have been hunted down by seniors, who call them 'heathens.' Even the football coach has joined in, putting up a banner in the locker room urging his players to join 'Team Jesus Christ.' Scores of cadets have complained of being harassed and insulted by evangelicals, and a team of visiting chaplains from Yale Divinity School found a shocking level of of religious intolerance on campus.\\" This suggests that some among the military might not be wholly against a real Gilead. The idea of the military gunning down the President and Congress does seem implausible, but said assassinations certainly wouldn't be necessary for a real Gilead. And while the Los Angeles Times, for whom Jonathan Chalt wrote the above column, is considered fairly liberal, the report by the Yale Divinity School is real.Stepping back to the book itself, it does seem remarkable that Margaret Atwood imagined (I wouldn't quite say \\"predicted;\\" it seems more that she's saying they're possible than that they're inevitable) these things in the 1980s.Again, it is inaccurate to call The Handmaid's Tale a purely or primarily political book. But nearly all of the disagreement in the plethora of reviews of the book appear to be due to political objections, so hopefully this review will help the unsure customer make a decision."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I have very mixed feeling about this book. On one hand, it is a brilliant piece of literature. Atwood meant it to be a feminist text, but today, with the rise of Christian fundamentalism in America, it also reads like a warning on the perils of religious fundamentalism. Atwood's description of the rise of Gilead is chillingly realistic. She captures the poignant dullness of an oppressive State beautifully.My gripe? The book is a little too dull. The book's narrator, named only as Offred (of Fred), dwells extensively on her past. While her nostalgia for the past is understandable, it doesn't pull on my heartstrings the way Atwood no doubt intended it to. I am not a woman with a husband and a daughter - the \\"lost family\\" trope can't stir my emotions again every chapter. It got old. The narrator's passivity for most of the book also wore on me.This book was first published in 1985, a year before I was born. Perhaps my disinterest in this book is in part a result of the feminist movement that it was a part of. I don't aspire to domestic motherhood, and I respond better to narratives with more active women. I would have preferred a story about the rebellion that overthrew Gilead. That's fine, though. This book wasn't written for me."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This should be required reading for high school and college students.

I can see us on a slippery slope just waiting for someone like Santorum to take charge and push us right over. That's all it would take. Him and his fanatical right-wingers fantasize about a world like this. WOMEN especially need to read this book. Right wing women who are voting for Santorum ESPECIALLY need to read this book and wake the hell up. This book is a work of fiction but it WILL make you think."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood's stunning novel The Handmaid's Tale is one of the best modern dystopian novels written in the last few decades.Since the year 1984 passed us by with very few Orwellian repressions to note, misanthropes like myself have needed to find new repressions to fear. Atwood's seminal novel The Handmaid's Tale fits this bill nicely. Though there is a frame story of an academic paper set several hundred years in the future, the preponderance of the books takes place in the near future, in a time when an epidemic, which may have been a natural plague or a biological weapon gotten out of control, has caused mass infertility in the U.S. A repressive conservative religious regime has taken control of the government and, with one stroke of a keyboard, abrogated women's property rights. The few fertile women who are left (or, perhaps, the wives of the few fertile men who were left) are declared a natural resource and appropriated to bear children for the wealthy. These fertile women are called Handmaids, after the Biblical story (Genesis) of the infertile Sarah, when she allowed her husband Abraham to take her handmaid Hagar to bear him a son.Offred, a Handmaid whose name means \\"Of Fred,\\" meaning that she is an indentured surrogate to bear Fred a child, is the central character and first-person narrator. Offred's narration and observations are clear and, in places, funny, though her situation is as desperate as the women of Afghanistan's used to be.The Handmaid's Tale is a beautifully written narrative of a horrendous, possible future reality. The part that scared me the most was not even the Christian conservative government but the ease with which women's property rights were stripped away with a few keystrokes. We depend on the electronic manipulation of data for our whole lives, from our ATM and credit cards to get money out of a bank to our deeds that are registered in the computers of our local governments to ordering a book off of Amazon. While this book was frightening in the nineties, when I first read it, it's bloody terrifying now. It makes me want to get a Swiss bank account, stuff money in my mattress, and live \\"off the grid\\" to avoid Offred's fate.As a note added in proof of how much people enjoy this book: I have bought 5 copies in my life. Every time I loan it out, the person keeps it and won't give the darn thing back.TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I wish this book could be dropped, like leaflets during wartime, on all of the 'red' states.

What's more amazing, and scary, is that this book was published 20 years ago! When Offred relates in a passage of how the President and half of Congress were killed and it was blamed on Islamic terrorists, my blood literally ran ice-cold.Many reviewers have cited similarities to the actions of the current Bush administration. My bigger fear is what will come next? With most of the media acting like lapdogs of the multi-national corporations that sign their paychecks, while they perform any trick that Karl Rove and company orders, the citizenry is being lulled into an increasingly deep complacency."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"If Orwell's \\"1984\\" were blended with Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and assorted other modernistic themes, including P.D. James' \\"Children of Men\\", you would probably have something akin to this insightful and completely enlightening novel.In this novel - which occurs around the time of the writing (1986) - women lose identity and become chattel. They were being abused before the government came to deliver this new protective life -- so they are told. \\"There is more than one kind of freedom. . . Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from.\\" Sounds like a debate between the ACLU and the Bush administration.The chosen few are afforded the opportunity of providing children for the most highly regarded males - Commanders. They are not concubines - emotions are not allowed. They are not prostitutes -- no money passes hands. Instead, they engage in a monthly ritual devoid of emotions. A fornication which includes the Commander's wife. A grotesque act which hopefully ends with a child - something which the Commander's wife cannot produce.This religiously tyrannical world blames the infertility issues among the women - not the men. And, as such, only those women who previously conceived and bore children can become a Handmaid. Dressed like a 17th century Pilgrim, treated like a black slave of the 19th century, and the envy of the other \\"Female Slaves\\" who clean house - called Marthas - we watch Offred become indoctrinated, and rebellious.Patronymic changes are first - all of the Handmaid's names change from their own to one beginning with \\"Of\\" and ending with their Commander's first name. Our protagonist becomes Offred. Her watch - Ofglen, and so forth.Then they live in the house out of reach from all. They are saved for the monthly ritual and between such anything-but-erotic sexual acts, they are fed, cleaned and clad as though they were premier mares - serving the exclusive purpose of making issue.Like \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", education of the masses is believed to be the tyranny's foe -- and probably rightly so. Women are prohibited from reading, using pens or writing instruments, and basically live oppressed lives which mirror the slaves of America in the 18th and 19th centuries. They are stuffed religious propaganda -- in verse to be remembered, not read. One of the book's highlights is the growingly cynical Offred's twist on the Lord's Prayer at the end of Chapter 30. Connecting that commonly known prayer to the world in which she lives is priceless.Like \\"1984\\" or any of the books which play on similar themes, there is rebellion - perhaps for adventure, perhaps to relieve boredom, perhaps just for rebellion itself. But, in such worlds of totalitarian rule, the consequences for discovery of such acts can be simple - a hanging with a white hood over your head and public display of your corpse limply and listlessly drooped from the heights of the city's \\"Wall.\\"I will not tell you the story, but will add that it is not as you might think. The last chapter fills in many of the openings, and leaves others open. But, all is done in fair play by the author to the reader. And, the different writing style of the last chapter explains the simple, short, and Hemingway-esque style used throughout the rest of the novel.I have never read Atwood before and look forward to reading other novels she has authored. She is a great novelist -- in style of writing and in imagination of story."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood's genius novel \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is the story of Offred, a woman who has been forced into service as a surrogate mother for an elite married couple in a totalitarian regime. As a woman, she has been stripped of all of her rights, and as a low-class woman (committing the \\"crime\\" of having a second marriage) she has been denied even the basic human rights she once took for granted. Even her name has been taken from her: the label \\"Offred\\" is to let people know who her commander is (she is the handmaid \\"Of Fred\\"). Her narrative is laced with sadness, regret and humility -- for her life situation, for the family that was taken from her, for the humiliating way she must give herself to a strange man, and mostly for the way that she is too scared to resist the people who oppress her. Atwood masterfully guides the reader through Offred's daily life to a shattering conclusion. Through it she shows us the fear that keeps people complicit in a government that does wrong as well as the hypocrisy inherent to humanity that makes the institutionalization of religion such a fruitless pursuit. \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is an expertly crafted and brilliantly devised parable about the dangers of extremism and the enduring power of the human capacity for hope.What is so alarming about Atwood's novel is that, twenty years after its initial publication, it is more timely than ever. The Republic of Gilead (the religious organization that controls every facet of Offred's world) came into power in the wake of terrorist attacks on the U.S. which led to the suspension of the Constitution. Suddenly, Atwood's cautionary tale doesn't seem so impossible after all."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book was written in the mid 80s, but it might well have been written today. It's about life after the US government is essentially destroyed, the environment ravaged by toxic waste, and sectarian wars resulted in a monotheocracy.Offred, the Handmaid telling the tale, gradually reveals what life is like in this new world: women are for procreating (Handmaids) and domestic chores (Marhtas) and as decoration (Wives). They are not allowed to read, nor can they have friends. Men fare a little better -- they can read and own things -- but only a little; even the Commanders have a pretty grim life. Everyone spies on everyone else, or else wonders who is spying on whome. People are executed for the slightest offense and put on display as a lesson.This exquisitely written book has so much going on: the meaning of friendship when it's not allowed, the danger of not paying attention when civil rights are slowly taken away, the struggle to just survive another day. The tale is so fantastic, at first, the reader thinks it's something that couldn't possibly happen. Then the reader is reminded of secret wiretapping, of people who say we should suspend rights in time of \\"emergency,\\" of with-us-or-against-us rhetoric, of the public paying more attention to celebrity hijinks than to things happening around them.This book has certainly made me think, and the fine writing made it a pleasure, albeit a scary one, to read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I had read this book years ago, and just reread it.

She hopes that someday, someone will hear her story, for it is the only available weapon she has against a society that seeks to destroy her humanity.A disturbing, satirical, and ultimately frightening novel, The Handmaid's Tale is also a warning against fundamentalist ideals taken to the extreme and the possibility for damage to human worth and dignity."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The United States has become a Huckabee-meets-Palin Utopia, a WASP military dictatorship based on a racist Protestant reading of the Bible.

Knowing that (which I didn't until now), why do I publish my comments? Because I loved the book. Atwood has 17 works of fiction in print and this is one of the finest. It's a tale of the dystopian future; the earth has been poisoned by atomic radiation, the human race is mostly infertile, and a right-wing church group has seized power. \\"Commanders\\" rule local groups; women are supervised by \\"aunts\\", and \\"eyes\\" are standing guard all over the place. The Handmaid becomes the sexual and intellectual plaything of the local commander, and the plot takes off. In addition to their sexual subservience, most women are required to do menial work and to wear distinctive colors--red for pregnancy candidates, who are subjected to \\"ceremonial\\" rapes.

The story is very interesting (although a bit confusing at first - my suggestion is to read the Historical Note at the end first) and is almost a social commentary on what may happen to civilization if things progress the way they have been. In this society many people are unable to have children, but if you have enough wealth and status you can hire a handmaid to live with you and bear a child. But how do the Handmaids feel about this? What of their previous lives where they were parents and important themselves, rather than simply child-bearing slaves?

It depicts two women, dressed in long flowing red robes, wearing white headdresses, carrying baskets in front of an unnaturally tall curved brick wall. There is a patch of blue sky that can be seen over the top of the wall. You perceive the wall as a barrier, that the women are somehow cut off from the world.Before I knew anything about the book, I assumed it was an historical novel, something from the Middle Ages.I wasn't too far off.Margaret Atwood conjures a future society, but many elements of her society can be seen in fundamentalist cultures right here, right now.And unlike most science fiction, her story is not about the fruits of technology, but rather the sociological and personal implications of technology's impact.Much has been said about the political sensibilities of the book, but I would like to praise its exposition. We are introduced to a new America (now called Gilead) by the first-person account of the narrator, Offred. Her birth name has been taken from her. Offred means \\"Of Fred\\" making her identity literally that of a possessed object. She weaves her thoughts about her present-day predicament with observations of her daily routine and a history of her personal life and the transition from the USA to Gilead. Her view of the world is necessarily limited by her lack of access to information, but after a while you realize that her detached description of her environment is also a survival mechanism. For our heroine to even articulate her position to herself puts her life in danger. As is true in all dystopias, it is frightening to wake up.In another writer's hands, this futureworld could be a strident polemic. Ms. Atwood makes this book so engrossing by letting her narrator reveal herself and her world in her own time, by making the personal political.Without giving too much away, this is a story about technology and control run amuck. The future is a world where technology, pollution and personal freedom have created new survival choices for society, and society has chosen badly.Ms. Atwood says that her book points out what would happen if certain ways of thinking were taken to their logical extreme. As Offred's instructor says, \\"the Old World protected \`freedom to'. We protect \`freedom from'. Is her story relevant? With Americans guzzling gasoline in behemoth SUVs faster than Detroit can make them, and fundamentalists controlling large parts of our political and communication machinery, do you have to ask?The Handmaid's Tale is an engrossing, chilling, and well-written story from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book scared me more than any story from Stephen King or Dean Koontz ever could.

The religious right, with their cries for a Return to Morality and their efforts to bring prayer back into school, bring us ever closer to Gilead each time they attempt to diminish the separation between Church and State. Other things Atwood mentioned in The Handmaid's Tale are actually occuring NOW: the controversial list on the Internet of Abortion providers, &quot;for a future reckoning.&quot; Dr. Laura, who could be Serena Joy, preaching the value of women staying at home and being the obedient sex.If there's anything we should take away from Atwood's book it is a sense of caution, and a will to fight every loss of freedom no matter how small or inconcequential it may seem. Societies do indeed fall in degrees."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood, in this beautifully written but incredibly disturbing fictional novel, describes what could happen if religion gains too much power, and what society could become if women's rights are not protected.The story is set in the United States in the near future. A brutal attack has left all members of Congress dead and the country has collapsed into civil war. A section of the United States, governed by religious fundamentalists, becomes a totalitarian state called the Republic of Gilead. The Constitution is suspended; civil liberties and freedoms are dissolved; the death penalty is instituted for dissidents, homosexuals, and non-Christians; and women loose the right to work and earn money.Radiation poisoning from the war has resulted in almost all women becoming infertile. Those few in Gilead who can still bear children are forced to become Handmaids, surrogate mothers for infertile couples. The book takes the form of a personal diary belonging to a Handmaid named Offred, who is commissioned to the house of a Gileadean commander, and whose sole purpose is to routinely copulate with him in order to bear a child for his infertile wife. Using this as the basis of the story allows Atwood to address the conservative, traditional and sometimes religious belief that the only purpose of a woman is to bear children. In Offred's own words:\\"We are two-legged wombs, that's all: sacred vessels, ambulatory chalices.\\" Pg136.and\\"What we prayed for was emptiness, so we would be worthy to be filled: with grace, with love, with self-denial, semen and babies.\\" Pg 194.Offred takes the reader through her many trials as she struggles to come to terms with her place in a suppressive and legalistic society. The story frequently flashes back to Offred's memories of her life before the war, when she had her own job, money, a loving husband and a young daughter. This dualistic nature of the story provides the reader with a comparison between two societies: one where women have choice and the other where women have little or no choice at all.This is a dystopian novel, and through it Atwood provides a warning of what could happen if religion becomes the ultimate law of the land, and if women are no longer free to make their own decisions, especially regarding sexuality and reproduction."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"First, my disclaimer: I had to read this for my high school English class. I was one of the few who loved it (I will say that the like/dislike did seem to come down gender lines) as many just thought it was a flat-out weird and pro-choice novel.The Handmaid's Tale is a heavy social commentary in a hijacked USA, where *everything in this society is justified on Bibical premises*. It is a harsh look at the religious right, and even more meaningful in this age, where evangelicals grow in numbers daily. Offred has lost her name, but she is one of several Handmaids who have been \\"Of Fred,\\" the Commander. In this society, she has a plum role--as long as she can reproduce, she has bread, food, regular health checkups. The most haunting part of her story is the loss of her husband and daughter, both of whom she dwells on constantly. One of my particular favorite characters was the rebellious Moira, who escapes the Center to become an underground prostitute. She, too, is guided by very strict sanctions--punishments for gaining weight, etc.I would recommend reading some background information after reading this book--my English teacher gave us a packet discussing the Bibical background (\\"children of Ham,\\" the Rachel/Leigh story, all the shops which have names derived from Bibical verses) of the story, as well as the stark changes in diction and detail when Offred goes on touchy, personal subjects, or when she's scared, or just weaving her background. I wouldn't say this story is anti-Christian (no Christian values are in evidence here) so much as anti-oppression. Most of the verses which support this society are grounded in Old Testament roots. It is a very feminist novel. Atwood describes Offred's life before the revolution--where she did have worries such as her job, being raped, walking on the streets alone--to her life after the revolution. However, she has to pay for her \\"protection.\\" Atwood goes on an interesting tangent about \\"freedom from\\" and \\"freedom to.\\" The Handmaid's Tale is a wonderful novel about the somewhat tenuous role of women in today's society.I must praise Atwood for one of my favorite parts of the novel--the Historical Notes, at the end. Through the Historical Notes, I was able to plot out and calculate a some semblance of a chronological timeline (Offred marries--has daughter--revolution--and post-revolution) in years. The use of The Historical Notes are absolutely amazing, and add several layers to the book's texture."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This novel, the first I have read by Atwood, captured my attention quickly with its first person narrative and distict jumps in time. The confusion I sometimes felt as the audience, is nothing compared to the confusion and horror protagonist Offred goes through. I am not a fan of sci-fi yet I thought the futuristic vision Atwood creates of humanties inhumanties as chilling. The Republic of Gilead claims to honor women in their enforced creation of a sisterhood. What this futuristic government accomplishes is degrading women even more so than the violent rapes women were experiencing in pre-Gilead days. An excellent book for a women's discussion group."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Just an incredible work. This was a nightmarish dystopian scenario filled with archetypal images and characters that will stay with me for a while. The author creates a fully realized social structure of Commanders and Guardians, Wives, Aunts, Handmaids, Marthas and unWomen, Eyes in black vans and underground May Day abolitionists. Even as I was enthralled by the narrative, I was increasingly heartsick at the level of inhumanity depicted in this world. The crucial epilogue, presented as a piece of historical scholarship, ties everything together and supplies many of the political details lacking in the first-person narrative. In fact my only criticism would be that some of these details of context are not explained earlier. The historical perspective also reminds us that, before we dismiss Atwood's vision as impossibly grim, we recognize that such models of brutality and gender subjugation exist even today in totalitarian regimes like Iran."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In this book, the author uses an incredible style to convey a point of confusion and wonder to the readers. I really like the story in the book and the hinted ideas throught it. Even though at some places the book is difficult to read and understand.

While slow at times, I felt the protrayal of Offred's life convincing and realistic. Although I doubt that the future described here could actually come about, it serves as a warning about what could happen if certain cultural trends run amuck. Over-all I would recommend this book to all science fiction fans who appreciate an intelligent read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is a very entertaining book.

Just listen to common people (on the busses or in the pubs) while talking about the 'degeneration of the new generations', the 'loss of moral values in our days' and so long and think if just one of them could have the complete political power in his hands. It's not necessary to be a woman to understand this novel."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It's about time someone wrote a dystopia from a female perspective. Governments are usually run by men who don't think for a minute about being a woman, which causes law-making to be biased. If this situation would ever arise in our society, one can be sure of who would take over, and who would be left to obscurity. Atwood has taken writing to a form of the highest art, with her amazing word twists and mind games. Probably my favorite dystopian novel, in which the main character has not only a brain, but an imagination and a memory."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was one of those books you get so wrapped up in that when your done reading it you are depressed because its over.

I really like the characters in the book, and I think that Atwood wrote an incredible story. I especially loved the historical notes, and thought it tied the whole thing together well."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This novel is even more relevant now than when it was written,given the resurgence of the 'know-nothing' element of the American polity."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"If you like chilling, thought-provoking novels that envision futures of suppressive, theocratic societies, where women are seen as national resources, and playing Scrabble is a capital offense, then maybe The Handmaid's Tale is just the book for you. But that isn't the reason I recommend it. The dystopic elements of the novel are interesting, yes, but more intriguing and worthy of noting are Atwood's literary and stylistic choices in writing the tale.Atwood doesn't just tell a story, she has us feel it through the use of suspense. From the dry, dispassionate manner in which Offred relates her story, we sense that the narrator is a woman who has seen too much, undergone too many horrors, to--to do what, we don't exactly know. We wonder how far Offred will go to escape. We speculate how appealing those hooks in her closet, or the matchstick under her mattress, will begin to look. Atwood keeps us tense and engaged with the story through the ambiguity of not knowing what will happen next. Though we are told of events second, and sometimes third-hand, Atwood still manages to somehow preserve a sense of immediacy and suspense in the telling, and we're genuinely concerned for Offred, even though she is, presumably, relating the events from some point in the future.The fragmented nature of the narrative is also strangely engaging. The gaps in the chronology keep us guessing as we try to figure out (along with Offred) how the world has gone so horribly wrong. As we follow Offred's stream of consciousness, realize her losses, and learn of her harrowing experiences, we become more deeply engrossed in her tale. You'll battle over wanting to know what happens next, and fearing just what that will be. Atwood masterfully carries the tension of not knowing right up through her last sentence. Depending on you personality (and literary tastes), you'll either be slamming the book down in frustration or giving a deeply contented sigh for the beautiful, be it ambiguous, finish.Thought-provoking? Absolutely. But artistically, it's spellbinding."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I have recently re-read The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, whom I consider to be one of the best living writers. This novel should certainly be read by anyone who not only enjoys writing (and the construction of it), yet more importantly it (the novel) deserves it's place alongside other 'Dystopian' novels read, taught and studied by male authors such as 1984 (George Orwell), Brave New World (Aldous Huxley) and Fahrenheit 451 (Ray Bradbury).In one aspect then The Handmaid's Tale is a response to the male point of view (written by a male author) relating a future society. While Atwood is not the first female author to include a female protagonist within an imagined future society, (Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is one previous novel), her (Atwood's) novel is certainly more accessible given its length (which is comparable again to the shorter novels listed above, 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451). The whole aspect of questioning (society, self, religion) is one of the principle reasons (involved within the novel) that there are people who are opposed to this book being taught in schools (to high-school students in particular). Of course there are going to be people, (and people within systems), who would be disturbed by the content and theme of The Handmaid's Tale (sexuality, death, individuation, institutions), which is one of the reasons that make this novel so vital. The fact that it is written (told) through a female perspective is of course central to the novel and the circumstances that the character finds her self a part of.Along with the overall questioning involved with the events happening in the novel (who has allowed this to happen and why?), we (as readers) also are questioning the validity of the tale which Atwood brilliantly weaves throughout by incorporating such passages as this: \\"This is a reconstruction. All of it is a reconstruction now, in my head, as I lie flat on my single bed rehearsing what I should or shouldn't have said, what I should or shouldn't have done, how I should have played it.\\" (The Handmaid's Tale, Atwood, page 134). This \`questioning' of the narrator's tale (and her \`current' state of being) is continually reinforced by Atwood in the use of the language in the novel, which we are told in the epilogue has been reconstructed from tapes (spoken word). Atwood's understanding of the \`visual sense' (or impression) of the printed word (in this future society writing is forbidden) is another reason this novel should be required reading alongside the \`patriarchal' writings of Dystopian literature.There have been many criticisms involving the plausibility of the events that create the society in The Handmaid's Tale in so short a time frame, yet one only has to look to Nazi Germany for an example of how quickly (and efficiently) a society can be changed and \`social norms' accepted (this unfortunately is not the only example, just the most extreme). This of course disturbs us as readers (as it should) and results in our deniability in its portended involvement. The gross or unpleasant themes that are told through the character of Offred are relations of a reality that we would rather not envision. Certainly it is easier to ignore The Handmaid's Tale as trivial fiction or the collection of a disgruntled feminist writer (or as I have heard some men say \\"The rantings of a man hater\\"). One has to wonder though if those who hold these views have actually read the novel, or at least the whole novel and paid attention to its complex structure. The Handmaid's Tale is an eloquent example of the possibilities that the written word has to shape our understanding of our selves and our place in our real and our imagined world."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Atwood's novel brilliantly depicts a hypothetical, yet not unrealistic political atmosphere that is based purely on the oppression of all classes below the elite. As the author is a well known feminist, I assumed that her novel would be about the oppression women currently face in society and no more. And in a sense, her novel does revolve around how women are oppressed psychologically, physically, and sexually. But her dark novel goes beyond arguing her feminist ideals but instead begs the reader to examine and understand the current treatment of society's weak. In fact, I was amazed by how the torture inflicted on people because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, and religion could so easily relate to our current society. Therefore, to label as a book for women only would be a great insult to the universal truths Atwood preaches. Besides being extremely moved by her political themes, I was also intrigued with how she depicts the psychological dramas of Offred, the plot's protagonist. The way Atwood tells the story is a totally different style on its own, but this adds to the plot's complexity as it contrasts what Offred wants and what she has, and it deeply analyzes the psychological effects of being censonred and completely controlled by a government. The characters in this story are neither complete heroes nor villains but shapers of their own futures, and I think it's best the story be told that way as it brings light to our current society's role in its future. This book completely change my outlook and made me examine my own role in society."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Atwood warns us against a futuristic dystopia. Women are given no privileges whatsoever and are unable to ever improve themselves, punished if they ever set their eyes on any words. The government assigns them three roles, and three roles only; all of the roles are harsh, but the worst of them all would be the handmaids. Handmaids are only there to fulfill what the wives are incapable of doing- to have children. They cannot choose their position, thus they have to sacrifice not only love but their dignity as well.Atwood's novel is captivating, demonstrating the detrimental effects of human faults in our society today. She expresses her views on feminism and antifeminism through Offred's point of view. By doing so, the reader is able to comprehend the atrocity that handmaids have to endure, such as the fear of not becoming pregnant after the monthly ceremonies. They can relate to the life that she used to have with her undying love for Luke and her daughter, and visualize the horrors of her present. Atwood also utilizes many descriptive images to heighten the effect of the government's oppression against the people of the society. Everything of the future begins to seem gloomy and dreary with the Unwomen's jobs and the hatred that people have for one another. Everything is dull with nothing for anyone to do, except wait or work according to their given roles.By exaggerating the horrible outcome of our society today, Atwood stirs fear into her readers, which works quite effectively since people constantly question and stress over their actions in life. She offers to her readers a perspective that they have not even bothered to think up of yet, making them worry and think of different methods that they can achieve to prevent this from happening which was one of her main intentions of writing this piece.This novel is brilliantly written, and the plot is interesting and out of the ordinary. It takes a lot of skill and talent to be able to create a whole different world, and she definitely possesses those characteristics. I highly recommend this book to everyone. Although it may be awkward to hear of such a disfigured society in the very beginning, the feeling subsides and only cautiousness and fear remains at the very end, which demonstrates how great of an impact Handmaid's Tale has on its readers."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is set in the future, where a tyrannical government has replaced democracy with limits on literacy, free speech, and any form of opinion. Atwood's feminist views are evident throughout the novel, voicing her concern for a society that has receded into the past of male dominion. Expressing her concerns through a riveting plot which documents Offred's life during a period of government corruption, Atwood succeeds in shocking her audience with controversies of a woman's role. Offred is the 'handmaid' of a general, and serves purely for procreation purposes. The emphasis on a womn's productivity (the devotion of an entire occupation) thus portrays the paradox of a Handmaid's role; although society relies on their reproduction, the means which they procreate nonetheless degrades their status. Offred's very name also depicts the male domination that now governs the country. Handmaids have no identity; instead, their name is derived from their general's name, placed after \\"Of-\\". For instance, if her general had the name of Charles, Offred would thus become Ofcharles. This complete annihilation of a women's identity reveals Atwood's concern for women's rights in the twentieth century.At first glance, The Handmaid's Tale seems like the generic story of the oppressed, a heroine fighting hopelessly against a cruel government. However, the story is distinct in that is only uses this mold as a basis to create something else. Offred is the unfortunate woman that must be forced to abide by strict, unfair regulations. But she is not the typical heroine that resolutely defies all; instead, she is much more human, protesting through her ability to write, and to reveal truth through her unique perspective. The uncertainty in the conclusion, where the reader is unsure whether Offred lives or dies, rejects the archetypal happy ending and instead reveals a realistic end: where the unfortunate and goodwilled does not always conquer evil.However, the most unique aspect of the Handmaid's tale is the epilogue, where a Professor James Pixizoto's complete misinterpretation of Offred's story warns reader to read the novel correctly, that is, without discarding the tale as a place for Offred's rants and cries. Instead, this is a story revealing the political, social, and human desolation of a dystopian empire, therefore a caution against a tyrannical government. Her contempt for the ignorant Professor Piexoto is expressed through his pompous tone, and the assuredness which he presents his incorrect findings. Piexioto's carelessness can be perceived as haughtiness, thus revealing the characteristics Atwood would despise in her readers. The ability for a book to mock a reader, literally stopping him/her mid-read, demonstrates Atwood's powerful control of her writing. Thus, Atwood's work stands out by allowing readers the second chance to fully understand her work of fiction. The humiliation of the professor provokes the reader to reread the story out of embarrassment, if not out of her determination to unearth previous details that he/she had missed in the first read. If in the first time a reader only skims without comprehending her purpose, the epilogue is a sharp scold. However, if a reader is not even competent enough to realize his/her mistake, then the Handmaid's Tale is beyond them.As a last caution: read this book with care and consideration. It is a fulfilling and rewarding novel to the very end. Adept readers can mock Professor Piexioto along with Atwood, but they need the perception and patience to truly appreciate the morals of the Handmaid's Tale themselves."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is an excellent book. Margaret Atwood weaves a masterful tale, which is made more poignant by her pacing. The book does not give to much information about the protagonist or about the world she lives in too early, it comes at a gradual pace, and they grow from one another. This is a good character based novel and dystopia novel in one. It shows one of the many ways a radical Christian puritan ideology could manifest into a oppressive theocracy. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" serves as a warning, a social examination and an exploration of the possibilities from the revival of religious conservatism. In her chilling dystopian novel Atwood, much like Orwell did with 1984, pushes the political trends to their plausible extremes. The American democracy is replaced by the theocratic Republic of Gilead. Women lose their rights as citizens and as humans, ranked by the vitality of their wombs; if their wombs don't work, their social status is lowered even further. The novel centers mainly around the degradation of women and their loss of everything, including the control of their physical body.Atwood writes \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" in a direct and sometimes graphic manner, narrating the life in the Republic of Gilead through the eyes of a Handmaid, the Republic's birthing vehicles. Although some literary reviews have criticized Atwood's abrupt ending and inclusion of the last chapter, I found both added to the message of \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\". For some reason I cannot quite put to words, the last chapter made the possibility of a fundamental theocratic state seem much more possible and logical if church and state do achieve separation.Reading this book of speculative fiction forced me to re-evaluate if my rights might ever be taken away like Offred and all the other women in the novel. How Bush, hardcore conservative views and the raising of Christian affect the politics of today's world and my rights? Would I be reduced to a walking womb, if not worse? I gained a new appreciation for my rights as a citizen of the United States of America, ones that I once taken granted, and gratitude for the feminists and others who fought for the legal recognition of my inalienable rights."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is a unique novel which takes place in the Republic of Gilead, a futuristic society in which many of its citizens' rights are taken from them. This story was riveting because it had many fantastical elements that kept the story interesting. The plot centers around Offred, a handmaid in the new society and her struggle to adapt to the new society. Throughout the novel, Margaret Atwood cleverly interweaves many different narratives together, jumping around from present time to the past, flashing back to Offred's life with her family with whom she is separated from. Written in a first person point of view, this novel relays feelings of a journal or diary, with Offred describing her innermost thoughts and feelings to the reader which conveys the evils of an oppressive society. Personally I found the novel very fascinating and insightful, and with the seamless blend between the elements of past and present the plot is never illogical or confusing. The actual writing of the novel is very imaginative and descriptive, with varied syntax and embellished language, enhancing the reading experience. I found myself sucked into the book's complex plot and I enjoyed reading it. Each character undergoes many complex emotions, making them very dynamic and the reader is able to connect with each character. The main character, Offred, has a wide range of emotions throughout the novel, and is fully developed and intricate. Atwood does a magnificent job of creating a tone that mirrors the feeling created by everything that happens. Additionally, the conclusion of the story enlightens the reader and reveals a lot about the story's style and its presentation. It clears up many of the seemingly unrelated topics and makes the book that much more unique and different.However, the one knock about this book is its seemingly empty and vacuous plot, with no action whatsoever. At times, the dense, embellished descriptions make for a hard-to-read, complicating novel that seems to lack substance. I must admit that though the elements of the story are fresh and new, the repetitive nature of the situation, which is bleak and hopeless for the main characters, hurts the story. Also, the book does not actually contain real plot, and is instead made up of descriptions and feelings, coupled with flashbacks. Though the story is entertaining, its lack of action and static plot can make it boring and uninteresting at times."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Living in a society where we are free to do exactly what we want, it is hard to imagine living in a culture where women are restricted to go on with their everyday lives and must be enslaved to the caste system of a male-dominant society. In The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, Atwood illustrates how the choices one makes can influence his or her life in many different ways. Though a controversial book that often depict women as only \\"sex slaves\\" to the men of the Republic of Gilead, The Handmaid's Tale provoked me to ask questions about the current situation of our society. Some may find that this book is blunt in its words, often depicting the acts of sexual pleasure given to the men by the women as something that is not pleasurable but rather tedious. Although this book was slow in the beginning, demonstrated by Atwood's description of each setting and character, it quickly picked up its pace as Offred revealed her place in society. Atwood has a special way of introducing new information to the readers through Offred and in my opinion, is the best way she chooses to utilize her style in the book.This book is meant for someone who not only wants to be challenged but also entertained. Though at times the information is confusing, as Offred jumps back and forth between the past and the present, Atwood uses a superb way of illustrating the text to actually allow readers to understand the situation of Gilead and how women are suppressed in the society. When I was reading this book, there were times where I could not stop reading but there were also times when I felt the urge to put the book down and not finish it. But as I continued reading and received more insight of the story through Offred, I was captivated at how strongly Atwood was able to demonstrate the pain Offred felt in the Gilead society. This book is worth buying and keeping in your book shelf for many years to come."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Wow! I found this to be an excellent book! When I first began, I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it because it took my a chapter or so to get into the &quot;rythym&quot; of Atwood's writing. After I got into it, however, I could not put it down. Atwood - here - creates an entirely possible world and characters that are eerily familiar. A Must Read!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"If you really want to scare yourself, read this book along with \\"1984\\" and \\"A Brave New World\\" within a couple week period. Doing this will scare you more than any horror movie or book ever will. Why? Because these three books were all written years ago (mid 1980's for this one) and they keep getting closer to becoming fact instead of fiction.Maybe you see things with a different political slant than I do, but give this a read.1) A Handmaids Tale - A fundamentalist religous group has taken control of the country and immediatelty imposes Biblical law. Women are subject to control by man and those that can reproduce (the environment is so polluted that infertility is rampant) are kept as slaves for families that cannot have children. --- More than any of the other two stories, this one has already come close to fact in many third world countries. Most notably - the recently Taliban controlled Afghanistan.2) 1984 - A world in which we are constantly at war. An elite class of people rules and enjoys all the luxuries while the rest must try and get by every day. Oh yeah, in order to maintain the safety of the empire/country everyone is under constant surveillance and can be arrested and imprisoned without trial. -- Sound slightly familiar?3) A Brave New World - An elite class controls society and spends their time taking \\"Soma\\" a drug that relieves anxiety and allows them to live in complete peace and ignorance. Instead of working, the elite class has devised a way to clone people to do the laborious work. --- \\"Soma\\" could be television of Prozac, while cloning is becoming more of a reality.Read them. Then watch as they slowly come to life."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"THE HANDMAID'S TALE is Margaret Atwood's cautionary future myth of the United States (aka the Republic of Gilead) having fallen under the total domination of the Religious Right. Atwood's novel is one of the most readable and effective entries in the antiutopian genre that includes classics like 1984, ANTHEM, WE, BRAVE NEW WORLD, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and THE IRON HEEL.Atwood's Gilead is a society where most persons are sterile due to environmental toxins, and where women like \\"Offred\\" the narrator are used as Biblical handmaids, to bear children for the ruling elite.There is a sterile white heat which envelops THE HANDMAID'S TALE throughout, an almost sibilant silence to the book. Society is patriarchical and rigidly hierarchical: Commanders wear black, Wives wear blue, \\"Marthas\\" (servant women) wear dowdy green, \\"Econowives\\" (non-elite spouses) wear cheap striped dresses, and Handmaids wear billowing red with white blinders, symbolic of the menses.Handmaids are allowed out only to shop (the stores have pictures of foods, never worded labels), and little or no communication goes on between members of the household. This gives Offred extended periods to ruminate on her past life as a wife and mother in 20th century America, and to compare and contrast this new society with the old. Atwood has caught flack from certain quarters for idealizing our capitalist culture, but it certainly is freer than the world of Offred.Even in this stultified society, undercurrents exist. The Commander begins to surreptitiously invite Offred into his study to play Scrabble, and sneaks her out to one of the few remaining \\"gentlemen's clubs\\"; he complains of his loveless marriage. The Wife promises to help find Offred's vanished daughter in exchange for favors. The Chauffeur, Nick, begins a love affair with Offred; and as the book progresses, Offred becomes aware of a shadowy Underground, \\"Mayday,\\" designed to help women escape from Gilead. In the end, she leaves the Commander's house, but whether to live or die we never discover.Strongly pro-feminist, democratic and egalitarian, THE HANDMAID'S TALE is a terrifying glimpse into a future of darkness, the penumbra of which is already touching most Americans' lives."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood is a Canadian writer and poet of some substance, judging from her many literary awards. She is a self-described activist who is not afraid to part ways with the Left when she chooses. Still....there are problems that must be addressed. For one, many of her works leave one cold and perplexed though the nature or this particular work seems to have addressed at least the latter problem.Let's start with the basics - this is science fiction writing at its worst, the kind that features extremely unlikely scenarios without reference to historical or contemporary trends. Despite this, it is also a very good story even if in that inimitable, ackward stilted prose that seems an Atwood trademark. The idea of a future classroom studying an American theocracy is not so much insulting as ridiculous since any oddsmaker will give the chances of an American fundamentalist coup at 100,000-1.I thought at first that this was a parable but the moral message was somehow omitted. In any case, it is a tale of a young lady, a handmaid to the wife of a powerful leader in the regime. The ruling class resembles not so much religious fundamentalists as those believers of secular religions (socialism, fascism, etc).Despite their almost worshipful reliance upon Old Testament teachings - absurd in the light of rampant Bibical illiteracy - the rulers are almost uniformly corrupt and hypocritical. In the end Offred manages to take her just revenge, escape and join the Revolution.Atwood had difficulty deciding the paramount issue - feminism, religion, politics, economics...all were involved in some literary diatribes. Men, religion, acquiescent women, rulers and the market economy seemed to take it on the chin as a matter of course. The problem in the end is that Atwood (or any so-called \\"activist\\") fails to offer an alternative society in which they not only have all the material goods they want but are equally able to offer protests whenever they like. They may do one or the other, it seems, but not both."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Both shocking and sad, Atwood presents us with a story that leaves the reader feeling sick at the end. Offred (name withheld) is in a world where pregnancy is the main goal of women. And those who go against the new norm are to be punished. It has a Nazi/1984 kind of feel to it. Normally, when stories have such a plotline as this, I would zip through it to find out the conclusion, but Atwood weaves beautiful language in with the wonderfully-constructed plot, and I found myself slowing down just to savor the beauty of it. It's truly a masterpiece, a modern classic, and those artistes who say classics can't be achieved these days be damned. She also leaves you with the feeling that this could happen, that one day, in the future, our government could wind up like this.

I've been reading all of her novels (excluding the previously read books) for my Project Atwood Challenge, but I just couldn't get rid of this one.Leah from Books Speak Volumes and I were discussing the book recently, and decided to reread it together. Which was fun because we could chat about the book and both of us found symbolism or had interesting facts about different things from the book!I'm finding it tough to write a review of this book, so here's an edited version (spoilers taken out) of what I emailed to Leah:First of all, I still love this book so much. Margaret Atwood does such a great job of slowly revealing the characters, their stories, and the dystopian society where they live. It's amazing how she does it!I didn't remember not knowing for so long what the main character's \\"job\\" is. It was about 25% of the way into the book before you found out about Offred's main purpose as a Handmaid, what she actually has to do, even though you might be able to figure it out beforehand.There is a lot of imagery that is used to convey sexuality, too. For instance, Serena Joy's perfume was called Lily of the Valley, and the shop where the Handmaid's dresses are purchased was called Lilies of the Field. I know that Chinese foot binding is a very sexual thing, with the goal of having \\"lily feet,\\" which are to only be seen and touched by their husbands. Also, flowers are all over the place in the beginning of the book, and even Offred says that they possess the reproductive parts of plants.How sad I would be if I couldn't read (like the Handmaids)!!! It kind of reminds me of how people didn't want slaves reading, because knowledge is power.As I was reading, I also kept thinking of good Quotable Friday quotes for Leah, one of her segments on her Books Speak Volumes blog. I think my favorite so far is this: \\"We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the stories.\\"To sum it up, The Handmaid's Tale is even better the third time around. I now can appreciate the imagery without rushing through to understand the plot, and just take my time allowing the story to expand on its own.The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is my favorite book of all time.

Atwood weaves such a heart-rending tale that is both empowering and terrifying. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In this fascinating novel, Margaret Atwood paints a grim picture of a future ruled by a strict religious regime. In The Republic of Gilead, formerly part of the United States, women have no control over their lives. They are not permitted to own property, their marriages are arranged, they must cover themselves head to toe in public. They are little more than housemaids and breeding stock for the male-dominated society.Our guide through this strange new world is Offred, a former career woman who is now a &quot;handmaiden,&quot; an involuntary surrogate mother. Offred's character is smart and ruefully funny; her sharp observations and turns of phrase carry the novel through some feminist and environmentalist preaching. Offred's narration makes this tale of oppression and hopelessness a surprisingly light read. She is a real, believable character, and her story is complex and rewarding.Just as George Orwell wrote 1984 as a commentary on society in 1948, Atwood's Gilead is already in place. Substitute the Christian coalition in the novel for Islam, and Gilead is in Iraq and Iran. More chilling than the idea that a misogynistic, totalitarian society *could* exist in the U.S. is that it already exists elsewhere."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is quite possibly the best-written book I've ever hated to read. Ms. Atwood's writing skills are superb and she takes an otherwise dreadfully slow paced and hideous book of man- and woman-bashing and makes it quite a good read. Her writing skills not withstanding, the book is entirely without a single good point. One expects from feminist literature something new and interesting in the examination of the relationship between the sexes. Amy Tan in The Joy Luck Club brought us an interesting look at what feminism means to Asian-American women. It doesn't happen in this book, which is filled with trite stereotypes and two-dimensional figures. One expects strong female role models, characters worthy of emulation. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon gave us both villainous and heroic women who were nevertheless fascinating studies as strong female characters. This novel, sad to say, lacks even a single female worthy of a moment's consideration. More disappointingly, it falls back on trite and overworked male bashing in lieu of actually having anything original to say on the subject of male-female relationships.Misandry is sadly to be expected from many types of feminist literature, and this novel is a good example of this trend. Ms. Atwood didn't feel it good enough to simply make a few of the male characters in her novel lacking in merit, nor did she feel it good enough to make most of the male characters poor examples of their kind. No, for Ms. Atwood nothing less than the total male population of her novel had to be self-serving, ill defined, and quite flat models for her venomous attacks.The kindest male character in the book, the one character that Offred truly cares for, is her lost husband Luke. Even this character, under scrutiny, boils down to loathsome traits of which not all men, despite Ms. Atwood's beliefs, are predisposed. Luke, for one thing, began dating Offred while he was still married to his first wife. Moira \\"disapproved of Luke, back then. Not of Luke but of the fact that he was married.\\" (171). Offred's great love, it appears, left his first wife for a \\"newer model,\\" or so it would appear, as Luke is described as being older than Offred. Offred later describes him as being rather taken with the idea of her new legally enforced servility. After finding out that his wife has no legal rights to property under the new regime, he seems to take it in stride with aplomb. \\"He doesn't mind this,...\\" Offred thinks, \\"He doesn't mind it at all. Maybe he even likes it. We are not each other's, anymore. Instead, I am his.\\" (182). Yes, this woman's great love, the man she pines for throughout the entire novel, kinda likes the idea of having his wife as property.Offred's mother is perhaps the guiltiest party in the book to carry on misandristic demagoguery. \\"What do I need [men] for, I don't want a man around, what use are they except for ten seconds' worth of half babies. A man is just a woman's strategy for making other women.\\" (121) Many of the Aunts are good for a line or two, as well. \\"Men are sex machines, said Aunt Lydia, and not much more. They only want one thing.\\" (144). Elsewhere she warns her charges that \\"Modesty is invisibility ... Never forget it. To be seen -- to be seen -- is to be -- her voice trembled -- penetrated.\\" (28) Even Andrea Dworkin never went that far.Perhaps this stereotyping wouldn't be quite so bad, on it's own. It would definitely make for flat reading and an uninteresting cast of characters, if not for the outright violation, albeit mentally, of the Commander by Offred. In quite the vilest simile I have ever read in my life, Offred daydreams of knifing the Commander, of slipping a shiv between his ribs, \\"I think about the blood coming out of him, hot as soup, sexual, over my hands.\\" (140) Had this passage been written by a male author, or had this passage been a man thinking this about a woman, the entire feminine press, and much of the left wing press as well, would have immediately risen in outraged indignity over the equation of this act of violence with a sexual act. Andrea Dworkin would have risen into the air and bellowed that this was just the sort of outrageous misogynistic rape that the male culture perpetually pressed on women. Since it wasn't, not a peep. It seems this type of violent sexual assault is only wrong when perpetuated by men against women, the reverse does not seem to hold true.Far more confusing than the rather trite use of male bashing by the book's author is the author's clear misogynistic attitudes, as well. Male bashing may well be expected in a feminist novel, but the woman bashing seems intuitively counterproductive to the apparent aims of the novel. There seems, in fact, to be an utter lack of strong female characters in this novel, at least ones who aren't simultaneously misogynistic themselves. Serena Joy, the Commander's wife, certainly seems like a fairly strong character, but then she helped to create the world she currently lives in, though she may not bee too happy about the results (46). The Aunt's are certainly strong characters, but they're bad guys, no doubt about it. They are responsible for the indoctrination and enslavement of women to the purposes of the Gileadean regime. Which leaves us with Moira and Offred herself.First, let me dispatch with Offred. While in the Red center, while still fresh from the outside, she takes readily to the indoctrination of the Aunts and actively participates on tearing down Janine, who has suffered a rape in the past, by blaming her for the rape, by claiming it was her fault. \\"For a moment ... we despised her.\\" (72) Later, while holding the dirty little secret of her affair with her Commander in mind, she thinks of Serena thusly, \\"I now had power over her, of a kind, although she didn't know it. And I enjoyed that. Why pretend? I enjoyed it a lot.\\" (162) Let us not forget that this isn't her first affair, either. In regards to Offred's relationship with Luke \\"[Moira] said I was poaching, on another woman's ground.\\" She later becomes so self-absorbed and wrapped up in her little affair with Nick that she refuses to help the resistance when asked.I can't, I say to Ofglen. I'm too afraid. Anyway I'd be no good at that, I'd get caught. I scarcely take the trouble to sound regretful, so lazy have I become. We could get you out, she says. We can get people out if we really have to, if they're in danger. Immediate danger. The fact is I no longer want to leave, escape, cross the border to freedom. I want to be here, with Nick, where I can get at him. (271)This total capitulation, this acceptance of her slave state, this total passivity of hers is what makes her most pitiful, and hateful. Even her fantasies of escape revolve around Luke somehow making a miraculous rescue and reuniting her with her husband and daughter (106). But she takes no active role in attempting any escapes, nor an active role in much of anything that I can see. She is utterly passive and lets the world simply roll over her and then bemoans her fate when it does.What, then, can we make of Moira? She is at least active. She cares for others actively and vehemently. In the Red center when Janine has a nervous breakdown and becomes unresponsive to real world stimuli, it is Moira who takes command of the situation and manages to snap her out of it before the Aunts return (215-17). She even manages to make an escape from the Red center (130-33) and contact the \\"Underground Frailroad\\" (another bit of misplaced misogyny) and almost manages to escape the country before she is caught. I had hope that here, finally, I might find a strong character, and I certainly found the strongest in the book. But in the end, even Moira capitulates and chooses a life as a prostitute in \\"The Club,\\" better known as Jezebel's to the girls that work there. Her life span will be brief, perhaps \\"three or four good years before your snatch wears out and they send you to the boneyard.\\" (249)So, in the end, even Moira gives up. Pity. The novel would have been far more interesting if it had simply been written about Moira and left Offred as a supporting character."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Timeless novel.

When I got to the end, I sort of shook my head and said \\"yah, so what was the point?\\" Atwood seems to be trying to make a commentary on gender and sex roles in this novel, but I don't think she quite makes it there. I was hoping that the end of the book would see the handmaid running from her master or throwing herself into her role or ... something! Instead the novel just kind of peters out and nothing really comes of it. Too bad, because there could have been so much more there."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"However, that present is in Islamic areas, where women literally *are* second class citizens. When a woman is raped, it is the woman who is punished (sometimes a brutal flogging) as it is assumed somehow she enticed the man.Margaret Atwood is a talented author and I have enjoyed some of her other works. But to see a supposedly concerned feminist being worked into hysterics over an entirely unlikely and theoretical oppression of women by the Christian right in the future while completely ignoring an ACTUAL and BRUTAL widespread oppression of women all over the Islamic world happening NOW, TODAY really is jarring.The curtain of theocratic dystopianism seems to always be descending on America, yet it always lands in the Muslim world.Why not write some books celebrating the heroines who have stood up against the oppression in the Islamic world?

I did find this book well written and quite complex. Margret Atwood did an excellent job in writing this novel because of all of the different dynamics she used. The Handmaid's Tale presents a new type of dystopia then the novels such as 1984 and Fahrenheit 451, which made this novel unique. The Handmaid's Tale, which is a feminist novel, depicts an alternate reality (a dystopia) where men appear to have complete control and power, while ironically the women (specifically the handmaids) hold the actual power. The women in Gilead have freedom from, but no longer freedom to (pg. 24). Offred, a handmaid, recapitulates her experiences from before and after Gilead became established.Offred represents a complex and dynamic character. She has many struggles within herself which develops her personality. Despite these characteristic which would seem to make Offred an interesting character, she annoyed me. Margret Atwood tries to have the reader sympathize with Offred because of the oppression that Gilead's government has pushed on her. Instead of sympathizing with Offred, I felt that she just complained and sulked throughout the entire novel. Offred always talked about how she wished to escape Gilead and find her husband and daughter. Instead of taking any initiative she would lie in her bed and feel sorry for herself. Offred had no perseverance or courage which Moira (Offred's best friend) clearly showed. If The Handmaid's Tale profiled Moira and not Offred it would have given the novel a more intriguing and exciting main character.An aspect of this novel that I severely disliked was all of the chronotopes. A chronotope is \\"a thickening of time in a particular place. As an event or image in a text gains important, the passage of the time allows down to present its details to the reader\\". In The Handmaid's Tale when Offred would go into a chronotope it always gave the reader information about her old life. The reader learned about Offred's family, the strange transformation of Gilead, and the events that happened at the RED Center. These chronotopes usually happened when Offred had a conflict going on (mentally or physically). I dreaded each chronotope that Offred ever said because each chronotope was long, dull, and tiring to read. Margret Atwood should have not made the chronotopes such a significant part of In The Handmaid's Tale. Without all of the chronotopes I would have enjoyed the novel much better.The lack of knowledge given to the reader throughout The Handmaid's Tale irritated me quite a bit. Margret Atwood mentions many events and things in the novel, but she did not explain them well. At many points in the novel I was confused because of the lack of explanation. I wish Atwood would have given more details on how Gilead became established because the reasons for the development seemed unlikely and pointless. Offred never fully developed her thoughts which would always leave me wondering what Offred was doing. I just had so many unanswered questions during the reading of this novel and none of them were ever answered. I am sure Atwood did this on purpose to support the theme of the unknown, but it was frustrating for me.I suggest that high school students should read this because of the literary content. I did learn a lot from this novel and found the ideas and themes interesting. Atwood raises complex questions throughout this novel such as, \\"What would you do in Offred's situation?\\" and \\"What would happen if the United States became a totalitarian government?\\" However, I did not find this novel entertaining. It is definitely a book for English class or for people who like science fiction novels.(I had to write this review for English class)"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I received the product within 3 business days and the product was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Upon reading the synopsis of this book, one felt captivated immediatly. On preparing myself for the acclaimed 1984ish style and structure, I expected a nightmare which truely provoked raw emotion. How wrong I was. True, it would be unfair to say the book was crap, as it is clearly written with careful attention so as to create maximum thought and impact. The plot too holds a lot of promise but never delivers the Orwellian dread that could have been. Margaret Atwood is a woman with a lot to say, but unfortunatly does not possess the skill to put all this into a single coverbound dissertation. As a poet, metaphor is second nature to Atwood, a fact which becomes increasingly obvious as the novel progresses. Atwood's major error in writing this book is that she assumed that everybody would be captivated by her style and hold on until the very end of the book (Historical Notes) when all is revealed and the final piece of the puzzle slots neatly into place. As a feminist who clearly targets females as her audience, Atwood forgot that to ever be a literary classic, the book must be readable by all. A study of other reviews in this section will show that feminine readers will award excellent marks and the masculine minded will denounce the book as boring crap. Love it or hate it, the book is a good one so long as it is viewed through a womens eyes. Much of the &quot;horror&quot; is aimed at women and provoking them into thinking that this could happen. As a male reader, I found this complete bunk and much of the tension was lost on me. Proclaiming this text suitable for academic study may be a mistake. To assess the text well enough to get an &quot;A&quot;, one must read between the lines and think as a woman.

Don't waste your time.Criticisms of the book fall into these three categories:1) It is boorish, vulgar, and obscene.2) It is poorly written. It's not great, or even good literature.3) It is politically correct, agenda driven literature, with a preposterous plot.Boorish, obscene, poorly writtenAmazon asks reviewers not to use distasteful, vulgar or obscene selections from the book when reviewing a book. Therefore, these quotes are not included in this review. You will have to search elsewhere for examples of these quotes. Nor is one supposed to direct you to the sites, so this information is not provided either. Suffice it to say there is much vulgarity and sexually sadistic imagery, and that this is one of the major problems with the book.Poorly writtenApart from its boorishness, one can make these observations about the writing: The novel feels contrived throughout; it is a paint-by-the-numbers dystopian fantasy. The characters are undeveloped and poorly defined; one doesn't really care what happens to any of them. There is no suspense. There is glacial movement to the so-called plot. All the sexual relationships in the book involve dominating or using another person: there is no genuine love. The author has the most annoying habit of using commas and periods incessantly. It is so boring! When the author writes on page 267 \\"...I keep going on with this sad and hungry and sordid, this limping and mutilated story... after all you've been through, you deserve all I have left, which is not much...\\" she is telling the truth! It is the literary equivalent of listening to the drone of a bagpipe with no accompanying melody.Politically correct, agenda driven literatureThe book is about a future takeover of the U. S. Government by the \\"religious right\\" and the imposition of a totalitarian regime. It's pathologically anti-Christian, \\"Christo-phobic\\" one might say.The regime lynches abortionists, homosexuals and pornographers. Women can't own property, read, or receive an education. They are only valued for their ability to bear children. For some unexplained reason, most women are infertile. The men with the power, the Commanders, are given \\"handmaids\\" (fertile women dressed in nun's habits). A commander, after reading from the Bible and praying to God for help, ceremonially rapes his handmaid, in hopes that she will \\"bear fruit.\\"The author's anti-Christian animus becomes clearer if one adapts the plot:In this version, the United States is taken over by a phallic cult of male homosexuals who have moved up the ranks of the military. Young pubescent men are held captive, and ceremonially raped by their masters. Catholic priests and pastors who speak out against this are lynched with the verse of Romans 1:27 pinned to their chests.Wouldn't this adaptation of the book be considered \\"homophobic\\"? So too is this book Christophobic.When one considers that the Godless totalitarian regimes of Mao, Stalin, Hitler and Pol Pot murdered well over 100 million people in the last century, and the continuing forced abortions in China in this century, one has question the rationality of the author's morbid fears of a \\"takeover\\" by the religious right. But it is this politically correct agenda, and not the book's literary value, that explains its appeal to leftist intellectuals:\\"Among the many third-rate books that English professors waste their students' time on (when they could be teaching truly great English Literature) is Margaret Atwood's 1986 The Handmaid's Tale... The Handmaid's Tale is the quintessential expression of our intellectuals' fears of what a truly Christian culture would look like.\\" (From The Politically Incorrect Guide to English and American Literature, by Elizabeth Kantor, Ph.D., p. 27)Reading this book is a terrible waste of time. It brings to mind the sign at the beginning of Gone with the Wind: \\"Do not squander time; it is the stuff life is made of.\\" If you want to read a good \\"dystopian\\" novel, try Brave New World. It portrays a society in which people are controlled via sexual and drug induced pleasure instead of brute force, and people's thinking is kept on a material plane by depriving them of \\"pornography\\" such as the Bible and the Imitation of Christ. Or read something by someone who's lived in a totalitarian state, such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, or The Gulag Archipelago. Or one might read The Canterbury Tales, for an idea of what it might have been like to have lived in a more genuinely Christian time."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"well all i have to say about this book is that to me it sucked. no matter how futuristic it got or how good it attempted to get it just couldn't hold my interest. the historical notes did alot for me but it still didn't make me remember this book. definitly not one of my favorites. i wouldn't ever read this book again i can tell u that for a fact. jacki.a"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Those of you who like Atwood will enjoy this book,...

Don't think I am an illiterate jock. I am the opposite. I understand the book, and it is nothing but a great example of Atwood's disillusioned view of society. Never will anything remotely like the Republic of Gilead be formed. Atwood's intentionally vivid description of the impregnation ritual is unnecessary. I am not offended by it, I am disgusted by it. NEVER in any english class will a book written by a male rights activist be required reading, so why should we read a book by an outdated feminist? Ever since women (deservedly) got the vote, feminists have had to scrounge for stuff to gripe about. Take Ally McBeal, for example. Feminism was successful, and now is no longer necessary in North America. In this day and age, women get good jobs, and are treated equally, sometimes better than men. They are not, and never will be, brainless robots used as fetus containers. (That's just my opinion. Buy the book, if you believe the hype.)"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"My Book Club assigned this book. I never would have chose it on my own.

And what's the first thing they teach you in driver's ed? Look for the symbols, watch for the sign of the school, or the red hexagon to stop. It's really scary if you think about it. But all the same, this was an incredible novel. Margret Atwood's vivid dipiction of the City of Gilead made the book less like a work of fiction, and more like a history lesson. Hours after I read, I would still be thinking &quot; I wonder if this was how it was when the City of Gilead was around.&quot; And then I would remember that it wasn't a real place!

If you want details, read the first two reviews.As for Alicia Simpson's review, she doesn't know what it means to have an overt political agenda in a book, which Atwood did not. Atwood simply told a story about a futuristic society that oppressed many groups of people (based on story references). Atwood just told the story from ONE WOMAN's perspective. You want to see an overt political agenda in a novel, try reading anything by Ayn Rand, who is good for putting 50+ page political speeches (just speeches!) in her novels.As for Alicia's comment about \\"sullen, feminist...\\", I think Alicia might be suffering from the female hatred that our society instills in everyone, male or female. Alicia thinks this book is about a woman's story. But I think it was HUMANITY'S STORY, through a woman's eyes.As for Alicia's response to the profound, violent sexism in the story, isn't it amazing how some women are so conditioned NOT to care about their rights, that they ANGRY when someone else does?

The general idea of the novel is not bad at all, but the style of writing is very boring. For people who are not interested in depressing dystopias it's a waste of time to read it. The story is often confusing and incoherent. Also the fast changing time levels make it hard to read.Even though it was a torture for me to read it (at school), the topic of the book makes quite sense as we all live in a fragile society and it is not unrealistic that we might end in a world described in the book. So that's why i gave two stars of five."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In this novel Atwood seems to want to tell us lots of earth-shattering things about gender, repression and the social climate of 1980s America. She may well have succeeded - but for me any such message was occluded by her embarassing, cringeworthy prose. She suffers from the same malady that riddles DeLillo's prose: one very long sentence, lots of clauses, usually lacking conjunctives, unusual punctuation; then the surprising fragmentary sentence which really makes everyone think.Thus.(Both writers seem to have a proclivity for indenting these little asides.)So we get such bellyflops as:How I wasted them, those rooms, that freedom from being seen.Rented licence.andWhat I feel towards them is blankess. What I feel is that I must not feel. What I feel is partly relief, because none of these men is Luke. Luke wasn't a doctor. Isn't.To me this lacks elegance; and the harder she pushes the poetry, the pithier it appears: viz.:Now the flesh arranges itself differently. I'm a cloud, congealed around a central object, the shape of a pear, which is hard and more real than I am and glows red within its translucence.or -You've killed her, I said. She looked like an angel, solemn, compact, made of air.or -Still, it must be hell, to be a man, like that.It must be just fine.It must be hell.It must be very silent.or even -The sitting room is subdued, symmetrical; it's one of the shapes money takes when it freezes.If that kind of prose is your bag, I hope you enjoy it; personally I found it unbearable. I have heard Atwood speak on the radio and she was very eloquent...maybe I should try another of her novels."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"While I agree with many reviewers that the subject matter is interesting and perhaps relevant to today, where women are stripped of rights in some places in the world, I did not like this book. As a result of her situation, Offred's character holds herself distant from the world around her. While a reasonable response to a screwed-up world, her narrating is just as distant and flat and I found myself not really caring what happened to her. The plot moved very slowly, and I wound up reading the plot synopsis on Wikipedia just to see if anything better is coming. It doesn't appear so, and so I'm not sure if I'll even bother with the last few chapters of the book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book was written very well. I had the creeps while I was reading it. It reminded me of the movie \\"Children of Men\\" and the book \\"The Giver\\". The entire time I was reading this book, I kept thinking of a certain female vice presidential candidate. I am afraid that she would love the form of government that is described. This is a short read. Give it a whirl."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"As the U.S. marches closer to Gilead, Atwood's classic dystopia becomes more clairvoyant daily. Ms. Atwood, a Canadian has said that American women ask her how soon Gilead will come.The Handmaid's Tale is a disturbing look at the logical outcomes of current policy and trends. It is the perfect introduction to speculative fiction for Liberals to give to Conservative friends, perhaps in a gift pack including 1984 and Anglomerika. It is also an excellent primer for 2nd generation feminists to give to the upcoming generation to remind them of what we fight against and to prevent.Besides the &quot;If This Goes On --&quot; polemics, The Handmaid's Tale has a riveting plot, complex characterizations, and a mastery of the reflective use of English. While the book could not exist without the politics, the politics are a setting, not the focus of the story. Thus, it is a truly great novel."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This actually is a very interesting book, however the similarities between it and '1984' are stricking. Not being a women or femanist I didnt always appreciate the depictions of a patriacal society Atwood seems to manifest. However the first person form of the book adds to its futuristic storyline making it quite belivable and personal to the reader. A must read for any fans of dysutopian fiction, not to mention femanists."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Atwood is good with words, but doesn't handle ideas quite as well; not a combination that augurs well for a dystopia in a century which has already produced some of the best. This would have made a fine piece of historical fiction -- the purported diary of a young Roman or medieval woman, for example -- but doesn't work (for me at least) as a cautionary tale about the future or commentary on our own times. If the concluding &quot;notes&quot; were intended to mock the insufferable superficialities of academic conferences, Atwood gets full marks there.From the little I've read of her books and poetry, I sense that Atwood's one major flaw is that she trips over her own cleverness.This isn't a bad book, but I wouldn't call it a must-read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"SDCSGBBVXZCZDSEedESEFVDV EFDWDC;SKDCS DFNSJKFNHK,S"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"When I first started reading, I enjoyed the beginning. It captivated me and I expected a really good, developed story. However, as I continued, the monotany and general boredom took over my thoughts and the book became a horrible chore to read. Margaret Atwood also drove me up the wall with her lack of astounding vocabulary. She never diversified her words. By the end of the novel, I was thoroughly disappointed and I refused to read the historical notes. I didn't feel like going through the epitomy of boredom for another 20 pages."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Can you imagine sexism and homophobia mingling with government?

How could she know then that by 2004 this nation would be dangerously rushing toward the reality she foresaw? In 1985, the only way she could envision the government of the US being taken over by religious idealogues was through violence (assassinating the president, machine-gunning the Congress). How could she know that 20 years later the government would be usurped from within?I think this book should be required reading for any United States citizen who may be concerned about the direction our present administration is taking the government. It's very scary and not at all implausible."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book had a shocking and interesting idea behind it, but the actual story was somewhat lacking. While the idea of Womankind being totally subservient to men is appalling, it definitley keeps the reader riveted. That said, I found myself wanting to know more about who Offred was before she was a Handmaid. What was her real name? Her daughter's? I realize that the reason Ms. Atwood did not share those details was because Offred was basically supposed to be Everywoman, yet in a sense I felt a little cheated after I finished this book. I thought that the ending was totally lacking. What ever did happen to Luke? Offred? Was she pregnant? I would not recommend this book to anybody who dislikes cliffhanger endings."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Halfway through this book we went on vacation, and I thought great, it's gonna take me forever to finish this book. Wrong! I read it every chance I could get, in the car, at the hotel, in between our excursions, I loved it! It was completely unbelievable, but entertaining nonetheless.This is a story of the 'future' (the future of 20 years ago, since that's when this book was written) told by Handmaid Offred (meaning Of Fred, i.e. belonging to). After the Presidents Day Massacre, the government was taken over by what I gathered to be an Islamic terrorist group, and women were stripped of all rights. They were no longer allowed to carry money, speak out, read or write. They were torn away from their family and assigned jobs, such as Martha's (maids, housekeepers), Jezebels (whores), Handmaids (child bearers), and Wives (married to the prestigious Commanders).Offred tells her story to us, about how she yearns to know what became of her family and friends, how she came to be a Handmaid, and everyone's new life in The Republic of Gilead (formally the United States). She speaks of the underground workings that try to help people flee the country, and how it gets harder and harder to remember the 'past times', she tells us about The Wall, and the people that hang from it, and a little about how the new government works.Overall I recommend this book. It's very different from everything else I normally read, but I enjoyed it immensely. I didn't look at this as some reviewers here did, and that was thinking Margaret Atwood was actually trying to predict the future...that's ridiculous. I took this for what it was, an incredibly powerful tale about one possibility of the future of the United States, and a look into what life would be like if women didn't have all the freedoms we have today. Definitely give this book a shot, it may not be for everyone, but you never know."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"As a female conservative, I approached this book with a great deal of trepidation, knowing of its reputation as a parable for the left. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the writing and story-telling (and for this I give it three stars) but the overall quality of the novel is marred by the blatantly circumscribed view of Christianity presented in the book as well as the lack of her distopia's relation to reality. One of the most important tenets of Christian Doctrine is to respect the individual, and for Atwood to portray the supposedly Christian society of Gilead as having zero respect for individual rights and to be all-concerned with status and dominance does not ring true in the slightest.Several of the other reviewers argue that Atwood's vision is not at all farfetched because of the state of women in Islamic countries. Exactly! I had the same thought in the back of my head the whole time I was reading this book. It is so-called Islamic countries in the Middle East and not Western nations where women are limited to lives as wives and mothers and where the sanctity of the individual is not respected. Had Atwood set her novel in present-day Iran or Iraq, it would ring true in a way that setting it in near-future-day America does not. We have a centuries-old tradition of respecting individual rights in America. Atwood's suggestion that we are on the brink of negating centuries of human progress in the way we view individual rights, in the one place in the world (the West, that is) where they are consistently respected, stinks of feminist fearmongering. And her constant harping on abortion \\"rights\\" gets really old, especially when contrasted with actual evils--rape, slavery, torture--perpetrated on the \\"handmaids\\" in her novel.Ultimately, when we're judging the value and insight of a distopian novel such as this one, we need to look at how relevant the story is for the society it claims to portray. I think Brave New World is a wonderful book because despite being written over 50 years ago, it was accurately able to pinpoint troubling aspects of our society, that have grown more troubling in the ensuing years--our materialism, hedonism, lack of respect for life, failure to create lasting relationships, etc. The Handmaid's Tale fails to fulfill this crucial function. Atwood may think that by pinpointing, say, opposition to abortion rights as a \\"problem\\" in America, she's right in positing that the Republic of Gilead is our next logical step as a society. But by taking that philosophical leap, she's entirely glossing over the message of her opposition (those who want to protect the unborn) whose message has nothing to do with enslaving women, and everything to do with respecting human dignity. I recommend this book to those on the right, if only to gain some insight into the lefty feminist mindset, and because the story is compelling, if entirely misplaced in historical context."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A chilling picture of United States after a fundamentalist coup: women have become second-class citizens, who may not own money or property. They are essentially a slave class. Every woman is the property of some man.No religion other than the official Church is allowed to exist. No one can be required to truly accept the official religion, but everyone is required to appear to accept it without question; anyone suspected of believing otherwise is not likely to remain alive.Should a fundamentalist group gain political control of this country, some of the details will no doubt differ from what is described in this book, and other details will differ from the present situation in Afghanistan, but there can be little doubt that women will be reduced to second-class citizens with little or no control over their bodies or their lives.If, as now appears almost certain, a candidate owned by the religious right succeeds in stealing the election and becomes the next President, then it is very likely that we shall at least start down the path toward a dystopia similar to what Atwood portrays so well.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"When i was reading the handmaids tale it made me think this book was about the past, when women did not have their rights then i come to find out it was about the future and how they through out the government and president and made everything go the way they wanted it to go. This book was amazing i loved it very much and it really gave me a wake up call that we are so lucky to have our rights these days then the women in the past who had no rights and had to do what they were told to do. We have our rights lets keep them. What really made me angry with this story is that i feel that the commander loves her, but it just complicates things, i mean he does play scrabble with her even though he knows hes not allowed to let her read. The thing with this story that i dont like is that women are shown as objects and i understand that margaret atwood is just trying to show us how lucky we really are, our trying to sell a good book haha just kidding, but seriously if women had no rights i would feel that with the sick mind men have their would of course be a job for women for their main purpose to just spread their legs, men are such pigs.

I decided to read it simply to prove I was not above reading things that opposed my views (not a fan of the RR, but I don't think we're in danger of an American Taliban regime either).The book was much better written than I anticipated. However, the sheer unlikeliness of these events to come to pass hurts the book greatly.The bulk of the US military would never support a theocracy like Gilead (let alone overthrow the federal government to install it), and the sort of people the book implies would want such a thing--Serena Joy resembles Tammy Faye Bakker--would in all likelihood be horrified by the insane Gilead regime. Atwood does deserve some credit for describing \\"Baptist guerrillas\\" who fight against Gilead.A better description of who exactly the rulers of Gilead are and how they came to power and imposed their views on the entire country would have made the book much better. Instead, we're left with a well-written jab at the Republican Party."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"While I was searching for a new book to read, I stumbled across Atwood's new novel, Oryx and Crate. I read the reviews and many people agreed that the Handmaiden's tale was much better. So I decided to buy it. Although Atwood writes very well, I found her story to be long and monotonous. I was appalled to see that this novel has been compared to the likes of Aldous Huxley's &quot;A Brave New World&quot;, and &quot;1984&quot;. This book can only be seen on the same level as those books, if you are a hard core feminist. As a female, who enjoys a good story, I was was truly disapointed. I would recommend to anyone who is considering this novel to save their money, and read a true story on a women's plight in war, rather than waste time on this garbage. I enjoy fiction, but Atwoods characters seemed empty and useless. A non-fiction novel on a similar topic would at least be educational and motivational, citing true obstacles to overcome. This novel is as interesting as a description of bed ridden patients day at a hospital."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A very unusual read.

I can hardly wait for their reactions."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I really enjoyed this book because I thought Atwood wrote a very vivid description of how life must have felt for the main character, Offred. Even though it's not a horror story, it's still one of the scariest books I have read. Her life was cloistered and despairing, and there was nothing she could do about it, not even kill herself. It was so horrifying to think about everything Offred lost; not just her family and possessions, but also her identity, her right to voice her opinion, even the right to read.I did feel that I did not have all the answers by the end of the book, and we are left wondering what ultimately happens to Offred. But I liked that the book didn't give us the whole picture right from the beginning and instead reveals details throughout the book, it always kept my wondering and wanting to read more."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"My book group selected this as our monthly read many, many years ago when it was newly published. At the time, I was in my twenties and it was impactful enough that I put it back on my bookshelf to re-read at a future date. A few months ago, the Kindle version was on sale at a very attractive price so I purchased that format as well. As the previous reviewer mentioned, Margaret Atwood came to speak at Butler University last week and I decided to re-read it in anticipation of attending that talk. She was a very entertaining speaker as well as coming across as a bit eccentric, but in a good way. Hearing her mastery of the language in her own voice was a treat that I feel honored to have heard.While I remember being impressed as a twenty-something, as a more \\"mature\\" reader now the age of fifty, it struck me as even more profound and frightening. I remember thinking it was interesting as a young adult but I largely was of the mindset that it could never happen --- a bit of youthful, rose-colored glasses at that age. Now, with a few more years lived, and technology advances what they have been, and some of the happenings to women in the Islamic-controlled region, it was bone chilling to contemplate. My thought this time was more akin to \\"it COULD happen here\\".A tale that kept me mesmerized from beginning to end as well keeping me fairly uneasy, Ms. Atwood has written a book that all lovers of democracy and human rights should read (not just women's rights since theoretically, it could go either way). A master of language and story, this is a novel that is both enjoyable and enlightening.Note: There is some sexual content so I would be hesitant for less mature readers. I would feel comfortable with my 17-year-old daughter reading it but not so when she was 15. Plus, I'm not sure the younger audience would appreciate the story as much as an older teen or adult.Bottom line: Read it twice so far and anticipate reading it again at some point."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood is speaking at Butler University this week so I read The Handmaid's Tale in anticipation of that event. What a timely book, considering the political climate today. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"\\"We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the stories.\\"Society, as we know it, does not exist. Thanks to threats from Islamic extremists, what was formerly known as the United States has been transformed into the Republic of Gilead. Due to a sharp decline in the population, women are valued for one thing: their wombs. If they are unable to give birth, they are shipped off to the Colonies to do unspeakable work. Those who remain are either Wives of important officials, Marthas (servants), or Handmaids (portable wombs).\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is a pseudo-memoir about Offred, a Handmaid in Gilead. We get a glimpse of her life as it is now, serving a Commander in his attempt to have a child, taking her daily shopping trip with another Handmaid, having more time on her hands than she knows what to do with. We see the rules society has imparted on her and all women (no reading, no falling in love, always doing what you are told). And we see, through flashbacks, what Offred's life used to be like, meet her husband and daughter, and experience some of what happened to bring about the society she now lives in.I feel that, to properly review this book, I need to divide it into two sections, what I liked and what I didn't.Pros:1. The prose. Many people have berated this novel for its lack of quotation marks or divisions between the past and the present, and while I found them initially annoying, that irritation didn't last long. This book is written beautifully, almost poetically, as the quote at the beginning of the review shows.2. The atmosphere. This is a bleak story, and Atwood has captured Gilead in all of its \\"glory\\" - the hypocricy, the terror, the totalitarianism of the regime.Cons:1. The plot. About halfway through my mind really clicked on what was happening and I had to pause for a moment to be offended. All of the changes in Gilead have been brought upon by the Religious Right (of which I am a member). Granted, this is taken to an extreme unlike what is seen in American politics today, but I still needed that pause to continue the rest of the book. In addition, while Atwood creates an amazing atmosphere in diving into the story, I wish she had stopped for a minute to do something a bit more traditional, like introduce the characters (we never do learn Offred's real name, nor the name of her daughter), explain the setting, or take us, briefly, in chronological order.2. The ending. I understand that the book drops off for a reason, but even the fake symposium at the end, while clever, did not satisfy my craving for an actual ending. Novels are supposed to have a clear beginning, middle, and end, and this book had all middle and very little else.Overall, despite its shortcomings, I found myself constantly going back to \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\", eager to see what would happen next.

But for women, this future is anything but happy. The U.S. Congress has been murdered and a new government, the Republic of Gilead is in power. Women are property of their husbands or male kin; they no longer work or have money. In society they are either a Handmaid, Martha, or Wife. The story focuses on a woman named Offred who is a Handmaid. She is in the household of a Commander simply to produce a child. Offred dreams of how things used to be and of escaping the totalitarian and patriarchal society.Atwood brings her characters to life through her resonant voice. She creates simple and natural conflict between the women of the society-especially between Offred and her Commander's Wife, Serena. Atwood illustrates the animosity between the two beautifully. \\"She didn't step aside to let me in, she just stood there in the doorway, blocking the entrance. She wanted me to feel that I could not come into the house unless she said so.\\" (chapter 3; pg. 13) Serena symbolizes every Wife in this story. The Wives must let the Handmaids come into their home and have sex with their husbands for the sake of society. That conflict between women makes the story seem like Gilead could actually exist.Atwood also does an amazing job setting up Gilead and Offred's surroundings. She plants the smallest details within the story to make Gilead come alive. \\"There is no such thing as a sterile man anymore, not officially. There are only women who are fruitful and women who are barren, that's the law.\\" (Chapter 11; pg. 61) Atwood has little details like this that further promotes the idea of Gilead's strict patriarchal society. Women are to be blamed for everything and men shall be blameless. Another one is \\"You wanted a woman's culture. Well, now there is one. It isn't what you meant, but it exists.\\" (Chapter 21; pg. 127) Atwood has also placed a small part of women's culture within the men's but it has been perverted from women of free will to women under the control of men.The way that Atwood has taken parts of the modern world-feminism, mistresses, etc-and used it to form a dystopia is part of what makes the story of Offred repulsive yet I couldn't seem to put the book down. I simply loved the book. Through Atwood's narrative as Offred, I could see everything as if I were watching a movie. The ending was symbolic and fitting for Offred-it won't disappoint. I highly recommend The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handsmaid's tale takes on what could happen to women is a dystopian society.Without giving it all away, it's a story told from Offred, a \\"handmaid\\" whose only role is to bear children for Fred and his wife.It's written in a very matter of fact way with hardly any emotion.Her acceptance of her position gives the reader, or at least me, a terrifying view of what losing hope is all about.The moments where she remembers the time before reveals her pain and explains how this new society evolved.It's an incredible reminder of the precious freedoms we have in the west, and an all to real image, of how quick we can lose them."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I picked up this novel at a bookstore without knowing anything about Atwood or this book. I read a couple of pages and because it was on sale, thought \\"Why not? I don't think I've read a fiction like this in a while\\"I was soon hooked. The prose is so crisp - that's the best word I can think to describe it. And I really became engaged in the emotions of the main character. I soon realised that this wasn't a mere story about a dark future, but was dissecting the world we already live in.One of the things I appreciated about Atwood's feminism is that women aren't all portrayed as the one archetype - the Victim or the Heroine. There are also female perpetrators of the oppression. And as privileged as men might seem, they are still trapped in this prison, not free to relate to women how they wish nor express themselves fully. It resonated very much with how I see the world: that you can't just draw the lines along gender and lay blame that way. And as another reviewer put it, it shows that for this sort of thing to happen, there must be some degree of compliance with the regime.I also appreciated its commentary on religion's role in this. In fact, it's what helps this book to still be very relevant today to both modern Christianity and Islam.One experience from the book that stands out is when Offred is confronted by tourists asking her questions. It gives an interesting return perspective from the insider looking out compared to the outsider looking in perspective we normally have of other cultures with different social constraints and levels of oppression.I definitely recommend buying this book. I know it will rub some people the wrong way, as you can't avoid a critical piece like this, but whether you come out agreeing or disagreeing with Atwood's insights & perspective, it's excellent for provoking your thoughts on the matters handled within. You will at least appreciate Atwood's skill with the English language."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I originally read this book in the late 1980s shortly after it was written. I just read it again for a literature class I am taking. In the age of Clinton, I put away my fears. However, considering recent events and the outlawing of hard won women's right, one after another, I think a rereading is a good thing. The book is written as a narration by one of the Handmaids, a group of women who have had their lives and bodies taken over by the state in a way we pray will never happen. However, Atwood shows that this type of \\"Brave New World\\" impacts every woman and man in ways no one foresees. In a twist of irony, Atwood locates her story in that bluest of cities and states, Cambridge, Massachusetts. I guess she is trying to say this could happen anywhere. Also, in a scary piece of clairvoyance, considering it was written in 1985, she forsees the use of Islam as a unifying enemy. If I had my druthers, I would make this required reading for every woman, over the age of sixteen, no matter what her religious or political viewpoint."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I fail to see how people classify this work as a feminist novel. As a matter of fact, there are several places where the author makes some acerbic jabs at feminist theory and actions. The future presented in this book is not necessarily totally a fundamentalist extreme- it also takes feminism to its extreme, with the idea of &quot;protecting&quot; women from everything- even themselves, in the end.The other thing I see often complained about regarding this book is the characterization. I found it to be refreshing in that the characters weren't overly strong or daring- they were normal people, with doubts and fears, anger and loneliness. I could identify with Offred's reactions to certain things, and that made the book, which dragged at times, easier to get through.I think I see this as more of a warning about how all extremes are bad than a feminist or antiChristian rant. You just have to read this one carefully."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was assigned The Handmaid's Tale for a class a few years ago and was, admittedly, not looking forward to sitting down and reading a book I hadn't myself chosen. Not 30 pages into it, though, I was captivated. I could not put the book down, and when my professor asked us not to read ahead, I had finished it in less than a week.Margaret Atwood lets us peer into the life of a handmaid whose family has been ripped apart so that she might bear the child of a commander, whose wife is barren. As flies on the wall, we try to understand what the central characters are going through and what has led up to the current state of affairs.I at once fell in love with Offred and her plight and I found myself shaking with rage over the injustices the women in this book suffer over and over. The plot at first seemed unbelievable and over-the-top, but I quickly realized how easily it could mirror real life (our class also was studying the women and the culture of Afghanistan at the time).This is a frightening story and one you won't be able to put down or, for that matter, stop discussing with anyone else who has read Atwood's tale. This book may fill you with anger, but you will not regret picking it up."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Knowing that this is a highly rated classic I was very excited to read it. The main character jumps around so much that I had a hard time trying to relate to her at all."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"So many others have commented this way or that on the pros and cons of the prose, but in the end a book is only as good as it makes you feel.I liked the story, but I felt the author's constant jumping back and forth in time, and from reality to fantasy and back, to be annoying. Just as I would be getting wrapped up in the story, the author would slam on the brakes and take it in a whole new direction...and for only a paragraph or two...and then leave it up to the reader to try to get back on track when she returned from her digression.And I did not enjoy the ending. I won't spoil it, but suffice it to say that it was one of the weakest endings in a dystopian novel that I can recall. Especially in this genre, I do not expect...nor want...a happy ending, but this was something entire unique and one that I did not appreciate after having spend the time reading until that point. It felt tacked on, as if the publisher asked the author to come up with a better ending than what most people think, erroneously, is the ending.Enough people liked this novel, so I can't recommend avoiding it, but do not get your hopes up too high."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I picked it up because of an article about it being banned for high school. The reasons it was being considered banned, adult content, I have not really found to be the case, but I do not think it is a good book for a high school student. Mainly it is very slow and boring. The main characters life is boring and the author does a good job bringing that across in the book. When you have nothing to do for most of the day you tend to day dream or fall back on old memories and that is what a great majority of the book does. It makes for an interesting read if you can get past the slowness and the constant flash back to a better time."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"While some of Margaret Atwood's other works have received greater critical praise - her novel The Assassin's Tale won the Booker Prize in 2000, for example - The Handmaid's Tale continues to stand out as her best-known work. Set in a dystopian future in which America has been taken over by a military coup and transformed into the Republic of Gilead, a right-wing theocracy that elevates men, Christianity, and white people at the expense of all others. The story is told from the perspective of Offred (women's names are now formed by a combination of the prefix \\"of\\" and the name of the man they serve), a \\"hand maiden,\\" an Old Testament function revived by the country's plummeting birth rate: basically, these women act as concubines for high-powered men whose wives have proven sterile. The arc of Offred's story follows her new assignment to the Commander and the various glimpses she receives of both the elite world in which he moves and the underground resistance movement that has formed in opposition to the new republic.I have a lot of mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, I happen to agree with many of Atwood's observations about both American society and the ambiguities of feminism that she underlines here. I was particularly intrigued by the character of Serena Joy, the Commander's wife, a former televangelist who, in the old days, had preached about the pious subordination of women and now, ironically, finds herself the victim of her own success. On the other hand, I found that the way in which Offred's story is presented comes across as too didactic, and I kept wishing that we could hear the intimate thoughts of other characters like Serena Joy instead of observing them purely from the outside. I realize that part of what Atwood was trying to do was create a sense of stifling solitude in her narrator's account, this feeling that she was isolated not only physically but also mentally, but while Offred certainly expresses plenty of doubts and reservations about herself, I certainly didn't get the same feeling overall about Atwood's position.What really dragged for me about this book, however, was the heavy-handed way that Atwood deploys her satire. I realize that totalitarian regimes are clueless when it comes to irony, but doing things like calling the grocery stories Loaves and Fishes, for instance, was a biblical joke that really fell flat. But such tricks pale in comparison to some of the most awful puns I've ever seen in a famous literary work. Take, for instance, this admonition against women learning to write that Atwood, with a straight face, turns into a dreadful Freudian play on words:\\"Pen Is Envy, Aunt Lydia would say, quoting another Center motto, warning us away from such objects. And they were right, it is envy. Just holding it is envy. I envy the Commander his pen. It's one more thing I would like to steal.\\" (p.186)\\"Pen Is Envy\\" = \\"penis envy\\": get it? A few pages later, there is another one:\\"September first will be Labor Day, they still have that. Though it didn't used to have anything to do with mothers.\\" (p.199)The inclusion of terrible puns like these, plus a sense that many of Atwood's fears are an expression of a Cold War, Reagan-era mentality that has not aged particularly well, bring down the tenor of the book. It's a pity, because there are some aspects of the novel that really do work: I especially liked Atwood's revelation about the circumstances surrounding the discovery of Offred's narrative, an instance in which her satire does work, mirroring as it does the history of the Gospels.The Handmaid's Tale is certainly a book worth reading, but its place in the literary imagination will not, I suspect, reflect the original ambitions of its author: namely, to serve as an enduring critique of gender, religion, and politics in contemporary society. Thanks to the self-indulgence of Atwood's style and the historically dated vision of the future it presents, The Handmaid's Tale will instead be remembered as a book that exemplifies the concerns of its time. It is this inability to transcend its own timeliness that makes The Handmaid's Tale a minor classic rather than a text that will resonate for years to come."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read The Handmaid's Tale for the first time twenty five years ago.

I'm still not sure if I really enjoyed it or not. While reading, I had so many questions that were never answered. I wanted to know more about Gilead and how it was created. I wanted to learn about the society prior to Gilead. Why was there such a disdain for women? How did the Commanders come into power and how they were able retain it? The historian in me really wanted to know the how's and why's. In the end, a few questions were answered for me; the main one being why the limited perspective from the Handmaid. But there were not enough answers for me.The descriptions of how the Handmaids lived are very powerful. There was such resignation, desolation, and tremendous sadness. The great lengths the Commanders and their Wives went to prevent Handmaid suicides was truly disturbing. The monthly visits were brutal to read. The triangle between the Commander, Serena Joy and Offred was very disconcerting. Ms. Atwood is a great writer who can really convey emotion or the lack thereof. Offred's efforts of detachment from the whole impregnation efforts were so very sad.There is an intense feeling of claustrophobia that runs throughout the entire book. The handmaids are basically caged until they were needed by the Commanders.The constant fear that all citizens felt, also, ran throughout the book. No one was really safe. Paranoia was a constant companion to all. The Eyes see everything. In this way, The Handmaid's Tale, reminded me of 1984, very fatalistic.Even though fear runs rampant, rebellion is always just beneath the surface. It seems no one really accepted the severe rules of Gilead. Each character, in their own way, would try to grasp at any ounce of freedom they could; whether by reading a fashion magazine or smoking a cigarette. No one was really happy.In the end, this tale was very strange and sad. Margaret Atwood is a wonderful writer and her descriptions were very intense and poignant.

It is set in the \\"near future\\" (at the time of writing, it would be \\"now\\" today) America after a fundamentalist Christian group takes over America. Atwood imagines a world where Rachel Carson's predictions in The Silent Spring come to fruition--our pollutants have created an unsafe environment, with whole species becoming extinct and the human population in decline because of environmentally influenced sterility.Women and men fit into proscribed roles, but since the story is about Offred, we really only delve into the position of women. Offred, who has proven her fertility in the \\"before\\" time by having a child is put into the Handmaid's role: she will have children for the new society. Emotions and love are absent in Gilead and people behave in an almost robotic way.The most haunting aspect of The Handmaid's Tale for me was the memories of \\"before\\" that Offred has. She remembers times with her husband and child and piecemeal tells us about their relationship and how she got to where she is now.Atwood is an amazing writer.

The stakes in this novel are very silent because it's more about the events that occur before and after than really about an actual edge of your seat plot. She makes a brilliant satire of todays world but it isn't plot centered. It's centered around the setting of the novel. It's world dictates the actions of everyone in it. The women turn on each other when they realize that men have the control. Men take them in to have meaningless sex. It's all so relevant."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale takes place in a alternate future America, where a right-wing military coup has produced the \\"Republic of Gilead,\\" a theocratic, militaristic Christian state where women have no control over their minds or bodies. The waste and pollution of the modern era has rendered most of the women (and, it is hinted, the men also) infertile, and so fertile women are especially persecuted, treated as commodities for consumption by the elite. The protagonist, Offred, is one of these \\"Handmaids\\", and tells her story of humiliation and enslavement through a series of (we find out later) audiotapes recounting snapshots of her life as a concubine to a powerful \\"Commander\\" and his infertile wife.Wisely, Atwood does not bother with long monologues refuting the tenets of the hyper-religious Gileadean society, nor does she provide the reader with a traditionally \\"strong\\" heroine who becomes a gun toting rebel or martyr. Instead, she uses Gilead to explore the paralyzing effects of totalitarianism on both the powerful and powerless, including the Commander and his wife. The unhappiness and misery of the characters, especially the women, should be reason enough for a full rejection of Gilead without moralistic preaching, and Atwood delivers on this count.Gilead's system of control lies in a twisted interpretation of the Old Testament with an emphasis on regulating sex and sexual desire. Such a strict moral code is shown to be a fantasy of a small band of extremists, and is such a pipe dream that even the self-righteous Commander cannot hope to live up to it. The reader is supposed to feel some small sympathy for the Commander and his wife, but also rage- they ignore the shared humanity that binds them to lower-class people like Offred. The Commander's wife is an especially tragic character, as a former Christian television personality, she was slowly stripped of control over her own life by the very society she helped to create.For those that think the book unfairly focuses its vitriol on the far-right \\"Moral Majority\\" types still prominent in our society today, Atwood takes (admittedly less obvious) jabs at extreme feminists and academics as well. An oft repeated theme in Gilead is the setting of men and women at odds- the women are encouraged to accept the restrictions on their freedom as protection from the savagery of men. The conclusion of the book is a thinly veiled attack on academics, who ignore the emotional impact of Offred's tale in favor of detached analysis- failing to connect with the protagonist or apply the lessons to their own society.While this book was not intended to be a prediction or an attack on religious people, some will no doubt misinterpret it as such. What it does is illustrate how a small group of extremists can use time-tested methods to instill fear in a populace and operate a regime that even they know to be nothing but smoke."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Some books are entertaining, some have a lasting message. This book is both. Not only did it get me to rethink how I view the world, but the portion where the historian reflects on the history of the events recorded reminded me of how time can desensitize us to lessons learned and repeat the same mistakes."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book I had to read for school and I was very much hoping it would be at least a little good. Luckily, it exceeded my expectations. Atwood's writing style of switching from past to present and not revealing all of what's happening in the story makes you want to constantly read the book and crave more information. Now, this book is rather depressing and doesn't contain a very happy ending, but the tragedy and mystery behind the main character's life gives you a sense of enjoyment from the book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"My own introduction to Atwood's work came when I was in high school. Atwood really is a great writer - I have yet to be disappointed by one of her books. I really enjoyed this haunting, dystopian novel. Written in 1985, the most alarming thing about reading this book today is that some of her rather dire predictions have more or less come true (the rise of terrorism, religion and politics still not being as separate as the Constitution intended). So while these things may have been shocking to read about back twenty-five years ago, they aren't quite as horrifying now. Still, the book remains relevant, particularly in how it has influenced the new breed of YA dystopian novels. It's definitely a rather depressing book, but a very fascinating one from first to last page. There are some uplifting elements to it, but considering that it has set the standard to dystopian novels, it's about as dark and depressing as you might expect. Still, I enjoyed reading it, and think anyone interested in this sub-genre of fiction, this is definitely must-read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I finally read this after coming across several references to it. It's the scariest book I've ever read because 20 years later, I can still see it coming true. It was a bit confusing to read at first but the main plot was easy to grasp. This is one of my favorite books now."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale really exceeded my initial expectations. This futuristic novel, set in the future, is a personal account of Offred's life in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and oppressive society in which women are only valued for their abilities to reproduce. The increase in abortions, birth control, and sexually transmitted diseases has caused a decrease in birth rates. Thus, Offred and other Handmaids are forced to have intercourse with their Commanders monthly in order to maintain a steady population. In Gilead, the Handmaids are allowed only the bare minimum of rights--the dictators have even removed everything readable from their lives so that the Handmaids cannot stimulate their thoughts. In her story, Offred reveals tidbits of her past life, where she enjoyed spending time with her family and having the freedom of choice.Margaret Atwood writes with such power and fluidness that you cannot stop reading her intriguing story. This novel is both humorous and despairing, with an ending that was to me extremely shocking. Upon finishing the book, you will be confronted with a series of new thoughts on our world's problems and our future. Atwood calls to attention numerous issues in society: environmental deterioration, pornography, and degradation of women, to name only a few. Also, Atwood vividly captures human emotion and longing, as Offred is offered no consolation to her alienation and loneliness. The reader can feel Offred's despondency. Atwood exposes mankind's need for human contact and relationships.The book ultimately serves as an implicit warning to its readers of the dangers of falling into a state of complacency in a world of corruption. The novel is a quite frightening portrait of what may happen to us in the future if we do not change our ways right now.While in Offred's past, society had the freedom of caring or not caring for the world, her present society has no choice to do anything anymore, even if it wanted to. Atwood is trying to warn us, and she succeeds: as of now, we have a right to apathy--but will we in 20 or so years?"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Republic of Gilead is a place where no woman would want to be summoned for it is a place where certain women, called Handmaids, are used as sex slaves. A woman given the name Offred explains her life as being a Handmaid and how she once had the life as a wife and mother. Now she can only think of her past and appreciate what she once had and hope one day that she will regain some of it back. Offred continues to explain through out the book how she was forced to live with a man, known as the Commander of the household, and his wife to be used solemnly for her ability to give birth. As interesting as the life Offred is now living, she surprisingly slowly shares information of her past and how everything came to be. As the book prospers, you can't help to want to know the future of Offred and her past. As things become unbearable in the Republic of Gilead, it is as if you also seem to slowly lose hope of ever gaining change. The best part is not quite really understanding what is happening in the novel, yet wanting to understand.I believe The Handmaid's Tale was fantastic. I liked how the author only allowed Offred to tell certain parts of her past at random moments. Because I am a woman and the fact that Handmaids were being used for there abilities to give birth made me want to find out if Offred would escape from her, so called, destiny. Knowing that Offred wondered what had happened to her mother, Luke, daughter, and sometimes Moira, also made you curious on what had happened to them. There were moments through out the book that would make you think there was hope on yet escaping but then around the corner was just the opposite. As the reader, I just wanted to know what would come of Offred. For example, there was a time where you thought maybe the Commander, of the household Offred was sleeping in, would be Offred's ticket home. Then there are many women of Gilead who, like Offred, are against what has happened which could possibly lead to an escape. Of course there was the possibility of Offred becoming pregnant. The Republic of Gilead amazes me from the arranged marriages to the hangings in town. The Republic of Gilead is an awful place as described by a woman given the name Offred. However, just as Offred's new life in Gilead prospers so does her outlook on life and her heart and mind is swarmed with mixed feelings and soon yours are too.If you have an interest in novels that are based on the feelings and emotions of one certain character, you will enjoy The Handmaids Tale. I definitely recommend that people read this novel because it keeps your interest and it makes you think differently about life. After I had read The Handmaids I appreciated my life more. The Handmaids Tale has excitement, mystery, unhappiness, paranoia and even romance. If you want to experience the life a woman who has lost her past and now must live a life of sex, pain, love, and hope you should read The Handmaids Tale."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book was on my A.P.

The book is set in a futuristic society where men control everything and women are just tools. The way the author writes makes this bizarre society seem belivable.

The much critisied 'time - jumps' of the narrative make the story seem more real, as though these are truly the thoughts of a fallible, human character, and not some omniscient, distant author/narrator.While there have been criticisms of the portrayal of the various male characters and the ambiguity of the ending, I believe that both these aspects are important to the book. The 'conclusion'- allows us to draw our own conclusions,to write our own endings, depending on our mood. The rather negative portrayal of most of the characters reflects the negative aspects of the work, such as the brutality of the regime and its people, the 'weakness' and capitulation of Janine and the rather foolhardy defiance (admired, certainly, but hardly conductive to survival) of Moira, and also Offred's procrastination.While I first read the book when I was about 15 (and took it literally - so I had nightmares for a week), it's probably better to wait a couple of years (I'm 17 now), before one can be more aware of the use of metaphor and symbolism of the work,the poetic quality, and the exaggeration (at least I hope its so) of Gilead so we can examine the world more critically.I would recommend this book to (almost) everyone, but I doubt it is meant as an 'easy' summer read, or to be taken at face value."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book is absolutely the best book ever written.

The confusion I sometimes felt as the audience, is nothing compared to the confusion and horror protagonist Offred goes through. I am not a fan of sci-fi yet I thought the futuristic vision Atwood creates of humanties inhumanties as chilling. The Republic of Gilead claims to honor women in their enforced creation of a sisterhood. What this futuristic government accomplishes is degrading women even more so than the violent rapes women were experiencing in pre-Gilead days.

She showed that our society is still fragile enough to create a totalitarian system, in this case a theocracy, which supresses people and try to manipulate their mind and kill dissidents. It was clever to choose the main character as an ordinary person to make it possible to identify with it.Nevertheless it was a little bit difficult to read and understand, because of the novel's narrative techniques which made it hard to get through the novel.Moreover it was really shocking to me how fine and accurate all works in this regime. People really seem to have assimilated in this regime. They no longer scrutinize their situation.Handmaid's Tale is suitable for everybody who is interested in dystopias and wants to get an idea of totalitarian systems.Though the book was puplished 25 years ago and was written in a fictional point of view it fits perfectly in our era in which digital surveillance becomes ordinary."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I've read several novels that are considered to be dystopic in one respect or another. While this novel isn't nearly my favorite of the genre, it is very unique and somewhat engaging. I love that it deals with the subjugation of women and the social stigma of things like divorce and abortion in a world that is falling apart. While many dystopian novels do deal with political ideals gone awry, Atwood's take is pretty refreshing (in the bleakest way, of course.) The structure and the pacing are fine, and Atwood certainly is an excellent wordsmith. The only reason I don't give this novel five stars is because I feel like the characters aren't very well developed, especially the main character (Offred.)"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Written in sharp, not overly descriptive prose, Atwood's tale of the plight of women following a titanous holocaust of sorts that renders the world compartmentalized (even further than it is now) into a series of brutal, self-contained city states is a must read for anyone even vaguely interested in either distopian fiction or women's rights. The protagonist (Offred) has the grim charge of trying to get pregnant by a somewhat boyish Commander at a lonely estate, and also must deal with the whims of the state that seems to see women only as \\"sacred vessels\\" and nothing further. In fact, they are conditioned to see themselves this way by groups of women referred to only as Aunts. The Aunts show videos of gang-rape and such atrocities to show the women that their lives are better now that they are protected by men, subjugated in red cloaks like bloody ghosts of virtue. The story takes a while to get going, but once things start to escalate (they don't escalate too far, don't expect slam-bang action, this one is a slow burn) we as readers are swept along with Offred, hoping desperately that she won't end up on the WALL, strung up with other enemy combatants, abortionists and the like. This is a chilling book kept away from being too moribund by Atwood's narrator's sharp wit and attempts to occasionally focus on the beauty of the world that remains, for example, flowers.There is an emotional core to the novel that cries immediately of Feminism. Some critics have used this to dismiss the novel. Really though, this subtext (and occasionally blatant textual references) only helps to deepen the impact of an otherwise plainly Orwellian landscape. The Horrors of the Totalitarian State is a trope very well explored in literature. I, for one, applaud Atwood's different, decidedly feminine take on it. And the descriptions! Amazing. The author's total command of language is staggering. Some of these sentences just take you off guard with their grace and human longing. Rich, multi-layered, bleak, occasionally heart-wrenching, the Handmaid's Tale is a hit. Good quality literature."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A phenomenal look at a dystopian society as seen from a feminist point of view. I found it to be incredibly relevant today in light of the debate about a relativist versus an absolutist approach to human rights (for example, is the right to be free from genital mutilation a fundamental right, or is it a right that must determined in light of one's particular culture). There is also a clear parallel between the complacency of Americans in the book regarding the erosion of their rights in the name of increased national security and that same complacency seen in America since the 9/11 attacks. Very interesting material indeed."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In this classic novel, Margaret Atwood offers us a story of a future that is not entirely out of the realm of imagination. As is stated in the final chapter, nothing mentioned in the novel is truly fictional - each of the events happened at one time or another in human history: subjugation of women and forced breeding are hardly new concepts. What Margaret Atwood does here is create a \\"civilization,\\" Gilead, wherein all the small elements that were used at various times come together in a horrifying life for the women living at this time.What one gets out of THE HANDMAID'S TALE will depend on what one brings to it. Women and men will find different things about it compelling, as will readers of varying ages. I suspect that I reacted to what I was reading far differently than my mother, who would be in her early 80s, or my niece, who is in her 20s. Some men may reject it as rather hysterical, while my reading of it was more frightening to me than anything Stephen King or Dean Koontz could write.Offred is a Handmaid. Her life, down to the smallest morsel of food she eats and the clothing she wears, is strictly controlled by the government of Gilead. Her sole purpose is to be a breeder for an assigned \\"Commander\\" and his infertile wife. She is not allowed to read, move about without permission, or wear anything other than the red gown that denotes her status. Everything in Gilead is thus restricted - the residents are identified by their uniforms and all are suspect.The story comes from how Offred ended up in this situation, and how gradually the world changed for her, and for everyone else. Those seeking a conclusion and neatly-tied ends will be disappointed. Those seeking to be challenged, frightened, enraged and warned will find an enormously compelling read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Handmaid's Tale, by Margaret AtwoodThis futuristic novel, published in the mid 1980's, describes life in the Republic of Gilead, a stifling, dictatorial, theocracy formed following a coup in the United States, in which the President and several governmental leaders were killed. In the Republic, basically all freedoms have been eradicated, and all activities are carefully monitored and regimented by a secretive government. Free speech is stifled by fear, including fear of being reported by an informant. Women are particularly abused by the government, losing all right to own personal property or to hold a job (other than menial jobs for the benefit of the state). In an effort to depersonalize, each level of woman is required to wear a different color and type of dress (for example, our protagonist must wear a red dress with \\"wings\\" surrounding her face to hide it and to hide her gaze). The government seeks to justify this loss of freedom by contrasting the dangers that existed in the previous society (rape, murder, etc) with the stifling safety which exists in the new society--arguing that they have simply modified \\"freedom to into freedom from.\\"Into this world, we are presented with the protagonist, Offred, whose role in society is that of a Handmaid. A Handmaid's job is to bear a baby for a Commander--a high ranking official of the new order. Apparently, this society has largely lost its ability to bear children, due to various factors, such as widespread use of contraception, damage to the environment and nuclear explosions. The scenes describing the depersonalized, ritualized, desexualized procreative activities among the Commander, the Commander's wife, and the Handmaid are at the same time horrible and comic.Offred reveals her story through her description of her interactions and experiences, and her recollections. Without doubt, the pacing is slow. However, the speed (or lack thereof) makes sense, given Offred's limited understanding of what has happened to the world and what is happening to her, her very constricted ability to acquire new information, and her inability to rely on the true motivations of any characters she meets.While the Handmaid's Tale covers well tread ground, I nonetheless found the book to be well-written, with some very intriguing concepts and themes, including:1. Notwithstanding the \\"new order,\\" you can't really change who people are, what's important to them, and what motivates them. While the government publicly sought to put a beneficent face on the goals of their new society, we the reader understand this to be just another example of an effort to sacrifice the less powerful for the benefit of the more powerful.2. For everyone Offred meets, she must decide whether they are \\"a true believer,\\" a dissenter, or perhaps worst, a nonbeliever who will snitch on her for a momentary advantage. Then within these categories, she must assess their relative power, and what each person is trying to achieve or avoid. As such, even the simplest interactions, becomes a complex, tense, chess match or dance (whether real or imagined).3. A Handmaid is not permitted to own any personal property, even a pencil. Ownership, being a cornerstone of the human psyche, Offred finds herself coveting even the simplest items, a pen, a cigarette, a match.4. As in many extreme situations, people are forced to make many difficult choices, and to discover what's really important to them.5. The epilogue to the book is a symposium presentation on the Gileadean era given 150 years following the period in which the book takes place. This was a fascinating device the author used to place the story into a larger context.All in all, a fascinating, well-written book, that has well stood its 25 years since publication."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is a story about a totalitarian theocracy set in the near future in a place called the Republic of Gilead which was formed within the borders of The United States. A military attack was staged against the President and Congress and the Consitution was abolished. This new military-style dictatorship govenment is racist, homophobic, and chauvinistic. The story is being told by Offred, a Handmaid to the Commander Fred and his wife Serena Joy. The Handmaid's are endentured servants; they are there to get impregnated by their Commander. If they are unable to become pregnant, they are sent to the Colonies which is a fate worse than death. Women who are not fertile are considered to be \\"Unwomen\\". Women in this new society have no rights. They are not allowed to read or speak. Females fell into different categories: Marthas, Wifes, Aunts, and Handmaids. Each type of woman had to wear an identifying uniform.The Handmaid's Tale is a disturbing look in a society where a woman's worth is determined by her fertility. Offred's story is told in a stream of consciousness style, out of order, dependent on her mood. She talks a lot of about her husband, Luke and her daughter. She wonders if Luke is dead; if her daughter is dead. Whenever she walks by the Wall - a place where offenders are killed and hung for display and warning- she always wonders if Luke is going to end up on the Wall. For Offred, she believes that they'd be better off dead. For me reading this book was disturbing. It made me think about the life I have and how would I react if I no longer had any rights. The 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote not even 100 years old. How quickly could that be taken away? There are still people in this country who believe the words of the Old Testament and the Bible literally in regards to a woman's role in society. I could not imagine living in a society where my body was not my own. Where I'm not considered to be a human but just a vessel for some man to plant his seed. I felt anger for those women especially Offred because she remembers what life was like before things had changed.Today there are women who live in countries where she does not have a voice. A patriarchial society where a women is not valued and has no voice. This was heavy reading but I enjoyed the book. I finished reading The Handmaid's Tale thinking about how easily this could happen. It made me think about my role as a woman and what I want to do to continue the fight for women's rights."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book is utterly a joy to read. I had known of this book for years, but unfortunately I had only known about it in the context of a Young Adult novel, which is what my high school had it labeled under. I don't know about the majority of the population, but if something is labeled as YA, that's the quickest turnoff in the world for me as a reader. This is due to many reasons, chiefly because I think it is a marketing scheme from publishing companies that panders to, and insults the intelligence of, the reading public, in order to get parents to spend money on \\"age appropriate\\" reading materials, if there is ever such a thing - but i digress.Recently, I took a world lit class in college. We read this book in conjunction with Orwell's 1984. Well, all I have to say is that I was blown away at how good this book was, and is. I have actually reread the book twice since that class, and every time i discover new layers of meaning. What's more, it has a dark twisted sensibility that i enjoy immensely, and Atwood frequently divulges into macabre puns that i personally find hilarious. I myself am a fan of dystopian literature, having already read the classics - Orwell's 1984, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, Huxley's Brave New World, and Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5. I may have missed a few in there, but my point is, i considered myself well read in the genre. This book took my totally by surprise. It was a refreshing take on the genre, and it added a new perspective that one does not often find.The other thing that will perpetually confuse me to no end is that there are some decidedly \\"adult\\" passages within this book, so I am left to wonder why in the world is was listed and categorized by my HS as \\"Young Adult\\". Oh well.My point is, this is a fantastic book that deserves all the praise it can get. Go out and read it, its lush and wonderful, and it'll get you thinking in new ways, I guarantee it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood's, The Handmaid's Tale is a dystopian novel set in the futuristic Republic of Gilead, formerly the US, a place now run by a conservative Christian dictatorship. It is here where the men are in charge, everyone is being watched over, and all offenders of ANY laws are prosecuted.The narrator, thirty-three year old Offred, is a \\"handmaid\\". (a handmaid is a fertile woman whose life is one of isolation. She is forbidden associations with other men or friendships with other women). Previously, Offred enjoyed life with her husband and child. She use to have her own job, own money, and own interests. Since she is presumed fertile, the new leadership has taken away her child, her money and she is being offered to the Commander of the government as a \\"handmaid\\" for the purpose of being him a child. With birthrates declining dramatically, women are prized only for their fertility and their ability to reproduce. They are forbidden to work, own property or even to (GASP) read. If no baby is produced within two years these \\"handmaids\\" are sent to colonies for \\"unwomen\\".MY THOUGHTS - Can you imagine such a scary thought -- women being stripped of their identity and having their existence justified by their ability to breed? Without giving away too much of the plot, I'll just say that there is even a monthly \\"ceremony\\" ritual that made me scratch my head in disbelief. How about a repressive society where order is maintained by terrorizing its people? A chilling, but thought provoking read that drew me in from the very first page. I did not expect to enjoy this book, however by the end I was amazed at what an effect this book had on me...Recommended - 4.5/5 stars"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In response to the growing movement of radical feminism of the mid 20th century, Margaret Atwood wrote the dystopian novel, The Handmaid's Tale. She created a completely alternate world, through which Atwood imagines the extreme consequences of uncheck feminism. Its oppressive setting is disturbing to a generation that indulges in rights and freedoms, enhancing the impact of her message.The narrator, Offred, lives in Gilead, a totalitarian regime that took over the United States. In that society, women are viewed as possessions, not allowed to read or write. In an age of declining birth rates, Offred and other fertile women like her find their sole reason for continued existence in their womb, their only use being reproduction. The plot is incredibly intense. The almost offensive extremes of the new government attract interest and its suspense holds the interest. However, the narration is not in chronological sequence but instead jumps around, providing fragments of the narrators past and her present situation. This format is hard to get used to. In the beginning, one often gets lost and confused as Atwood switches between Offred's experiences in the Red Center and her life in the Commander's house. For readers looking for a simple, quick read, the opening of the novel may prove to be to complex. However, as the reader gets used to this style and apprehends its presence, the plot becomes easier to follow.The eerie plausibility of the success of such a regime, especially in the democracy of the United States, provokes a set a questions. What direction is our society moving in? Is such a takeover possible in the United States? If so, what are we doing to protect our rights from such usurpation? Its message is profound and the author's caution is clear. The novel urges its readers to question the society that they live in, in hopes that such questioning will result in positive changes and reinforcements to the rights we now take for granted. The fact that a regime such as Gilead is not wholly impossible makes the story more engaging, as people try to envision the dramatic difference between their world and the one Atwood depicts.Atwood presents the inner struggles of the main character, Offred's choice between resignation and resistance, subtly, implied through her thoughts and actions. In a society where thoughts of the past are forbidden and pleasure is considered unnecessary, Offred's battle to hold on to her past and her search for a viable way of dealing with her life reveals her rebellion against the regime. Although Offred does not act out like the many other resistors in the novel, most notably Ofglen, she can still be viewed as a heroine through her suffering and her refusal to submit to the regime's oppressive demands.The syntactical structure of Atwood's narration and the abundance of imagery found throughout the book truly signifies The Handmaid's Tale's place as a classic of its time. The calm narration suggests Offred's defeat and submission to Gilead, but the choppy style of her flashback and her forbidden day dreams emphasizes that those are things that can never be suppressed. The images painted by Atwood attract the reader to delve deeper into the story. It helps the reader to envision and relate to Offred's circumstances, eliciting emotions of sympathy, shock, and disapproval.Truly engaging, The Handmaid's Tale is intellectually profound and emotionally stirring. However, it takes some motivation to get deeper into the tale. Nonetheless, its message is clear and daunting, and its impact equally as great."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Alarmed by trends in attitudes towards women in the mid 20th century, Atwood took action by writing the dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale, in which popular beliefs about females are extended to their logical conclusions. The result is entirely alarming. Atwood successfully constructs an alternate, though, honestly, not impossible, universe, an unsettling world that, when read by the current generation of free, independent-minded people, seems a striking opposite of the current world. Atwood's novel is illuminating, as the author uses syntactical strategies to their fullest effect to establish a desperate, dreary mood, weaving a tale that, though not flawless, remains a blend of masterful writing and subtle cautioning.The plot of The Handmaid's Tale needs no explanation. A prospective reader only needs to know the basics; that, in the book, women are viewed as possessions, that the government is a dictatorial theocracy, and that absolutely everything is tightly controlled. Easy enough to understand with one read, most of The Handmaid's Tale is completely engaging, partly due to the flagrantly extreme principles of the newly established government. A reader cannot help but move quickly through the book, soaking in the alarming changes that initially seem far-fetched, but later feel eerily familiar. Though generally simple and easy to understand, Atwood's plot is in no way straightforward; instead, the author unifies varying plot threads to create a jumbled narration that successfully enforces the disorientation most readers feel when reading the story. Unfortunately, this structure is one of the main flaws of The Handmaid's Tale. It is true that this form stresses both the narrator's and the reader's disjointedness, but it also makes the novel less engaging and more confusing. Ultimately, the structure, which features skips between several different plotlines at random moments, lessens the merits of the book's intriguing plot and simple language. Also undeveloped and ambiguous are the characters, who are difficult to connect with. The narrator, a handmaid, often seems distant- other characters are equally puzzling, lacking sophistication. Most are undeveloped to the point that a reader fails to care about them and simply rides on the waves of plot to move through the book.Unexpected, rapid, and engaging, The Handmaid's Tale frequently deals out shocking pieces of information. It strongly impacts any reader, both intellectually and emotionally. When finished with a book, nobody can help but question the format of society presented- is such a government really so unfeasible, the direction in which our society is moving? Does a separation between church and state really have more advantages than disadvantages? The great thing about this book is its ability to urge readers to question society. Of course, the book is also wildly successful in provoking a response of several clashing feelings. Sympathy, disgust, shock, relief- the story shifts quickly in and out of these emotions, with great success. Note, however, that this book is not ideal for a cozy nightly read. It demands a reader who is ready to delve into a dark, disturbing tale that is almost incessantly depressing. Understand that this book will incite an array of emotions and prompt a large collection of questions. It really is stimulating.Atwood clearly has a talent for syntax; every sentence evokes a certain mood, and every device serves to enhance the story. The syntax is simply masterful; as Offred, the narrator Handmaid, begins her tale, her descriptions are robotic and uniform. She simply lists elements in her surroundings, drawing out all hints of emotion. As she progresses into her narration, however, her sentences turn into beautifully spun descriptions that reveal even slight nuances in her mood or surroundings. Everywhere in the book, examples of elegant and revealing syntax appear. When describing her own body, for instance, Offred imagines herself as \\"a cloud, congealed around a central object ... inside it is a space, huge as the sky at night and dark and curved like that.... Pinpoints of light swell, sparkle, burst and shrivel within it, countless as stars.\\" While the plot is incredibly successful in capturing the attention of a reader, it is Atwood's style, I think, that truly makes the novel a masterful literary accomplishment.The Handmaid's Tale is not an idle tale. It absolutely requires a willingness and effort to engage, a readiness to feel a strike of feelings for a sustained amount of time. The book is excellent in plot and style, truly intellectually and emotionally stimulating."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Even if Ms Atwood claims this book is \\"main fiction\\", there is no doubt in my mind that it has all the traits of very good sci-fi.It is a dystopia depicting a very stark future, but not impossible in occurrence.In a not so far future, a theocratic government has taken power over USA using violent methods. The new society is shaped as a patriarchal hierarchy, relegating women to a very subordinate position. One step after other this totalitarian government has banned gays, other religious groups and political dissidents.The story is told by a Handmaid that is to say a fertile woman used as an official concubine by high ranking officials. Women have been stratified in rigid classes: Wives & Daughters, Handmaids, Marthas, Aunts and Housewives. Each class has its codified role and attributes under constant surveillance of males. Males are also stratified: Commanders, Angels, Eyes and Guards. They also are subjected to very strict behavior codes. Any intent of deviation is harshly punished.The Diary gives the reader inkling into the new society and how it came into existence, but not a detailed and complete picture, rendering the novel very believable and interesting.Ms. Atwood prose is very ascetic; short phrases devoid of adjectives gives her novel a very special taste. The reader is introduced into this stark universe little by little and the whole image takes some time to be grasped. As a final result a griping tale emerges.This novel has been compared, deservedly, with Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" and in my view it stands to par with them.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I can only imagine how horrible it would be to live in this future society created by Margaret Atwood. No one in this book seemed to be truly happy. The society in this book values their freedoms in the same way that we value our own freedoms, but the people in this book consider \\"freedom from\\" more important than \\"freedom to.\\" Atwood makes a powerful statement about what can happen when people are willing to part with their freedoms to do things. She uses simple, creative language that seems to flow naturally. Her focus on ordinary objects is amazing. Instead of focusing primarily on the politics of this culture, Atwood focuses on an individual. This makes the book much more believable than most books written about the future. The main character is completely unique, but ordinary. She captivates people with her surprising humanity. A society that claims it's main purpose is to protect women, actually ends up suppressing them more than anything. This is a statement of what happens when women especially are willing to part with the freedoms they fought so hard for. The main character of this book was alive for many of the women's pornography burns, although she did not actively support them. Even so, her rights are being suppressed, for her own safety they tell her. Yet she can never quite believe this. This shows that people always feel the need to have rights. Atwood ends the book in a way that people have to fill in their own ending. It shows that big things to happen to regular people, and regular people can make a difference."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"&quot;Behind the barrier, waiting for us at the narrow gateway, there are two men, in the green uniforms of the Guardians of the Faith, with the crests on their shoulders and berets: two swords, crossed, above a white triangle ...

The young ones are often the most dangerous, the most fanatical, the jumpiest with their guns.&quot;No, the above passage isn't a scene from the Reconstructionist South or Stalingrad in the early 20th century. It's from The Handmaid's Tale, a frightening novel by Margaret Atwood. And the narrator of those words is an unwilling prisoner in a stifling society, from which death is the only escape.Known as Offred - her real name was taken away years ago - she functions as a baby-maker in the Republic of Gilead, a fundamentalist Christian society that was called the United States not so many years ago. Her every step, every gesture is monitored by heavily armed spies, who vigilantly watch for any trace of impropriety, any hint of subversiveness. Even a lingering glance at a man could cost Offred her life. \\"Such moments are the hold out for myself, like the candy I hoarded, as a child, at the back of a drawer,\\" she muses as she glances into the eyes of a guard on her way to the grocery store. A former wife, mother and feminist, Offred holds out hope of leaving Gilead someday, even though the odds are against her.As the book progresses, Offred's situation becomes more complicated. Her Commander, with whom she is forced to have emotionless sex every month, begins taking her to a brothel. Her mistress Serena arranges for her to have a clandestine affair with chauffeur Nick, so Offred can produce a child for her. And she is temporarily reunited with her best friend Moira, who was once a defiant lesbian but is now a prostitute, devoid of hope and ambition.Atwood tells her chilling, \\"1984\\"-esque tale in elegant prose, interspersing scenes from Offred's current life with her tormented recollections of the way life used to be. \\"Pieces of paper, thickish, greasy to the touch, green-colored, with pictures on each side,\\" she says of the old monetary system. \\"You had to take those pieces of paper with you when you went shopping.\\"Will Offred get out of Gilead and see her husband Luke again? Or will she be labeled an infertile Unwoman and be sent to the Colonies to clean up radioactive waste? With only her memories and an obscure Latin phrase to keep her going, Offred wrestles with these thoughts as she sits in the window of her government-issued bedroom, staring out at a world that is no longer familiar to her.Part science fiction, part precautionary tale, The Handmaid's Tale reminds us all that we should never take the smallest liberties for granted and that a seemingly stable society can change almost at the drop of a hat. Give it to your favorite feminist, or just someone who likes scary novels. This one isn't frightening because lives are threatened, but because it's entirely possible."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I found The Handmaid's Tale to be a dark and mysterious novel, with many references to imminent societal problems. Interest is piqued with an end almost equally as mysterious as its entire content. Atwood creates and portrays an all too possible future, which she based on the political actions taking place in the mid 1980's, when religious rights began pressing into politics.Margaret Atwood's writing style emphasizes the pressing issues laid before in a feasible future for the United States. The use of first person enables the reader to become acquainted with the main character, Offred, and her surroundings. Her feelings are bared only to the reader, allowing for them to make a real connection with her situation. Atwood also uses very \\"real\\" diction, encompassing many aspects used in everyday speech. This everyday dialect permits the reader to better understand Offred's daily struggle with society.Atwood's style is what made me really enjoy reading this book. I felt as though I could truly relate to the bravery, intelligence and boldness of Offred while she secretly holds on to her memories. Day after day she resists all temptations and the world that has become her reality. The oppression against women, even though The Handmaid's Tale is most definitely based in a woman's world, cements my respect for the valor and defiance of Offred. Religious ideology invades the social structure, creating an even more distinct extremist culture where, although the power and regard for women is undeniable, men are the dominant gender. Offred's account is one of true beauty and strength in an emotionless and sexist society.Although The Handmaid's Tale is an example of an extreme situation, many areas in the modern world are showing similar ideals. Some Islamic societies and African cultures have oppressed the rights of their women, allowing the men to dominate while other countries have great difficulty separating the church and the state. Parts of the future presented in The Handmaid's Tale are already represented in modern societies, and are possible future problems for all.I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a break from the nave and mindless chick-lit of today. It encompasses dark and pressing issues, with a most fitting ending allowing for hope. Atwood's inspiring novel is truly a literary work of genius about love, the struggle of an oppressed life, and a society of all trust with no questioning."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I loved this book. I thought that it was insightful and relevant. One might read this book and say, \\"Wow, this was an interesting fiction.\\" I would disagree with this thought. I see this book more as a biting satire. It might sound absurd at first to think that the United States could become the Republic of Gilead where women have fewer rights than the children and their roles have been diminished to one such as a modern day concubine but this book puts light on a certain reality: governments and roles of people change. Not only did I love the message of this book but I loved the way in which Atwood conveyed it. She wrote her novel in first person and followed up with \\"historical notes\\" that made the whole situation more real. I recommend this book to anyone who cares about the future roles of women and men a like. However, I see a woman president before she is degraded to a \\"martha\\" or a \\"handmaid\\"."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I've had this book on my reading list for over two years now, and finally decided it was time that I actually sat down with it. I am so glad that I did. In my opinion, this is the best Margaret Atwood book I have ever read; and possibly the best thing she herself has written.Set in the Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States this story talks of a time where religion and the book of Genesis are thier government. The population is sharply declining because of overuse of toxic chemicals from the past and they must use \\"handmaids\\", a sort of personal assistant to sterile couples. If these handmaids break an offense, they can be hanged or carted away. In short, Freedom of life is completely gone.What both amazed and scared me is that she wrote of the Republic of Gilead as formerly the United States instead of just some obscure country. Especially in the time we live in today, a very divided nation of values and issues it is plausible that something like this could take place.I was amazed by this story and at Atwood's smooth, rich storytelling. There were moments that were gut-wrenchingly sad and horrifying, and yet other moments such as the character of Moira that made me laugh out loud. Overall, her writing is superb and flows along perfectly.It is also an incredible social commentary on censorship, freedom of speech and religions, and most importantly women's rights. As all rights have been taken away from women and they are property of men in this story, there is a shocking and haunting note that all women have worked for could be gone if we do not continue to fight.I would reccomend this story to anyone who wants a challenging, meaningful read. It is also a good \\"study\\" novel to discuss with a group, or analyze on your own. At times, the storyline is very intense and depressing to read but you will feel rewarded that you stuck it out in the end.As a companion read with this, I suggest either Oryx and Crake another superb Atwood novel; or 1984 by George Orwell."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale, by Margaret Atwood, is a very unique and interesting novel. This thought provoking novel makes the reader think about life and what is to come in the future. Briefly, The Handmaid's Tale is about a handmaid's life, her efforts to have a child for her Commander, and her continuing survival in a changing world. This novel provides both an interesting read and new look at what life could be like.The background information concerning the novel is extremely important. It is set in what is now the United States in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In the novel, this country is the Republic of Gilead. The Republic of Gilead has many new laws that are looked upon now as sexist and restricting. Some women only have the job of conceiving and giving birth to children; at this time infertility is vast. Women at this time do not have rights, or at least compared to today's society, this includes not being allowed to read. This information is essential in understand The Handmaid's Tale.The Handmaid's Tale is a story unlike any other. The novel is about Offred, a handmaid, whose only job is to conceiving children. Offred lives with Serena Joy and the Commander. One day the Commander invites Offred into his office, which is a very risky situation as it is forbidden to have unnecessary contact with each other. \\"My presence here is illegal. It's forbidden for us to be alone with the Commanders. We are for breeding purposes\\" (136). This quote helps to exemplify the fact that this contact is dangerous and that her sole purpose in society is for breeding. In the Commander's office, the two of them do various things that are considered illegal, but in today's society are not. One day Serena Joy confronts Offred about her desire to have a child. The two, even though they have an extreme dislike for each other, conspire a way to make it more likely for Offred to become pregnant. Serena Joy says to Offred, \\"'Maybe you should try it another way'\\" (205). Offred questions, \\"'What other way?'\\" (205). Serena Joy replies, \\"'Another man'\\" (205). One evening, the Commander takes Offred to Jezebel's, an old hotel where prostitution and drinking occurs. Here Offred runs into an old friend and has sex illegally with the commander for the first time. Serena Joy's efforts to find another man work out and Offred sees him, which leads to an interesting and unsuspected ending.The Handmaid's Tale is an extremely good book that keeps the reader on edge and constantly wanting more. The book achieves its goals of making the reader think about what could happen to the United States and if something to this effect could actually take place. This novel is a lot like George Orwell's 1984 and The Giver, by Lois Lowry. By far, The Handmaid's Tale is the best, but is in the category of novels with extreme changes in society. Atwood writes the novel in a very convincing manner. It seems as though these events really did occur. The Handmaid's Tale is a book that keeps the reader on edge and is something that everyone should read at some point in life.Margaret Atwood's, The Handmaid's Tale, is a thought-provoking novel that exhibits changes in a society. A different type of lifestyle is looked at through the eyes of what is considered the person that makes the society run. Without these handmaids there would be no society. The Handmaid's Tale is a novel that everyone should read whether it is for enjoyment or learning purposes."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I've read Atwood before, having picked up &quot;The Robber Bride&quot; a few years back. Nevertheless, I wasn't quite prepared for the genius of &quot;The Handmaid's Tale,&quot; a futuristic fable of what might happen if a religious stronghold annihilated the government and suspended the Declaration of Independence.This is a precautionary piece of literature, both political in its message and highly erotical in Offred's desires.Many women have been reduced to the literal sense of &quot;baby-makers&quot;- Handmaids - imprisoned to homes dictated by a Commander and his wife.In these homes, women sign themselves up to copulate with the Commander in hopes to add to the grossly underpopulated United States, now known as the Republic of Gilead. Any other sensual activity has been outlawed; courting no longer exists, marriages are archaically arranged. Touching without some sort of contract is absolutely forbidden.Instantly absorbing, the reader is carried through this fictionalized but convincingly real, suppressive society by Offred, a woman whose true name has become a shadow; her own true identity seemingly slipping away as each chapter progresses.In this novel, time warps from the present into the past, from the strangeness of this new world to the old one which is relative to today. We are told of the transition, of how things came to be so controlled for Offred and perhaps that is what makes this novel so frightening; that in one day, all in which one takes for granted - the right to freedom, the right to love, the right to possess, to even HAVE rights - all those things can be eradicated and overturned. Life as one once knew it can, quite easily, be seized by greater forces.This is an engrossing book, from the opening line: &quot;We slept in what had once been the gymnasium,&quot; to the last question. It is a book in which one learns to appreciate any kind of ability, of reading one word or having just one cigarrette. A simple kiss, a gentle touch, a serious stare... all things outlawed in that of &quot;The Handmaid's Tale.&quot;"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I recently read this book as a direct result of listening to NPR. Listeners were calling in and talking about what they were reading in the wake of 9-11. A woman called in and said that she had re-read The Handmaid's Tale in order for her to identify with what it must feel like to be a woman under the Taliban regime. Granted the religions are different but I was shocked at the similarities. I also found myself truly understanding what it must feel like to be discounted. Overall I believe this is an amazing book and will recommend it to all of my friends."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale was an amazing book. Although it took me a few pages to get hooked, after the initial boredom I couldn't put it down. It is the story of Offred, who is the handmaid for a Commander and his wife, who cannot have children. The book is set in the Republic of Gilead, which used to be the United States. Women in Gilead are forbidden from any pleasure in life. They may not read, or write, have jobs, own land, or even go by their own names. Offred and the other women in Gilead are extremely strong and should be admired.At times the book did confuse me. Offred speaks in a sort of stream of consciousness throughout the novel. That was kind of hard to get used to but it was used to reveal all of her inner thoughts and her personality. She jumps from the present to the past, and sometimes she will give an entire account of an event only to say, \\"But that's not how it really happened.\\" Some parts of the story were disturbing and I think it takes a mature reader to look past that part of the book and get to the true meaning. Aside from that, the plot of the book is fascinating. I could really relate to Offred and that need for real love that we all have. As I read the book I had many questions. By the end of the book I had found only some of the answers, while others really depended on my own interpretation of the book.I also liked the fact that the world the citizens of Gilead once lived in is the world we are actually living in right now. This made the events of the book hit closer to home and seem more real. Although somewhat difficult to read, it was very touching and was really one of those books that make you think. The book touched me deeply and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something deep and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Dystopias succeed less on how nightmarish they might be (for that we have horror novels) than on how well they form a mirror of the real world, and in this way they represent the full potential of speculative fiction. Just asNineteen Eighty-Fourpresented the kind of violent police state that all too many ideologies (Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Kim Jung Il, etc.) have wound up trying to impose,Brave New Worldpresented the dangers of selfish pleasure used for political and social control. Into this mix comes The Handmaid's Tale, Atwood's frightening view of religion that has lost its meaning and become nothing but dogma.Much has been made of the feminist angle of this book, and certainly it presents a feminist's nightmare: a society where women are reduced to function, to breed, to clean, to appear as ornaments and sexual playthings for men. But such dystopias by themselves are seldom powerful, serving more as platforms for rage than serious discussions of the oppression of women. The Handmaid's Tale goes well beyond this by pointing out that the oppression of women goes hand in hand with oppression in general, and she does not hesitate to show that in Gilead, men too are oppressed, forced into narrow, self-destructive roles by the theocratic government.This is a lesson well worth noting, and it is what makes this book brilliant. This is no men vs. women battle of the sexes, but a battle over ideas. Can religion be corrupted in this way, and can it be used as an instrument to gain and hold power? Atwood shows that in every case of oppression, a measure of submission is required: the cooperation of some women is required for the government of Gilead to be able to commit the crimes it does. We are also given glimpses into the lives of the average man in this society, those who make the police state of Gilead work, and why they cooperate.Can it happen? One need only look at the Taliban to find an answer. And this is the danger that ignorance about religion presents: that it might be used not to provide guidance in a complex world, but as a way of justifying injustice and cruelty and the very worst sides of human nature."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It was probably not a coincidence that Atwood wrote this novel in the year 1984, as it fits right into the futuristic genre that George Orwell's famous book typifies. Right now that there is such a focus on the Taliban in Afghanistan, a regime that eerily echoes the Republic of Gilead, the revelations in this book might sharpen our thinking. The Handmaid's Tale is considered a feminist novel, which it is, but it so much more. It is a warning against destroying the enviroment, a plea against zealotry on the right and on the left, a tragedy of human nature, a fable of religion gone wrong, a satire on delusional public figures such as Phyllis Schafly, and a reminder that feminism is part of humanism and the two need each other for sustanence. It's also more than a moral and political novel. In fact, I recommend reading it twice, the first time for her characters and her powerful description of her creation, the Republic of Gilead, and the second time for the literary play. The Handmaid's Tale in a generic novel that subverts its genre's assumptions. It is a play on the modernist affectation of the kalediscoped (and unreliable) narration. It is one of the few novels that I can admire on both its cleverness and its honesty, classing it with something like Lolita in my estimation. It far surpasses its inspiration."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is the second Atwood novel I've read. While it's quite good, I think it falls short of the The Blind Assassin. Neither as ambitious, nor as fully realized, IMHO. Although most reviewer's focus on depictoin of the 1984-ish dystopian society in which Atwood sets the novel, the heart of the book doesn't lie in political or social commentary. Instead, it's in the human interactions among Offred and the various people, from all levels of society, she encounters, as well as in Offred's own struggle to reconcile her need to reach out to others with her opposing need to protect herself from the grievous harm others could cause her. (In this way, it reminds me of Joseph Heller's comment that Catch-22 was not a &quot;war&quot; novel, but in fact was fundamentally a peacetime novel.) One quibble: Atwood does a terrific job in constructing the fictional world in which Offred lives, and as readers we quickly come to accept it as her &quot;reality&quot;. However, I found the scene in which she depicts how the &quot;revolution&quot; actually came about a bit forced. Better, in my opinion to have simply depicted it as a fait accompli. But still, a very good, engrossing book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It's sometime in the not-so-distant future, and the United States of America no longer exists. What once was the U.S.A. is now the Republic of Gilead, a nation \\"under God\\" where the Constitution has been suspended and society is strictly controlled. Women have neither freedom, nor their own money, nor jobs. They are not allowed to read or write. They are objectified, labeled, separated into groups, color-coded for quick reference. There are the virtuous Wives of the Commanders, who wear blue; the Marthas, housemaids, dressed in green; and the Handmaids, in bright red, whose purpose is the most startling of all. In an age of declining birth rates and sterility, the Handmaids are valued solely for their ovaries, for their ability to bear children. Although they are consistently called \\"commodities\\" and the importance of their position is stressed to them again and again, the Handmaids are objectified to the extent that their real names are taken away from them; they are known only as possessions.Thus, we meet Offred, the heroine of THE HANDMAID'S TALE. Offred remembers a time, not so long ago, when she had a husband, a daughter, a militant feminist for a mother. Now she doesn't even know where her family is; they could have made it across the border to Canada, or they could be dead; they could be in the Colonies--villages that glow with radioactive waste, where people are sent when they're too old to be useful or as punishment for past transgressions. Offred reflects on her past, lives in her memories, and dreads a future of utter despair. Each day begins with nothing to look forward to; each day ends in hopelessness, with a spirit that's a little bit more broken. Offred's story is a stream of consciousness, an account of the days as they pass and of long-ago days in a different world. And the tale this Handmaid has to tell is one of the most thought-provoking, horrifying accounts you'll ever read.Here are just a few of the words I'd use to describe THE HANDMAID'S TALE, written by Margaret Atwood in the mid-eighties: startling; perceptive; mysterious; terrifying; eloquent; sorrowful; passionate; important; captivating; paranoid; and what is perhaps the most appropriate word of all...POSSIBLE. Just read the book, and then look at our world; I defy you not to see the similarities between the way we're living today and the time Atwood calls \\"Before,\\" the years directly preceding the formation of the Republic of Gilead. These similarities--the obsession with female sexuality, the importance put upon worldly goods, religious and nuclear war, political unrest--are precisely what make this book so frightening. And Atwood wrote this book twenty years ago; we're closer and closer to this future every day. What if...?THE HANDMAID'S TALE is utterly riveting and completely unputdownable. Atwood's details keep us relentlessly aware that she's talking about the United States in the future, with references to etchings in the wood of schoolroom desks and televangelists and the Appalachian Mountains. This sense of familiarity increases the gravity of Offred's situation; it's startling, an ominous reminder of what the world has become in the future of Atwood's novel. And at the same time, the novel is intentionally vague; we never really know exactly how the Republic of Gilead came into being; we're just given snippets of the past. This vagueness, the not knowing, makes the book even scarier.The prose is descriptive and flowing, but Atwood doesn't waste her words; each sentence is heavy with Offred's desperation, with the weight of no hope. But Offred is not to be pitied; she's to be admired for her strength. She's an incredibly human character, one who didn't always do the right thing in her previous life (and doesn't always in her current one). The supporting characters are just as well-drawn and humanized. That's one of the greatest things about THE HANDMAID'S TALE, in my opinion: The government can change the name of the country, they can enforce strict rules and guidelines--but they can't change what it means to be intrinsically human.The bottom line is this: Atwood is just an ingenious, literary writer. Take our heroine's name, for example, which so poignantly symbolizes duality, a major theme in the novel. Offred can be read as \\"Of Fred,\\" signifying possession--but it can also be read as \\"Off Red\\" (read: off with the red dress), symbolizing freedom.THE HANDMAID'S TALE would be a perfect read for a book club or a college classroom; there are lots of political, religious, social, and psychological issues to discuss. If nothing else, reading it will make you more appreciative of what you have. Usually stories about women's inferiority in society are antiquated; but in THE HANDMAID'S TALE, Margaret Atwood has given us a shocking portrait of what life could be like for \\"the fairer sex\\" in the future. And this future could, unfortunately, happen; I think after you read the book you'll agree. I'm giving THE HANDMAID'S TALE my highest recommendation; it's a definite must read and a book I'll never forget."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Many books have been written about dystopian futuristic societies, but none such as Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. This novel is told to the reader through the eyes of a handmaid who has been given the name Offred. During this time period, taking place in the not too distant future, few women are able to successfully reproduce due to pollution and radiation brought on by wars between religious sects. Atwood possesses a beautiful writing style in which she goes from discussing Offred's past in the &quot;normal days&quot;, her early days as a handmaid living in a designated &quot;Center&quot;, and her present circumstances. The America that Offred lives in has frightingly been transformed into a totalitarian oppresive society. Blacks have been taken to North Dakota while Jews have been given the choice between deportation or converting to Christianity. Men and women no longer share sexual intimacy, but mate solely for the purpose of procreation . Offred suffers in this novel not only because she's a survivor of the time when women were free to do as they chose, but also because she has no idea of what has happened to her husband and daughter. During her time as the Commander, Fred's, handmaid, she experiences disillusionment, jealousy, bitterness, and affection towards two different men in two different ways. Atwood is obvious in her attempts to convey Offred's since of isolation and disperation as she uses similes, motifs, and metaphors. Her strong feminist beliefs are extremely blatant as she depicts a world where women are looked upon as objects and how horrible the conditions are in the lives they are forced to lead. Offred bitterly reflects on the past and hopes for a future where she is allowed to love and possess some sense of freedom."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It really pains me when I read a book that is hailed as a classic many times over but for some reason or another it just doesn't click at all with me. This is the case with The Handmaid's Tale, which is unfortunate because I was very much looking forward to reading this book. I really really wanted to like this book but I can't force what isn't there for me.The Handmaid's Tale is a dystopian novel set in Gilead, which is formally part of the USA. Most of this book is told in the first person perspective by a character named Offred. Offred is a handmaid, which means her sole purpose in this society is to produce children for her commander (whose name is Fred, Of Fred, you see). Because of the fallout from a nuclear war most women are unable to have children, but Offred is thought to be fertile so during times when she is most fertile she is more or less forced to have passionate-free sex with the commander for the sole purpose of having babies(since his wife is unable to do such). Other women play their role as well. \\"Aunts\\" keep watch on the Handmaids and are allowed to read and write (unlike the Handmaids), \\"Wives\\" are the highest level caste, whom are married to high ranked men. \\"Marthas\\" are older, infertile women and \\"Econowives\\" are women who are married to lower ranked men. For men there are commanders, who are high ranking men, \\"Eyes\\" who are like the police and \\"Angels\\" who fight the wars. Only babies who are deemed as \\"keepers\\" are kept, \\"unbabies\\" vanish to somewhere unknown. There are other elements such as the Wall where people are hung-up dead for all to see, if they violate the laws of Gilead.What we have is an excellent setup for a good novel but unfortunately there are some serious issues with this book.First, this novel is really disjointed. The novel often bounces between present-time and Offreds past, but the transitions aren't smooth. This novel is written in a stream of concious style and it just doesn't work for me. Because it bounces around all over the place it can be a bit confusing at times which draws me away from the story.Next, the prose is just bad. I understand what Attwood was trying to do here, she's trying to make the character sound more real, but it often feels boring and the areas that are supposed to feel emotional just fall flat. It doesn't have that organic feel to it like, say, 'We' by Yevgenny Zamyatin, which is also written in the POV of the protagonist. Attwood often times tries to sound poetic but to me it comes off as just plain cheesy. She'll often write a cheesy poetic line, followed by a word or two which is supposed to feel impactful but it just doesn't to me. Or she'll write repetitive lines to try and build on the impact, but again it falls flat for me, for example -\\"The Commander is the head of the household. The house is what he holds. To have and told hold, till death do us part. The hold of a ship. Hollow.\\"Or\\"What I feel towards them is blankess. What I feel is that I must not feel. What I feel is partly relief, because none of these men is Luke. Luke wasn't a doctor. Isn't.\\"Or lines like -\\"Moira had power now, she'd been set loose, she'd set herself loose. She was now a loose woman.\\"This type of prose is strung throughout the book (in fact I just fumbled through a few random pages to find these for this review, there are way worse). I was constantly drawn out of the story because of the cringe-inducing prose.The characters are also a bit flat. Offred is *slightly* three dimensional but most other characters are stuck in two dimensions. A good dystopia needs characters that really pop out of the page to succeed in pulling at my heart-strings.Finally, the ending fell flat. There is virtually no resolution. It seems like Attwood was going for an ending which would spark conversation (and for many people I'm sure it does) but I really don't like books where there is no resolution, you have no idea what happens to the protagonist.So, unfortunately this book just didn't work for me. It's hard for me to say I don't recommend reading it. Perhaps it's me and I'm just missing something. So, even though I give it a pessimistic 2.5 (rounded down to 2) I'd still say to check it out because so many people love this book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Although the dystopian future that the book presents has not actually occurred, the feelings that it provokes are as unsettling and pertinent today as when it was written more than 25 years ago. Margaret Atwood creates an alternative U.S. in the late 20th century in which nuclear war and pollution have ruined much of our resources and created warring factions of nation-states. Into the maelstrom of a struggle for resources swaggers a right-wing religious conspiracy that murders the president, his cabinet, and Congress, and instills an all-encompassing theocracy. The U.S. becomes a bleak habitation in which hundreds of thousands are killed, all thought is censored, and a limited few \\"Commanders\\" have absolute power over everyone else.This world is revealed in a heartbreaking diary by a young woman (Offred) who has been selected by the society to be a breeder (handmaid). She and thousands of other women are sadistically re-educated and forced to be concubines of Commanders because most women and men are sterile, due to exposure to pollutants. These handmaids are both society's most important people (the only who can procreate) and their most despised (only one purpose). They live lives of utter desolation, not allowed to read, work, or have friendships, and forced to wear coverings similar to nuns outfits or, as we are more familiar today, burkhas.Because the story is told by a woman who remembers life before the revolution that created the Republic of Gilead, it's heartbreaking to hear the story of her mother, her husband Luke, and her daughter. They have all been separated from each other, probably dead (except the daughter who might become a handmaid, too). Even as she tests the limits of the restrictions and meets a person in the underground that's opposing the movement, she describes losing her sense of life before Gilead. The restrictions of the new society are erasing all evidence of life in the past.The plot itself isn't very important, except as a vehicle for describing the society in which women are either handmaids, wives, servants, or shipped off to die. The men don't fare much better, as the Commander in the story sneaks around with forbidden magazines and clothing and occasionally consorts with prostitutes. The other men seem to work as enforcers of the regime --- but without access to wives or handmaids, unless they have achieved a high rank. Meanwhile, the environmental pressures and ever-present wars are continually reducing the standard of living, also helping to keep everyone in a state of fear.In sum, the book is a chilling and moving tale about life in a totaliarian state --in this case, one that arises quickly in the US in response to economic/environmental pressures and the fanaticism of the religious Right. Given what we've seen in the last two decades, we seem to be moving closer to this direction than away from it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"We are seeing a society[2012] that appears to aspire to be a theocracy not unlike Gilead of the novel. This book needs to be required reading for all young women who wish to maintain the rights to which they are currently entitled. Atwood makes the statement:\\"In a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it.\\" We are currently experiencing incremental attempts to change women's rights.Some are so small they may go unnoticed;we must be vigilant. I taught this book for at least 15 years in an all-girls high school and it never ceased to cause extensive discussion among the students. I implore you to read it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I rarely find novels that predict the future inspiring or even enjoyable. This book is the exception. Although it has it's hum-drum parts (as does any good book), it's a really profound look at one woman's emotional and physical exile in a world that is trying to keep the human race alive with no justifiable reason for doing so.It made me question the definition of living, of happiness, and of purpose. After you read what the Handmaid's life consists of and what the world has come to, you look at things like solitude, our freedom, simple pleasures, love, selfishness, andpossibility in a whole different light. Her writing is eloquent and thoughtful...the main character is capturing right away. It's not a book to be rushed through and the depth of some of the quotes will make you want to reread pages of it at a time. It's a rare find."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I began reading this book at the beginning of a long plane ride from Texas to Wisconsin. By the time I was at the O'Hare Airport (in Chicago, about halfway to my destination) I was completely saturated in it. I became extremely paranoid, not wanting to draw attention to myself or even to speak. I felt like I was in the story, and it was a strange and wonderful feeling. This book draws you in and leaves you fairly breathless. It is extremely enjoyable, powerful, and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"...I would like you to know that this exact scenario happened Sept 1996 in Aghanistan.

Again I was through it in a night, but it also tells an important story."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's TaleThe plot of this story begins when the main character is caught by the totalitarian state of Gilead while trying to escape from their control. She is then taken to an institute called the Red Center where other \\"special\\" females are also held. This is the start of the rising action in the story. From there, our main character, Kate (later renamed as Offred), goes through a certain type of training or preparation at this Red Center to become a Handmaid. Here Kate learns the ways of this soveriegn state and learns that she is among a selected few who can still \\"bear the fruit\\". These women are later sent on assignments to complete their job as \\"assistants\\", which in this case, means bear children to those who cannot. This is the law of the Republic of Gilead, which is the setting of this tale. At this setting, the status of both men and women are very distinct. Women hold few roles as either Handmaid's, Aunts (those who train Handmaid's) or Wives (usually Commander's Wives). The other women are mere servants or of lower class. The men are either high- ranking Commanders and Generals, or soldiers and guards. The basis of this government rule is Biblically oriented. This explains the use of Handmaids in this society, and the bizarre manner how this government functions. This then introduces our story's conflict, man vs. society, and our story's theme of freedom. This becomes the main character's ongoing battle, along with identifying herself. Moving along towards our climax, our character, Kate, is sent on her assignment to a new commander's house. Here she faces a new dilemma, the Commander's Wife, Mrs. Serena Joy. The position of a Handmaid is a difficult and awkward one due to the fact that she's forbidden to have relations with anyone besides these commanders. And when they must have relations, which is done preceding a ceremony, the Commander's Wife must also be present, holding the Handmaid in fact, during this session. That is why the role of the Wife is powerful, yet fragile. She is the antagonist of this story, yet without doing any wrong. Continuing towards our climax, our protagonist, Kate, ends up having an affair with the commander of this household. Their innocent meetings of playing board games and reading magazines, which have been banned, go on for quite a while without Serena Joy's knowledge. Thinking up schemes of her own, Serena Joy, sets Offred up (our character's name has been changed by this point) with the commander's escort driver and guard, Nick, in attempt to get Offred pregnant by Nick's seed. Serena does this because she believes the commander may be infertile and she wants a baby already. Offred complies with this set up because she has feelings for Nick, and if she has a baby she would not have to stay there anymore, and her status of a Handmaid would rise. Moreover, being with Nick is the only real relationship she has. The turning point of this story, the climax comes along when Offred realizes she's pregnant with Nick's baby and decides that she wants to keep it for herself. The climax comes also when Serena Joy finds out about Offred and the Commander by her clothing that the Commander gave Offred to wear the night he took her out to Jezebel's, the underground nightclub. The falling action after the climax is when a group of soldiers, called the Eyes, roll up to the Commander's house in a van shortly after Serena found out, and comes for Ofrred. To Offred's surprise, the first soldier through that door was Nick. Thinking she has been betrayed, Offred is hauled away by the Eyes. But for the final twist in this story, Offred soon realizes that the Eyes are not \\"really\\" soldiers, but rebels, those who oppose Gilead and it's rule. They actually came to save her, on Nick's request. Our resolution in the end is that Nick helped Offred escape, by being a rebel himself. Beyond that fact, the end is not really clear, but it's contemplated that Offred (Kate) ends up having Nick's child and crosses the boarder into Canada. She then writes this book of her gripping tale, the tale of a Handmaid."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! A stunning read! Atwood has touched the core of my heart and has set it aflame with her brilliant choice of words. This novel has made me realize the beauty as well as the evil of our world, and has forwarned me of the bleak future which is awaiting us all. Every word Atwood uses is stunning, the vivid pictures created in my mind have been dancing to this day. This by far, has been one of her best works ever, and to top this masterpiece would simply be impossible."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I hate dystopian novels. Part of it is the neither fish-nor-fowl aspect where they are not science fiction and they aren't really social commentary either. Margaret Atwood annoyed many fandom writers by outright stating that a book about a futuristic world in which the forces of fundamentalist (racist) Christianity take over and ppush women into second class citizenship is \\"speculative fiction\\" and not at all science fiction (on the other hand Robert Heinlein's overtly sexist books were popular at the time so its understandable). The science fiction elements are subsumed to the fact that the author isn't terribly interested in telling a story. Dystopian novels are about world building with a non-descript no-personality character telling us about what's happening. Most of the time the world is one or two aspects of this world taken to the most extreme and ridiculous conclusion. Orwell knew that the Communist revolution was a sham and that the USSR was controlling people's speech and sending dissenters to the gulag so he imagined an entire world where the Communists could get away with everything in 1984. Aldous Huxley thought that Americans were vulgar with their jazz and their detective novels so he thought up a world in which everyone is on drugs and watching vulgar entertainments without thinking in Brave New World. Even when these books work, they are irritatingly preachy and short on characterization.The Iranian revolution looms large in this book. In a few years Iran went from a relatively Westernized nation to a hotbed of religious zealotry where burka wearing was enforced and speech was curtailed with women in second class positions enforced by very conservative ayatollahs. Iran has always been much more complicated than the \\"they just went rightwing\\" generalities, but as a symbol of a country falling into fundamentalist zealotry was very attractive. Having Japanese tourists taking pictures of the women in their robes as if they were exotic creatures is a particularly compelling scene. Atwood also takes great pains to show how women are just as capable of enforcing and maintaining a misogynist social structure in the convention of the aunts. Another part of the book that is interesting is the way that Atwood invokes the 70s feminism arguments by noting that in a totalitarian male-dominated regime, many of the battles fought by feminists are won, albeit in a terrible way.However, there isn't much in the way of a story. The nameless protagonist remembers her youth and her marriage. She lives as a handmaid with all the breeding that it entails. At a certain point the nameless male figure takes a liking to her and there's some point of autonomy. It's never really clear why we should care about these characters. Furthermore, Atwood's view of American Christianity is insulting at best. It's not enough for American Christians to be so zealous that they take away women's purchasing and voting rights but they have to be racist as well. The book might as well have been titled \\"Why I'm Afraid of Church\\".This is not a bad book. It is a fast read. However, it's the kind of book with a reputation well beyond anything that it deserves."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale presents an all too morbid future where gender roles are clearly defined with women restricted to menial labor, devoid of freedom, intelligence, and equality. The idea in itself was powerful and made me think for nights on end. This book is essential, absolutely essential for gaining respect for freedom, democracy, and equality.Advocating feminism, I do not think Margaret Atwood could have done a better job in revealing the endless depression and utter embarrassment that would result in a sexist society. Atwood's approach in presenting the atrocities is absolutely brilliant. I read in complete awe as Atwood described restrictions on objects that I could never have dreamed of. The piece is just so clever in setting up tone. Atwood thinks of every situation that would maximize embarrassment and further degrade her characters. Her words, tone, even syntax helped to convey the truly dismal atmosphere. The stories, events, and character struck cords in my heart and I truly felt the pain and sorrow of the characters.There were many devices she used that I thought were completely brilliant. In her fictional dystopian community, Gilead, Atwood provides sexists their utopia. Women are chained to their menial labor and surrender their bodies to them at the will of the men. By creating what sexists really want in a society, Atwood cleverly highlights the countless flaws in this supposedly utopian society. What was also brilliant was her use of biblical allusions. Each allusion was well thought of and held significance in furthering the book's theme. From the name of the city, Gilead, itself to the names of certain handmaids, allusions were ubiquitous.This novel is beautifully written. Atwood's fictional world is so well described that it seemed eerily real. Her characters were all very well developed and very interesting. Her protagonist was believable and readers instantly share a connection. The imagery found in this novel is also frighteningly vivid. As I was reading this novel, I could not help but notice that I felt as if I were in a bad nightmare. The style and tone was lively and just a joy to read.This novel was deep and was worth every second of my time. Its clear descriptions of the mistreatment of human life mimicked stories of people under the mercy of Hitler or other powerful dictators. This book advocated not only for an end to sexism, but a call for virtues. The Handmaid's Tale serves as a constant reminder for what we must fight for: freedom, liberty, and equality. Her fictional government really scared me and left me very thankful for the present condition of the world.Bold, horrifying, and very insightful, the Handmaid's Tale is a first rate novel that I would not only recommend, but insist others to read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Years ago I picked up this book. I don't know why. Something about the cover art. Then I noticed the Table of Contents appeared decidedly different from any other I had seen. Intrigued, I started reading and couldn't put it down.In many ways, I'm a typical guy when it comes to reading fiction. I'd rather read a manual on roadbuilding or microbiology than the Lord of the Rings. Sad but true. I won't bother rehashing the characters and plot as you can get that from all the other reviews here. But this book was chilling, scary and pulled me in.I'm writing this review today because I'm recommending--make that buying--a copy of it for my most awesome friend, Trisha, who is giving the gift of life, as a surrogate mom to a lovely young couple.Go Trisha.PS: Don't waste your time on the movie."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Gileadian Takeover happened very quickly, and before anyone had a chance to react, martial law was announced, women were robbed of their jobs, and all marriages after the first were declared unlawful. To halt the dropping Caucasian birth rate, unattached able-bodied women were corraled into &quot;Red Centers&quot;, where meekness and submissiveness were hammered into them under prison-like conditions. Later, these &quot;handmaids&quot; were redistributed to affluent households, childbearing being their only goal in life. This is the tale of one of these unfortunates: 33-year-old &quot;Offred&quot; can still remember her husband and daughter, being allowed to read and write, but with every passing year this Calvinist society claims more and more of her.Very surprisingly, &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; did not at all strike me as especially feministic. Its dystopia is all the more striking because everyone is discomfited - both the opressor and the opressed. Out of the numerous cautionary tales I've read this is the rare one that takes into account almost every side of the story: whereas others usually pose one side as unjust tyrants and have the other side engage in a just struggle, the quietly nightmarish world of &quot;Handmaid's Tale&quot; is especially appealing in that its central character, a nameless everywoman knows only by a patronimical (Offred - &quot;Of-Fred&quot;), is out not to revolutionize, but to survive. Indeed, this is a tale of finding contentment in the unlikeliest of places, of living day to day, of forming relationships, of adapting, and of coping. Not wasting any more time than necessary on the do-not-resuscitate plot (Offred's eventual escape), Atwood commits every last drop of her writing prowess to examine the personalities of her characters and the numbing effects of the new order. In doing so, in constantly examining and re-examining Offred from every perspective, she makes her so multi-faceted as to make her more than a character - she becomes an excellent interface between the reader and Atwood's conceptual vehicle.The profoundly disturbing - of not particularly likely to happen - dystopia Atwood creates serves as a stage for examining the various drives and motivations of her characters, using the veil of strangeness to abstract her findings into something approaching objectiveness.Something I didn't expect was how particularly inert men are in the world of the &quot;Handmaid&quot;. While the narrator speaks no more cynically of them than of the women, it is women who seem to run everything, from the general social order to the secret underground. Men appear content - if not especially happy - with their secret burlesques and generally acting as if they still had any real power.While I enjoyed the gentle manner with which the author maintained my attention despite the poststructuralist approach, there are few memorable ideas that the book communicates. I feel that I will remember it solely for the ludicrous, gruesome visual trappings - and that's quite a misfortune."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"That is the plot for this phenomenally written novel. In Handmaid's Tale, Atwood utilizes the convention of the research paper as a frame story for the autobiography of Offred, a handmaid, in a United States that was taken over by misogynistic Christians. The fundamentalists turned the US into a baby machine to compensate for what may be a bio-plague's effects. Erudite and wracked with tension, this book is not to be missed.If you like deep, creative, intelligent literature, try the following:Rabid: A Novelby T.K. Kenyon,Sex Wars: A Novel of Gilded Age New Yorkby Marge Piercy, andOrlando (Penguin Modern Classics)by Virginia Woolf."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"When I first year this book as a 14 year old highly devote protestant, I was utterly disgusted and thought Atwood was making a personal attack on my faith and the faith of thousands of other. Now as an upper year University student, this book has taken on completely new meaning for me. Rather than attacking Christianity, or any faith at all, Atwood masterfully blends together elements from past religious traditions to produce a chilling dystopian warning of what is possible in our world. She is not attacking Christianity directly, as she herself openly admitts. Instead, she elaborates on things that have already ahppens and projects a nightmarish future possibility. This novel is clasic Atwood, written with her usual sharpness and eloquence. perhaps more so than any of her other books, this novel grips the reader from start to finish. However, it isfar more than justa thrill read, leaving the reader with much to mull over in her abrupt and provocative ending."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Not one for science fiction or futuristic tales, I was surprised to very much enjoy this Atwood classic. She is clearly a feminist without the overbearing anger that is so often stigmatized and associated with it.I would recommend it to friends!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale discusses the role of women in a society called Gilead, that because of declining birthrates women are stripped of their freedoms and given distinct roles all of which surround the notion of boosting the population. The heroine, Offred, is portrayed through the stages of her life beginning from being raised in a feminist environment by her mother, to becoming an individual, to having all of her rights taken away during the time of Gilead. Offred's struggle and willingness to survive without an identity, but two ovaries and a womb, will open the reader's eyes to the changing roles of women in society."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"THE HANDMAID'S TALE is a tale that needs to be read. This one by Atwood is not simply a work of feminism, as some try to portray it. It's a work also (I would say primarily) of secularism (or the artful plea for more of it). In a post 9-11 world, can anyone ever again say that religion taken to its logical extreme doesn't hurt anyone? Maybe fundamentalists think it hurts only women and that that's all right. Just as the nightly news proves them wrong, sadly night after night these days, Atwood will prove them wrong, too, only more poignantly."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A story that was very disturbing. Even though this scenario seems far fetched it is not far from the truth in some countries. Oppression of women is a reality in many countries and is usually rooted in religious traditions. A real thought provoker."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is sci-fi at its best; take a supposition and follow it out to its most absurd conclusion. In this book, Atwood depicts how the future could be if all the Fundamentalist Christians were allowed free reign to become a new type of Nazis. I read this after watching the movie, which was excellent with Robert Duvall and Natasha Richardson. But, of course, the book is even better. Really made me think about gender roles and the morality of righteousness."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Rather than accomplish anything I spent a few hours last night and most of the afternoon reading Margaret Atwood's A Handmaid's Tale. In accordance with my previous policy of time-wastage, I thought I would write a review of said book.Overall, A Handmaid's Tale is beautifully written. Atwood does not stay with a strictly temporal storyline: the main character Offred had flashbacks to her previous life. However, Atwood ensures that the narrative is not confusing by having fairly regular earmarks for each part of the story. The prose is not in a particularly high style, which I must admit is nice: rather than struggling through the sort of dense writing that characterizes most \\"classics,\\" Handmaid's Tale is very readable.Atwood tends to chose compelling subjects for her novels. I have only read one other book by her, Oryx and Crake, but both novels deal with epic changes in our society. Essentially, AHT addresses the idea of Biblical Literalism and how it would play out in a totalitarian government. The novel itself is a bit dated: it was written 1986, and I tend to find her scenario a bit hard to accept. However, this could simply be my own prejudice: Oryx and Crake dealt with bio-engineered life-forms and bio-terrorism, which I found much more believable.Ultimately, AHT was interesting and not too difficult to read. I think Atwood addresses pertinent issues in our society, and I actually have an interest in what happens to the characters. (Note: I really hated The Great Gatsby and Tess of the Durbervilles because I had no concern for any character in the books). So yes, it is worth reading, which is more than I can say for most drivel printed."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read this book the summer before junior year in high school (about 3 years ago).

I love books that deal with the future and books that deal with the changing of society. This book takes a look at a future where fundamentalist conservatives take over. I loved it because it is a satire of the religious right so to speak. It is a what if type of book. For me, what is great about it is that something similar is very possible. Don't get me wrong. It is a little extreme but it is plausible in so many ways. For example, with the push from conservatives to overturn Roe v. Wade. Or with Bush in office pushing the views of the ultra conservative right. This book puts me in mind of other books like 1984, or It Could Happen Here, or Darkness at Noon. I loved it and wish I could find more books like it. This was my first introduction to Margaret Atwood. I really liked the way it ended but I don't want to give it away. Read it and read it closely.

Complex and complicated characters making their way through the first generation of that time turn her compelling political statement into a compelling story.One need only spend five minutes looking at the policies of the modern Republican Party in the United States to realize that it has taken this book for an instruction manual rather than a cautionary tale, a hand-guide to totalitarian theocracy to be cherished and craved rather than abhorred.

It could serve quite well to generate discussions of difficult ideas. I rate it an interesting academic read, but found myself reading to the end out of discipline rather than enjoyment."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This may seem like a very halfhearted review and I do not blame you for thinking that. I don't usually tend to write reviews about books I don't like, unless they're review copies, in which case I have to. It's because I am mostly unable to think of anything to write. But since I read this book as part of a challenge, I decided to go ahead and write the review.I have seen this book compared to Orwell's 1984 countless times. I won't try to tell you how wrong those comparisons were; I merely want to show how wonderful I expected this book to be. What I got, instead, was very clumsy writing; not to mention very little character development and an average plot.The book starts out painfully slow. The writing is childlike, with short pretentious sentences, too many metaphors, an inconsistent narrative and for some reason, no quotation marks. The authors tries too hard to sound beautiful, scary, touching. Throughout the book, the reader is kept in the dark about most important things, and instead presented with a whole lot of irrelevant details. Till the very end you don't get a clear explanation of why the world is this way, what drove the characters and we never find out what happened of half the characters.So much of the plot is withheld for so long, and I can think of no other reason why the author would do this than to attempt to keep the audience intrigued. I wasn't intrigued, just confused, slightly irritated and sort of amused. The only reason I kept reading the book was because I had to find out if the mystery ever ends.I wish the book had a more intricate plot, or better developed characters. The book would make a much stronger statement, if only all the underlying themes such as gender, sex, caste, class and patriarchy were, in fact, underlying. I like books that have a point to make, but not if the message starts to hinder the plot and character development. I appreciated the basic premise of the book, the world that the author has tried to create and the impact she's tried to make; but that basic idea was the only thing I am completely certain I liked. If someone asks me how I find this book, I won't say I hate it, because I don't; I would just call it okay."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I've always enjoyed Margaret Atwood's books. This is one of the first I'd read by her and when I saw it was available for my Kindle I decided to read it again. It's a very interesting and sad story of a male-centered society and the two classes of women in a post-apocalyptic-type country. There is triumph and tragedy that keeps the pages turning."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I had to get about halfway through this book before I actually began to appreciate the situation that the main character was in. Initially, my reaction was that she had just given up on everything and I couldn't understand why she didn't fight harder for her \\"freedom\\". After she revealed more personal information about herself and had some meaningful interactions with some of the others in the book, I was horrified at the oppressive conditions that all of these women were living under. I even found one of the \\"bad guys\\" a somewhat sympathetic character, which caused me a bit of conflict.I couldn't imagine waking up one morning and having all of the rights and freedoms that I enjoy taken away from me, including the right to control what happens to my own body. In the end I found myself wanting to know more about what happened to some of the women and men who were central to the storyline.I like the idea of reading the story as a historical personal narrative that was uncovered years later. Overall it was a well written book and it really is frightening when you think of the power that this government has over the women. It is definitely worth a read, and as a woman be prepared to feel a bit angry with the treatment of the women in this story."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It's just as well I didn't read this book when I bought it in December 2011 on sale. I probably would have scoffed at the idea that a hard-line fascist patriarchy could take over what was once America. Reading it in May 2012 now I'm not nearly as skeptical. Hearing the hard-line stances of those like Rick Santorum and Rush Limbaugh infamously calling a woman a [rhymes with \\"glut\\"] for wanting birth control makes me think there is a portion of this country that would enact something just like Atwood describes.What she describes in \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is a patriarchal society where most women are stripped of all rights. There's a caste system of sorts enacted. At the top are the \\"Wives\\" who are (obviously) the wives of high-ranking officials in the new regime. There are also \\"Econowives\\" who are the wives of lesser officials. The Wives have servants called \\"Marthas\\" who toil away in the kitchens and so forth. And then since most Wives are older and infertile, there are the Handmaidens. The Handmaidens are tasked with giving birth to a baby, which is then turned over to the Wife to raise.Now since this is a hard-line religious establishment where doctors and scientists are killed or locked up, they can't use scientific means like artificial insemination. Instead there's a whole bizarre ritual that takes place every few nights that involves the Commander (the male head of the household) getting it on with the Handmaiden while the wife is present. There's nothing seductive or kinky about all of it; it's all pretty sterile, which might be why it's ineffective.The person telling the tale is a Handmaiden known as Offred (as in she's Fred's property). She describes life in her household and at other intervals talks about life before the new order took over. In that life, Offred had a real name and a husband named Luke and also a daughter. She had a feminist mother and a lesbian friend named Moira.I think if you want to complain about anything it's that not a lot really HAPPENS in terms of plot. So if you were looking for a taut thriller or anything like that, then you wouldn't enjoy this. The obvious point of comparison would be \\"1984\\". I would also say that was a better book in that Orwell has more of a story arc concerning Winston being seduced by the \\"rebellion\\" and then betraying the one he loves in order to save his own skin, thereby crushing his spirit. (Oh sorry for the spoilers.) While Atwood's book is riveting, the world she builds doesn't really go anywhere. Offred isn't forced to make the same choices as Winston. And I have to say I found the last 6% or so, the epilogue, to be a little corny.Still, with the recent events I already mentioned, the hard-line anti-abortion laws being enacted in \\"red states\\" and so forth, I think this is an important book to read (or reread) at this point in history. Especially if you're female you should read this to see the worst that can happen.That is all."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I knew nothing about this book when I bought and read it. I wish there were some way to review it without telling anything about it. The story definitely works better if you allow Atwood to bring you slowly up to speed. Stepping into the story with a knowledge of its setting and basic plot is bound to cause frustration, because Atwood parcels her secrets with great patience. So, if you want to enjoy this book as much as possible, and if you truly know nothing about it, then stop reading this review (and any others) and start reading THE HANDMAID'S TALE.Still reading? Fair enough.Atwood's story takes place in an alternate future where America (at least large portions of it) has been taken over by radical religious groups. The narrator of the tale lives in Gilead (in what we would call Maine), and she performs the functions of a concubine for a top-ranking political leader of this new, brutal regime. Everything in Gilead is (ostensibly) based on a religious (Christian) precedence, and so women's rights have been vastly curtailed. They are not even allowed to read.Told in the first person, the novel's prose is beautifully done, although it does begin to drone near the middle of the novel. Other reviewers have complained about the odd punctuation, fragmented sentences, and stilted structure, but if you make it to the end of the book, the narrator's strange approach to storytelling is fully explained. I found it rather poetic and insightful. Others (people who seem wedded to traditional novel structure) complain that it is insufferable. If you absolutely must have quotation marks, or if you can't stand run-on sentences, then step aside and read some Dan Brown or something.The book doesn't appear to have much in the way of a plot until you hit the middle point. The handmaid (her name is Offred, which is a title that indicates she is owned by her patron, a powerful man named \\"Fred;\\" the name is also a clever symbolic twist on the fact that all handmaids are required to wear bright red dresses) mostly just observes the world she is in for the first half of the novel, and her passivity gets a bit redundant by the halfway point. Atwood, seeming to know this, then sends the novel into more exploratory areas, and Offred is given a chance to witness other, less religiously pure, aspects of Gilead's society. Interesting still, although, again, little can be said to happen.I enjoyed this novel because, more than anything else, it is a excellently drawn portrayal of where religious fundamentalism and political fascism are rather easily intertwined. As a pastiche of moments/images that paint a picture of a world built on hypocrisy and the less-holy tenets of the Bible, the book works quite well. It is more a \\"imagine this world\\" kind of story, and if you are a reader who enjoys being submersed in new ideas and environments, the novel offers a lot of philosophical/political/sociological ideas to muse over. If you want action, cause and effect, intrigue, and conflicts leading to complications leading to resolutions, well, this is not the book for you.Because the book is so relentlessly symbolic as well as political, it is bound to bore some and insult others. The story is most obviously about women's rights and religious fanaticism, but it is also about humanity's self-destructive tendencies, the nature of fear and oppression, and the different shapes that insanity can take. It is a textbook more than a storybook, and this is hammered home in the final section of the novel. I won't tell you what happens, other than to say that the book, at a key moment in the story, takes a radical shift in its story-telling.For 95% of the novel, you are intimately involved, inside the head of poor Offred, witnessing and hearing and experiencing her world first hand (and usually in the present tense). For the last 5% of the book, you are so far removed from the contents of the handmaid's tale that it is a rude and (for me) somewhat unpleasant shock. The final moments of the book felt like Atwood trying to both ameliorate the reader's desire for clarification but also remain tantalizingly withdrawn; she spoon-feeds the readers some key data, while purposefully leaving vague the information that readers really want to know (let's just say that the Handmaid's Tale, like the Canterbury Tales from which the title was drawn, isn't exactly finished). I suppose this is just a final confirmation that this book is less about the handmaid herself, and more about the world she inhabited.It would have been nice for Atwood to craft a better end point for the story, or to at least offer a meager reward for the readers who were following Offred's story with patience and focus. But books like these are meant to be cautionary and theoretical rather than literary treats. This is not a fun story, nor is it exciting or clever. It is scary, dark, and unforgiving. For readers who enjoy theory, ideas, and the thought that there might be a meaning to life, this novel is a kind of beautiful punishment. You might not deserve punishment (Offred certainly didn't), but I think that's kinda the point."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was assigned this book for summer year for my senior year but I didn't read it because I thought it woulfd be boring but when I heard all my classmates talking about how realistic and shocking this book was, I went ahead and got. When I got the book, I just can't put it down for one second, it kept you interested to know what happened next in the story.

Since I never was very big on futuristic fiction I packed it away. I just discovered it and began to read. I soon found myself in Atwood's nightmare, unable to put it down and escape. It was a wild ride into the world of the extreme right and religious fanaticism. This is a must read!!!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood knew, long before vigilantes began shooting doctors in abortion clinics in Florida, that issues of the right to manage one's own body would be the issues that spawned the next major civil unrest in America. We profess our superiority, claiming we live in a state undivided by religious dogma, but our own personal convictions, shaped by thousands of years of religious teachings, ultimately divide us on opposite sides of issues of law. In &quot;The Handmaid's Tale,&quot; Atwood offers us a chilling glimpse of our own future should we choose to continue our derisive treatment of those who believe differently than ourselves. She deftly manages the language and timeline to produce a book which appears to have been written in the &quot;present&quot; it describes - giving only a slight nod to the &quot;history&quot; that created her environment, despite the fact that we are living that history in our own modern times."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Although some may scoff and say that Atwood's dystopia is too extreme to be taken seriously, I for one think that Gilead needs to be studied carefully. Offred is a natural, loving, creative woman and she has been reduced to living in a world that refuses to recognize her abilities. The only ability that Gilead recognizes is her ability to bear children. Today, we have seen people reduced to states parallel to Offred's whether it be during times of war or economic distress. Offred's story does not seem so extreme. I truly think that all who live and keep up with ANY current event should add this book to their library. In her own way, Offred has become a type of &quot;Everywoman&quot; through her distressing tale."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"To those few of you who seem to find Atwood confusing and morbid, I feel that is the whole point of the story!!! Even though these situation may or may not happen in actuality, it makes everyone wonder. The point of the story is not to predict our future society, it is simply to tell an entertaing plot that tells a wonderful story. In my humble opinion, the actuality of this occuring in the twentieth century is null. However, it creates wonderment on whether we are inevitalbly getting closer to the fate of &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book has affected me so much that every time I read a newspaper account of The Promise Keepers, or that male fertility has gone down, or the increase use of ATM's I am drawn back to this book.

I tend to think that the book is made as metaphor for the oppression of women in countries like Iran. The thing that sticks out about this novel is simply the fact that it is set in a culture that we all know and recognise, It is supposed to shock us in the way that the fundamentalist regimes in middle-eastern countries can't because we don't live in them, and can't compare them without a similar context being portrayed on our own society.

There are many ideas and scenarios that Atwood describes that left me shaking my head, not in disbelief, but in the sometimes haunting similarities to the world of Gilead and our own. Perhaps we may never be subjected to the extreme measures that are taken within these pages, but The Handmaid's Tale represents our world and what could become of it.The focal point of the book is the character Offred; whose role in her society is that of a Handmade. In Gilead, a Handmaid's purpose is to become pregnant and conceive a child; these women are used as vessels and regarded as nothing more. At times I found it hard to wrap my head around the story, mostly in terms of the lack of rebellion in the society. There didn't seem to be much of an all-powerful force to keep these characters in check, and somehow better explain why they didn't all band together and change things. I don't recall any sense of happiness or even contentment in any of the characters, yet no one really seemed to attempt to do much about it. It's as though there was this unspoken wish for life to return to normal, as it had been, but everyone was too brainwashed and robotic to take a stand. Once again Atwood manages to capture an eerie parallel to the way many people feel about our country in its current state. The author does however manage to sprinkle in some examples of resistance throughout the story, though I considered them fleeting and brief.We learn early on that Offred is unhappy with her surroundings, but expressing this would be blasphemous, in some cases punishable. She manages to retain memories of her life as it had been before Gilead. She is consumed with gathering as much information as possible about the current events unfolding in society, with the hopes of gaining insight about her husband. Gossip, communication in general, is not allowed between the Handmaids and most others, so the bits of information she receives are sparing. Offred also likes to steal things, finding a sense of excitement from it; a thrill. Deeper into the story we are introduced to a Commander whom which Offred is meant to conceive a child with. Sex exists only for the sake of procreation, so when Offred and the Commander begin a brief, quiet affair, they are both taking a great risk. She also begins a similar situation with a character by the name of Nick. From brief moments of conversation with another Handmaid named Ofglen, to an emotional relationship with Nick, Offred manages to keep her sanity by challenging the rules and boundaries set before her.In the book we are also introduced to a character named Moira; a friend of Offred's from her life before Gilead. Offred regales us with memories of her friend and how strong of a woman she was. Moira ended up being taken to the Red Center, along with Offred, but refuses to succumb so easily. She tells one of the Aunts, the women that oversee the Handmaids, that there is a problem with the toilet, but when the Aunt comes to assist her, Moira stabs her and steals her uniform as a means to escape. Her dangerous risk pays off as far as Offred knows and Moira serves as a symbolic reminder of hope. That is until Offred is reunited with her friend in a night club, where Moira is working as a prostitute. She explains to Offred that after her escape, she was captured. One of Offred's shining symbols of hope is now nothing more than a beaten, broken-spirited shell of her former self.I was disappointed by The Handmaid's Tale. I thought that by showing us this twisted society, Margret Atwood would somehow regain sanity for these characters and write in an uprising, a formal rebellion. I suppose the end-cap of the book alludes to the eventual fall of Gilead, but is that world any better than the one before it? I felt as though the book never really went anywhere. I consider it to be a view of a world that could be, but we all pray will not. There is no redeeming light at the end of Atwood's dark tunnel. I found it depressing and disturbing, but if the author's intentions are to stir the imagination and to start a dialogue then she has succeeded in spades."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I truly enjoyed this anti-utopia by Margaret Atwood.

Your life will be better for it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I love this book--Margaret Atwood is a national treasure. The only criticism i can offer is that the prose feels a tiny bit dated (but only for a second!), but the dystopia aspect could not be more poignant and timely amidst birth control and abortion issues, woman's rights, right wing fanaticism takeover, and man's decisions regarding women's bodies (as i write this we are just coming off of R. Limbaugh's \\"slut\\" and \\"prostitute\\" comments; a White House Health Care commission hearing regarding birth control coverage by a religious institution in which NO women were present; and a Republican Senator/legislator commenting that in his day \\"women just put aspirin between their legs\\" as the form of birth control). Trust me, this book will validate your reason to be freaked out by the tightening grip of the conservative right, and to covet all those sacrifices made by women for women. If you are the conservative right, read this and expand your imagination into what the world could be if we just \\"don't care\\" anymore.However, I really wanted to use the book jacket art with the image of the Handmaids against the wall, but the seller misrepresented the book art and i got a hardback with another sleeve on it. So the seller would get a poor review from me and is the reason i awarded 4 stars.

There are no quotation marks to differentiate when she is speaking to somebody and when she is narrating, but that is explained in the end, which was a big twist and great surprise for me!

Disturbing and thought-provoking in similar ways as 1984 or Animal Farm, but with far deeper sexual and political narratives. Written from the perspective of a handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, a not-too-improbable futuristic society, in which women's rights, freedoms and liberties are completely stripped in the name of the \\"greater political good.\\" Read it, it'll make you think!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In the modern era very few authors have taken the time and effort to maintain the classical writing style that was so prevalent during the 19th and 20th centuries. At present, the reading public is more concerned with action, sexual innuendos and excitement of a plot line rather than what previously dictated skill of what is required to be 'good writing skills'. Margaret Atwood, regardless of how one feels about the content of her books, has never ignored these age-old tenets. 'The Handmaid's Tale' is no exception. Written in 1st Person Singular we see the dystopic world of Gilead through a single handmaiden's eyes and her eyes alone. The result of this process not only allows the reader to closely identify and empathize with the lead character but, also, we become aware of the acts and events that are occurring around her that she has little, or no, awareness of. What is equally intriguing about this style is that we are quickly taken from current to past events, from memories into present thoughts and on into dreams. As it should for any successful novel, a great deal of work and concentration is required by the reader to maintain the flow of the plot while these rapid personal impulses are presented to you. The flow of the novel itself mimics the styles of E.A.Poe insomuch that we are given a foil with which to compare our heroines character, the slow building of a sequence of events which lead to the denouement, the rapid closure at the novel's climax and an equally critical short period whereby we, as a reader, can draw a degree of closure from the preceding events.Reading this novel, to me, was an extreme pleasure if for no other reasons than those I mentioned above. However, the dystopic world view, remembering it was written in the '80s, is equally as powerful. Is such a social milieu possible in the future? Probably not. But the point of this presentation is on of deeper-lying symbolism of our present situation rather than as being a foolproof predictor of future events.Atwood is not only an author that Canada should be proud of, but should be equally recognized around the world. The only failure of this text to me is the cover itself. While I realize that it, too, is meant to be merely symbolic representation of secrecy and obedience, an unknowing reader may reject the book outright because they feel this book may have its leanings towards physical mutilations."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was impressed by other books by Margaret Atwood I read, but this is definitely the best one. Frighteningly realistic, too."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Offred, is a Handmaid. She is sent to different homes for only one purpose, to produce a baby. This time she is with a Commander and his wife. Always doing as she is told she glides through this life, only having time at night, alone in her little room, to reflect on the life she lost. She holds the hope that, someday, this will all end and she will go back to her real life. It could happen...right?This book raises a lot of issues. Whether it be the oppression of women, or the strength of men or even the harm religious extremists can do to the world we live in, it made for a very interesting read.I have heard a lot of people say this book was scary because of how close we are as a society to becoming this way. Maybe I am naive, but I, in no way, saw this. I know in some countries this happens or isn't far from the truth but I had a very hard time believing that it could happen here. Then again, this book was written in the 80's just after the whole '1984 panic'.I had a hard time getting used to Atwood's writing style. I know the narrative was written in a way to sound like a persons own thoughts, but some of the sentence structures threw me off. There were many occasions I had to go back and re-read a paragraph because I didn't understand it. It is hard to tell who is talking about what when the author doesn't use quotation marks. After a few chapters, you do get used to it.Atwood does have a talent for language. Her writing is beautiful and descriptive. The details were extraordinary. I wanted to keep reading, not just to see where the story goes but to, also, get the images she paints into my head. She did especially well with the voice of Ofred. I felt like I was walking in her soft, flat red shoes down the faded pink runner in the hallway.I liked Ofred too. Even with everything that happened and was still happening to her, she held out hope. She is a survivor.This book would make for great discussions.

There's a lot better, like -Three billy goats gruff."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I highly recommend this book to everyone out there in the ether. Read it closely-- this is what happens when the religious right wins. I am amazed that Atwood was able to see our future so clearly when she wrote this book in the early 1980s.In \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\" the Bible Thumpers have overtaken our government, demolished the church-state barrier, and installed their own vile brand of theocratic fascism in the Republic of Gilead. (Take note: they rise to power by citing a constant threat of unnamed terrorists, necessitating police state measures.)In Gilead, everyone is segregated into a strict caste hierarchy. Men may be the Commanders, who are in charge, the Eyes, who are the agents of the Panopticon who whisk away any deviants, the Angels who wage the faraway wars, etc. Women's options are more strictly delimited: they may be the Wives of the Commanders, Econowives of the lower ranks, the Aunts who dominate and control women of the lower ranks, the Marthas who do menial household chores, the prostitute Jezebels, and the Maids like the narrator Offred.As a Maid, Offred's sole purpose in life is to breed with her Commander. The manner in which Commander Fred attempts to \\"fertilize\\" Offred simply must be read to be believed. Interestingly, the Gileadans cite Biblical precedent to support this bizarre method of surrogate conception. Maids are terminated if they prove unable to conceive.Since Offred's life options are so severely restricted, most of the novel takes place in her head. She reminisces about the time before, when she was able to marry, own property, and have her own children, the gradual increase in restrictions, and her failed attempt at escape. The novel is crushing in its illustration of a life thwarted, stunted, and defeated, and a woman made into an empty childbearing vessel. Reading the book, I was reminded of prison memoirs-- Offred has no chance of an external life, and is trapped in a life of solitude and regret.Some people might say that such a future is unthinkable in our democratic society. I would recommend that you speak to any member of the extreme evangelical ministries, which view Jefferson's separation of church and state as a lie and an illusion to be abolished, and believe in the literal, inerrant truth of the Bible. I would also recommend that you read V.S. Naipaul's \\"Among the Believers,\\" concerning the Islamic revolutions in Iran and Pakistan. Gilead's corporal punishments for heresy, dismantling of all democratic institutions like the press, and mandatory \\"Prayvaganzas\\" closely track what happened in Iran after the Ayatollahs overthrew the Shah.I would place this excellent book on par with \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World.\\" \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is necessary reading in this day and age."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Disturbing......because this could so easily happen right here.I thought it prophetic that in the \\"Historical Notes\\" at the end of the novel, Gilead(America under the monotheistic regime) is grouped with Iran (and that Gilead's takeover was accomplished by blaming the acts of terror on Muslims), when it's the hard Religious Right who push for monotheism and are always warning against Muslims.....Ironic.I thought this was a disturbing inside look at dominionism, Biblical cherrypicking, and oppression taken to the extreme. Anyone who thinks \\"this could never happen in America\\", I ask you to look at the recent legislative restrictions on women's rights, birth control, abortion, equality, the rights of LGBT, civil rights, voting suppression, attempts to bring Christian theocracy into our government, the war on the poor rather than on poverty, the lack of compassion by the Religious Right.....and think again.Excellent commentary on issues such as the consequences of pollution as well."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book is set in the near future.

Her idea of taking a form of religious fundamentalism to extreme was surprisingly suspenseful, with a strong narrative drive and hints of interesting characters that prompted me to read it in one day.That sounds like a five-star book. Unfortunately, her premise that the story could occur in the United States to me is absurd. Even in the 2000s, with the usual arguments about abortion, feminism, and the separation of church and state, we are nothing at all like the totalitarian and anti-woman state in the novel. People who read the book with an eye toward whether America could become \\"Gilead\\" are making the wrong move, in my opinion. Read it instead as an alternate history, more like science fiction or \\"The Road\\", contemplating how people would behave, what the rules would be like, and how might dissent be fostered and suppressed.Ms. Atwood shines at the dreary details, with the different castes of women and the unending rules, including their evolution over time as the power-that-be accommodate reality and the population's own adaptations. Naturally, the leaders adopt the time-honored tradition of keeping the masses uneducated and disconnected, with public eliminations of \\"enemies\\". The main theme is men's domination over women, with religious fundamentalism as the vehicle. However, Atwood also indicts women, as there are plenty of women complicit in the elimination of most freedoms, either through passive acceptance or as active participants. One of the saddest likely truths is Atwood's observation that people without freedom will gradually forget what it was like before, and the subsequent generations may not miss what they never knew. In the end, she seems to believe that humanity's desire for excitement, love and freedom are not completely repressible and inevitably and eventually will triumph. (Speaking of the end, the \\"historical note\\" fell flat with its tone and message, other than its utility as \\"what happened later\\".)The other main flaw in the society she created is that nobody really wins and nobody is happy. Who is benefiting? The men seem miserable most of the time and most of the women are miserable. If the men really wanted to construct a government with complete domination of women, they could have done a better job. The religion-based approach, so unlike any modern religion, presumably was chosen by Atwood as an anti-religion statement and is an excellent hook for the definition of rules. However, it ends up so extreme and unrealistic that it clearly could not have survived at length."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I am reading this book as a part of a book club.

However, I have to admit that some of the more graphic detalis could be unenjoyable to some. They do add to the story, but can be a little too much at times. The characters themselves add a lot to the story.

Atwood does a fantastic job of creating a fantasy world that very well could come true. my only complaint is that she fails to fully develop any of the female characters in the novel-even Offred remains flat and one-dimensional. This is an excellent science-fiction psychological thriller, but as do all thrillers, the characters lack any depth."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"At first reading, this is another possible-future story with a particularly bleak outlook. A theocratic totalitarian regime takes over the US in a fast, well-planned strike. Overnight, women lose the right to own property. They become property, their worth measured by their reproductive ability. If they fail as baby-making slaves to the inner circle of male domination, they become forced-labor slaves in the worst of environments. The regime reverts to public executions as entertainment, and to a corrupt core inside its iron fist.What's truly chilling is how close the details are to contemprary American politics. The regime bans birth control (except for \\"entertainment\\" slaves) and requires every pregnancy to come to term. No matter how severe the accident of nature, the baby must be born, post-natal infanticide being the replacement for abortion. Believers in any faith but the state faith are first banned, then hunted down. Much too much of this sounds like the ideal world for America's Christian fundamentalists - one faith, one morality, rights for only the few they select, all enforced at gunpoint. It's just too close to be funny.The book's postscript shows optimism. In it, some far-future conference on sociology analyzes the book and its era as ancient history, long after the regime's collapse. The narrator escaped and lived long enough to create the book's content, and the regime collapsed of its own internal distrust.This is a worthwhile, thought-provoking piece of fiction. Let's just hope that it really is fiction, not prophecy.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Margaret Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;. I found the slowly unraveling plot to be exciting and imaginative, and the setting that Atwood creates is simply stunning.Reflecting back on the book, however, several weaknesses clearly stand out. For instance, the beginning of the book reveals very little of the context of the story, but by the second half most of the story has been revealed, and only the plot (not extraordinarily interesting on its own) is left to be resolved. So by the ending, the only suspense that Atwood has held back is the fate of Offred, and the &quot;conclusion&quot; is somewhat lacking in punch. I personally felt that the denouement was inconsistent from the pacing of the rest of the book, and a little silly.My strongest reservation against this book, however, is the dull subject matter. I don't get it; is it supposed to be political? feminist? apocalyptic? In any case, I felt this aspect of the book was the weakest. Rather than condemning the totalitarian government, Atwood seemed more interested in exploring the torment of Offred, which is where the true strength of the book lies. Besides, how many times have we heard this same futuristic story before?Although I question some of the author's choices, I would not be reviewing this book if I did not sincerely enjoy it. Despite the (at times) overly political themes, the book is never boring. I also whole-heartedly suggest Margaret Atwood's other books, many of which are stronger than &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;.ps. In case you don't know how the book ends yet, I suggest you stop reading these reviews!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"As Shakespeare once observed, \\"What is past is prologue\\"--and certainly this holds true for Margaret Atwood's haunting novel.

While I agree the writing is, at times, overly impressionistic, and the feminism is blatant and outmoded, neither of these are my main problem with the story.Atwood fancies herself a writer of speculative fiction, meaning plausible - usually dystopian - futures. The problem is the speculation is so twee in its musings. At the current time, forty years after Atwood burned her bra and wrote this book, women are being systematically raped in the Congo, or the Sudan. And historical precedent also challenges the validity of her predicted future (e.g., The Nanking Massacre in 1937, The Khmer Rouge, etc). The point being that her chaste little world of the Republic of Gilead is so absurd and unlikely given the known barbarism of human nature when released full force.The book actually becomes an insult to women's rights, denying their natural sexuality, and a grave miscalculation of the evils to which society is capable of descending. The sexual behavior is bizarre, not in its perversion, but in its dowdy prudishness and unintended subtext of closeted lesbianism - specifically the \\"mating\\" rituals.It's to the misguided predictions of Atwood that - while American society has progressively advanced women's rights - other crimes against women, and people in general, in other parts of the world have and had greatly exceeded the ones put forth in The Handmaid's Tale. In this sense, the book is a disastrous failure, and its laurels a small crime against humanity."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The skills of the writer lacked to the point of boredum and her attempt at establishing a stable premise at which to convey the ways in which this ridiculus world came about are not present.

I don't know who Margaret Atwood is, but she must be one of us, cause she explains real well how our forces will run the country once we take power. This is a pretty good description of our program to establish a government for decent Bible-believing folks, to flush away all the filth that has polluted our society. Time to go back to the laws of the LORD and put people in their right place. Women will be protected and cared for properly, as this book tells, and not left to run loose and get into trouble the way they do now. I don't know how Margaret Atwood got ahold of the top echelon's plans, but maybe it's things she overheard in the training camp. We already have some righteous believers in place, like John Ashcroft, but there is still so much more to do. I hope more folks will read this book and join up with us, to restore righteousness to the nation and strike fear into the hearts of the unbelievers. This book is an important recruitment tool, like the Turner Diaries, to let everybody know there is a movement to restore decency to this land. We're on the move. We're getting close to success. The Bible promises that we will triumph. It won't be long now. Read this book to help get ready and inspire you what we're fighting for.

Atwood may be a good writer but her writing talents are spent here. In Offred, she creates a very pathetic character that is too uninteresting for the readers to care about what happens to her. I could not wait for this book to end, although I applaud Atwood for her creativity. This book belongs in the 70s when the feminist movement was taking shape. In the 90s, it is outdated.

Then it just became funny.I was not moved in anyway with this book, except for possibly lightly humored. It was not disturbing because it was so laughable and unrealistic. The most disturbing thing was the bizarre nightclub scene, because it seemed to be just thrown in there to be provacative, which unfortunately, it wasn't.Just wasn't my cup of tea at all.

The story is told by one of the few fertile women left, who are sold into slavery as baby makers. A horror story, a cautionary tale, and that wonderful rarity, science fiction that achieves the level of art. The first chapter, where the women are whispering their names to each other, will move you to tears. The characters are uncomfortably real, the commander and the commander's wife in particular. The last chapter never fails to make me froth at the mouth, I think mostly because I don't want Atwood to be right, and I'm terrified that she is.If you liked this book, try Sheri Tepper's The Gate to Women's Country.

I felt that she was to fulfill that Everywoman function too much leaving her seeming almost generic.

This book in no way convinced me that American society would end up in the bizarre '1984'-like ripoff presented here. To even suggest this as the logical future is completely shortsighted and ignores all advances women have made towards equality in the past hundred years or so.The entire book reads as an extremely heavy-handed attack on sexism. It fails to conjure up a realistic society, its characters defy common sense and reason, and it even falls flat in illustrating an interesting love story.

Thanks, Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I'm up in the air about this book. I really liked it, but there were many things that just didn't add up, were never fully explained, or just didn't plain make sense.This was the first Margaret Atwood book that I've read. The writing took a little bit to get used to, but after awhile I got into the groove, reveling in the poetic quality and harsh truths disguised under delicate prose. Atwood sure knows how to turn a phrase, equating glimpses to sips and hotel rooms as freedom licenses. She has a way of looking at things that makes you think.The story was good, seen through the eyes of a woman that was transitioning into her life as a handmaid, intense at times and told through a series of flashbacks and recounts of what happened. As good as I thought this book was, there were a few things that irked me. Some of the action was cut in favor of being told later on what had happened. Tell vs. show. Never a good thing, especially if there isn't a whole lot of action in the first place. The main character, I never did catch her real name, if it was said, I don't remember it, is a handmaid, tasked with the important job of having children in this new world where birthrates have fallen and women have become worse than second class citizens. It isn't till about halfway through that you are finally told what had happened to the United States in order for something like this to happen. And when it was revealed, I felt sort of let down. I guess I was hoping for more...epic, or at least something a little more probable. The idea that a group could just gun down Congress and take over the presidency and the army without any real resistance seemed a little silly to me. There's way too much bureaucracy for something like that to happen. And the fact that women's bank accounts were suddenly frozen was laughable. No bank in their right mind would want to lose half their customers. Who do you think runs this country anyway?I was unsure about all the religious implications. Hopefully, we as a society have grown to realize that we can't live exactly as the Bible tells us so. It's unrealistic, especially in modern times. And if this society was really concerned about birthrates, then why limit sex to the few and the old? The handmaid idea is basically a religious institution for prostitution. Have sex for babies! And then maybe your life won't suck so much! ... oh right, but you're a woman, so it always will. Most of the men in this world have many of the rights and privileges that they used to, if they are rich, that is. I understand the idea, and I was hooked when I was reading it, but after I was done and took a step back to really look at it, that's when I could see the glaring flaws.The worst, however, was the ending. It just sort of leaves you wondering: Did she make it, or not? Even after reading the epilogue, told in a bizarre college seminar history lesson years after the fall of the Gilean empire, you still don't really know. You never find out the fate of Luke or her daughter. Or if the main character finally made it to freedom. I would have been better off not reading the epilogue and then just making up my own theory of what happened.But, even after all these faults, I still found this to be a rather captivating read. I will read more of her books somewhere down the line. Hopefully her prose will do better with a different sort of story. This book does make you think though, of what could happen if we just sit by and watch our rights fade away in an effort to feel safe and protected. Something that was touched upon many times throughout the journey. An important idea that we face, even today."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I've been on a dystopian kick lately, and an Atwood kick as well, and I've noticed something, and this book really hit that something home. That something is that Margaret Atwood has exactly zero sense of subtlety. Over and over in her books, whether it be this, Year of the Flood, Blind Assassin, or Oryx and Crake, she finds that ONE thing and just starts hammering it into your skull. In some cases, like this book, she even adds an APPENDIX so that you can't ever, ever, ever be confused as to what her point was.The point of this book was, of course, feminism. A cause to which I am heavily sympathetic. So my problem isn't per se that the book has a feminist slant or pays attention to feminist themes to pretty much the exclusion of everything else. My problem is how Atwood goes about it. Let's take the heroine, \\"Offred.\\" When I first saw it on the back, I knew about the general idea of the book, I figured, \\"Huh. I guess it's a sort of Germanic looking name, maybe?\\" Thinking about the trends in, say, England, when it came to embracing Germanic features of its heritage after the Reformation in order to distance itself from the Catholic continent, I'm thinking maybe something like that happened here as well. A more radical case of self-redefinition in order to put a solid line between \\"us,\\" and \\"the other,\\" an extraordinarily common phenomenon after a revolution when people need to form a concrete distinction between the pre- and post-revolutionary eras. In Iran, for instance, after the foundation of the theocracy there.But nope. \\"Offred,\\" simply means \\"Of Fred.\\" As in \\"Fred's possession.\\" Because women are chattel. Get it? GET IT?This is what I mean. She takes a point she wants to make in a story and refuses to put it in any uncertain terms, out of apparent fear that you might make your own conclusions and have your own ideas about the work. Whether Atwood is naturally lacking in subtlety or whether it's an intentional thing, I don't know.But even the society is like this. It's obvious that the idea of it comes from the rise of extremist religious movements, whether the rise of the Moral Majority et al. in the US, or the rise of institutions like the velayet-e-faqih in Iran, or the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the Republic of Gilead is so blown up to cartoonish levels, devoid of any nuance, bereft of any actual attempt to analyze or look at the dynamics of actual theocracies, that we're left with no convincing explanation about how it came to be and how it's surviving. While there's a secular nature to the Republic (e.g., the bordello at the end of the book), most of the time it comes across as Atwood having a checklist of things a terrible, repressive theocracy should have. Public executions? Check. Public worship ala televangelism? Check (in the book as \\"Prayvaganzas.\\") Everyone hates everything? Check.The last part is especially important. Who is the Republic of Gilead benefiting that it's staying together? Even the commanders in the book are decidedly \\"meh,\\" about it. Fred, one of the leaders of the Republic, has some mild agreements with it, but apparently outright despises the strictures it puts on him. The everyday people don't seem to be extremely religious, as Atwood describes them. But even going back to the foundation of the Republic, Atwood describes that while only raising more questions. Why did the U.S. Military, the vast majority of which is not fundamentalist, despite what you may have heard, gun down the Executive and Legislative branch of government? What was their motivation? How did the rest of the world react to the world's greatest military power declaring martial law on itself as it installed a theocratic government?This goes on and on, but the central point is that Atwood's world, while mildly interesting, is focused without subtlety on her single pet agenda, and the world is fleshed out only so much that it seems even more cartoonish than it otherwise would have. All of this is compounded by the appendix of the book, which is a recorded transcript of a speech given by a scholar of Gilead society two hundred years later. In it, Atwood proceeds to take any interesting ambiguity the book had and do away with it. The name of the book (\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\")? She makes sure to tell you it was a reference to Chaucer. Inability of the Commanders to have children? Turns out they were infertile! And so on. Pretty much every plot point (besides the fate of Offred) is tied up so explicitly that the only room for discussion, really, is whether Offred survived.Jumping off of this point, others have noted how irritating the writing can be. While I see their point (and cringe at some of the lines they pull up), I really do think the appendix is the most poorly written section of the book. It has single-handedly convinced me that Atwood can't write a line of dialogue longer than a sentence. It just sounds stilted.Don't get me wrong, the book isn't BAD. It is, however, painfully average. Offred can be a compelling character at times, but too often she's two-dimensional. If you're looking for an interesting look into how a country, any country, can fall into theocracy and what that theocracy can look like, I wouldn't really recommend this book - the world is too built up around Atwood's own agenda to be a truly insightful look into the nature of religious extremism, or even religion, and the societies it can produce or influence."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is one of the most gripping books I've read.

It takes place in the near future, and focuses on the life of a woman whose soul purpose is to provide babies to powerful men. She is a handmaid. Every joyless minute of her life is controlled by her overseers. Beneath the narrative, Atwood weaves a picture of a tragic world where life is bleak. The prose appropriately mimics the stultifying life of the handmaid.The feminist message runs deep, but does not point at men, per se, as the guilty ones. In her novel, the villains are both men and women: anyone supported the religious wave that overtook their freedoms.It's truthful, and a work of art."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In The Handmaid's Tale, the United States has been turned into the Republic of Gilead. It's heavy on men, military, and religion. The narrator, known only as Offred (read: Of Fred), is one of the class known as \\"handmaids.\\" They function as surrogates for the wealthy/powerful/sterile. Through flashbacks juxtaposed with events in the current time, we learn a bit about how Gilead came to be and a lot about how screwed up it is to be a woman in a totalitarian state.Here, perhaps, is where the novel lost me. While I am a hearty advocate of women in general, I am not a feminist per se. I agree with you that we should be able to vote. I don't agree with you that we should punish men for having kept us down lo these many years. I do not choose to have a chip on my shoulder, unless it is made of chocolate.My personal views aside, I enjoyed the \\"how this all came to be\\" sections of the novel, as well as the epilogue that gave additional detail on the downfall of the United States. (It was incited by a staged terrorist attack attributed to Muslims. This book was written in 1985. Dun dun DUN.) Offred's history and what happens to her during the course of the book, less so. I suspect it would have more resonance for those who have or have tried to have children.Whether you're up for a critique of gender roles, religion, and government is up to you. All of us, though, can use a good reminder of the dangers of totalitarianism. I mean, this book has people getting hanged and beaten to death. Even worse, most women aren't allowed to read.

Atwood delivers with her novel a new aspect in the various dystopias of the 20th century: the tyranny of a fundamental christian sect.Considering all these aspects one could remark that the artistic realization leaves a lot to be desired.But the final question,if the handmaid's tale is really worth reading is difficult to answer.If you are interested in becoming acquainted with dystopian novels you will be more content with one of the classic dystopias, such as Orwell's \\"1984\\" or Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\"."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"To say Handmaid's Tale is a story about women, would be saying Moby Dick is a story about whales. This terrifying story about Offred and her restricted life in the Republic of Gilead is a masterpiece that explores the darker secrets in a person's life.Offred is a Handmaid; she is under the guidance and control of her Commander, Fred, and his wife, Serena Joy. Once a day, she is allowed to leave her home to walk to food markets. However, instead of words that indicate what one is buy, the signs are now pictures, for women are no longer allowed to read. Once a month, Offred must go through the \`Ceremony\\"; a ritual in which the Commander proceeds to impregnate Offred. This ritual is completed by all handmaids in order to save a declining human population.Weaved within this story of love and hate, are personal narratives, in which Offred recounts her previous life in which she lived with her husband and daughter. A time in which she had a joy, money, and access to knowledge. As readers enter this hidden world, they become more and more attached to Offred and her fight for freedom.Handmaid's Tale is a story like no other. Its deep expression of one woman's battle in a world of bigoted men is as true as today as during the 80's. So whether or not you have time for this story, make time, you wont regret it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"My bookclub read this and everyone enjoyed it a lot.

She will become a person not even herself can come to know. For sex is the art of governing. The Handmaids Tale is a malicious story told in a way only one can feel sympathetic for Offred, a handmaid living in the Republic of Gilead. She is to be obedient and is considered petty to all that are not handmaids. This is a place that has continued without interference of the past. For Gilead's future does not consist of love anymore but arranged child births and marriages. Offred is a woman that only exists in this community for her ability to produce children.This cause for the existence of a child is so the future can reek of children molded into what this nation believes they should be. My opinion, which I hope is obvious, is that no child's future should be chosen by anyone but themselves. A person should not be able to just sit back and marvel at the sexual suggestions being spewed out. These are innocent babies being torn away from ever being able to say a phrase like \\"I love you, I really do.\\" Offred's body is not the only one of its kind being tortured numerous times. This is only a story told by one handmaid. I just don't see how anyone can be self-assured when a woman is being provided by another like property. And let this happen to these woman when they have never been subjected to these \\"ways\\" before. These people should get paid for being generally annoying and irritating. How can you expect one to be sociable and efficient. When they are treated as if they are only this set of names and faces given away with instructions. I am not only furious with the ways of Gilead but disappointed. I know theoretically women are smarter. But I did not think they would go this far to control us. These things should stay in the privacy of your own home. I demand these people to stop humiliating themselves. You think you're the future of \\"birth\\" just because you manipulate women. One word for you \\"Wrong.\\" Because no matter what happens there will always be that no passion, boredom, emptiness, need, laughter, and energy to communicate in this terrifying picture of the world. Some will not be able to tolerate, for example me. There is no real principal behind it because Gilead's expectations are unrealistically high.But some unrealistic things can be capable of existing. That's why I recommend this book. Because it helps you appreciate the way our government is now. I am personally against a lot the government does today. But after read this tale I have come to appreciate it much more. I know most of you are saying something on line of \\"This would never happen, so what's your purpose.\\" Well I do have a purpose because anything could happen. Its not like we would have agreed with a person ten years ago when they said \\"Two planes will crash into the twin towers.\\" Our government is not perfect and neither are the people trying live by it.

Its not real and the notes are irrelevant. Not only that, they pose the question of how Offred was able to record them. No-where in the novel does she relay any such detail as her difficulty in keeping records. And finally, my last moan, why are the notes at the end? They would provide a good basis and outline of the novel. They belong at the front. Though to be perfectly honest the whole thing belongs in the bin. Never agin should a student be subjected to such rubbish."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"it's a good book. it's not the best but it's good. i love the author's style and creativity, and the silly way she presents what possibly happened to Offred and Nick and the Commander."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I have not read any other book by Margaret Atwood so this review is solely based on the writing in this book and what I got out of it, which was not much.The first chapters are particularly innundated with incomplete sentences which usually give a sense of urgency to the reader. In this case, it just made the reading tedious. You do not want to read this book out loud because it will make you sound very annoying.Even though I'm all for criticizing religious extremists, a better book could have made the point without insulting people's intelligence.On the story itself, I just didn't buy it from the beginning so it was difficult for me to get into it at all. Here's why:- The changes that must have occurred in this society are supposed to have happened within 10 years. This is too far-fetched, as it has been mentioned before. Anyone who has taken any type of sociology/anthropology/economics/politics class is being asked to forget all they have ever learned and just go with the flow. No society where everyone living under it(including top officials)is unhappy and breaking their own rules is going to be sustainable for long and much less enforceable for long. Drugs are too easy an answer.- The main character is not really defined, she's all over the place. In fact, for someone who was supposed to be a college grad, she's pretty stupid. She thinks of herself as timid and complacent and yet every now and then she would have an outburst of assertiveness. Like her sudden awareness of her sex appeal and manipulation of it toward the Commander in those secret meetings. She wasn't smart and that was a big turn off.- There were so many opportunities missed from the very beginning of better story lines that never took off. Ex. Ofglen, her partner in shopping, was aware of some underground movement and yet Offred never asked questions on the subject. Similarly, other handmaids during the 'birth day' had information that our hero never bothered to pursue. Maybe she liked being a victim and the life she led. The book would have been so much more exciting if the character had been willing to take risks. Again, not a very smart or functional main character.Although I didn't like the character of Moria (come to think of it, I didn't like any of the characters), I think I would have liked the book to be about her and her adventures better than Offred's. She got a better perspective of what was going on and she was not afraid to explore the possibilities.I do not recommend this book. It asks it's readers to conform to a mediocre story just like Offred is being asked to conform to a mediocre life with no real justification."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Thinly-veiled left rant disguised as Orwellian thriller. Well-written and a good read overall, but one wonders why a writer of Atwood's obvious gifts could not have been a little more subtle and less pedantic."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Steven from Colorado, Colleen Clay, and Cynthia Spiegel have analyzed this book correctly, and I agree with their two star rating, although even that low rating seems hard to justify on the merits. They have discussed the many flaws of the novel, including the fact that it is dull, flat, meandering, uninspiring, and poorly written. But in addition to all that, it is misconceived. Atwood succeeds in evoking a dark dystopian world, pandering mightily in the process to current feminist hysteria and borrowing not a little from George Orwell; but the plot goes nowhere. The book is (like most fantasy and sci-fi) utterly unbelievable -- and yes, I do get the parallels with the plight of Muslim women -- but even if we suspend our disbelief for the sake of the story, there is no story here worth our time. The book is simply a feminist diatribe in dystopian form. Nor is there one character with whom the reader can identify. The reputation that this book has acquired since I first read it almost fifteen years ago is far overblown. As ideology, it is a shrill harangue. As literature, it is a failed experiment and a pretentious one at that. Better Nora Roberts than this."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Once I read chapter 16, I was ready to read the book in one sitting.

I thought, \\"This book can't go all the way to the end without anything happening, can it?\\" But it did. It was quite a feat. You could summarize this book in about 45 seconds. And you'd likely want your 45 seconds back. Is this supposed to be 1984, Brave New World, or even Hunger Games? If you compare it to any of those books, it is utter fail. I guess it was supposed to be sad, but I didn't even care about anyone, or anything in the story. And there was this weird section at the end, where they try to pretend it was a true story, and they are having a meeting to discuss the historical facts about the book. It starts out talking about a planned luncheon of the historical group. Was that supposed to make it seem \\"authentic?\\" It was just bizarre."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"i thought that the book was in good shape, it didnt have so many pen marking, it was in good condition. i would have like if the book came soon though."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It was very well written, with imagery so vivid that it was at times disturbing. However, the ending ruined the entire book for me. I had never read anything by Atwood before, and I never will again. What a letdown!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"As Sci Fi books go this is a poorly written one. Doris Lessing once remarked that if you want to write literature in this day and age it has to be in the form of science fiction. Viewed in this light this is mrs Atwoods first attempt at writing literature and she shows here she does not (yet) have the writing ability. This book barely rises above the level of a feminist pamphlet, if that.For a properly written book on this theme see Suzette Haden Elgin's 'Native Tongue' (and sequels)."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The book arrived in perfect condition, and I loaned it to a friend before re-reading it myself, which I plan to do. I loved it the first time I read it, and now that I'm older, I want to read it again with fresh eyes. It is a very engrossing tale."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"After a violent uprising and coup, portions of North American are controlled by a theocratic society called the Republic of Gilead. In Gilead women own no property, hold no jobs, and are relegated to specific roles. They are not permitted to read, to speak with men, to have any human touch outside the specific regulated ceremonies. This book tells the story of Offred, who has had everything taken from her; her husband, her daughter, her job, her money, even her name. She is a handmaid, and her job is to become pregnant by one of the elite men of Gilead and give birth to a healthy child. She must live by the rules of this society or suffer an unknown fate.This is an above average book made more powerful by the current political atmosphere. What makes this more powerful, terrifying really, is the realistic possibility that this could happen in my lifetime. I do not particularly like Atwood's writing style, and I think the addition of the historical notes at the end was a mistake. It is a good but flawed book, but it should be read far and wide as a warning of what could happen."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A beautifully written book that requires the reader to think.

I loved it!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Atwood's style appeals to me as much as the storyline.

Order it from here and be sure to tell all your friends."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This seemed like an important book, and I was in the mood for something serious, so I purchased it. It's just getting too weird and disturbing for me. I give it 3 stars because the writing is good - and maybe I'll pick it up again sometime, but I decided I wasn't really enjoying reading it, so I stopped. The scary thing is that some of it -- i.e., the repression of women -- sounds like it could happen today if the right wing extremists had their way. But it's really very creepy, even by their standards."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is one of the scariest books I have ever read; the most frightening aspect of the book is how POSSIBLE it is. The society portrayed in Atwood's world feels eerily close to political themes bandied today: conservative religious fervor resulting in a theologically fascist state where woman's rights have regressed to a pre-reformation level of oppression and control, facilitated by systematic brainwashing and aversive control. This book is a must read for progressive women everywhere."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"An absolutely amazing read. This dystopian world, accompanied by infertility caused by nuclear waste, is a situation that could one day become our reality. This is the reason why this book is so chilling - it could happen one day, and is in fact happening currently in some places of the world.When you read it, you will get chills up and down your spine because of how terrifyingly accurate these scenes are. You can actually imagine it happening... you can see the justifications, you can understand the desperation.This book is beautiful, haunting, and quite worthy of all the praise that gets lavished upon it. It should be required reading for everyone, but especially younger women. I have wanted to read this for a long time, and I am kicking myself for not doing so before. Truly a gem, and Atwood is a master."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Great story, stunning use of the language. Every line is poetry, yet with no loss of clarity. As important a dystopian novel as \\"1984\\" or \\"Brave New World\\" -- but with superior prose. A must-read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The time in the book is more or less now--but a now if things had gone horribly wrong a few years ago. The narrator, a woman in her thirties, used to have a successful career. Shortly after college she started dating a married man, who then divorced his wife and married her. The two of them had a daughter together and were happy. They were aware of some troublesome things--there was a toxic waste problem, and reduced childbirth rates, possibly due to sterility caused by the toxic waste. Life was still livable, though. Then the country fell apart. The president was gunned down, as were all other top-level government officials. Those now in charge decided to go back to the Bible for advice on how to live.The first changes happen together--women are no longer allowed to work or to own anything, including money. The narrator finds her bank account frozen and herself without a job. Bigger trouble seems to be looming on the horizon, so she and her husband decide to escape with their five-year-old daughter before things get any worse. Their plan seems foolproof, but something terrible happens. Instead of escaping across the border, they are caught. The narrator loses her husband and doesn't know if he has been killed or arrested. She and her daughter run for it, but then her daughter is taken from her, to be raised by a suitable family. The new government does not recognize divorce and has dissolved all second marriages and taken away the resultant children.The narrator is lucky, because she still has a viable reproductive system, a commodity truly valued by the new government. This fact saves her from being labeled an \\"Unwoman\\" and sent to work the fatal job of cleaning up toxic waste. Everyone is desperate for healthy children. She and many other women like her are sent to live in a sort of brainwashing center, where they are taught that they are nothing but wombs to be filled with the babies of those more worthy, the children of Commanders and their Wives. When an important couple is unable to have children, they will be assigned one of these women, a Handmaid, who will live with them, meekly and silently. The Handmaid, who is not allowed to converse with others, to read or to do anything without permission, will be permitted out of the house to do the grocery shopping every day, where she will be paired with another Handmaid who will presumably tattle on her if anything inappropriate happens. The Handmaids wear long red dresses and head coverings with blinders to prevent them from looking around. Once a month an elaborate ceremony is performed, culminating in a weird sexual act involving the Commander, his Wife, and the Handmaid.Such is life for this narrator, who is currently assigned to a Commander named Fred and is therefore called Offred, as she is considered his property. She is told that in a couple of generations things will have worked out and Wives will no longer be jealous and resentful of Handmaids. She is told she will get used to her life, her solitude, her newly reduced place in society. But she dreams of freedom, of escape, of her husband and her daughter and of the million things she should have been grateful for before she was made into a sex slave.There were a lot of things I really liked about this book. The attention to detail was admirable; I felt like I knew the characters and had a good grasp of the rules of this society. I could understand how the words of the Bible could have been twisted around to make such a society possible, and I could see how people were controlled by this new government. The story was poetic, the thinking of the narrator beautiful and heartbreaking. I liked the ambiguous ending and wish she'd left it at that, instead of adding the horrible \\"Historical Notes\\" to attempt to clear up the story. There are much better ways to do so, although I don't think in this case it was necessary.However, there was one major problem with this book. Nobody was benefitting from the new system of government. Women were certainly not benefitting. Everyone, from the Wives, to the servants, to the Handmaids, was miserable and resentful of the others for some reason. In any situation in which one group of people is exploited or marginalized, there is generally some corruption at the top layers of social heirarchy and someone is getting something out of the deal. In this story, it seems that men ought to be getting something out of allowing women to be treated as objects and property.Even the men in this story, though, who are sneered at and villainized by the author, are living miserable lives. They have to wait to be assigned a Wife and they have no choice about who she is. Perhaps many years later if they are unable to have a child, the couple may be assigned a Handmaid. It seems that this would be a reward--one man allowed two women with whom to have sex! However, the sex is so regimented and scheduled that it has been stripped of all of its passion and excitement. Even in a time when things are so backward that men would not want women to be able to read or to carry on a conversation with them as equals, I'd bet they wouldn't be in favor of these new rules about sex.So, although there were a great deal of things about this book that touched me and made me think, I found it simply unbelievable that anyone, male or female, would have tolerated this social system for very long."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"If you are looking for a fascinating plot, The Handmaid's Tale might not be for you. In re-creating her dystopic, monotonous world, the typical event structure of novels is sacrificed. The setting and characters, however, are incredibly well-thought-out and detailed. From clothing to titles to shopping methods to coming-of-age ceremonies, Atwood has left nothing out. There is no real beginning, and no real ending either--just a slow march of pages (indeed, there are at least three chapters entitled \\"Night\\") that still keep you enraptured and horrified.While a fascinating book, The Handmaid's Tale is an exercise in imagination and thus might not be for everyone. However, if you have an interest in women's issues, this book is almost required reading."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This novel is the epiphany of bone-chilling in its element of sheer possibility. Atwood creates a situation of the not-too-distant future where the norm of every day life becomes one held in a pace of inhibition and complacencey. The elements Atwood uses to emphasize this miniature world holds the intrigue of the reader while at the same time evoking a plethora of emotions in response to the characters and the roles they abide. The depth of which Atwood takes the story keeps the pages turning faster and faster while also causing dread for us to fall deeper into the web of this tangled new world. By the end of the story, the reader is both at the height of astonishment and surprise. The intensity of questions and wonder that befalls the reader after absorbing the last few words of this novel will surely resound for many years after the fact."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Several readers excoriate Atwood's Tale for being an unrealistic glimpse into a future that has not come. However, this book does not contain the same portents of the future as Orwell's novel 1984, which follows similar plot lines. Rather. it seeks to reframe the past. My gut reactions to fictitious events in the book were mixed with horror and disbelief. Then relief that we as a society are not subjected to the injustices which Atwood's characters justify. But the parellels with the past are present- and in the book's Epilogue, entitled Historical Notes, they are made even more apparent.Atwood describes an Underground Female-road, shuttling women to safety. America had it's own version in the 19th century, the Underground Railroad. Atwood describes videos of slaves picking fruit and cleaning up waste in The Colonies. This could foreshadow painful aspects of our culture too.The adulterous and treasonous, whether guilty or not, are ceremoniously killed in public hangings, a practice that was once part of Puritanical New England society.Countless other faceless people hide or flee from the radical religious persecution which characterized the Holocaust.Indeed, Atwood's ending, entitled Historical Notes, acknowledges the historical foundations of the outrageous practices and ceremonies employed by the fictitious Nation of Gilead to subvert the protagonist and others.The passion of some and the indifference of others in the face of human suffering is nothing new, but Atwood's novel nontheless illuminates the topic in the context of true historical events. She aptly reminds the reader who says \\"none of this could ever happen\\" that it already has, and still is.Read this book as a vision of the future and you will be left with a piece of radical feminist propoganda, an entertaining, almost comical story, but you will miss the author's intentions entirely."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It&#8217;s not like \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is a book I would have picked in a bookstore, just because I don&#8217;t like these kinds of books, creating a dystopia too show people just how bad the world they live in is in reality. I don&#8217;t like having the feeling that the author of a book wants to pass a message to the reader, through the language of signs and symbols, like the reader is to stupid to make out that point by himself.Still, expecting the novel to be just perfect for interpreting messages into metaphors and similies, as it was for school, I reluctantly read &#8222;The Handmaid&#8217;s tale&#8220; &#8211; or better said &#8211; I reluctantly started reading it for it turned out to be a completey fascinating story.Atwood describes, from the main character&#8217;s point of view, how the State of Massachusets is turned into the Republic of Gilead, where every person only has one purpose to fulfill, deping on their status in society. The main character, Offred, is chosen to be a handmaid, meaning that her purpose is to bear healty children to her commander and the commander&#8217;s wife. To make sure everyone is fulfilling the tasks designated to him/her, people are constantly being controlled by the totalitarian system, being brainwashed as well as contolled by fear and violance. Offred&#8217;s personal fate in this world, governed by religious fanatism, is described in &#8222;The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale&#8220;.Of course there is many things one could read into that story, the warning of how bad reality could turn out to be if we don&#8217;t handle society carefully, but that overloaded symbolism only is a small point which, in my opinion, does not change the fact that one can enjoy reading the novel without thinking about such criticism &#8211; or actually, one can only enjoy reading the novel without doing so. When I read &#8222;The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale&#8220; trying not to interptet the author&#8217;s intention, but only concentrated on giving in to the story I found myself pushed to my personal boarders, being confronted with ideas I had never been confronted with before and that was, in some way, scary. It&#8217;s like standing at a cliff when you&#8217;re afraid of height&#8217;s and you have to climb up there &#8211; it&#8217;s scary when you do it, but afterwards you&#8217;ll have you&#8217;re personal borders pushed away a little further so you can understand more than you could before."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read this book once in high school and again in college. This story has already happened! In Iran women are kept almost as slaves to their husbands and they have no rights of their own. For centuries kings would have barren wives executed or divorced just in order to remarry a woman who could bear him an heir to the throne--if that's not women being used as childmaking robots I don't know what is. Even now a woman doesn't have freedom to choose what happens to her body. Abortion is illegal in most places than not, meaning that a woman cannot make her choice to terminate her pregnancy. Men out there--if you can't relate b/c it is not from a male perspective then you have no intellectual capacity whatsoever--women have related to male-view propeganda for years without complaint."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"After reading the reviews I really thought this was going to be an interesting book.

It just stops... and you have to read in the prologue what might have happened or might not have. It had the potential to be a really good and interesting book.

The world is in dire straits because of some kind of war (likely nuclear in nature). The story focuses on Offred (pronounded of-fred), a handmaiden to one the Commanders (higher-ups, all men). We see the current world through the eyes of Offred as she uses the past to escape the present. \\"Today\\" is interspersed with how \\"today\\" arrived in a very fluid yet eerie way.I love how smooth the transitions are because so many stories jump around timelines badly. As the timelines converge, the story goes deeper and deeper into a sort of madness that makes the reader want to scream stop, but somehow it seems logical for things to happen this way.This is not really a hopeful piece of dystopian fiction, much more along the lines of 1984. Unlike the newer dystopian books, this story is much more quietly menacing rather than in your face violent fights. It's still not for the faint-hearted though.I really enjoyed this story although it's disturbing nature has sapped my ability to read disturbing books for awhile."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I'm not a big fan of sci fi but this was better than I thought it would be. It had a well woven plot and interesting characters."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Atwood's dystopia proves all the more chilling because of the America's puritanical penchant in addressing social issues. With a push here, a nudge there, the totalitarian regime described in this subtle tour de force could evolve into a terrifying reality.Atwood's writing structure also adds to the despair, the gloom, of the protagonist's recounting of her sordid ordeal. So much of the prose was passive. In other instances, this would've been weak writing. But Atwood deftly employs this construction to intensify the violation of Offred, women, and the nightmarish society she so masterfully constructs. The slights happened to her; events controlled her. Our heroine had no power to determine the course of her existence.This tale also forces one to consider how we as a society deal with such moral quandaries. This book is all the more terrifying because of the rampant sexual assaults and \\"gender\\" violence that occur today. Pushed too far, the public could acquiesce to such ideologically driven regimes.Germany still bears the scars from Hitler and his genocidal Nazi regime; Russia has Stalin and the great purges. Even in America we have seen the abdication of freedom for so called security. One can certainly imagine in a time of successive crises the American public meekly falling in line.Atwood scoured my soul with this work, but made me think of how I should cherish life and its simple, its sublime, moments, its beauty and love, instead of blankly, passively, existing.The Handmaid's Tale is not for the weak or those who do not want to examine their own internal motivations or values.It is starkly, yet beautifully, written. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I love dystopian novels. Overall, I enjoyed the writing and flow of this work.

The viewpoint of the story is based on a women who has been put in the role of Handmaiden, who's role is a broodmare for her Commander. She is the 1st generation, so there are many flashbacks to society prior to this change in the world. This is not an uplifting tale, but a very scary &#34;what could be&#34; story of a society where all liberties are removed, and as long as you follow your prescribed job, you will survive. Everyone though is aware that once you no longer do your job or deviate from societal &#34;norms&#34;, there will be a black van showing up to take you away.

While many people acknowledge how subjective &#34;normal is,&#34; this book gives a first hand catharsis of this notion. In Offred&#8217;s retrospections of life before, nostalgia reigns. All of us have experienced nostalgia of different stages, or periods, in our lives. It&#8217;s really true that change is the only constant. &#8220;Ordinary, said Aunt Lydia, is what you are used to. This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will. It will become ordinary&#8221; (Atwood 34). Change is only startling long after the fact, and it unnerved me how distant yet always present the past can be. Especially with emotions. &#8220;But who can remember pain, once it's over? All that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. Pain marks you, but too deep to see.

It is the author, Margaret Atwood's view of what her real world Dystopia would be like. The story is about what could happen if the government and the people lose control of what they have. It shows what could go wrong and what life would be without order. There are not that many details when reading the book, of why the world had been turned upside down so quickly. You have to make up your own ideas on what you think happened and why it happened. I believe that the author left it that way so the reader could be creative when reading this book. You begin to ask yourself question on why, would the world would turn into such a religious society, which was once so sane, and peaceful. This society slowly takes over and eventually they run everything, even sex. All the women are given the choice to either be sent to \\"the Colonies,\\" or become a handmaid. The Handmaids wear red robes, white blinders, and do there own shopping. At this point of the book this does not seem to be a life or death situation for anyone. You try to keep your head and not let the society take control of you like they have done everyone else, however this will shortly change. The worst is yet to come. I will try not giving away all the major details in The Handmaid's Tale. In the new society, you are not allowed to see your previous kids, family, porn, or the other handmaids. One of the parts that I didn't like was all the flash backs that she was having during many of the parts of the book. I found them to be very confusing and hard to figure out, what was going on. I had to read some of the passages a couple of times, some times more than others. However I liked how the author used the past to create a background of the main character, Offred. You may think that the names are weird know, but once you read the book, in the later chapters you will find out what the Handmaid's names mean. I also like the great detail in which the author described in the book. It felt like you were in the room, you know where everything was; it was like you wanted to reach out and touch something.The only thing that I would change was, I would give it a proper ending as it does not have one and it is frustrating not knowing what happens. You will know what I mean when you finish the book. I felt like there should have been another chapter, on what had happened to the main character Offred and to the rest of the Dystopia.I would recommend it because it is so different and interesting from anything else."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Wow! What a story. A little confusing at first but after awhile the pieces started to slide together. Scary, a little too close to home but unbelievable all at the same time. You could sympathize with Olfred, you could be scared or angry at her. You could sympathize with all the women's choices or at least the choices they were given anyway. They tied up the ending nicely although makes you wanting more. I listened this on tape and the narrator was very good, expressed emotion very well. However I would still like to read the book at some point so that I can move thru it slowly and concentrate on all parts more closely."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaids Tale should serve as a warning to future generations."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I came across this book while studying for my English A levels and was taken a back by the way in which Margaret Atwood (the author) encourages the reader to question and analyse the text. The Handmaid&#65533;s Tale is a story about just that, a tale written in a diary of sorts as told by a young woman who lives as what is known as a \\"handmaid\\" in this time under this new oppressive government. Basically, handmaids are young women whose primary purposes in life are only held for their reproductive capabilities, making them nothing more than pieces of private property. It tears away all that is uniquely democratic and possibly worthwhile from our society, and replaces it with something that is quiet [different] in its own rights. In fact, a direct correlation could be drawn from the USA's own constitution to the overthrow that occurs in this novel.The new government in The Handmaid's Tale has been founded by radicals, who suspended the Constitution after the United States fell into chaos, with their president having been shot and Congress wiped out. The radicals restructured society in the hopes of a more promising future, one where the burdens of women are uplifted and removed."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A very frightening alternative reality stressing the utter fragility of our country. Not too far fetched if the religious fanatics that we all know exist in this country get organized and take action. Just think of it, a return to the dark ages in terms of ideology but with nuclear weapons. Very dark, very frightening, impossible to put down. A brilliant piece of work."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is a horrific view into the future that displays the use of sex as a political aspect. In an extreme rightist world, Offred, a handmaid, is used as a tool for expanding the population. She is forced into have sexual intercorse with her &quot;Commander&quot; so that she may bear children, who will be raised not by the handmaid, but by the Commander's wife. Yet, as terrifying as it seems, the future that Atwood describes becomes viable, palpable at times. Atwood develops the plot so that the future she describes could easily be our own. She confronts issues which we struggle with today, such as abortion, birth control, extreme rightisim, and surrogate mothers and provides conclusions to them. For example: the abolition of birth control and abortion, and the glorification of surrogate mothers. These conclusions shape the scenes that Atwood presents. The use of handmaids has arisen because of the use of surrogate mothers in the past. However, the conclusion of the novel leaves the reader curious, slightly confused, and bewildered because of the lack of explanation by Atwood. The main character, Offred, is taken away and the novel concludes, leaving the reader without an explanationof her whereabouts and wellbeing. This is definately a novel that will intrigue minds and give you something to ponder."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I think this also one of the most scarest because the whole time I was reading it was thinking how a lot of what the character goes through is a reality for women around the world.

I recommend the book to anyone who enjoys a good story."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This edition of the book includes some clarification in the appendix. Atwood based the events on her historical research into religious oppression in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Atwood tells a terrifying story of history repeating it self in an extreme way. The details of day to day life were so interesting to me, I was sucked into that world and when I was able to put the book down I felt relieved! It was a page turner for sure, but not a book that was easy to pick up once I got away from it. Although the world Atwood described was gripping, I wanted more of a story instead of just an idea of what society was like. I wanted to know more about Luke and more about what ever kind of resistance there was, I wanted a war. I wanted some kind of a climax to the story and I don't feel like there was one. The ending didn't tie all the loose ends up for me instead it had an opend ending for you to imagine what you wanted. I would rather have a nice tidy ending, but that's just me. A dark, horriflying, disturbing read! Four stars for me"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book was pretty surreal but rather interesting.

The first margret Atwood book I've read and I'm sure to go through the rest of her work. The writing is superb and as your reading it you know it's something special."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book may have been written over 25 years ago, but as of today it's story is still extremely believable en eerily realistic. It's a gripping story and the realistic feeling of the book is what makes it such a good book!The main character, Offred, is a Handmaid, a woman who is in the household to get pregnant so she can ensure offspring for the couple she lives with. This involves doctor visits and a monthly \`session' with the Commander, on a specific date to ensure the best chance of the Handmaid getting pregnant, while his wife looks on and tries to ignore or push her thoughts out of her own mind knowing that she cannot bare children herself. Handmaids have no choice in the matter and are to do as the rules say, so they can stay where they are instead of being sent out to work in the Colonies to clean up the pollution, most likely killing them. It's picking the lesser of two evils. If you have read the book \\"The Red Tent\\", you will see in this book how much this story resembles the acts of the people in this book. Their beliefs are quite the same as Rachel's mail Bilhah being offered to Jacob to bear children for them.It made me realize how much freedom we have right now, and how much we actually take for granted. Women's rights are quickly stripped away from the characters in the book and they are being used as \\"property\\", unless it involved one of the elite women, who of course, had more rights. Women have few rights, if they have any in the book, and it may sound hard to believe, but Atwood has a certain talent of writing it in a way that's incredibly believable.I have to admit that I have a really hard time putting my thoughts on this book into words. It's a gripping story, compelling, realistic, and very well written. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a story that may introduce you to an adult dystopian novel, without travelling too far away from the YA genre or reading about less realistic societies.The Handmaid's Tale is a story that will stick with me, gruesome as it is, and it has made me curious about her other dystopian novels![...]"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Reminiscent of Time Machine and the implications of extreme unbending beliefs.

I've told everyone I've talked to to read it. It takes me away from this world and places me into the world of Offred and the other characters. There were a lot of unanswered questions, but that is part of what made the book so good! I read Orwell's 1984 and there were definate parallelisms, but the situations were so different that it was hard to compare the two. As soon as you read this book, it will be one of the top books in your collection.. it's defiantely one of my top five!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Handmaid's Tale was slow starting, but don't give up too soon! Give it a chance and it will go on your to ten list for sure. Margaret Atwood is a genius in feminine writing! To make such a statement in story form is amazing. The end was both maddening and wonderful. She mocks her reader continually while drawing you in at the same time. She knows what you expect of the book, acknowleges that, and goes the opposite way, almost to spite you. It's a wonderful story of hope and desperation, love and disgust, freedom and captivity!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"For the first 80 pages or so I was confused as to what the plot of this book was. After that I understood it. I couln't figure out what the plot was supposed to be. After I understood what it was about I found that I didn't want to put the book down. Without a government or anyway to get to your money, I don't think it would be that hard to accomplish something this nuts. It kinda makes me reconsider my money in the bank and my future."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is a very eye opening book. It makes you think about how despensible your own rights can be. I think that it was very interesting how Margaret Atwood had taken the events that were in her book from things that have actually happened in the past. It was weird to hear that these sorts of things could be heppening in the world. I mean, could you imagine going to work one day and being fired because it was the law? I would be crushed. My job is my freedom. Without it I would be totally dependent on my parents, being as I am a 17 year old high school student. Margaret Atwood takes a book about a women sitting in her room and being locked up in a small area and turns it into a very compeling and interesting book. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone that believed in their own rights along with the rights of every human being."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"All this books 'flaws' (non linear, lack of information) only make it more realistic and scarier. Even scarier is that this world could become real. Thankfully, we are not facing a declining population, but just the opposite, which could be an equal hazard. If such a wotld became real today, it would center on children rather than women, as today much political talk is of &quot;protecting the children.&quot; This book could save America by warning us of what could happen if rights are not protected and people do no take interest in the government.The book is well written and has as much literary value as historical value."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book was awesome. I think it would be good for anyone, especially those people who don't like the way our society is headed right now. I felt it was very realistic in how it portrayed the future; even a little scary maybe. The way Atwood wrote her review added to the mood of the book as well, because it was so simple, yet devoted to the senses. It was the kind of book that I could not put down, and always wanted to read more of to find out what was going to happen. This book was even better after we did some research on it for my English class, because there were many small details that related to current issues. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, because I know I really liked it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It's always difficult to review \\"a classic.\\" Let's start with the positive. I liked this one a LOT better than Cat's Eye. The Handmaid's Tale falls into the same genre as Orwell's 1984. It paints a picture of a horrifying \\"near future\\" in which a totalitarian society has been established... this time run by an extreme religious sect which places no value on women. It is told from the point of view of a handmaid named Offred (a name that literally indicates that she is the current property of a man named Fred). She is a part of a transitional generation of women - women who remember. They remember living in a normal, free society. They remember what it was to have jobs and money and families of their own. Now, in the Republic of Gilead, women like Offred are literally government-issued property... issued to childless couples for the sole purpose of procreation.Are you depressed yet? Outraged? Horrified? Me too. It's a thoroughly original but majorly depressing book. I can't fault it for being depressing because it never pretended to be anything but. The theme of oppression with an underlying, tenuous thread of hope is all-pervasive. The real heartbreak in the book emanates from Offred's memories of her former life... college days with her friend, her love affair with her husband, the way she loved her daughter, who was literally snatched away from her and given to a Gilead family of rank. Offred's memories are where the real story lies. They are vivid and painful and beautiful.The characters are difficult to rate. Everyone in this book is unhappy. They all fall into one of two categories... the miserable oppressor or the miserable oppressed. Offred is sympathetic for her memories. The rest are sort of flat. But then, they have to be flat in order to pull off the whole miserable theme. You follow? Same with the setting. It's bland and nondescript. It also has to be. So... is the lack of characterization and setting detail a flaw or pure genius? I lean toward pure genius.Unfortunately, there is one thing that The Handmaid's Tale has very much in common with Cat's Eye and that is Atwood's ponderous writing style. Do you typically need a writer to spend one and a half pages telling you that night has fallen? If you do, then you're in luck. Because that's how long it takes Ms. Atwood... complete with a lengthy musing about why we say \\"night has fallen\\" rather than \\"night has risen.\\" Yawn. For all those elements of genius, there were points in this book where I just had to either skim or put it down and not return. At times, the narrative got so bogged down in tedium that I hated it... not for the story but for the departures from it that bored me to tears.I haven't even touched upon all of the political commentary in this book. And I won't, because literary merits are what I choose to judge my books on. One thing that can be said for The Handmaid's Tale is that it is certainly capable of inspiring discussion and debate for any number of reasons. At the end of the day, I still don't know whether or not I am a fan of Margaret Atwood's work. But my opinion has definitely improved.The Bottom Line: A classic cautionary tale that has undoubtedly earned its place in classrooms nationwide. Still, it's a tough read... on many levels.This review originally appeared on my blog. See my profile for details. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"If you haven't read an Atwood book, I suggest you pick one up ASAP. Her books are amazingly well written. She tells the story in a way that keeps you wondering throughout and wanting to get to the end so you know everything. She tells you a little bit at a time, with only some of the details in the beginning so you have to wonder what happened in the world she's created.In this story, men have taken over the United States and taken away all women's rights. They've also invoked the law of Rachel and Leah, which comes from the Bible, in which Rachel could not have children so she asked her husband to sleep with the handmaid so they could have a child of their own. The men in the book warp this bible reference to mean that it is women who are barren, not men who are sterile. If their wife cannot have children, not tests are done, it is assumed that the woman is the problem and the couple is given a handmaid for two years. If the handmaid does not become pregnant after being stationed with three different couples she is killed.The book shows what it would be like if women's rights were taken away. It shows how people can be forced to believe in anything if there is enough fear. And it shows that there will always be a small few who are willing to risk their lives to change the status quo. It's an interesting tale and I especially loved the historical afterword."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood uses a very differen't writing style than any other author I've read before. She refrains from using quotations in her dialouges, which helps set the tone of the book that you're in a new age. I think it's a very creative way to show how the direction of feminism might move, and in a very dark and mysterious way. I thought it was interesting that the womans names always started with, 'of' because they belonged to a man, 'offred'. Margaret's book has many unique symbolisms, just as the woman have to wear certain colors, like red, it connects to communism. She uses very descreptive words to portray how men are hanged for looking at a woman. I hope that there will never be a time when woman never lose the power that her characters had to face, where they aren't allowed to look up at the sky, or smile to a person on the street. I hope that there will never be a day where a womans only pride comes from being told she is only worth something if she can concieve. In all it's an easy read, and very flowing, and I would suggest it to anyone."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale was one of the scariest books that I have ever read in my life.Why, you may ask? It isn't a horror story. Far from it, in fact. And it isn't a story on the terrible atrocities of women that our society has faced in the past.This is a potential future that the world may have to face... a world that takes the Bible and absolutely runs with it... though not in the direction that I think it was meant to be run with.It is the story of a woman who is a Handmaid in a house. She has had everything taken away from her: her daughter, her mother, her boyfriend, her best friend, and, most importantly, her identity. She doesn't even have her own name anymore.She is given to a man that she doesn't love, in the hope that she will have a child that she won't be allowed to keep. If she doesn't have a baby after three different households, then she is to be sent to the Colonies, where women are put to work cleaning up nuclear waste from a current war and usually don't last for more than three years.This is exciting, unpredictable, and frightening. I was scared out of my mind and kept having to put it down to say 'Whoa.'"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I see many reviewers of this book claim that Atwood's Gilead world is unlikely and not believable. This may be true for some, but I was completely absorbed into the world Atwood created. Her attention to detail made it real for me. Offred's struggle with the choice of resigned complacency or clandestine rebellion make the reader question what one's own reaction would be in such a situation. The epilogue, designed as a paper presented at a conference on Gilead by scholars after Offred's time, wraps everything up in the sense that it answers the reader's questions without revealing everything and leaving possibilities open for the reader to ponder. Atwood, too, was smart to incorporate all members of society into her new world; no one was left out, though the reader is only offered glimpses into what actually happens to other, &quot;less desirable&quot; people.I loved Offred - she was strong without being unbelievable, smart but not infallable, and courageous but still hesitant. This book was a highly developed political fantasy that still afforded strong character development. I don't think Atwood was trying to make any &quot;leftist&quot; statement, as some reviewers claim; I think she took some elements we see every day around us and stretched them to the extreme to create an intriguing tale that makes us ask, &quot;What if?&quot;"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Eerie to have so many facets of modern life in this book. ATM/Check cards, terrorist attacks, righ wing-ed christian agendas, feminist backlashes of the worst kind, and the controversy over the burqa. Amazing. Atwood writes golden poetry even in her prose. Stark and bleak with the reality that sexism and misogyny will prevail in all forms of partriarchy, no duh, huh? But Atwood delivers a fluid, harrowing tale of the less than ideal future with women protected as Marthas, Econowives, Handmaids, and wives. Of course, there's the Unwomen and the women used as underground sex slaves by the highly righteous and pure men of cloth in Gilead. Accurate futurism. Read this and draw lines from the novel to the present. Highly recommend. The movie does no justice."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I cannot describe the effect this book had on my life. Due to wonderful writing skills, this book operates on several levels. You can just read the book as a story and you will like it or not, depending on your political persuasion. Or, you can open yourself up to another dimension of reality that coexists with our social reality: the dimension that follows one of the timelines that could become a reality figuratively, if not literally. The power of this novel to open the readers' eyes to the consequences of political and social decisions and trends is totally awesome. A masterpiece that I will read every couple of years for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The place is Gilead. Religious fundamentalists are now in charge, but no fundamentalists like I've grown up knowing. Gone are the freedoms that women take for granted; their way of dress, owning a checking account and property, having a say over how their body is treated. Instead they are now placed into roles, the wives, the Marthas, the Handmaids.This story revolves around Rachel, Jacob and Bilhah from Genesis. The use of Bilhah by Rachel and Jacob to give them children. But instead of being in ancient times it is now the future.So many reviewers have pointed out that this is very similar to the treatment of women in other countries. It's a true observation and this book does a chilling job of putting the reader in one of those womens shoes.As I read I could hear the voice of Offred in my mind. I could hear resignation, sorrow and a lack of hope. I could hear disbelief as she spoke of memories that were so distant from what she is living now that they seem unreal. I could hear frustration as she struggled to understand why rules and traditions were being changed.I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book. I thought it might be too graphic, that I wouldn't be able to handle it. Atwood deals with the subject, as I'm learning she always does, with a respectful hand, laying the facts out without making them personal. It's that sense of detachment that struck home for me the most. I felt angry and scared while reading, my emotions making up for the seeming lack of emotion shown by Offred.This is my second Margaret Atwood book. I'm hooked. Both this and The Robber's Bride have shown incredible character development and eye-opening scenarios to me.What a disturbing, fascinating book this is."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is another of those books that I read because a friend told me to. I didn't really look at the description, just opened it and started reading. Needless to say, I spent the first quarter of it a little confused. The writing is absolutely amazing, but the plot is a little all over the place. It doesn't seem to flow. We find out at the end why. Part of me wants to re-read it because knowing what I know about it may change my perception.Having said that, it was slightly disturbing and given what goes on in parts of the Middle East these days, a little close. I'm not sure I'd say I enjoyed reading it. It kept my interest, but I found myself dragging through parts of it waiting. The ending wasn't wrapped up nicely which makes me a little nuts. I need to know what happened, I suppose.Worth a read to say you read it, but not a beach read, a little on the heavy side."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was familiar with the background and storyline of this novel, having seen the outstanding 1990 motion picture of the same name, starring Faye Dunaway, Natasha Richardson and Robert Duvall.As has been pointed out, the novel is set in a near future dystopian theocracy, in which most adults are sterile. A select class of fertile women is designated to carry the children of their upper class employers, such practice having its origin in the Old Testament story of Abraham, his childless wife Sarah and the handmaid Hagar.The handmaid in this story, Offred (Of Fred), is assigned to carry the child of the politically important \\"Commander\\". The story, told from the perspective of Offred, details her life in the household of the Commander, his hostile wife and several other household servants. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of her life before the creation of the theocracy (Gilead) and how the American Republic is subsequently overthrown and females relegated to a life of servitude and bondage.While this has been labeled a feminist tract, it goes well beyond such a narrow interpretation, touching upon religion and hypocrisy as well as sexual and racial oppression. The most striking emotion garnered from reading the novel is the abject hopelessness of Offred and many of her compatriots. Written immediately following establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and before the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the novel is eerily prescient in its resemblance to treatment of women in those regimes."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I originally read this book when it first came out and enjoyed it then. I found it SHOCKING! Now in my forties, and having recently read Brave New World and having become a big dystopian fan, I decided to revisit it. I can't say enough good things about it. As a young woman, I really missed how pro-feminist and anti-religious right it was. Atwood is a genious at making a book that appears to be pro-life to an extreme and anti-woman's rights, actually be about how society needs diversity of opinion and choices in order to flourish.The story is a historical document discovered after a future society fails. The failed society is one in which America's birth rate dropped so low, that extreme measures were put in place to protect the future generations. Fertile women were to be used only as babymakers and non-productive (producing healthy babies, that is) women had a dim, if any future. Sex is only for procreation and all ofsociety is very regulated for both men and women in a very Orwellian way.Told from the point of view of one woman who remembers the typical American life she had, she fills us in on the changes that brought her to her role as a baby making machine. We feel her sense of loss and desperation and refusal to give up on a rescue."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is a fascinating plot, and it is well enough developed that the reader doesn't fix on its plausibility. The writing pulls you in. In the pen of a lesser writer this would be the plot of a B movie. Atwood manages an excellent pacing of action, flashbacks and the unfolding thoughts of the handmaiden.It took a while for me to get my bearings in time because its content seems like a future but it is written in the past tense. I once I figured out that it was a not too distant past, I had a easier time of it.A lot of moral issues are presented here, the most striking of which was the appalling morals of the moralists.Atwood covers very difficult material and created what may prove to be a classic."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This story is extraordinary...chilling, but extraordinary. As with all of her books, Atwood as a canny ability to insert the very basics of human nature into the most outrageous and horrifying of environments, which is essentially what makes this book believable. I challenge any reader to keep the chills at bay when they come to the part of the story where it is explained how the United States is overtaken by a group of religious fanatics and the world as we know it is mutated to a dystopian hell."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was surprised at how this book drew me in. The story is really captivating and Atwood sprinkles it with just a little mystery. I wanted to keep reading to find out more about the main character.The ending was perfect in my opinion. I loved the sort of epilogue that she included. I feel like we will never know what happened to Offred for sure, but she leaves us with enough information to draw a conclusion. However, I do wish we found out what happened to her daughter and husband. In particular, as a mother, the flashbacks of her daughter were very difficult to read.I would love to see a prequel to this book. One of the questions I had was - how did things end up this way?? What lead to the state of the country? There is some history peppered throughout the story, but I did not get enough to form a picture. It is possible that I was so interested in other aspects of the story that I missed this information."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I picked this book up unexpectedly while passing it by in the bookstore. I wasn't even planning on buying it but I have seen it so many times and I have always been intrigued by the premise.I can't say I liked this book because I feel like I would be saying I liked what happens in it. But I will say this is a very important novel about important issues surrounding women. I was uncomfortable reading through it yet I had to keep on. I knew I was reading something that matters.This is also my first Atwood book. I have to say she deserves all the acclaim she gets; this novel is written in first person narrative in a stream of conscious kind of way. It is very effective for the story because of the intensity of the plot. I think it really highlighted the anxiousness I felt while reading it.I really loved the ending and its ambiguity. I loved the historical notes at the end. I think this was so well thought out and it would have to be in order for people to buy into what happens. And I did. Even days after reading it I still think about it which makes this book an A for me.

Offred herself is nearing the age when she will no longer be able to reproduce. If she is unable to get pregnant she will be declared Unwoman and will be sent to \\"the Colonies\\" or perhaps worse. Atwood shows great authorial discipline in the way she allows the story to unfold, never telling us any more that the main character would know. Is this person setting her up? Can they be trusted? What happens in the Colonies? What has happened to her family? In this way the reader experiences a bit of the fear, confusion and isolation that the main character feels.This book was written 25 years ago and seems even more relevant today than it was then. I couldn't help but think of women under the rule of the Taliban as I read this book. Many reviewers seem to be asking \\"could this really happen?\\" I read in an interview with Atwood that she got her ideas for this book from newspaper clippings and she claims \\"there isn't anything in the book not based on something that has already happened in history or in another country, or for which actual supporting documentation is not already available.\\" Scary stuff."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was disappointed with the style of Atwood's writing.

It could have easily been the first in a series."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"If you love dystopia stories, I highly recommend this book. This is a beautifully written story that is as horrifying as it is intriguing. For it to be written in a somewhat narrow first person POV, there are so many insightful characters and vivid descriptions. It has an open ending though (it'll drive you crazy if you don't like loose ends!). I had so many questions after I finished reading it. Thanks to the Historical Notes, you're able to get a clearer picture of the things outside of the narrator's point of view so it's a complete reading experience. I took another day just to analyze it all and then read the Spark Notes analysis just in case I missed something. There's a ton of great talking points here and many ways you could interpret what *really* might have happened to our main cast of characters.My greatest fear before reading this book was that it would bash Christianity and religion. I am a Christian but I'm not a social conservative, so I left it on the shelf for several months despite the fact that I adore dystopian novels! I love its counterparts (Brave New World and 1984), too. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Offred, our central character who is more passive narrator than swashbuckling heroine like her best-friend Moira, prays to God at one point in the book and makes it clear to the reader -- she knows this kind of oppression, sexism, racism, hypocrisy and stripping of human rights is not His doing. I was shocked to read that the Gileadans are so extreme that they were even against other Christians of different denominations like Baptists. This is an amazing book, but it's not without some really scary parts (SPOILER: The scariest of all being how they brought down the US democracy and originally blamed it on Islamic groups. It sounded so realistic, especially with today's Islamophobia). It makes you wonder what you'd do if America suddenly became Gilead and you were forced to live like Nick or Offred. Or in my case, if I were a Child of Ham smh."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A gripping, haunting book by a powerful writer"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This novel required very little suspension of disbelief.

What gave me bad dreams the night Iread this book was the ease with which the whole transformationhappened, and how much more plausible it was than the asked-forfascism of &quot;It Can't Happen Here&quot;.I came to this book as a fan of dystopias.

A fantasy (?) tale of a religiously divided society whose women are categorized into very few roles; told from the perspective of one woman whose role is childbearer.

The narrator, a handmaid in the Republic of Gilead (formerly the United States) describes her experiences after the overthrow of the US government. The book really makes you think about how life would be like in America if everyone was assigned a certain role in society with strict rules to obey. A scary novel, especially for a woman who tries to imagine what it would be like to be a handmaid and be forced to give birth to children for women uncapable of bearing them. I definitely would recommend it"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book contains every typical, boring, stereotypical jab from an author who obviously doesn't understand the passages from the Bible that she uses to build the whole foundation of her book. Ironically, the passages from the Bible she chooses to depict man's oppression sanctified by God were thought up, instigated and executed by the WOMEN in the passages, not the men. Note to author, please do more research on the main platitude of your book, so it can have validation. She obviously has an ax to grind with Judeo-Christian principles and uses this book as a platform to distort, cast aspersions, and instill fear regarding these belief systems.Regarding the story- extremely depressing, no hope, no good verses evil, just twisted grossness and blah. Her main character is weak, conviction less and incapable of making any exciting moves in this story. After I was done reading this book, I could find no takeaways, except there are no ends to the misunderstanding of Christianity and no shame in extorting it to promote women's rights and freedoms and the author's weird understanding of what that means. I read this book because so many other people have and wanted to know what all the hype was, instead I'm mad I wasted my time and money."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Seems like I've always had a fascination with stories about dystopian futures. I've read 1984, Brave New World, Logan's Run and Fahrenheit 451. Children of Men was intriguing. I even liked the movie version of Aeon Flux (it wasn't great but the concept was interesting). So when I recently heard about The Hand Maid's Tale, I decided to check it out from the local library as an e-book.Keep in mind, this is the first book by Margaret Atwood that I've read. Perhaps the other books she has written are better. But I was decidedly unimpressed. The world she's conceptualized doesn't seem particularly real to me. It comes across as a poorly realized anti-religous rant. And it was clear she's not American and has little real experience or understanding of American culture or behavior (I checked after I finished the book; she's Canadian). Americans meekly accepting domination by a single religion, setting women's rights back a hundred years or more? Granted this book was written in the 1980's but still, having been through Vietnam, etc... who would really believe that Americans en masse would accept a religious fringe organization coup d'etat? If you're going to suggest such a future, at least come up with a plausible explanation for why people would go along. If there is one thing the Tea Party and OWS have in common, it's that Americans are rarely accepting of anything that is that contrary to their beliefs.It wasn't all bad. Some of it is intriguing. I kept reading to find out just how the protagonist ended up where she was and what had happened to her friend. Which is why I gave it 3 stars. But the protagonist seemed entirely too passive; virtually everything that happens to her in the story is the result of other people's actions. She seems incapable of action, right up the end. And the author seemed to pull her punches at the end. I won't spoil it, but if you read this book and think the ending fits, I would vigorously disagree."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale helped cure my Hunger Games hangover. Please note, this book is nothing like The Hunger Games, however, it takes place in a post apocalyptic era, similar to The Hunger Games. To be honest, this book creeped me out a little bit because of all of the current legislation that is going on in the US right now. Atwood's characters come to life and are written in a way for the average reader to relate to. I found myself empathizing with the main character. I really felt like I was in her shoes, so I spent most of the read angry because of this. I can't imagine living in a world like she had to, and am thankful things are not to that point here in the US. The only part I didn't like about the novel is the end. I wanted to know what happened to the handmaid, but that's all part of being a good writer- leaving the reader wanting more."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I tried to post a review on my account, but it wasn't over 48 hrs old, so I couldn't post this review. I'm using a family member's account with their permission to post this. -ElizabethAlthough Margaret Atwood tries to create a dystopian novel with a feminist focus, I feel this could not be achieved completely. The lack of information about the events that caused the Republic of Gilead to exist as presented caused me to become confused and lose focus on this. The readers learn that the government is very controlling, that the Constitution was repealed, and individual rights were diminished. However, the readers do not know how this came about.Already in the dark about the previous events that lead the society to this current condition, the readers do not learn hardly anything about the characters' past lives. This ambiguity here causes more uncertainty, which leaves the readers questioning. I did not like the fact that I was left to either figure out or conjure up something about these characters and their previous lifestyles.The Handmaid's Tale also, in my opinion, was extremely dull. I hardly ever felt engaged while reading this text. Perhaps the only time I was interested was when Offred encountered Moira at the club, and then Offred tells the readers about how Moira escaped, but was then in a sense, recaptured. Offred occasionally accounts events that are exciting and surprising, such as going to the \\"club\\" with the Commander, playing Scrabble with the Commander or visiting Nick at night. The stories about Offred's husband, Luke, and her daughter were interesting too. Generally, however, Offred's daily stories are ones of monotony. This sameness caused me to lose interest in the plot.I also felt that this novel should have been told from multiple perspectives. Since Offred was the only narrator, I could not always rely on what she said. I feel the novel would have been easier to understand and more enjoyable if a man's perspective could have been shared as well. This might dilute the intended feminism, however such a limited perspective aggravated me because I feel like a story should be attacked from all angles. Perhaps a chapter told by the Commander or Nick would reveal their true feelings about the societal condition.I became aggravated when Offred continued to refuse to tell the readers her true name. Why is she hiding her identity? If she is the heroine many critics claim her to be, why is she acting like this? She tells Nick her real name and even tells the readers that she tells Nick this, but she does not reveal her name to us. What is the big issue? Moira never took a \\"new name,\\" and never let herself be inferior to the women and men around her.A lot of critics seem to think that Offred is the heroine in this novel, but she does not do much to be considered a heroine. Moira acts as a heroine, as she does not let herself become subservient to the \\"authorities\\" around her and she is willing to take gigantic risks, such as her own death, to only possibly return to a similar life she once lived. Moira represents the typical heroine and actually provides us readers with excitement and hope. Offred, although she says she does not want to live in the current society does not seem to take action like Moira. What good is it if she doesn't do something about her situation? Her life will not improve and she will definitely never have such freedoms again.While I was reading this novel, I never felt the urge to read \\"just one more page.\\" It did not leave me hanging on the edge of my seat and it did not contain any suspense. Each page seemed to consist of monotony and this caused me to become bored quite quickly. If you like to read feminist novels about oppression and the coping mechanisms of a young woman experiencing this, The Handmaid's Tale (won't let me underline the title) is the novel for you. If you are like me and enjoy reading novels with twists and turns, I would not recommend for you to read this novel as it would only result in disappointment."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I'm fascinated by the reviews that indicate this book is now assigned in English Lit classes. That alone is testament for reading this book. I read it for the first time nearly twenty years ago. As an avid reader, and a re-reader - it stills stands out for it's unique concept and characters - regardless of your political beliefs (and given when it was written - I'd encourage even younger readers to be a bit less skeptical about it's political agenda).Well-executed \\"what if\\" concepts with characters you care about can be hard to come by.This is a book that intrigued me from beginning to end--- twice. Having seen the movie (a huge dissappointment - that reflects 1/1000th of the book) and read other Atwood books (thinking - way back when - that I'd discovered a great new writer) I unequivocably recommend this book - and urge you to avoid the movie and not have such great expectations for her other works.If you find you like delving into a unique, character driven \\"what if\\" scenario (though these will probably not get recommended for English Lit class) ---- I also recommendThrough Violet Eyes,The Time Traveler's Wife] and [[ASIN:0316068047 The Host: A Novel."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I started reading this because it was on the required reading list for my IB english class.

I was giddy with excitement, telling everyone I could \\"This is a really good book!!\\". I just thought I'd say it again. It is just one of the best books I have read to date. And that's saying a lot."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale proves to be one of the more controversial books in time. Margaret Atwood's dystopia provokes disruption and torment in a totalitarian society. A society where women are treated like animals; only useful for their fertile bodies, men are subdued as the reigning force of society; shovanistic pigs that use their power for the forces of evil, and a society where normal life for all ceases to exist. Life is cheerless; there is no privacy and no room for the once pluralistic society that America had. With Atwood's addition of a suspenseful, mind-boggling plot, developing themes, and interesting setting, she creates a terrifying novel based on actual events and leaves the reader dwelling on what the future really does behold for the world.The setting of this book is very interesting because it correlates with the issues portrayed. The Handmaid's Tale is set in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Atwood does not come straight out and say this is the setting, but she puts forth clues in the novel to come this conclusion. For example, she mentions Harvard Wall, which is a huge indicator of the location. Atwood chose this small town because this was the first settlement of the Puritans in the seventeenth-century. The Puritans had bizarre rituals and beliefs and much of their religious and traditional values, were the same as that in Atwood's novel. Atwood pieced this information along with clippings from historical sources to put together this satire of how life used to be and could possibly turn into again.The Republic of Gilead: a place where common people are not allowed, and traditional values and Puritanical beliefs are set in stone. It's a place where men are the dominant figures of society and the women are their property. The population of this small town is dwindling for most women are becoming infertile or having their tubes tied to avoid being forced to have sex. Offred is the narrator of the story. She is a handmaid, placed in a house with the Commander and his Wife. There, her main duty is to become impregnated for the elite couple, for the Wife cannot bear children. While Offred is a part of this crazed household, she becomes close to the Commander. He invites her to play Scrabble and allows her to look at old Vogue magazines, never pressuring her for sex; treating her normal and getting to know her interests without sex. Although this is a change, she must keep it secret for if the Wife, Serena, finds out, Offred can be shipped away and never be seen or heard of again. Offred and the Commander never have sex privately, but they do perform it with the wife, as a ritual. Each sexual act portrayed has no emotion or feeling and is extremely impersonal. There first is a Ceremony to pray for a child and then Offred lies between the Wife and the Commander. While the act is being performed, the Wife pretends it is her who is the fertile one. After the act is done, a Ceremony proceeds to pray for a child. Outside the household, is an even less appealing atmosphere. There are weekly hangings and the government or the \\"Eyes\\", allows no privacy for any individual. Everything is monitored and watched closely, and if one breaks a rule, they vanish. People live in fear, women mostly, and from Offred's point of view, no one is doing anything about it.The sex roles in this novel play in as an important theme. Women have no role in this society. They are not allowed to read, write, gain knowledge, share an opinion, hold a job, own property, or live separately. Their entire lives are planned out for them; they are nothing but a service to men. The men on the other hand created this world. The Commander says, \\"The problem wasn't only with the women, he says. The main problem was with the men. There was nothing for them anymore . . . I'm not talking about sex, he says. That was part of it, the sex was too easy . . . You know what they were complaining about the most? Inability to feel. Men were turning off on sex, even. They were turning off on marriage. Do they feel now? I say. Yes, he says, looking at me. They do\\" (p 210). Now they have a society where women wait on them hand and foot. Another theme present is the way government handles itself. They provide no privacy for the women; most men seem to never have to worry about being caught or harassed. They call themselves the \\"Eyes\\", and they are always watching. Atwood adds this in because with new technological advances, the government could very well keep surveillance of every citizen, without that person even knowing. Nowadays, anyone can find out personal information about someone else; the world is turning into the \\"Eyes\\" where room for solitude and peace will no longer exist.I recommend this novel to anyone for it makes you think about \\"what if\\"; what if the world could turn into this crazed society. This book opens up a lot of controversial issues-feminism, political activities, religion, etc. It is a great book for discussion and allows many opinions to flow."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Do NOT read this book on a cold, grey day. Read it when all is right with the world, and you just feel the need for some sober enlightenment. It'll shock, depress, and scare the life out of you.This tells the story of Offred ('of fred') who works as a 'handmaid' for a wealthy family. This is a time when most women are barren, and the few who might possibly reproduce are forced to be handmaids, women who bear children for powerful families. Offred calmly, almost coldly narrates the horrifying tale of a society that has stripped her of her family, her freedom, and her position as a citizen. She's literally a walking pair of ovaries. We watch Offred do her 'work', dream of the past, and possibly become involved in an underground freedom movement called Mayday, people who will either free her or destroy her.What's really frightening here is that this situation is almost happening now. While it's set in the near future, Atwood brilliantly shows us a moment where Japanese tourists, outfitted in modern, stylish clothing, gawk at the peculiar habits of the veiled American women. Switch a few things around here, and we've got a scene that could've taken place on any street in a Middle Eastern country. Women who exist basically to procreate running around behind heavy veils, being stared at by American tourists. It's something that has happened many times before. Things may be changing now, but there was a time when Atwood's description of the situation was almost flawless. We live in this world. Atwood just changed names and dates.As I said before, don't read this if you're depressed in the slightest. You won't want to get out of bed for a week. The world created here will frighten you, and when you realize that the goings on are practically a reality for many people, it will upset you even more."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"...I love this book for its short length, I truly enjoyed the story and in depth futuristic details.

I say this because the content is quite mature at times. At first I really was grossed out with many of the sexual details and I can see why many would be uttlerly disgusted. But thats the true beauty of the book, it is completly realistic. It is written in the point of view of a Handmaid and none of the sexual nature was at all gross to them, it was just a day in and day out reality. It is truly a wonderful book once you look past the raunchy sexual innuendos and content. I recommend this to anyone with a open mind and love of great literature.

I do not read feminist literature but this book appealed to me both as an intelligent person and, moreover, as a young woman.It is an extremely clever book with many thought provoking ideas. What people tend to gloss over, however, is that this book also contains a marvellous story.

And well you should, when we've seen what the Taliban and Islamic fundamentalists have done to women and gays all over the world. Had your story been more mythical, as opposed to a poorly veiled attack on Christian fundamentalists (and I am not one so I have no particular dog in this fight) it could have been intriguing.

Some of the parallels between Atwood's fictional work and contemporary Christian Nationalist right-wing ideology taking root are too close for comfort."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The author presented an interesting tale.

When I first read it, some 10 years ago, I was stunned by not only the story but by the voice of the narrator. Now that I've just re-read it, I found the story more terrifying and harrowing. I imagine that it's twice as frightening for a woman. But as it seems to me that some of our Constitutional rights are quickly being challenged (whether justified or not) there is a new, palpable fear that resonates in the pages of THE HANDMAID'S TALE that wasn't there in the early 90's.I'll get off my soapbox now.THE HANDMAID'S TALE is a gripping and compelling novel of a nation out of control, and of male-dominance. While it is set in the not-too-distant-future, the feel is reminiscent of Nazi workcamps, as the female characters are subject to brainwashing, imprisonment, and sexual predation. No one I know who has read the book, even those of my friends on the far right, felt this to be heavy-handed or didactic. And no one I know who has read the book, put it down without reflecting deeply on our sexual/social relations. THE HANDMAID'S TALE is an impossibly brilliant book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The writing in this book is superb- but that's typical Atwood, no amount of superlatives could describe her lyrical prose. The plot, however, is what really dug into my soul and made a home for itself in my subconcious.At first glance it seems like an improbable fantasy story. In fact, I found it lodged in the trashy horror section of my local library. The United States has been transformed to a theocracy governed by a strict interpretation of the Bible. Women particularly have very limited roles in this society: wives, maids, 'Aunts', prostitutes, or handmaids (surrogate mothers). Life in the new nation is oppressive and terrifying, with all dissenters suffering terrible deaths and torture.The true horror, however, is how true this novel is. While the US is unlikely to succumb to this fate, governments like this do exist, Afghanistan being a prominent example. I personally know people like the religious fanatics in the novel, and they don't act fanatical- they are normal people in positions of power. After putting down this novel, I felt a fear deep in my gut- I realized how vulnerable our rights really are.Many people told me they didn't like the epilogue, but it was the epilogue that put it all in perspective, that allowed me to see how realistic the book truly was. Read this book. You'll appreciate the wake up call."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Unlike what most of the postings suggest, the novel is NOT anti-Christian. Offred prays to God more than once, Ofglen tells Offred she believes in God, and various sects(Baptists, Jesuits, Catholics, Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses and Quakers are those mentioned) of Christian religions are just as persecuted if not moreso than the women are. It's barely even what I'd call a feminist novel, the book doesn't seem nearly as propagandizing as I'd first assumed it would be.In addition, it is not Atwood's best work. It's wonderful, a compelling read, and Atwood breaks many literary rules, with almost always a positive effect. In any other author's repertoire, this would certainly stand out. But compare her prose here to, say, the Blind Assassin or Robber Bride. It's blown out of the water. It's almost juvenile in comparison.Atwood excels, however, in her treatment of the genre. The heroes and heroines of most post-1984 novels are revolutionaries, maverick thinkers, non-conformists. Also, their universes seem to be crafted by the author to fit exactly their strengths and weaknesses; don't we all wish such traumas were custom-made? Instead, Atwood focuses on Offred, who remembers the days when times were better but doesn't exactly care to attack the problem on her own. She vows to herself to accept her new life and try to move on, as long as she can stay alive. Not until she is approached by several underground workers does she decide to act on what every other handmaid is feeling. And she does nothing to really bring about the downfall of Gilead, she's just another handmaid who happens to get lucky and escape the system. She fails at her 'mission', she abandons hope, and never quite recovers it. She ready and willing to die when chance brings about her redemption. Offred is a true, real character, one of the best of the genre.Also, Atwood's portrayal of the Republic of Gilead is small-scale, and never reveals the nature of the system or its creation, making it seem more realistic. The characters never break into long monologues about Gilead's history; they all know it, and only reveal information in small references. Even in the slightly redundant historical notes no explicit knowledge is given. They're university students, they've all learned this before.A Handmaid's Tale is a very engaging and easy read, yet it can also be very profound, and it ends in about the right place. Just as it is about to get redundant and melodramatic, it is able to end realistically, and only barely seems to end too fast.So pick up A Handmaid's Tale if you're looking for an above average spin on most Utopian novels, but don't expect this to be an example of Atwood's later work. You'll be much more entertained with the aforementioned Blind Assassin and Robber Bride, or Cat's Eye or Alias Grace."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I literally finished this book minutes ago, and I must say that I enjoyed it. This is the second book of Atwood's that I have read (Cat's Eye being the first) and I believe that The Handmaid's Tale is the better of the two. On the cover of my edition, the book was compared to Orwell's brilliant 1984, and I suppose that it could be considered its counterpart. However, where Orwell was attempting to make a devastatingly profound point about government and its influence, Atwood's work takes on the nature of human instincts. Both books have immense resonance for the reader, and Atwood paints an excellent picture of a pseudo-religious, paramilitary junta government and its social restraints. The ending is very well done and leaves the book rather open-ended, something I usually decry, but it works well in this literary masterpiece. The ending itself will remain a mystery to even the most analytical reader. The appendix at the back of the book is quite, if casually, infomative, though there should have been more than one to fully explain the nature and conjuration of the Gilead government. A book definately worth the reader's time and a fine, fast, fantastic read. Check it out, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"If you're wondering whether this book is worth your valuable reading time, my short answer is yes. That said, I kind of wish I had been able to borrow it from a library or friend instead of purchasing it, as I'm not sure there's a lot of re-read value here.Atwood has created a fascinating society with very real roots in our present-day world that make it both scary and relevant. Worldbuilding is done little by little and through the eyes of our narrator, in a way that I personally found very interesting and never tiresome. Huge amounts of time aren't spent on characterization, especially when it comes to minor characters (and everyone but our narrator is essentially a minor player, this is HER story and the story of the world in which she lives...not so much for any other individual), but I personally felt them to be realistically round characters all the same. We are left to fill in the blanks, to wonder at their motives, to wonder how happy or unhappy any of them really is in the world they either helped to create or were thrust into...but there is quite a lot to wonder about, and a lot is left up to interpretation.The author takes some risks with style. The storytelling is very stream-of-consciousness, going back and forth between past and present tense and sometimes failing even to mark dialogue with quotation marks or italics. This is obviously done purposefully, and sometimes to great effect, but I did find myself re-reading passages, not because I was overwhelmed by their brilliance or because I wanted to examine the different possible interpretations, but simply because I was confused as to who was saying what to whom and when. This is not an easy read, or a fun one. It is, as I've said, a WORTHWHILE read, but not one that I found myself flying through, simply because it took too much effort to process some of the flashbacks, especially.All in all, an enjoyable and relevant novel, but not necessarily one I'll be coming back to again and again."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood was recommended to me by a friend, and I was bowled over by the novel. I devoured it in a few days (a feat itself as I have a youngish family) and was left with that sad feeling, an almost a bereft feeling, I get when finishing a truly great novel.In this dystopian alternative present, Offred is a handmaid, assigned to a Commander and his \`infertile' wife. Her only reason to live, to be allowed to live, is for procreation. In the land of Gilead, once the United States, women have been suppressed almost entirely. Eyes watch for anyone behaving out of the allowed norms that have been established, and punishment is either execution, to later be hung on display on the wall surrounding the centre of Gilead, or to be sent to the poisoned and radioactive lands and for an untimely and painful death. For now, Offred is avoiding the latter fate, but only by performing a monthly ceremony, the culmination of which involves the Commander inseminating her.But her time is running short. If she does not fall pregnant soon, she will be sent to the poisoned lands in disgrace. When she continually fails to fall pregnant, Offred, aided by the Commander's wife, looks elsewhere for viable sperm.What stayed with me after finishing this novel, other than the desperate need to find out the rest of her tale, and my feeling of abandonment by the author in not finishing the handmaid's tale (she left me hungering for more, much more), was the method in which the book was ended. Without giving too much more away, I was offended by the documentary style finish. Not offended as in unhappy with the author, but offended by the last characters I met. How dare they refer to Offred so casually, laugh at her issues, make light of her life. She had become very real to me, and I wanted to stick up for her pain, her solitude, all she gave up to become a handmaid.What I came away with was a better sense of my own past, of the real people who have lived through adversity, a bigger respect for their struggles and their courage for these real people who made their real stories known. I still hunger to know what happened next, and probably will for some time yet. One thing I do know, I will be thinking about this novel for a long time."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read this book when I was 13. Picked it out of the library shelf among R.L. Stines and Christopher Pikes (Not sure what it was doing among those books!). I'm almost 18 now, and even though I haven't picked up that book since the first time I read it, it continues to conjure itself to the surface of my thoughts. At the time I read it, I knew it was a good book even though it grossed me out completely. But now I can look back at it and see its greater effect. It is very similiar to 1984: an individual has an illegal and dangerous love affair, the individual lives as an oppressed citizen in an oppressed world where rebels are killed sadistically, there are high power party officials that live in decadence, the individual displays subtle courage, the individual is arrested, there are hints of an underground movement, books and historical knowledge is limited, and an ambiguous ending. However, where 1984 seems to critisize politcal parties and question our perception of reality and truth, Handmaid's Tale seems more focused on feminism and questioning women's role in society. Some people critisize it for its abrupt ending, but I think its not quite as abrupt as some would think. In 1984, I thought the idea of hope was rather questionable. But in Handmaid's Tale, I am almost certain that the last pages of the book meant most certainlly that hope existed and that even if our heroine had perished in the hands of enemies (we can also argue that she didn't and was saved), that at least in the future, the oppressive society in which she died in will also fail to survive. So if you like books with good ending, you might try this one."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In the fictional Republic of Gilead, the dramatic decrease of birthrates makes the society's fundamental goal is to control reproduction. Written from Offrend's first person point of view, the novel adds to the reader's connection with a Handmaid, her tormented feelings, and hatred toward this new totalitarian regime. Gilead is based on the precept that giving birth is women's religious and moral duty and those who do not fulfill it will be sent to hell (aka the Colonies) where the \\"unwomen\\" are left to die. With its modern setting, and reference to our present, the novel makes the reader shift between two different worlds: the narrator's and ours. For example, Atwood references Harvard as a place where the disobedient are hung and ironically she always hears the echoes of the old world where museums, stores, and the military where all used for their supposed purposes.With Biblical allusions, and references to WWII, as in \\"mayday\\" and the totalitarian regimes of Stalin and Hitler, Atwood creates a masterful piece of a fictional world still connected to the reality.With its ambiguous ending, the novel lets the mind ponder on what can become of this now familiar narrator. Is death better for her? Or if rescued, will she return to her family? The fact that the ending is hopeful adds to the greatness of the book.Its only flaw, however, was its introduction of minor characters that we never get to learn about. Offred often mentions her daughter's name but she never talks about her. Otherwise, Atwood's use of syntax is a great indicator of the narrator is shifting tones- from hope to desperation, from fear to indifference, from love to passion. She constantly uses flashback about her family and her former life to demonstrate her criticism of Gilead where women are containers valued for only what is inside of them.In order to serve the needs of the new society's elite, Gilead creates a system of titles where women are defined solely by their gender roles as Wives, Handmaids, or Marthas. Stripping them of individual names strips them of their individuality. In a moment of desperation, Offred cries out in vain, \\"I want to be held and told my name. I want to be valued, in ways that I am not; I want to be more than valuable. I repeat my former name; remind myself of what I once could do, how others saw me. I want to steal something\\" (Atwood 97).Deprived from her basic rights, Offred frustration and anger is revealed by her use of simple sentences with anaphora to stress her futile but desperate longing for attention."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood's A Handmaid's Tale is a dark and gloomy portrayal of the United States in the not-so-distant future, when a totalitarian government takes over all aspects of life. Atwood covers controversial issues including feminism, abortion, violence against women, pornography, environmental issues, bisexuality, ethics of cloning, racism, anti-feminism, militant nationalism, and religious differences.The governmental structure of Gilead, including its state religion, is horrifyingly built around one goal: the control of reproduction. Controlling women's bodies can succeed only by controlling the women themselves, so Gilead's political order requires the subjugation of women. They strip women of the right to vote, the right to hold property or jobs, and the right to read. Women are a \\"national resource,\\" Gilead likes to say, but they really mean that women's ovaries and wombs are national resources. Women cease to be treated as individuals, with independent selves, rather, they are seen potential mothers, leasing them to high-class families.Biblical terminology is revealed when Gilead theocracy develops its own words to give the state control over the sentiments and ideas people can express. The vocabulary makes you think and relate religious features to characters and places in the novel. The people of Gilead must carry on conversations within the suffocating confines of officially sanctioned language. Saying the wrong thing can lead to a swift death, so people watch what they say, thereby subordinating their power of speech to the power of the state.The main character, Offred, is exposed to the consequences of the reversal of women's rights. She craves happiness and freedom from the lock down society she now has to bow down to. The consistency of her sadness is painful and the reader is reminded of her dreadful lifestyle when compared to her past memories of normalcy. To escape her struggles with the corrupt government, she attempts to run away but gets caught. Previous handmaids have committed suicide to end their misery or to avoid getting caught having an affair with another man.Its scary to even think of this could actually happen in America but we can relate some events that could lead to this state ruling. The extremes in the novel are a little hard to believe but it makes women now relieved and thankful that this is not how life is. The female is too strong willed and not a pushover; I do not see in the near future anything like this happening."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This futuristic dystopian tale stems directly from the imagination of Margaret Atwood, as it hits on absurdities which have not yet been witnessed in this world. It takes Rachel Carson's theories of the effects of mass pollution to a whole other level as women everywhere become sterile, all except a few who are turned into \\"handmaids.\\" Handmaids are fertile women who have been assigned to various high rank couples. The job of handmaids is one thing and one thing only: to get impregnated with the Commander's child, which she will have to give up later on. Consequently, women in general are stripped of their rights. This is especially evident when the first action the new oppressive government takes is to cancel the bank accounts of all women, rendering them as the property of men. In a world controlled by a few aristocratic men, the women are made to turn against each other to fight for their own survival. Wives willingly exercise their power over the handmaids and even Marthas have initiative over the handmaids. Or at least that is that the men intend. However, many females have formed secret relationships and connections, ones that help them to get through the ordeal mentally. Since their bodies are now considered objects of possession, their only escape is inward into their own minds, where they can concoct possibilities and keep their hopes alive. Essentially, those beaten to the point of submission are forced into a state of numbness, in which they learn to not feel and keep living through it.The story, told through the character of Offred, tends to be confusing at times as the plot is narrated in a jumbled and chaotic manner that mirrors the feelings of the narrator. Readers must be ready to actively read and connect certain details with others in order to reach a more unified plot. The underlying connections in the book can only be reached when one is willing to dive headfirst into the novel and sympathize with Offred. The fact that the made-up world is one in which none of us have encountered makes the story much more unpredictable and surprising. The beginning was almost unbearable for me as a struggled to understand what was going on. Despite the initial blandness, the book gradually warms up until it cuts off in an abrupt ending. Offred's simple language demonstrates a very personal and casual tone, which is reasonable enough since these are her thoughts that have been kept inside of her for so long. She longs for an outlet in which to exercise her power of expression. As one will soon realize, The Handmaid's Tale capitalizes on the individual's freedom of expression and how the presence of inner hope can sustain a person a long way. Don't be mistaken though, Offred is by no means an active and dynamic character. Her passivity and inability to live up to the characteristics of everyone's \\"ideal main character\\" gets more than annoying sometimes. All she ever does is dream of escape, but never does she take a step toward actual liberty. Offred is at a point where she views coping and endurance as her only hope. Regardless, she does elicit struggle and desperation, both common qualities of the regular human being.The Handmaid's Tale serves as a possible harbinger of what may occur in the near future. It opens us to the great many possibilities and downfalls that humans are still prone to. It emphasizes human's natural instinct for survival and human's natural instinct to indulge until there is no more and to indulge even when times are tough. To read it is to question whether humans have really reached a state of superiority over other animals. Have we really come that far? What prevents us from falling backwards?"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I suspect that this book was a chilling read when it was published in the 1980's, but it is especially disturbing in 2008. The threats Atwood identified then-- religious fundamentalism, an environmental apocalypse, spying and terror committed by governments, increasing control over women's bodies-- seem even more pertinent today. Atwood's humor keeps the book from ever becoming too bleak."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This was a very unique and interesting story. It's a dark theme with some very dark moments, but it also opens one's eyes. It definitely has a feminist philosophy slant- but I like that. The book left me wanting to know more- I wanted to know what happened to the character and to society next, but that was supposed to be left to the imagination, I'm sure.This is not your regular novel and I would not tread lightly into it. It's philosophical content does not make for light reading. It also isn't uplifting or \\"feel good\\". But it is a story which will make you think.Don't let the negative reviews scare you off.

But in a way, we all need to read this novel, so that we can see where our lifestyles are leading us, and to try to avoid a world such as what Offread lives in.In short, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is a fantastic read depicting a terrifying future.

She in detail describes working at the Harvard University Library before the United States was taken over.Offred's story is not supposed to make perfect sense, because it is a survival narrative thereby many of its details are sketchy at times either because of severe trama, or as she intimates because of being drugged.The Radical Christian Fundamentalist Government has completely stripped people of the dignity, freedom, and often times their feelings--all things that had made them American, more importantly human.I strongly reccomend this book, because it, like nothing else, allows you to see the human aspect of the effects of a totalitarian regime, and how quickly one can lose their basic rights, when life and death become the only options."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The handmaid's tale begins in modern America in the late '80s or early '90s and is told by Offred (not her real name). One day Offred goes to buy a pack of cigarettes at a corner store to find that her credit card (cash is no longer legal tender) does not work. She gets to work and is fired from her job, as are all the other women there. In Washington, someone has gunned down the president and congress. Martial law is established and the constitution is suspended. While fleeing to Canada to escape the reality of awful rumors, Offred and her family are captured and separated. Due to recent nuclear accidents, many people have become sterile and, this is the new \\"Gileadean government's\\" attempt to ensure a continuation of the population. People are stripped of their freedoms and women like Offred are forced to perform as handmaidens to supply the barren wives of commanders with children. The handmaid's sole purpose is now for childbearing. Women are no longer allowed to read, wear makeup, or even use lotion. The new government bases its actions on words from the Bible. However, Offred remembers the words they quote \\"from the Bible\\" as having different lines. But, without the right to read, she cannot prove this. This is the story of Offred and her terrifying new world. May it remain fiction forever! Atwood has created a new and frightful culture in her book. THE HANDMAID'S TALE is, by far, the best book I have read to date. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down except to sleep. This is one of those books that the author will probably never be able to top. Wow! It can be compared to Brave New World or 1984 for it's eerie view of a possible and horrifying future. This book should be required reading for everyone."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Picture a world, not far in the future; consisting of low birth rates, oppressed females, religions, constant wars, and a never-ending battle for freedom of thought. That is the type of setting presented in Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. This book tells the tale of Offred, who happens to be one of the few handmaids in the world. A Handmaid is a woman who is used as a tool for the leaders of the world in order to procreate. Sound scary? You have no idea. Atwood describes a world full of fear and oppression that is easily portrayed through the narrative of Offred. With her harrowing words, Offred describes the people, places, and her thoughts quite clearly, leaving readers only in the wake of her emotions. She speaks to the readers personally about her contact with an underground organization, her past, the events leading up to the present, her secret affair, and much much more. All I can say is that this book holds you in a grip of anticipation and mystery as to how the set of events will unfold. The only thing you can do while reading this book, is to hold on for a wild ride of excitement and suspense. This book is a change from Atwood's common writing style, but she seems to handle it like a pro. You will definitely feel a sense of satisfaction when you put this book down. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I had to read this book for literature even though I'd read it before and I'm glad I did. The whole point of 'The Handmaid's Tale' isn't evident until you really start to pull it apart and think about it. It's one of those books where everything contributes to give a cohesive effect - the narrative isn't as significant as structure in communicating Atwood's ideas. To fully appreciate this work, I'd advise to get rid of all distractions and buy Cliff Notes to go with it - unless you're into post-modern literary analysis, you'll need it. It's not an easy read (if you do it right) but it's definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is a frighteningly realistic novel. Atwood combines historic events and societies to create futuristic society that is highly possible. The novel is one of both social and feminist criticism. The ideas presented in The Handmaid's Tale forced me to evaluate my own beliefs as well as the morals of the society in which I live. Additionally, the plot, diction, and symbolism are clever and highly effective. I recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy reading a psychologically thrilling novel."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was very pleased. the book was in excellent condition as stated on line."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I first read this book in Junior Highschool. I liked it then but I really like it now. I always liked dystopian stories and this one has a good mix of subjects but focuses on the female aspect of things in a way that many other books of a similar genre do not. Oppression is the focus of the book, breeding and the objectification of the human being. Powerful stuff portrayed in a accessable and fascinating read. If by chance you want a good fictional book that has merit instead of the filler/page turnerrs (which can be good too) pick this up, it will surprise you. Another highly suggested book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read! Handmaids Tale is truly thought provoking and makes you contemplate about the past, present and possibly future struggles of women. Atwood is a truly talented writer, her imaginative plot and character development is fascinating and surprises you when you least expect it.The main character of the story is Offred who is living during a time in the future when women are only valuable for reproductive purposes. Once a free woman, Offred is then brought into a new society along with its constricting roles for women. As you follow this main character through her confusions and worries you feel to be so involved that you are part of the story yourself! Its suspenseful plot continues as she encounters forbidden love and the true personality of the most misinterpreted characters in the book. Follow Offred in her exciting and fearful adventures that happen throughout the book along with her female peers.Atwood incorporates allusions from various books such as \\"the Scarlet Letter\\" that create a deeper meaning to the book than just feminism. More controversial aspects are presented in the story such as the stereotypical vanity that women have. The biggest issue Handmaid's tale confronts is the issue of morality. How much of your values you would sacrifice to survive? How much of your morals will you cling on to in order to hold onto you dignity? Handmaid's tale is a truly entertaining and intellectual book that caters to all interests whether it be from feminism to science fiction!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I moaned and groaned when it came time for my english class to do another book report, but so far, The Handmaid's Tale has been my favorite novel. In fact, it is the best book I have read in a long time, including the dramas and fiction stories I read during my own spare time. I was incredibly moved by the insecurities that women, such as Offred, felt as soon as they were stripped of their social status and integrity. Offred's tale starts out in Gilead during a time of inequality among the men and women. Offred's flashbacks and past experiences help us understand the creation of Gilead and the society that is burdened with inequality within it. At first, it is hard to keep up with Offred's constant tangents, as she wanders through various periods of time, but this only keeps the reader more interesting and anticipating for more. Luckily, I was not let down, as Offred's tale kept me not only wanting to know more about her life, but I began to wonder about the social injustices that plague our modern day society and how they can be drastic enough to infiltrate a fictional world in literature.I learned how unjust the rules that run society can be. Offred's struggles help teach a valuable lesson of equality among all genders and races alike. But Gilead's unjust society helps us realize how fortunate we are to live in a place where mostly everyone is striving for equality, whether it is in the business world for the adults or in school for the younger future leaders of America. These are lessons that should be kept in mind and not just simply pondered over with and forgotten."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Though I am not a female, I am intrigued by the strong feminism evident in this book, so I do recommend this book. Margaret Eleanor Atwood warns her audience of the insidious, lurking sexism and male superiority that can arise at any instant in contemporary society. Because the book is a feminist protest, it argues that women are being dominated by men through a subtle and unnoticeable tendency, and Atwood's purpose is to reveal that very innate unconsciousness of human nature that is imperceptible to society.Though she is from a feminist point of view, Atwood directs her book's content towards all types of audiences - male and female, antifeminists and feminists, through its subtle satire and dramatizing of an improbable futuristic society. Because this book is a dystopian fiction, it is all just a speculation, futuristic and unnecessarily realistic. However, the whole point of the novel is to argue the fact that the natural tendency of government is to have a society run by male domination. Though the citizens might not perceive of this insidious trend, Atwood argues that it will inevitably happen if society does not notice and stop it before it is too late. Much of this ultimate male domination is due to the fact that the repercussions of male power are devastating. As men begin to gain more power, they are eager to exercise their newfound authority, and thus they unknowingly crave for more power at the expense women equality. Supporting an egalitarian society, Margaret Atwood stresses the importance of realizing the natural inclination for human society to drift into a male dominated government, and the only way to prevent this ultimate devastation is to start today and protect women rights and equality.This book does not so much include allusions, but it is in itself a whole allusion that parallels the theme of a previously written book. Both taking place in the near future, Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 are dystopian novels that reveal the terrifying plausibility that constitutional freedom can be readily taken away, thus both authors stress the need to preserve that valuable right. Also, it somewhat resembles Orwell's 1984, as it also concocts a theoretical dystopian world.Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale should be read slowly, because it requires a prodigious amount of attention to detail as it is written as a satire. Because satire is increasingly subtle in higher works of literature, this novel deserves a very close read between the lines. Much of the light humor is attributed to the style and, in this instance, the tone dominates the humor. At first glance, the novel may seem centered on serious matters of a male dominated society, but a closer read would unravel a whole new point of view under a different light - one that is light and sarcastic. Therefore, it is imperative that The Handmaid's Tale be read under a close magnification, because of Atwood's use of a satirical toneThis book is thought provoking, because it makes me reflect on today's government and the way our society is organized. I wonder if our constitutional rights are truly secured or are we all just conditioned to believe that our rights are secured?"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was honestly deceived by the cover and the initial chapters of the book--I seriously believed that this would be a book of the past, something centered on characters of the seventeenth or eighteenth century, or maybe even the nineteenth century. I started the book with expectations that I was going to read some book about handmaids--some tragic story about a handmaid and her master, or else something just as clich&eacute; as that.I couldn't have been more surprised to expect a story placed in the future, a story about a life in our near future where all women have become the slaves of the men, valued only if they have a viable ovary, a story about a woman who struggles to take off the rags of society's male dominated society, a warning to all of us about the kind of future we will soon face.Offred is a handmaid, one of the few lucky ones that still posseses a viable ovary. She lives a harsh life as she is both favored by her fellow maids and despised by those who envy. Unhappy with her life in this new world, she frequently reminiscences about life when everything was normal, before the Gilead's took over and changed everything. Unable to forget the past and accept her new role, Offred cannot help but dream of escaping. As the story progresses, we witness Offred's gradual leave from society's chains as she secretly engages in illegal meetings with both the commander and his servant--her first steps of defying society's orders.Although I started off on a plate of confusion not knowing what or why something was happening, as I began to understand more and more of what was going on, understand that her previous life--the happy life with her husband Luke and their new born child--was so similar to our today, I just cannot put the book down. She could have been one of us. We could have been one of her. We could have been living the horrid life in her new world, the life of a slave, the life of an UNwoman, the life of a nothing."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This amazing novel serves as a warning for the future and one that must be observed if we hope to avoid these awful events. In the future, rights for men and women must be observed and be kept equal, as is finally revealed at the end of the novel.This novel starts out already in Gilead, suggesting that there is no way to avoid these events, but with Offred's flashbacks to the past (and our future) one can see the events that lead up to the formation of Gilead. When given this information, preparation for the future can be started by already coming up with solutions. This book makes you think, and is thus an effective warning. The beginning of the novel serves as the strongest warning as no date is given so you don't know when to expect these events. This makes you alert for the rest of the book, able to absorb the warning. Gilead is described in the beginning and the descriptions only get worse. Gilead becomes a reality to the readers as they become attached to the stories of Offred, Moira and Ofglen, some major women in the story. They live through their struggles and wonder is this will ever actually happen. With Offred's flashbacks of losing her job and finances, we are shown warnings of the future. If that were to happen in the future, we could guess at what would follow next and have an idea of what to do to prevent it.Another thing that can be gained from reading this novel is an appreciation for the mostly equal treatment of the different genders in our lives today. The consequences of abolishing that is dramatized in the novel and taken to new heights. When you read of Offred's struggles as she loses her job and right to own property, you become more appreciative of what you have today. This novel helps us appreciate what we have so that if it is ever taken away, we will fight for it back and not give in, like some in the novel. The errors of Gilead are not acknowledged until the end of the novel in the \\"Historical Notes\\" when Gilead is over and done with. Waiting this long for that realization will not work. Their mistakes needed to have been discovered right at the start so as not to continue it any farther. That is something to keep in mind for the future, our future so that if the time comes, these disastrous mistakes can be avoided."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I admit, I read this because it was the next book in the book club I'm in and for no other reason. I'd seen the movie when it first came out, but had no real desire to read the book.While hard to get through, it shows a what-if world on par with the most dystopian of science fiction imagings. The heroine, Offred, wasn't your normal protagonist, one who sees the wrong and is presented with - or creates - a way to improve either her situation or the world's. She was a normal woman with normal fears and no desire to better her life for fear of reprisals should she fail. All very understandable, but somewhat annoying when she lamented over her lost life and her ponderings on what those she loved were doing now.In dealing with a woman's choice over her life and body, this was a somewhat subtle poke at governments' attempts to regulate what should be an intrinsic freedom all women have. Political views aside, Ms. Atwood brings up an excellent point. When is a woman's body her own, and when is it owned by the state? In mere years, Offred goes from being a free and educated woman to a clothed head-to-toe handmaid, subjected to the whims of the government and the Commander. Yet when given the \`freedom' to dress again in evening wear by the commander, she feels naked and exposed. Does she feel this or does she feel it because the state tells her to?There are \`notes' at the end, an epilogue of sorts still in that world that try to study the Gilead Government. That was fascinating, and I'd have liked to read more of that.There are a lot of questions this book raises, and certainly no easy answers."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaids Tale is a very sexually based book. It takes place in a totally different setting than could ever be imagined. The novel is told from an old school in the republic of Gilead. Offred narrates the story but, Offred is not her real name. They way the Handmaids were named is that \\"of\\" is always the first word then it is followed by the name of the Handmaid's Commander. The way the book goes is that Offred will tell the story of the days that have come and gone and she will give us a vision of flashback quite often. A main flashback is how the story came to be. It begins once the architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women. Tragically chemical spills led to declining births. Using the military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cut women's rights, forbidding women to own property or have a job. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to cross the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated and Offred has seen neither since. Offred was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, also known as the Red Center by women inside. At the center, women were tough preparation for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia was supervisor of the women she gave speeches about the Gilead's beliefs and how women are under men and they are only concerned with having children. After some time Offred became pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred has sex with Nick secretly and has the child as if it were the Commander's. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes that Serena has always known what happen to her daughter. A rather large turning point then arises Offred goes out shopping, and to her surprise a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the police were coming for her. After the day of shopping when Offred returns home Serena has found out about Offred's trip to Jezebel's, and she sends her to her room, ensuring punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to rescue her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander's objections, she was on her way either to prison or to freedom at this time she does not know. The Gilead Empire has fallen and the novel begins to closes with an epilogue from 2195. The letter explains the formation and, customs of Gilead in objective, analytical language. It also explains the significance of Offred's story, which has turned up on cassette tapes in Bangor, Maine. The letter also states that Nick arranged Offred's escape but that her fate now is unknown. She could have escaped to Canada or England, or she could have been captured again.

In an atmosphere reminiscent of World War II Europe, people constantly live in fear and are afraid to do just about anything because simply looking at someone the wrong way can warrant an immediate execution. Additionally, women's rights have been completely relinquished. Offred, the main character in the story, has been separated from her husband and daughter and is now a lowly handmaid: her sole \\"purpose\\" in life is to be a sex slave to her master in hopes of getting pregnant and bearing a child to give to the Commander and his wife.This is a chilling and very thought-provoking novel that I suspect will especially be appreciated by women readers.

Oh, how my heart went out to her! To think of everything she went through; I had to keep reminding myself it is just a book.I wasn't particularly thrilled about the ending, but I understand why the author chose it. It's a matter of taste. I like things with more finite and proper endings, even though in such cases there is always implied 'life' after the book for the characters.

Written from Offrend's first person point of view, the novel adds to the reader's connection with a Handmaid, her tormented feelings, and hatred toward this new totalitarian regime. Gilead is based on the precept that giving birth is women's religious and moral duty and those who do not fulfill it will be sent to hell (aka the Colonies) where the \\"unwomen\\" are left to die. With its modern setting, and reference to our present, the novel makes the reader shift between two different worlds: the narrator's and ours. For example, Atwood references Harvard as a place where the disobedient are hung and ironically she always hears the echoes of the old world where museums, stores, and the military where all used for their supposed purposes.With Biblical allusions, and references to WWII, as in \\"mayday\\" and the totalitarian regimes of Stalin and Hitler, Atwood creates a masterful piece of a fictional world still connected to the reality.With its ambiguous ending, the novel lets the mind ponder on what can become of this now familiar narrator. Is death better for her? Or if rescued, will she return to her family? The fact that the ending is hopeful adds to the greatness of the book.Its only flaw, however, was its introduction of minor characters that we never get to learn about. Offred often mentions her daughter's name but she never talks about her. Otherwise, Atwood's use of syntax is a great indicator of the narrator is shifting tones- from hope to desperation, from fear to indifference, from love to passion. She constantly uses flashback about her family and her former life to demonstrate her criticism of Gilead where women are containers valued for only what is inside of them.In order to serve the needs of the new society's elite, Gilead creates a system of titles where women are defined solely by their gender roles as Wives, Handmaids, or Marthas. Stripping them of individual names strips them of their individuality. In a moment of desperation, Offred cries out in vain, \\"I want to be held and told my name. I want to be valued, in ways that I am not; I want to be more than valuable. I repeat my former name; remind myself of what I once could do, how others saw me. I want to steal something\\" (Atwood 97).Deprived from her basic rights, Offred frustration and anger is revealed by her use of simple sentences with anaphora to stress her futile but desperate longing for attention."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Breed for me.In a future world, there is a female fertility crisis, so those women that are fertile are strictly controlled by the rest of the societyHarsh punishments are meted out to rulebreakers, and being a dystopia those in charge adjust the rules and religions to their own ends.A reasonable book.3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book is very interesting.

The novel is set in The Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States, or at least the parts of it that are not radioactive. The radioactive parts are called the colonies, where bad girls are sent to die of radiation poisoning. The time is the near future, after the inevitable nuclear war, and the breakdown of government as we know it.This novel was a. Book of the Month Club featured alternate. However, that was a long time ago. It would never be recognized or honored in today's political environment.The society depicted in The Handmaid's Tale is a nightmare: everyone is watched by the Eyes, possibly the successor to the FBI or CIA, or a home-grown version of the religious police found in some fundamentalist countries in the Middle East. Women are strictly controlled. They are forbidden to have jobs. They may have no money of their own. They are irrevocably assigned to classes.. There are, at the top, the chaste, but morally superior, Wives, almost all of whom have been rendered infertile by the inevitable nuclear war. At the bottom are the housekeepers, or Marthas, who are non-entities. In the middle are the Handmaids of the title, who are fertile, but tightly controlled. Handmaids are forced to have sex with the Commanders, the husbands of the Wives. During this sex, the Wives are intimately present to take in any \\"love\\" their Commanders have to give.The Handmaids are trained to remain unattached to the Commanders. They are prohibited from using makeup or doing anything to make themselves attractive. Handmaids are forced to turn their offspring over to the Wives.The government is totalitarian and monotheistic. The one god is very strict, and has His Eyes everywhere.The tale is narrated by Offred. (Her name is derived from: \\"of Fred\\", since she exists only because of a man.) Offred is a Handmaid who, despite her training (read brainwashing), recalls her past, her loving husband, and her adored daughter. She tells with sparkling, and terrifying clarity, how the society came to be the way it is.This governmental aspect of the story is instructive.A coup d'etat is executed by a group of hardcore fundamentalists. They machine gun the Congress. They then use this lawlessness as an excuse to permanently suspend the Constitution. These religious rebels then enact into \\"law\\" an amazingly contemporary assortment of violations of human rights.Offred's personal story is heartrending. It reminds one of the miseries of, say, the women of Darfur. When the government breaks down, she and her husband and daughter attempt to flee to Canada. Unfortunately, they are caught. Her daughter is \\"confiscated.\\" Her husband is taken away. She never sees her husband again.Offred's \\"training\\" is described at length and in great detail.Atwood's writing is compelling. The story is a must-read for anyone with a political conscience."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" depicts a futuristic dystopian society based on unrealistic expectations, propriety, oppression, and lack of individuality. The story is told from the perspective of the protagonist, Offred, who is a symbol of youth and fertility; her role as a Handmaid is to provide her assigned Commander with a child. Atwood creates a dichotomy between their past and present (our present and future) through enormous amounts of imagery, insight into Offred's thoughts and emotions, clever references to \\"the time before\\", and descriptions and comparisons to the past through Offred's flashbacks.From our current perspective, Atwood's society of Gilead is somewhat unrealistic. However, she cleverly makes it more plausible to the reader with references to our world (which as I previously stated, is the not-so-distant past of the novel). Offred finds herself stuck in the monotony of everyday life and is in constant fear of doing something wrong. She is a tragic hero because she is a genuinely nice, nave woman whose only desire is to be happy and free, but is unjustly thrown into the horrors of her controlling society. Her disposition and character traits make it easy for the reader to relate to her and to have sympathy for her situation.A significant component of \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" deals with the relationships between perspective, happiness, and privilege. The beauty of the novel is how Atwood tells her story, with imagery (especially color) and descriptions of characters and conflicts that pull in the reader. She gives it just enough distance from our reality to portray the themes without threatening our sense of comfort. At the same time, she keeps it close enough so that she can warn us about what may happen in the future if we continue on our self-destructive path."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book has often been compared to 1984, but this is rather erroneous as it lacks the epic, soul-searing and unforgettable grandeur of Orwell's work.Nevertheless, this book is one of the finest dystopic fictions I've come across. The prose is memorable and echoes stream-of-consciousness at times while still able to adhere to a plot structure, an admirable achievement. Easy to read, quickly engrossing, and filled with fascinating insights as could only come from a woman's pen, its heroine is certainly unforgettable in her strength as in her weakness.Briefly, the tale is narrated in the first person by an unnamed author known only as 'Offred'; in the book's future, those of the narrator's status take their male 'possessor's' name, robbing them of all personality. In an unnamed future, a vague puritanical movement initially led in a cause that claimed to be feminist, a society has formed in which all women have been divided into different classes, supposedly according to a Biblical model (the tale in which Rachel offers Jacob her handmaid (hint, hint) to conceive children in her stead). There are the Wives, clad in blue, chaste, and not permitted to have sex; only those marriages from 'the Time Before' which were first marriages had been allowed to remain. There are Handmaids, wearing red, whose sole purpose is it to bear children, which are then raised by the Wives. Marthas, clad in green, do the household work and general menial duties; Aunts are brutal overseers who train would-be Handmaids; and the Unwomen are those, infertile or too old to conceive, as well as rebels, sent to 'the Colonies' where they act variously as farmers or nuclear waste spillage cleaners.As the title suggests, this is the tale of a handmaid, in which she depicts her internal struggle to remain sane in the face of dehumanisation, all the while interspersing the events with the story of her past, when she was a free, educated wife and mother. Rediscovering herself, she must learn to survive, but her current 'placing' eventually reveals surprises that demonstrate that human frailty has survived after all. Finding friendship and intimacy in unusual places, Offred finally appears to prepare for resistance against the regime, although the outcome is never clear...This book is full of warnings against totalitarianism, etc, as this genre generally is; however, its political and social messages are hardly effective at all - it is the personal, human journey of the narrator that will remain. Undeniably feminine in style, it would be wiser to make this compulsory reading, not for its dystopic politics, but for its insights into the female psyche and its ability to convey thought processes authentically.My major quibbles with this excellent work are inconsistency and a botched ending. The narrator appears suddenly to switch to a completely different style of narration, and the idea of romance presented quickly goes astray, as Offred's partner is a cliched, badly drawn character who has no seeming personality, except for a few glimpses. Also, as previously mentioned, the ending itself is vague - delightfully so, darkly full of promise and the possibility of either perdition or deliverance. This is followed, however, by an epilogue of sorts, written as a lecture given in the even more distant future on this narrative, portrayed as a manuscript found depicting the ancient 'Gileadean society' in which Offred lived. Thoroughly irritating, this almost ruins the impression left by the incredible narrative, and seems tacked on, a last thought to add a further little 'twist'. It robs the novel of a great deal of futuristic momentum, but all this may be overcome by simply missing out this section and ending the work at the narrative's end. I recommend that you do this if you wish to preserve the feel of the novel, and to savour it a little longer.Despite these minor failings, I thought this a great read - beautiful in style, thought-provoking in plot... Not the best dystopic work, but the only work by the author that ever interested me.

Whether or not it's the best dystopian novel ever, well, that's a different story.The Handmaid's Tale is from the point of view of, unsurprisingly, a Handmaid (a &quot;surrogate mother&quot; who is reduced to a breeding machine in the theocratic fascist state of Gilead). The book often shifts between the present and the Handmaid's (named &quot;Of Fred&quot; or Offred to indicate who owns her) memories of a much different past, when she used to be a normal woman in a normal world. Slowly we learn a bit about Gilead's ideology: using a few isolated Bible verses they have reduced most women to just chattel, forbidding them to learn to read and write, and making them wear veils. (Clearly, the point is that all of these things have all happened before in some way somewhere on the Earth, and that they could easily happen again.) This existence begins to weigh on Offred, for whom such things as the angle of her head, her posture and her tone of voice can mean the difference between life and death - all the more so when she meets her old friend, who was always militant, feminist and rebellious, and sees that even she ended up being spiritually beaten. To try and retain her identity, she starts breaking rules. This culminates in her sleeping with the house guard, who in the end gets her across the border into Canada.The most interesting part of the book, however, is the epilogue, a transcript of a scientific conference about 150 years after the main story takes place. Here we are told in greater detail about how Gilead came to power and what its &quot;ideals&quot; were like - not enough to satisfy our curiosity, unfortunately. It ends with the note that since the main story is a first-person account, no one can be sure as to its accuracy; therefore, no one will really find out the truth about the full extent of Gilead's oppression and we can't be sure if we have just read the truth.Somehow I found Brave New World's picture of Dystopia to be more complete, and thus scarier - and also more realistic; it does require no small suspension of disbelief to assume that the whole USA would willingly subjugate and disenfranchise 50% of its population (which worked and paid taxes and served in the armed forces). According to the book, the takeover starts with the massacre of the U.S. government, but it would never have been successful without popular approval. I also don't accept this as a &quot;feminist novel,&quot; as some do - Gilead's oppression bears no parallel at all to anything today. That aside, it's a fine story, if not because of its frightening world then because of the poignance of the main character's situation.

How about those pathetic IDs entertainment companies are starting to put on CDs and DVDs so that they can slap another frivolous lawsuit even if the consumer wants to keep a personal backup so that he or she doesn't have to pay too much just to get another copy? Or worse yet, take a look at the recent Terri Schiavo case in Florida and notice how our government is currently working on dismantling our Constitution and turning our country into a theocratic dictatorship by intervening when and where they please? Or even worse yet, if you haven't noticed, government is currently in the process of making abortion inaccessible even in the case of rape or incest and is already passing laws designed to promote more spousal abuse and bigger wages gaps between men and women.

The Handmaid's Tale is the tale of an America conquered by hardline evangelical Christian forces that have waged war on non-believers and those who belong to \\"incorrect\\" sects, but more than that, it's a story about what happens when pro-life/anti-woman sentiments are allowed to run unchecked. This is a society in which women are either stay-at-home wives who keep their mouths shut, servants, or traveling wombs, and none of them have much say in their own lives. It's a world in which sex is only for reproduction, never for recreation, and certainly never for pleasure. More intriguingly, it's the first generation of this world - which means that every woman in it remembers what her old life was like, and is forced to compare it to this brave new world. In short, it's a world that doesn't seem so far-fetched when you start thinking about people like Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock, and other politicians whose insane opinions about rape and women's rights still managed to find supporters. None of this would matter, of course, if The Handmaid's Tale wasn't a great novel, but between Atwood's beautiful prose, her controlled pacing that allows us to keep discovering new horrors in this dystopia, her strong character work, and the rich plotting that both advances the story and develops the themes of the novel, there's a lot here to chew on. I've heard about Atwood for years, and just never gotten around to checking her out; having read this inflammatory, magnificent piece of writing, though, she's going to be a priority for me for some time. (Note: This year, Nashville decided to have a citywide book club, and mayor Karl Dean chose The Handmaid's Tale as the first book. That is a choice that stuns me in its gutsiness and courage, especially during such a contentious election year. But it's also kind of amazing.)"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Book was very interesting and thought provoking, but exceptionally slow-moving and you really don't find out most of the stuff that seems important in the story that the main character talks about. I had thought that there was more to the book (because there was a historical overview at the end that I thought was \\"more book\\") and when I got to the last page, I was stunned at how little they told.

But it was somewhat enlightening."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read this book about 15 years ago when I was in high school. I loved it then and wondered why it isn't required reading in every school. I'm sure the religious right (or should I say \\"Reich\\") would squash that.

It's not a far fetched idea to think that this could happen in america."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"As in other novels of dystopian hell-on-earth, Booker Prize-winning author Margaret Atwood creates a society which bears enough resemblances to modern life that the reader is startled into paying attention to the dangerous direction in which Atwood believes we are moving. Set in Gilead in the mid-21st century, the novel is represented to be a collection of cassette tapes found in a footlocker in Bangor, Maine, and made by a handmaid known as Offred. The tapes' authenticity is being discussed in 2195 at a conference studying the former society of Gilead, which occupied land once known as the United States.Offred had been an \\"ordinary\\" devoted wife and mother when she was arrested with her husband and daughter trying to escape a repressive new theocracy. Separated from her family, she now lives a subhuman life in a female community. All aspects of her life are controlled--her name, uniform, role in society, associates, chores, food, reading material, and even the places she may walk. Executions frequently take place, and walking past the wall on which bodies are displayed offers one of life's few diversions. Since the birthrate has plummeted as a result of pollution, radioactivity, and disease, she and the other handmaids are assigned to become mothers, their lives dependent on their wombs, not their brains. Already over thirty, Offred fears that she has little time left to fulfill her role and bear a healthy child--a quarter of the new babies are defective \\"shredder babies.\\"Atwood creates an exciting story as Offred's sense of rebellion gradually takes over. Though she has been able to keep herself going for some time through a forbidden affair with a workman, she finds herself living for the moment, unable to see any future. She can trust no one, but she knows that she cannot continue to live under the conditions in which she currently finds herself, especially if she fails to produce a healthy child. When she learns that there is secret group known as Mayday which runs a female underground railroad to sanctuary over the border to the north, Offred decides to take some chances, hoping to escape the sameness of her life.As Atwood explores Offred's day-to-day existence, the ultra-conservative theocracy assumes ominous significance. Mind and body are totally controlled, and individuality has ceased to exist. Women are incubators, and even prayers are not original--they are churned out by computerized machines. Atwood's details of Offred's life are carefully chosen to illustrate her themes, and though the book is didactic (and it is no surprise that this is a popular novel for high school English classes), her sense of drama and her ability to create a sympathetic figure in Offred make this a fascinating read and obvious caution for the future. n Mary WhippleThe Blind AssassinOryx and CrakeAlias Grace: A NovelMoral Disorder and Other Stories"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was required to read this book for my english class this year.

The new society is shaped as a patriarchal hierarchy, relegating women to a very subordinate position. One step after other this totalitarian government has banned gays, other religious groups and political dissidents.The story is told by a Handmaid that is to say a fertile woman used as an official concubine by high ranking officials. Women have been stratified in rigid classes: Wives & Daughters, Handmaids, Marthas, Aunts and Housewives. Each class has its codified role and attributes under constant surveillance of males. Males are also stratified: Commanders, Angels, Eyes and Guards. They also are subjected to very strict behavior codes. Any intent of deviation is harshly punished.The Diary gives the reader inkling into the new society and how it came into existence, but not a detailed and complete picture, rendering the novel very believable and interesting.Ms. Atwood prose is very ascetic; short phrases devoid of adjectives gives her novel a very special taste. The reader is introduced into this stark universe little by little and the whole image takes some time to be grasped. As a final result a griping tale emerges.This novel has been compared, deservedly, with Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" and in my view it stands to par with them.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is Margaret Atwood's profound insight into the dystopian society that may exist if we as a people continue with our traditions of the oppression of women. Yes, the phrase \\"oppression of women\\" connotes the notion that women in our society are beaten and abused, but our society's discreet methods of repressing women give off a similar psychological effect. While society has progressed along in that women are now allowed to vote and run for political office, it has taken much too long for our mainly male-dominated society to consider females an equal gender (Where are our female presidents?). Atwood's depiction of a dystopian civilization is a perceptive look at what the world would be like if we continue to suppress women and their rights.Eloquently written through a handmaid's observant point of view, The Handmaid's Tale presents novel ideas that present messages which could easily translate into today's society. While we may not realize it, we as a people take many of a woman's roles in life for granted. It is the woman who normally takes on her husband's surname in matrimony, but it is hardly ever the other way around. In Atwood's proposed civilization of Gilead, the matrimonial nomenclature takes on a whole new meaning. The protagonist Offred is a handmaid to her household, promised to her commander. She is \\"of\\" Fred, so to speak, and the rest of the women bear similar names- Ofglen, Ofwayne, Ofwarren, and so on. In a feminist argument, Atwood brilliantly challenges the concept of women taking on their husband's family names, as the women lose their identities in the process, marking complete submission to their male spouses. Women who are with child are envied in Gilead and those who are barren are degraded. That women must endure the hardships of labor while their spouses stand by and watch is an element of life that many underestimate. It is these minor details that truly exemplify Atwood's intellect in fabricating her dystopian society, making extremities of such small measures that we normally take for granted.As a male, the book truly opens my eyes as it gives an alternate perspective of life if women were truly subjected to such measures. Despite the fact that the conditions present in The Handmaid's Tale could be considered by many to be outlandish to today's society, Atwood's message should be taken into deep consideration. Atwood creates a hypothetical world where America, rather than progressing forward, backtracks and resorts to its traditional gender roles where woman are kept for the sole purpose of bearing child. My appreciation for women has certainly been increased, as the book emphasizes the importance of women's rights today and how dire it is for these rights to be maintained, as society can easily, as The Handmaid's Tale shows, return to an antediluvian culture of male dominion. Through the portrayal of an anti-utopian society, Atwood conveys what may seem as imminent threats to society."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"HANDMAID'S TALE: Margaret Atwood's the Handmaid's Tale is a break from modern literature. A dystopia set in the future, the society of Gilead is unique and offers interesting insight upon structure and roles in society. Although the readers may need to take a while to adjust to the environment of Gilead, once they do, they will find it to be a refreshing outlook upon society.The society of Gilead is a place where women are set into strict castes, based on marriage and the male society. Throughout the story, the alpha male character is present and women need to succumb to the rules that men set. As an example of the male dominance in Gilead, women are required to adopt their male counterpart's name, preceded by \\"Of,\\" to indicate possession. The protagonist, Offred offers herself to the society in exchange for protection from the war that rages on outside of well-protected Gilead. In order to assure the safety of it inhabitants, the government of Gilead designates strict rules and curfews that its citizens are expected to abide by, and any violators will be punished by death. In such a society, Offred tries to find love and peace of mind despite the restrictions placed on her, and tries to break free from the rules in her pursuit of these goals. The book chronicles the journey of Offred and the secret society formed against the watchful eyes of the Gileadean government. I would recommend this book for its portrayal of the roles of women that are not commonly seen in today's society. It is an easy read, although it takes some getting used to, and is an overall enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is a wonderful book written by a wonderful author. This book is complex and interesting. It dives deep into many issues that society is ignoring today, and it makes you think about what life would be like if it continues on this same track.

I would recommend this!!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Chris HerbertPeriod 3Book ReviewThe Handmaids TaleJust recently I had read the Handmaids Tale. It was a very interesting book that had you always thinking of what was going to happen next. The Handmaids Tale was good but a very confusing novel. I had liked the book because it had kept my interest by being such a cliff hanger. The story makes you feel like your there with all the detail. In this book they give you enough detail to make you feel like you are actually there.The novel The Handmaids Tale was very jumpy. It made me confused because they jumps back and forth. That's what makes you so confused. This book reminds me of some movies. Sometimes when you watch movies you don't understand it until you watch it a second time. This book I think would be better if you read it second time. There's a lot of things that I had missed so I had to read the spark notes to help me understand what was going on. First it starts off in a gym then goes to a prison type of thing that has sex slaves in it basically. These women who have been taken over by this new government have been made these sex slaves. The purpose of these women are to have babies for other men. Then when they are done they are sent to some other guy to have there baby. These women are forbidden to have any type of relationship with any men, if so they could be sent to the colonies. These women are thrown around like they are nothing. So through out the book Offred the main character talks a lot about her husband Luke and her Daughter and at times her mother. Through out the book she talks about there escape but she can never remember what happens after they got caught. So later on in the book she all of a sudden starts to remember what happened to the country. She starts to talk about how the president and congress had started been shot up. Then they had called for a state of emergency. So they had made a new form of government called Gilead. So now your like ok what just happened. It makes you sit there and wonder how did she just remember this? This book tends to throw you off a lot and sends you in a different direction of what you think of the book. It's just one of those books that if you read it again it will make you think about things differently.This novel the Handmaids Tale was a very good book. I recommend it to any one that likes to read. I don't like to read but this book kept my interest enough to end up finishing it. It was a good book but you got to have the patients to read this book. But if you like to read then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"\\"I would like to believe this is a story I'm telling. I need to believe it. I must believe it. Those who can believe that such stories are only stories have a better chance.\\"This quote has great meaning to what this book is all about. As the handmaids go through each day, their lives are like a storybook. They must except what life throws at them and find a way to overcome the obstacles that come their way each and everyday. In order to make it in society, them must use their bodies to survive.The handmaids aren't acknowledged for the intelligence or beauty, but rather for their willingness to cooperate with their Commanders. The handmaids are only good for one thing, and that's to have a baby. As the women struggle to get through each day, they are tortured with the lack of respect from those above them. They have no one to love and have affection for, but rather dwell on those that they have lost in the past. Offred, one of the strongest handmaids in the Gilead, has mixed emotions about her life. She finds a way to get through each day, but often finds herself living in the past as she thinks about her family. As she makes new friends along the way, she's able to express her secrets and deepest feelings. Whether or not suicide will be her way to escape the hell she goes through everyday, it's one of the few options she has.The Handmaid's Tale is a book with many different qualities. It can be very interesting at times, but sometimes confusing and misleading. To see the way that these women are able to get through each and everyday is amazing to me. Being a woman myself, I feel for them. If I was being treated with no respect at all and all I was good for was my body, I don't know how I would survive. These women have to live with no love in their life, and without love, what is life? As the handmaids contemplate suicide almost everyday, it's interesting to see how they cope with their situations. These situations make the book interesting and leaves the reader wanting to know what is going to happen next. At the same time, if you aren't able to follow books easily, it can be quite frustrating. If you pay attention to what you're reading, the book can be quite enjoyable to read.I do believe that this book is very interesting and leaves you wanting more. Twisted into this book is love, sex, women's rights, and much more. Once you understand what the handmaids are going through, you start feeling connected to them. A great book to leave you in suspense and wanting more."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A remarkable alternative to _Brave New World_ and _1984_, Margaret Atwood masterfully crafts a tension and a hatred of everything statutary. The atmosphere of suppressed hope, coupled with intense and startling symbolism, gives the book a delicious gradual unraveling. An obsessive tale of the implosion of society, it brings to mind the ruthlessness of _Lord of the Flies_ and the kind of sheltered-innocence-cum-critical-revelation that sparks the mind into wandering down a path of philosophical daydreaming. All in favor of the lassez-faire, read this book. All in favor of the \\"thought police,\\" here's your handbook."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"After reading Surfacing and The Blind Assassin, The Handmaid's Tale was my last book for my senior paper. My teacher assured me it was a page-turner, but I couldn't get into it. Then, around page 190 or 200, I couldn't put it down (and literally didn't until I'd read the last page).Atwood says the book is not science fiction, and I'd say that anyone who calls it that would be crazy. The idea is shocking, but brilliant as Atwood always is, and the book, while terrifying, is not a synical as one might believe.Read it, you'll love it; I assure you (whoever you are)!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is an excellent book, one to return to every few years. While it conjours up our darkest fears, it shows what can happen when the far right and the far left come together to force their points of view on the middle.The really scary point Atwood is making is that all of these things are happening right now, all over the world. She puts Iran and Iraq into our own perspective. What if America became or was allowed to become the same sort of society?Any Questions?"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book was difficult to put down as I sought to find out more and more about how the religious cult portrayed had brainwashed so many people into following a ridiculous code of living. The juxtaposition of the baby making obsession and the extermination of opposition in the name of God was provocative and unsettling. As a Christian (but not one of the religious right) who believes and understands the Bible, I was curious to see how Atwood would describe those who had taken the Bible too far (or taken miniscule portions of it too far). The most horrifying aspect for me was the degradation of women as God's idea for them is quite different than the male domination portrayed in the novel: His idea is for equality with man, for women to live with purpose, for men and women together to show the amazing identity of God, and for all to freely read his word and grow in knowledge and freedom found within it. The book is good. It provokes all to think deeply about how religion affects society for good or for ill."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Aside from the beautiful writing (typical of the author) this is well worth reading to compare it with Orwell's 1984.

On the surface, it points out the all too familiar seeming dangers of Christian fundamentalism come to power. Having locked up in a Christian state what Christians should really take to heart may well be seen as a metaphor for what is happening in broad parts of Christianity. Underneath her sarcastic criticism of all religion become stone and dogma, however, there is something to be sensed in this palimpsest of voices which is not so much anti-Christian after all. Atwood makes extensive use not only of symbols, but also of Scripture, especially 1 Corinthians 13. Faith, Hope and Love are introduced vice versa, turn up as a kind of hidden agenda in Offred's reconstruction of her own past, which again turns into her very own Gospel. The trias comes up over and over again, twisted, questioned, neglected, shattered, tricked, and, finally, redefined. By redefining spiritual values, especially Christian ones, our 21st century Little Red Riding Hood successfully resents to be devoured by the wolf. Of course, like every piece of good literature, Pieixoto's work is open to interpretation, but to me Atwood's masterpiece has become a kind of survival programme for nowaday's Christianity. Spiritual truths only survive by redefining them on an individual basis."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"With fundamentalist sects seeking to turn the United States(or the world) into a theocracy, THE HANDMAID'S TALE may actually be a glimpse at what may be in store in the future.

However, I walked away from this book both shocked, amazed, and enthralled with Atwood's writing. Having never read any Atwood before, I had no idea what I was walking into when I decided to read THT. I was absolutely amazed by Atwood's use of language, chapter structure, imagery, and symbolism.This book should be used as mandatory reading in both senior English classes and government classes (if government classes are manadatory anywhere else but New York). This book is a prime example of what situations can evolve if citizens are not aware of the world around them along with the events taking place around them. In order to make students cautious of their actions, it is necessary to show them examples, fiction or nonfiction, of the results of possible actions. Speaking as a student, I think that the rest of my class would have gotten much out of this book had it been mandatory reading in this year's curriculum.

Subtle warnings about a clever and devious conservative white male think tank that in all probability is utterly devoid of any actual spiritual motivation and whose primary focus is the self-preservation of their elite privileged lifestyle in the face of its own self-destructive biological consequences are to be found here. Subtle warnings abound in this story and it behooves one to look at oneself as well. Short-sightedness and perfunctory utility are the destroyers of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.This is a well-realized society that Atwood has created, one that is utterly repressive in every way. The book is well-paced, well written and masterfully conceived. So complex and thought provoking is the book that it is one of the few modern day works of fiction to be the subject of a Cliffs Notes study guide.I found it particularly interesting that this book was published in 1985 and yet it warns of a paperless society, plastic and numerical money, and universal identification cards among other aspects of modern times that do, in fact, seem to be a coming reality. Ironically, the narrator of the story, a completely objectified, sexual commodity, enslaved and utterly repressed by the government, prior to the coups d'etat, worked as a transcriber in a university library and her task was to transcribe books onto compact disks in order to maximize space. As long as she still had the illusion of liberty and was being paid, she never questioned the danger of her job to civil liberty as a whole. Atwood's allusion to the reality in modern times of an insidious Fahrenheit 451 attitude, ostensibly for practicality's sake, is just one of the chilling warnings presented in this book.In one passage of remarkably prescient writing Atwood describes the actual day of the takeover thus: \\"It was after the catastrophe, when they shot the president and machine-gunned the Congress and the army declared a state of emergency. They blamed it on the Islamic fanatics, at the time. Keep calm, they said on television. Everything is under control.\\"I find it exceedingly interesting and frightening that our true-life catastrophe of 9-11 has already caused us to lower our guard and allow serious incursions into our civil liberties. We, like the Handmaid Offred in her earlier life, seem to be unconcerned so long as we are still getting paid and are still allowed our own personal familiar comforts. We are so complacent and so trusting. This book was a wake-up call seventeen years ago when it was published and today it is a warning siren against a gathering storm that we dare not plug our ears to ignor.

Here the new family traditions combine 20th century technology and old testiment biblical customs.Her longing for her child and husband and her old life never abate, even when she finds a way to resist throught an undeground anti-government resistence.While this is obviously fiction, it is easy to find current real life parallel. I'm not sure that the author was thinking of fundamentalist Muslins when she wrote this, but she could have been."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I recently picked up this book again, which I hadn't read since the '80's. I expected it not to hold up well, but was surprised instead to find it more timely and moving than ever. When something like the takeover of the Taliban in Afghanistan, or the Nazi takeover of Germany happens, we sit there and wonder how it could happen and how the victims couldn't see it coming. Margaret Atwood's miracle here is that she shows you how it might come and you understand how people got caught up in it. She also persuades you that it could happen here. This is a sad and scary book, but one that is incredibly compelling and believable.The book deals quite a bit with the pressing concerns of religion in America in the '80's, but they are problems that haven't left us today and, in some respects, are more prominent than when Atwood wrote her book -- a declining birth rate, increasing birth defects, a fundamental split in how the left and the right view abortion, clinic bombings, a movement to keep women at home, etc., and by the time the book starts, a far-right splinter group has taken power and stripped almost everyone in society, especially women, of their power and freedom. Atwood looks at how such a society would function and how it would affect its various members, from the wealthy and powerful men who run it, to their barren and houseridden wives, to the servants (men in the military, women in the house) to the handmaids, the fertile women possibily capable in a society not reproducing quickly enough of becoming surrogate mothers for the wealthy and powerful whose wives cannot provide healthy children.This is the ultimate tale of what happens when a society takes away women's rights, especially the right of a woman to control what happens to her body. As the \\"Aunts\\" who train the new handmaids to their job would say, there is \\"freedom to\\" and \\"freedom from,\\" and while women are free from rape, they are not free to do anything, include use their real names, their only designation being by to whom they belong at any given moment -- Offred, Ofwarren, etc. The Aunts are meant to conjure up the Jewish capos in the Nazi death camps -- affected people who accept positions of power from their oppressors and use it to help further the oppression. Although Atwood's book is awfully quiet on the subject of race, she does draw from the experiences of American slaves and their status in society, including those who risked their lives to get them to safety.The book is written as the after-the-fact diary of Offred, whose fate is refreshingly ambiguous. I've always disliked the ending, the tacked on \\"presentation\\" of a paper on the society in which Offred lived and which examines her diary to determine whether it is real. While it fills in some nice gaps (and lets us know the society it describes ultimately fails), it feels uneccessary and doesn't have the impact of the rest of the book, which is a back and forth between Offred's memories of her husband, child, best friend, and mother and the life she led before, and her current life, which involves a lot of waiting and doing nothing, of watching one's behavior very carefully, and of being afraid to develop friendships and afraid to offend. And of offering your body as a surrogate for a wife who despises you and only wants the child that you hopefully have to offer if you want a guaranteed life away from the relocation camps cleaning up toxic waste and not hanging on the death wall for some transgression against society.A moving account of a repressive Christian society, this book made me grateful for what I have, fears and all."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Bloody terrifying. Bone-chilling. Probably Atwood's best known work for no shortage of obvious reasons. If you don't vote, if you don't get out into your community, if you don't participate: this is your future."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood's novel \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is an Orwellian tour de force, except that in her novel the totalitarian regime is theocratic. Drawing on \\"1984,\\" \\"Brave New World,\\" and \\"Farenheit 451,\\" Atwood creates her own terrifying future, one in which the religious right has taken over America and subjugated its people to unrelenting fear and torture. Atwood illustrates how easy it is to take rational religious beliefs and stretch them beyond recognition until they become specious and repellent, so that the miracle of birth becomes mechanized propagation. Atwood succeeds masterfully in her premise because she turns story into parable: That when human freedom is denied, whether by theocracy, fascism, or any form of totalitarianism, life's only choice is rebellion, because acceptance, or even acquiescence, is a living death."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is not a medieval tale; the time is the not-too-distant future; the place: probably in what we know as Boston, MA. The government is a combination of brutal dictatorship with a Luddite cast of mind. Women have lost all rights and are to think of themselves as pure vessels of procreation-that is when they think at all.The book is presented in diary form, one that has been written after the fact. We never know our heroine's birth name. She, like her fellow handmaids, is christened anew when she is posted to a new assignment. A handmaid's job is to get pregnant by the high-ranking husband-of-the-house who hired her. If there is a resulting child, it belongs to her employer and his wife. The birth rate is very low and live births are few. If she succeeds, she is given another post. If she fails after three posts, she is banished or worse. Her present singularly ugly name is \\"Offred.\\" Her employer is \\"Fred\\" and she is merely \\"of Fred.\\"Offred is an intelligent, sometimes lyrical woman, who in the very recent past had a husband, child and career before the upheaval. She is often suicidally depressed, but tries very hard to resign herself to the present without completely losing her sense of the past. She is lyrical and evocative and has a shrewd eye for her fellow humans. She accepts but does not respect the laws and persons she lives under.Many of these reviews are by students that were forced to read this novel on assignment. I was fortunate to come by it by happy chance. I sympathize with being directed to read; I have never enjoyed George Eliot or William Wordsworth for that very reason. However, Offred has much to proffer and does so in an engaging manner. Her situation is dire. Her description of sexual intercourse with her employer vividly emphasizes her shame and the low caste she has been assigned. The customs surrounding the birth of a child are repulsive, prudish nonsense.I did not see \\"Handmaiden\\" as a feminist tract. It seemed to me the men were just as regimented and unhappy as the women. I enjoyed this well-told futuristic story and recommend it. You can even provide your own ending."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This edition of the book includes some clarification in the appendix. Atwood based the events on her historical research into religious oppression in the U.S. and elsewhere. It is worth noting that Afghanistan's culture today is not far from the dystopic vision in &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;.That being said, I found the book neither terribly convincing nor very enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I've been reading the other reviews, and noted that many women here seem to think that the Handmaid's Tale more accurately describes the life of women in Muslim Countries and is something that could never happen in a \\"Christian\\" nation.Wake up.The latest attempts to remove abortion rights (by defining the fetus as a person) show that the Christian Right is willing to use any back door they can get to deny women our human rights. I re-read the book for the third or fourth time after the non-election of 2000, and thought that Atwood was prophetic.Offred's life is the end result of many of the reforms that are \\"suggested\\" by various Right-Wing Christian Groups. It is a terrifying glimpse at a future that I, and many other women, hope never arrives.As Atwood so carefully outlines, the Bible has a history of being used to promote completely different points of view: while it was being used by African American ministers to prove that slavery wasn't allowable, it was also used by White Southern Ministers to prove that blacks were meant to be a slave race.It has been used to prove that women cannot speak in church and to prove that women cannot even ask questions of their minister (only their husband, and they must rely upon his answer). This is a daily reality for women who live in conservative Amish or Mennonite communities.The Bible states, repeatedly, what women cannot do. The Qur'an, on the other hand, states repeatedly what rights women have. Which means that it is actually EASIER to use the Bible as a tool to deny women's rights than it is to use the Qur'an.I do not say this lightly. My husband is Palestinian, and I have lived in Saudi Arabia. But when I interacted with non-related men, I was more valued for my mind when I lived in Saudi Arabia. In America (which is where I grew up), I find myself increasingly convinced that men are only interested in interacting with me as a sexual being. There is constant pressure for me to wear less, to put on make-up, and to \\"do something\\" with my hair.That is not to say that living in Saudi Arabia is pleasant. But as a woman wearing the Abaya with so many other women, I was, essentially, completely unidentifiable. Men did not follow me, look at me, or ask me about my availability. I only interacted with them as a cerebral being. In some ways, this allowed me MORE freedom than I experience in America, dressed as an average American female (jeans, t-shirt, skirt-suit, etc.).Needless to say, there are many Muslim countries where women are not forced to veil, such as Jordan, Turkey, etc. But in these countries, I have experienced more harrassment than in Saudi Arabia - until I decided to put on the Abaya, after which I was left alone.I tried the same experiment in America - only to find that the Abaya made me stick out, that men spent even longer trying to undress me with their eyes, and attracted far too much attention.It never ceases to amaze me how people can be so blinded by their preference for a particular religion that they do not see that the same faults of another religion exist in the one they practice. The Handmaid's tale shows what happens when the Bible is read from the viewpoint of a misogynist, right-wing male, and many parts of it fit very closely with how members of the Ku Klux Klan, the Amish, and various other groups with conservative readings of the Bible treat \\"their\\" women. And its not a pretty picture."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A lackluster dystopian fiction, about what may happen in the future in a free country such as the US, if ruled under an authoritarian facist regime, where citizens behaviors get closely monitored and women lives are subjected to the will of the State. the story is dull, and told under a monotonous, first person monologue, that of the Handmaid. The editorial reviews promised a level of drama, mystery and intrigue, I did not experience in any chapter of this tale."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is one of the most important novels of the 20th century. Atwood has captured what happens when people of good conscience and liberal views do not safeguard or battle for their positions. Zealotry wins in such cases. There are many novels that talk about the price of freedom being eternal vigilance. This novel graphically and frighteningly shows us the result of not heeding this simple message. It is not a very far step from the current practices of many countries to the society of Gilead, and unfortunately there are many people who would regard the society described as a utopia, not a dystopia."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read this book in one day. It tells the story of Offred, a handmaid. Each handmaid's name is similiar, like Ofglen, etc... They have be reduced to be called &quot;of&quot; and then their master's name. Even if the world was not entirely believable, I still felt the story was good and hard to put down. Basically, in a time not far from when the author wrote (in the mid-80s) the United States of America has ceased to exsist. Government and religion are one in the same. Offred is better off than most, for she is a handmaid, in her words &quot;a walking womb&quot;. The handmaid's job is to be the carrier of children for a household, but the child is in no way hers. In fact, as soon as it is born, it gets placed into the arms of the wife of the house, who is treated like she just gave birth herself. Offred can still remember the past, and the people she left behind, her mother, her best friend, her husband, and her baby girl. Where are they? Did they survive? That ray of hope seems to keep Offred alive, that, and breaking the rules, which could land her in serious trouble...perhaps even strung up on the Wall as an example for others."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale was the first Atwood book I read and it remains my favourite. As I was reading the book, I was by turns fascinated and infuriated. Fascinated by the story and infuriated by the treatment of the handmaids.The Handmaid's Tale follows the main character through her new life as a handmaid to a powerful government/army man and his wife. The couple have been unable to conceive a child of their own so they have been given a handmaid, whose sole purpose is to conceive and give birth to the man's child. Through flashbacks we discover how the handmaid got to be in this situation and the life she used to have before she became this &quot;non-person&quot;.Like all Atwood novels, the Handmaid's Tale contains many rich layers of meaning and symbols. It's the sort of book that I could easily read two or three times and come away with something new each time."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I'm 15 years old, and this book was recommended to me by my Sophomore Literature teacher. I had heard that in previous years, this book had been banned and was a little hesitant to read it. Well, I took the chance and loved it. Please DO NOT hesitate to read this book because you may have heard of its &quot;explicit sexual scenes&quot; because I have read romance novels that are more graphic than this book. It is shockingly real and makes a person think and wonder outside the world he/she lives in.

The way Atwood balances the tone in this work is impressive; an atmosphere of subtle apprehension runs alongside a slight sense of tragic inevitability to this drama. The reader goes inside the mind of the protagonist, and for me, I liked the personality of the main character. She is introspective, sensuous, realistic and hopeful. A woman dealing with life the best she can in the world she's subject to. Will she persevere in her dilemma? Or will she meet her demise in this ominous tale - this Handmaid's Tale? I consider this book a modern classic."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"What I felt to be the most important message of the book, was the idea that extremism of any sorts leads ultimately to the same tyranny. Offred goes to great lengths to comment not only on her own torturous existance, but also reflects on mother, a radical activist, and her friend Moira. The simularities between the radicals that lead the Republic of Gilead and her mother and Moira were similar in that they both wish to eradicate what they felt were &quot;dangerous elements&quot; in society. Most vivid of Ms. Attwood's examples were presenting Offred's memories of being with her mother (the activisit) as a crowd of women burned pornography, and illustrating the condemnation of the Gileadan ideologues of sexual material. Simultaneously, Offred recounts being involved in a group &quot;taking back the night&quot; in the pre-Gilead period, but then being pelted with messages from the Aunts (the indoctrinators of the Handmaids) about how women could not walk safely in the times before Gilead. These interesting juxtapositions are threaded throughout the novel, and illustrate how, in a sense, both sides of the political spectrum, the radicals of Offred's mother and the radicals of the sexist Gilead both utilized the same arguments (dangers of pornography and the threat to women) to justify acts of tyranny (book burnings and the removal of the rights of women). The message of the Handmaid's Tale is one of the dangers of moral absolutism and how any attempt to dominate society with one vision of social justice, for either good or bad intentions, will ultimately suffocate liberty."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I enjoyed this book, and it kept me turning the pages to find out what would happen next.

The idea that something likes this could happen is very scary.Overall, I wish the author would have tied up some of the ends, and not included so many open endings for the reader.One of the parts that made me mad, was when the commander reveals that some things have to be kept hidden and that \\"nature demands\\" certain things to be available to men. Even though they put up this laughable farce, that women are the most valuable in the society, they get treated very badly .... all around. Almost everybody is miserable in this new society and the total deprevation of human contact and being used in the most disrespectful way was a good way of illustrating the need humans have for social interaction.Since the author was in West Berlin when she started the book, it is easy to see the connection to East Berlin and how people where kept locked away and lived in very simple conditions ... what I mean by that is the lack of choices at grocery stores, entertainment, and other things like furniture/cars etc. The basic needs covered, but not much else.Overall, the author did a great job and I would recommend this book to any book club."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"At first I had no idea how to rate this book. At first thought I wanted to say that I absolutely despised it . But that would imply that it was poorly written, which it was not. Or that it was tedious or slow paced which is also untrue. I tried to think of all the attributes of a bad book. Did it lack originality? Was it flat and factual, unable to illicit the pathos associated with a good novel? Was I unable to immerse myself in the world? To all this I have to unequivocally deny. So in point of fact by all acceptable standards this is a wonderful novel. Which I absolutely despised. I hated everything about this world. I wanted to go into this world with a hatchet and murder people. The utter humiliation of being a woman here stuck in my throat.

Similar to Orwell's 1984, this book's dystopian future is frighteningly realistic, and certainly plausible. Many (if not most) of the characters are sympathetic (though, perhaps, not at first), and among other things, a message of the novel is &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover.&quot; And [best of all], unlike 1984, the book does not devote itself to the dogma of any particular system (like 1984 does with Communism), but instead allows Atwood's intent to be seen through the actual plot and the revelation thereof. If you liked 1984 at all, you will certainly enjoy The Handmaid's Tale."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is a story about American society in the near future. First the country becomes completely automated, so that no one ever has cash any more. All transactions take place electronically. People have accounts, and their wages and other income are automatically deposited into their accounts and funds for all purchases are automatically withdrawn. After the entire country is doing this, it becomes easy to gain control. The narrator goes to a store one day to make a purchase and is told that she has no money in her account. She finds out later that day that the government has been reorganized. Some religious radicals have assassinated the President and every member of Congress; they have suspended the Constitution and they are now in charge. The first order of business is to take all property away from women so that whatever they have in their account is transferred to whatever man is predominant in the woman's life. With the narrator, it is her husband. The next is to fire every woman who has a job outside the home. The narrator and every other woman at her place of employment are all fired that same day, at the behest of the government. The narrator and her husband eventually try to take their little girl and escape into Canada when it becomes apparent that this society is only going to get more oppressive. They are caught at the border and she is taken away from her husband and child. She never sees them again. She later learns that her daughter was given to some family who couldn't have children and who are intrinsically involved with the takeover of society, but she never learns what happened to her husband.Women are separated by whatever purpose those in charge believe they are most suited to. There are Aunts - those who are in charge of and who train Handmaids. They are dressed in brown and carry cattle prods. There are Marthas - who do household chores. They are dressed in green. And there are Handmaids - whose sole purpose is to become impregnated by some man whose wife cannot have children. They are dressed in red, with a headpiece that does not allow them to look other people in the eye because they have \\"wings\\" on either side of their heads. They no longer have individual names. They are named for the man whose child they are expected to bear - Offred, Ofglen - the men being Fred and Glen. The sex act is totally perverted by the fact that there is no bodily contact except that which is necessary to make a fetus. The Wife of the man is in the bed with the Handmaid's head resting on her belly while the man has impersonal sex with the Handmaid. The Handmaid's skirt is raised above her legs, but no further. There is no eye contact and no personal feelings are involved. After the Handmaids give birth, they are not allowed to raise the babies they gave birth to. After a few months of nursing, they are assigned to another man, and the baby is raised by the Wife of the man who is the father.The Republicans are pushing \\"personhood\\" statutes in many states right now. These laws give more rights to a fetus than to the woman who is carrying the fetus. One woman has been charged with murder because she gave birth to twins and one was stillborn. The charge is based on the idea that, because the woman had refused to have a C-section two weeks before she gave birth, she is responsible for the stillbirth. Another woman wanted to have a child naturally after she had had a C-section for a prior pregnancy. No doctor or hospital would agree with this, so she decided to stay home to have this baby. While she was in active labor, the Sheriff and the State's Attorney knocked on her door. She was strapped to a gurney and taken to a hospital - against her will - where she was forced to undergo a C-section without her consent. Another woman was diagnosed with lung cancer when she was 27 weeks pregnant. She and her husband and family had all agreed that they wanted to keep this woman alive as long as possible. The medical establishment did not agree with this decision, so they got a court order giving them custody of the child before, during and after the birth. This woman was also forced to have a C-section against her will. Neither she nor the child survived. These things have all happened recently, right here in the United States of America. The Huffington Post recently reported on this, and posted videos on their website showing the women involved. Women are being reduced to vessels whose sole purpose is to carry a child to full term, regardless of what the woman wants.This is happening - right here and right now. All women should read this book before they go to the polls for any election."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\", a futuristic dystopia results when a radical religious sect seizes power in the United States and enforces its extremist beliefs on the populace. In this new society of religious absolutism, women in particular are victimized by a culture in which they are relegated to second-class citizens. All citizens become enslaved to a totalitarian theocracy that uses violence and death to impose its fanatical doctrine.The story is told from the perspective of a Handmaid. In this version of the not-too-distant future, pollution and other environmental damage have resulted in dramatically reduced birth rates and rampant infertility. To keep its population from dwindling away, the ruling regime of this new Republic of Gilead has come up with a bizarre system of assigning fertile members of a disfavored class of women to \\"Commanders\\" whose wives can't bear children. The entire society is segregated into a rigid social order in which interactions are strictly regimented, and men and women are prevented from having anything resembling normal human relationships.This is a gripping, compelling study of the potential results when, as Ms. Atwood states in a note to readers, \\"not uncommon pronouncements about women are taken to their logical conclusions.\\"To many this may seem like an impossible and unrealistic scenario in today's supposedly enlightened world. But the reality is that religious extremists throughout history have done, and continue to do, all of the things that occur in this novel. In fact, the author herself pointed out in an interview shortly after publication that there is nothing in the book that she didn't base on things that have already happened in history, or in other countries. The message is that the threat of religious fanaticism is real, and has the potential to have far-reaching impact on all of our lives, and the world at large.The most frightening aspect of this novel, to me, is that the source of the violent and misogynistic beliefs and policies of the controlling sect is a book that is in widespread use today as the definitive guide for human behavior: the Bible. The term \\"Handmaid\\" itself is derived from the Old Testament, in which a barren Rachel demands that her husband Jacob use her maid to provide her with the children she cannot bear.Twisted Bible interpretations are hinted at throughout the book. Women's subjugated place in society; the routine and ritualistic execution of sinners or non-believers known as Salvaging; the fact that handmaids are allowed to speak to each other only in simple, proscribed religious phrases; these are all rules ostensibly dictated by the Bible. However, citizens are no longer allowed to read the Bible itself -- it is kept under lock and key. It becomes clear that the radical cult that has seized power is using religion as its vehicle for oppression and tyranny.The story is revealed slowly, through the present-tense ruminations of a Handmaid. At first, the use of the first-person present-tense is a bit off-putting: how can this woman be recording her thoughts? In this acutely patriarchal society, women are not allowed to read or write or have access to anything that would allow them to think for themselves. So how is Offred, the protagonist, writing this? The answer is in fact revealed later in the \\"Historical Notes,\\" the clever and revealing conclusion of the book; but during the body of the novel, that is left as a sort of dangling question.While this book is clearly a stark cautionary tale for anyone who doesn't fear religious extremism, it is also a testament to the resiliency of the human spirit. Offred, living in the most oppressed conditions imaginable, is forced into strict conformity. Yet she retains her individuality through a series of tiny, almost insignificant rebellions. In spite of the potentially fatal penalties, she continues to take these risks for no reason other than maintaining a small part of herself within the compliant exterior. Later on this rebellion escalates, testifying to the unquenchable human need for love, connections, bonding.At the conclusion of this grim saga, the fate of our heroine is left essentially unknown. But the very fact that the question remains unanswered gave me reason to believe that this compelling fictional character was meant to ultimately triumph. In my opinion, it is this hope that transforms what could have been an abrupt, unsatisfying end into a reason for optimism about the human condition.This book is a spellbinding, persuasive reminder that religious extremism is alive and well, both in the U.S. and in the world at large. If there is any question that the bleak dystopia of Margaret Atwood's imagination could indeed happen in our own community, we need only look at what has happened in the past, what is happening today, and the pattern throughout human existence of history repeating itself.Some readers may see Gilead's tyrannical society and bizarre Bible interpretations as unrealistic. However, it is important to note that the author meticulously researched her novel with supporting documentation proving all of these things have actually occurred in the modern world. And many are still occurring, even in America. As we move closer and closer to a theocracy in this nation, this book should be seen as a road map for what happens when religious extremists get into power. Anyone who reads this book and still votes for any politician who is a religious extremist of ANY ilk is paving the way for this to happen here.This message is delivered in a unique, startlingly real and resonant style, in an intimate narrative that leaves the reader breathless, wanting to rush through to find out what this weirdness is all about, what is going on, and what is going to happen next.One downside to the book is that it was obviously written as a potential future, with the intention that the reader assumes that it occurs not too long from now. The characters still remember \\"normal\\" life before the takeover as something that existed only a few years prior. But since the book was written in the mid-eighties, it now seems somewhat dated. In other words, it is obvious that this future never did happen, as their memories of \\"before\\" are decidedly eighties, missing too many details of current society (i.e. the internet, the dramatic impact of high-tech). This can be a problem with other future dystopias such as Orwell's \\"1984\\" or Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\", but the difference is that in those books, the characters didn't live in the \\"former\\" society and had no memory of it. But if the reader goes into \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" knowing that quirk, it can be overlooked and still remain relevant and resonant."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaids Tale by Margaret Atwood entails a dystopian atmosphere with an emphasis on feminism, but the vague information on how the Republic of Gilead came about, the past lives of the characters, and the disorganized and confusing thoughts of the main character made the novel not enjoyable for me. I am debriefed throughout the novel of how Offred was trained to live in the society, but it would have made more sense if readers were told about what caused the drastic change. I constantly read about Offred's past experiences in her previous lifestyle and family, but the details are vague and the sequence of events are always scattered. I tend to enjoy novels with distinct protagonists, antagonists, and a crisis that has to be solved, changed or endured; The Handmaids Tale does not provide an engaging and exciting story, but only talks about the sad lifestyle of a Handmaid.Throughout the novel, readers are told about Offred's experiences in the Red Center, in the race to escape the clutches of the unknown army, and her transition into the new society called the Republic of Gilead. However, the experiences are told out of order and often confusing on when the events took place, while the actual cause for the change of regime remains unknown. As I read the novel, I felt disappointed that the explanation for the drastic lifestyle change never became known. Insight of the change into Gilead would also give some information about the role of the \\"Angels,\\" \\"Eyes,\\" and the \\"Aunts.\\"Offred spends much of her free time talking about her past lifestyle and her family that was forcefully torn apart. We learned about the start and growth of the relationship with her husband Luke, but we never know the name and description of her child. On pages 176- 178, Offred talks about what she did with her daughter when the change of power was occurring, but never discloses her name or anything about her. It was aggravating to hear so much about her past in vague instances and never any descriptive details on the people or places. What made me unhappy was the fact that Offred never revealed to the readers her real name. On page 270, Offred tells us that she told Nick her real name during one of their intimate encounters, but never actually says it in the text.The Handmaids Tale portrays Offred as the protagonist and the regime in the Republic of Gilead as the antagonist, but no action-filled plot line exists involving them. The novel basically describes the lifestyle of Offred as a Handmaid and never gives any perspective from other characters with different jobs. I would enjoy this novel much more if it contained more than a narration of Offred's day-to-day experiences. The chapters either detail her daily routine or her thoughts and contemplations of her past and current day. The novel was not enjoyable for me because of the lack of suspense and the uninteresting narration of life in the Republic of Gilead.The Handmaids Tale overall did not appeal to me as a reader because of the vague explanations of the change in Offreds lifestyle and her past experiences and family. The plot was not interesting as no apparently captivating action occurred and it was only told from Offred's point of view. This would be enjoyable for people who like feminists novels containing oppression and the ways of dealing with a tough and inhibiting society, and therefore does not attract my attention."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Handmaid's Tale / 0-385-49081-XThis dystopia masterpiece, set in a modern world that rings eerily familiar years after the publication date, describes the daily life and desperation of a woman caught up in a social struggle that she cannot influence.A state of emergency has been declared, the national borders have clamped closed, and martial law rules a country that had previously been open, democratic, and free. Who is the enemy? That isn't always clear. A religious group, perhaps, or terrorists, but maybe the government is lying about the war, who they are fighting, and how it is going. Like the narrator, a prisoner in the country she once loved, we only she what she is allowed to see. In this time of despair, terror, and lower fertility caused by toxic chemicals in the water and air, the majority of citizens are willing to give up their rights in exchange for a fleeting feeling of security and protection.When the state of emergency is declared, a fundamentalist Christian-based sect of the government takes over, using Biblical passages wildly out of context to justify denying basic rights of citizenship to women. Women are no longer allowed to work, hold property, carry money, or read and write. The men - husbands, fathers, and brothers - are given the women's former belongings and are charged with their safety. The new \\"work\\" for women is bearing children, or (for older, infertile, upper-class women) being submissive wives. Divorce is retroactively criminalized, and women in second-marriages are rounded up as criminals and put to work as private sex slaves and baby-incubators, making heirs for the privileged and politically connected. This is the story of one of these women. She tells of her loss of freedom, her sorrow at her husband's death, the pain at having her daughter torn away from her, and the slow mental decay as she sleepwalks through her new life - the endless waiting for nightfall, the humiliation of her \\"work\\" in trying to conceive a child.The story is a work of art, and a masterpiece. The pacing is slow, leisurely, and even. We are gently and carefully walked through the life of a handmaid, we see the horrors and pain, and - like our heroine - we are numbed by it. Shocked, saddened, and pained, yes, but mostly numbed. We see the signs outside the grocery stores with simple pictures only, because reading is illegal for women. We see the slow crawl of days, stripped of freedom, monitored even while she is bathing, lest she attempt suicide. We see the other women, the ones who have accepted their fate and have come to adore their captors and the ones who have rebelled, fought back, and lost their lives dying trying to reclaim what was once there own.Even the epilogue, which Atwood has attached without a word of explanation, is a dash of sharp irony. Against all hope, the diary which we have been reading, written by this abused woman, has been found by later historians. These wise and 'modern' men are entranced by the diary, but not because they care about the horrors this woman has lived through. No, they are not here to 'judge' history, they only want to read her innermost thoughts, open her up, place her in history, date her and sign her and then delegate her to a nice shelf somewhere to quietly rot. Even in death, our lost lady has no name, no identity, no worth in herself, not because she is unimportant, but because the people who have power over her cannot appreciate her worth. Their priorities are wrong, and they can only consume others, without contributing anything worthwhile to society.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In reply to our dear Derrek, i as many of my other class mates throughly enjoyed the novel, it is rare a book you have to study becomes something you would read yourself, this was a pleasent suprise yet to be told those who found the ending fantastic are mindless idiots is not so pleasent... BUT as for the book, engrosing, compelling, frightening, everything that other review-ees have said before. I read many varied novels although i do not consider myself a book worm i read different genres in order to find what i like. BUt i know a lot of other 17 year olds who have never gone beyond FHM or MORE magazine who were cultivated by Atwoods sheer brilliance. Thankyou Derrek, you made 2 period on a Thursday rather entertaining."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read this wonderful novel in 1997 and even then, I drew immediate parallels with the Taliban's treatment of Afghan women. Atwood creates a real man's world, where women are only vessels for babies. Offred (Of FRED--the name of her master), the narrator, is intelligent and observant, but limited to the narrow confines of the life dicated by the new government. She lives her daily life unaware of the fate of her child and tortures herself by wandering by the execution wall to see if any of the new dead could be her precious husband. This novel presents a life unfathomable to Western women, but I think all of us owe it to our less fortunate sisters to read it, and to try to place ourselves in that world, if only for an afternoon."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I think what Margaret Atwood's, The Handmaid's Tale is a foreshadowing to our own futures. In this novel all peronal freedoms are taken from the main character and all the remaining people. I think this is a good representation of what could happen when people stopped participating in the social/political happenings around them. Everyone must make sure that even the smallest freedoms being taken away from them must not be overlooked. We must keep our eyes open and stay active in our surroundings and decisions regarding our lives."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Atwood successfully combines all the elements needed to make a novel worthwhile, great. The structure and plot content complement each other, with the jumbled up paragraphs, seemingly randomly combined, imitating the thoughts going through Offred's mind. The switching between eras also emphasises Offred's thought patterns, her mind drifting between memories. Atwood also uses language, symbolism and detail extraordinarily effectively. all in all, she presents a believable account of the future, linking the Republic of Gilead to Muslim societies and to Nazi Germany and extending modern ideas and opinions, showing how they can be distorted. I've thoroughly enjoyed studying it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is a brilliant novel! Margaret Atwood is successful in leaving her readers shocked, scared, confused and entertained at the very same time. This is a fairly difficult book to read and I do not recommend this book anyone who takes reading lightly. It can be confusing and little details that can be easily overlooked are important to the story. The main character switches between various time periods (her past, present and future) and important information about the story and questions the reader may have throughout the novel, are not revealed until its end. For some people, it may be easy to lose the true meaning and significance of the novel in its confusing and intricate plot. Unlike any other book I have read, The Handmaid's Tale has left a huge impression on me and I am looking forward to reading more of Margaret Atwood's books!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Dystopian novels abound and one might think that The Handmaid's Tale is just another. Written in the tradition of 1984 and Brave New World, Margaret Atwood takes this genre to a new level.While many dystopian novels focus on a far distant future when the past is forgotten, Atwood's Tale focuses on the transition period, the primal generation. Offred, a \\"handmaid\\" in the Republic of Gilead (the former U. S.), remembers what it was like to hold a job, to earn money, to own property, even to read -- all of which have been denied in this \\"modern\\" society.While the former society was imperfect, women were free, valued for the contributions they could make to society. Here they are not \\"free\\" -- they can't travel, gain eduction, etc -- but they are technically \\"free\\" from many of the former problems -- rape, sexual objectification, etc -- and valued now only for their ovaries.Offred is a sympathetic heroine. The story is told in a style reminiscent of stream of consciousness, she is merely thinking her story to herself. The narrative is compelling and the themes are significant. Atwood's style is poetic without being sentimental. All in all, it is a worthy work."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The end had to be the way it was. Its ambiguity kept it from being cheesy (a 'happy' ending) or completely fatalistic/pessimistic (like Orwell did), and so avoided, albeit in a small way, a typical trap of utopic/dystopic literature: being all one way or the other. Its loose ends gave it the further distance of 'History', which always has loose ends. Of course, setting it in History gave the novel another dimension perhaps not completely warranted by the book, but did extend its overall quality of haziness, a limitation of view that echoes and furthers the theme of the narrator's own limited view. Which reminds me: this book should not be dismissed as boring. The pace was meant to be slow, sluggish, sleepy, in step with the narrator's own sluggish, always waiting life. The style reinforces her actual lifestyle (in beautiful language). Those bored with trying to understand Gilead from behind the high wings of a bonnet should take steps that this life never happens to them.(Orwell hated the control of humans by opressive governmental use of technology, Atwood the control of humans by oppressive governmental use of theocratic views of gender (generalization). Both showed the dangers of their respective anathemi (?) in their works. One cannot dismiss either of their concerns, for each is a legitimate (and extreme) danger. Neither book can really replace the other.)I was especially struck by the cultural/historial relativism's dismissal of the suffering in Gilead (in the His. Notes); it makes one a bit more wary towards the postmodern view."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Since September 2003 Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is the novel that I have been fascinated with continually. As part of my current English Literature study on the great modern novels, The Handmaid's Tale was the obvious choice, or so though my teacher. I have just finished the book in class. My teacher told me not to read any further than where we were in class because he wanted us to have a surprising ending, but I can tell you that it was a difficult time trying to resist the temptation to see further developments. In class we look at almost every word that is contained within the book and analyse it further and further, and I have an exam on this book in June. My future in English Literature hangs in the balance with this book!In The Handmaid's Tale, our central character is Offred. The book is set in a post 21-Century dystopian society in which the United States has been destroyed from a nuclear war which obliterated large parts of the world. What remains is a strict and harsh barbaric society called The Republic Of Gilead. She is allowed only one function: to breed. Most of the women died and even most of those who managed to survive are contaminated and therefore can no longer reproduce. The few that can successfully do so are called Handmaids. They must give birth like rabbits to boost the population. Their babies are then handed over to the Wives of the Commanders who run the place. The Handmaid's are dressed in long red cloaks, they do not hold down jobs, must do as they are told and forced to live in strict households. They are tortured if they deviate from the 'correct' way of life and are not allowed freedom of speech - the removal of hooks and glass windows in case of the obvious suicide attempts that would reign throughout is a reminder of the harsh ideology.The Handmaid's Tale is, indeed, not an easy read. It is a difficult book to understand, but then we really aren't meant to. The novel is shrouded in ambiguity and eventual possibilities, which all generate an electric buzz that keeps the reader hanging on, wanting to know what happens to our narrator, Offred. This at times can be extremely frustrating, especially for the casual reader who may give up after just a few chapters. The detail and thought that has gone into this novel makes it a masterpiece in its own right. Atwood uses detail to the max in describing the tumultuous state of mind that Offred experiences throughout her time in the society. In the first few chapters she describes her surroundings and introduces herself.The characters also form a strong and coherent basis on which the novel is built. Serena Joy is the leader of the group. She is an evil and cold-hearted woman who is desperate for Offred to get pregnant so she can have a child of her own. Moria is the novel's hero. She is rebellious, she objects the system and doesn't care what happens to her if she strays from it. She is Offred's hero and keeps her sane throughout bleak times when suicide is a viable option. Moira's presence in the novel is extremely ambiguous and her downfall towards the end of the novel is genius. Cora, Rita and Nick also have minor roles, but in the end we get to see the bigger picture. The Aunts are like the officials of the household, strolling around with their cattleprods hung from thongs. Janine is perhaps the novel's greatest character in terms of ingenuity. She is a firm believer in the system and is the object to which all other Handmaid's fear becoming. In Chapter 13 we witness a meeting between the Handmaid's and the Aunts. Janine tells the story of being gang-raped aged 14, to which the Aunts yell at her, \\"But whose fault was it?\\" The rest of the brain-washed Handmaids chant, \\"Her fault, her fault, her fault!\\" It's a terrible scenario to be in, but a week later Janine believes what was being said and admits it was her fault.The high points in this novel include Offred's first-ever sex scene with the Commander in Chapter 16. The chapter is a purely comical look at stereotypical sex scenes. The shocking and violent language works in contrast with the humorous dialogue and avoids, in this moment completely, falling into the trap of being labelled simply another feminist novel. The outing in Chapter 36, the savage scenes in Chapter 43, Janine's birth scene in Chapter 21 is superbly crafted and Offred's meetings with the Commander throughout are true moments of intimacy which she craves so badly. She doesn't know where her husband Luke from the time before is, nor her daughter. She misses them incredibly, but pushes them to the back of mind because she knows dwelling on them would drag her to the jaws of suicide, and she doesn't want that. She believes in escapism, in a better world - she has the hope and her temporary loss of it in frequent situations makes this a gripping read.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10I have to say that The Handmaid's Tale is simply one of the greatest books I have ever read. Some people dislike it - fair enough, but I really think that anyone with an open mind and an eye for fantastic, jaw-dropping and thought-provoking novels should pick up a copy of this. If I wasn't limited to the length of this review, I would carry on for hours and hours about the genius of the novel and the way in which it is an important tool in modern day society, but I can't. However, all I will say is that this is an awesome book that I'm enthralled with. I hope you feel the same."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I, like many other of the reviewers, had read this book for the first time back in high school and it blew my mind. In the good old 90's, it seemed like simply a very well written, if slightly over the top, cautionary tale. Now after see how many of our civil liberties have been taken away, how many insurance companies refuse to cover birth control even for married couples, pharmacies refusing to fill birth control prescriptions, and how even some mainstream Christian speakers are proclaiming how women need to fill no other role besides wives and mothers (forever obedient to the male figure in their lives), this novel literally seems to becoming true. Anyone who thinks this novel is Christian bashing needs to actually read his Bible: the only real difference between Iran and Falwell's American dream is one less prophet. This book shows what life would be like when everything must be done according to the Bible (hint: it ain't pretty). After reading this, anyone (but especially women) should be scared and galvinized to make certain that this doesn't happen. Remember, the citizens in this story lost their human rights much in the same way as the Jews under the Nazis: very slowly and a little at a time until they finally woke up in a living hell. Read this magnificant book and don't allow it to happen here!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Back in the late 1980's, I read that Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale produced differing reactions in different countries. In Great Britain, the reaction was \\"Ripping good tale,\\" in Canada, it was \\"Could that happen here?\\" and in the United States, it was \\"How long have we got?\\"I remember seeing the paperback adjacent to the checkstand at the supermarket for several months before I picked it up and read the blurb on the back cover. I had no idea that the novel painted a picture of what the United States of America might become if fundamentalist Christians took over the government, but that is exactly what the novel does. It is both a fascinating and frightening picture. It was my first experience of Atwood's writing and I'm happy to report that, having read more of her work, she's an excellent writer. Her prose is clear, concise and engaging. Reading one sentence made me want to read the next and her books are very difficult to put down. In this particular case, the plot is brilliantly conceived as is the entire premise of the book.18 years have elapsed since publication, and the chilling picture she painted is still every bit as chilling as it was, perhaps even more so because politicians have been capitulating to the \\"religious right\\" more and more.I highly recommend his novel. It's one of the most important works of fiction written during my lifetime that I've encountered. It's also one of the most readable and engaging books I've read.Because Margaret Atwood is a Canadian, I think her viewpoint enabled her to postulate a fictional future for the United States that a U.S. citizen might not have been able to see. Robert Heinlein once wrote a short novel called If This Goes On which reminds me in many ways of The Handmaid's Tale, but it didn't have the scope or the relevance of Atwood's novel nor did the author have the same motivation stemming from the present political reality.Don't bother with the film adaptation, by the way. The movie so dilutes the story conveyed in the book - it is subjected to inexplicable changes that render it comparatively insipid - that it is not worth the viewing time. If you do watch the movie version, do yourself a favor and read the book first so you will know what's been omitted and what's been altered.Atwood gets my highest rating for The Handmaid's Tale."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I came upon this book at Waldenbooks about a couple of weekends ago, and I decided to look at it. I haven't read the entire book, but what I did read was truly horrifying. The story takes place in a future where women have been robbed of their rights. They can't hold jobs, have their own money or property, have their own names, and they're no longer allowed to read. They have been reduced to the role of babymakers--literally. The reason for this is that the United States, which is now known as the Republic of Gilead, has been destroyed by a nuclear war. As a result, most of the female population has been rendered infertile. The few who are still fertile are indoctrinated into becoming handmaids, women whose sole purpose in life is, literally, to make babies. They are then shipped off to affluent households to produce children for couples who are unable to have any of their own. The handmaids who, after three tries, don't produce offspring are sent off to the colonies to clean up nuclear waste and are labeled &quot;unwomen.&quot;This scenario is truly terrifying, but it can also make one feel lucky for what we have in today's society. I feel lucky to live in a society where women are valued for more than just bearing children; where women are women, whether they have had babies or not; where women have their own names; and where women are allowed to work, have their own property, read, and get educated.It is scary to think that a scenario like this could happen in our country. Hopefully, it never will-- not if we don't let it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book makes me grateful to be living here and now. It also makes me concerned about what could happen even in the United States under the right circumstances. Most people wouldn't worry about the United States actually turning into Gilead (where national security concerns prompoted religion to control the government and restrictions on education and information), but I do realize that it takes work to maintain the current level of freedom.My only issue with this novel is that the story ended unresolved. Perhaps that wouldn't bother you, but I wish I hadn't been left hanging."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I'll start off this review by saying I love reading dystopian novels. I also don't mind stream of consciousness writing, which is the style used in this book. However, while Atwood had a very good concept for a novel, it was poorly, poorly executed. In this American future, society has been based around the Bible story in which a handmaid is impregnated by a husband whose wife cannot conceive. Every woman in this new society has a very specific role, and none of it is very interesting. Thus, following our protagonist Offred, a handmaid, through her relatively boring life becomes excruciatingly painful in its banality. Offred's continuous bounce back and forth from reality to her memories make for a very confusing read with a lot of attempts at insightful prose. There is so much fluff and so little plot line in this novel, that about halfway through I began skipping all her recollections and half-page long descriptions of the garden just get to the meat of the story. It was passages like this that made me want to shake Offred:\\"The Commander is the head of the household. The house is what he holds. To have and told hold, till death do us part. The hold of a ship. Hollow.\\"And also a lot of:\\"Here's what I like to tell.\\"\\"This is the story then.\\"\\"Here is how it goes.\\"Not to mention an entire passage about her encounter character, just to have her say, \\"I made that up. It didn't happen that way. Here is what happened,\\" and the whole situation is repeated again.Sadly, I really, really wanted to like this book. I'd heard so many great things about it, but in the end, between the author's choppy prose, no explanation of how society could go from normal to extreme without any opposition, and a completely unsatisfying ending, I could not convince myself to like something this terrible."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Dystopian fiction is most powerful when it reflects fears about what could really happen. The more likely such a future is, the more terrifying the story. As such, there is perhaps no better time than now to read Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale.The Handmaid's Tale takes place during an unspecified time in the future, after the former United States has been replaced by the theocratic Republic of Gilead after a coup. Every part of society is aligned with the official doctrine, none moreso than the place of women. Women are assigned to color-coded classes based on their reproductive status and usefulness to society. The blue Wives, married to Commanders of the Republic, are the highest class, the green Marthas are domestic servants, and the brown Aunts enforce orthodoxy. The red Handmaids are fertile women assigned to Commanders and Wives who are unable to have children of their own due to the widespread drop in fertility attributed to environmental damage, their task being to stand in for the Wives, then hand any resulting children over to the Wives to be raised, as occurs in several stories from the Book of Genesis. No women are allowed to work outside the home or have money, and few are allowed to read.The title character is Offred (\\"Of Fred\\"), a Handmaid assigned to a high-ranking Commander. She is of the first generation of women to be made a Handmaid following the rise of Gilead. In her pre-Gilead life, she was a college graduate with a job, a husband, and a child. Offred struggles to keep some sense of herself alive after everything she was has been stripped from her. In the new society, her only function is procreation.The narrative follows Offred's assignment at her present Commander's household. Offred relates her story, which at first sticks to the routine of her duties. However, it doesn't take long before complications arise. A fellow Handmaid tells her of a resistance, and those in charge of enforcing orthodoxy have the same failings they did before Gilead, entangling Offred in dangerous activities. Interspersed with the current events are Offred's recollections. She tells the reader about her previous life, about how the Republic of Gilead came to be, of her experiences being indoctrinated as a Handmaid, and of the fates of those she knew from before.It's a sad, gripping story, watching Offred try to keep what control of her life she can, hearing how this situation came to be, inch by inch until it was too late to escape. The narrative technique used by Atwood is powerful, as it keeps us in Offred's head at all times, almost trapped with her in her prison of red. Often times, we can't be sure what's real, as Offred herself is unsure, can't remember, never knew. But that sense of oppression always remains.I've read several dystopian novels before, and The Handmaid's Tale is as good as any of them. I'd absolutely rank it right next to Orwell's 1984. Atwood and Orwell speculate on different origins and methods of dystopian oppression, but both are powerful, frightening, and too-often accurate.With the political debate surrounding reproductive rights in the United States in 2012, The Handmaid's Tale is more important than ever. This book is Atwood's warning to us. This novel needs to be read. It needs to remain a warning, and not become prophecy. I can't recommend The Handmaid's Tale highly enough."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Told in first person, the story strayed quite often with inner thinking that appeared to ramble and was sometimes random. Flashbacks came without transitioning or warning. It was an interesting idea for a novel; the plot was just a little slow moving for my taste. Most importantly though, the ending just left me hanging, which compels me to take away one more star. =("},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I have read &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; a number of times, both in English original and in Croatian translation (a pretty good one). First time I read it, it was because I have found it in a library of a Women's Study Centre in Zagreb, Croatia, so I expected it to be &quot;feminist literature&quot;, and was therefore a bit cautious about it, thinking it would be some kind of pamphlet for women's liberation. Of course, I did not know anything about Margaret Atwood back then. First thing this book taught me is that M. Atwood is, above all, a great author, and that &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; is a piece of plain good literature.The somewhat circular narrative centres around and is being told from the perspective of Offred, a woman living in Republic of Gilead, the dystopian, future theocracy established on the teritory of today's United States of America. Gilead's government is organized by a group of very specific religious fanatics, basing their theology on a couple of chapters from the Old Testament, specifically the story about Sarah, Abraham's wife, who could not bear children, and therefore had given Abraham her handmaid, Hagar, to concieve children with her. Also written in that chapter is God's command to Hagar to completely submit to her mistress, and Abraham's observation that Sarah is to do whatever she pleases with her handmaid.That is the point from which the treatment of handmaids is derived in the Republic of Gilead. As the increasingly polluted land caused infertility withing majority of women, the fertile ones, especially those who have been either married to divorced men (theocracy of Gilead does not recognize divorce), or single, but not virgins, are taken as &quot;handmaids&quot; to be awarded to high ranking families without children.Offred has been given to the family of The Commander, one of the highest ranking officials of Gilead, married to Serena Joy, a bitter and slightly desillusioned fanatic. Her narrative focuses on describing daily routines in their household, her experiences and her memories of a past, normal life, with a husband and a daughter.Apart from political description of Gilead's ideology (which is given masterfully, without unneccessary and boring descriptions, yet with frightening details), the main value of this book lies in Offred's introspection. She is a person completely determined by her biological function as a woman and a child-bearer, completely deprived of any other individual merrits or rights. The way Offred deals with that is beautifully portrayed; sometimes in a flow that resembles free-association (&quot;It's strange now, to think about having a job. Job. It's a funny word. It's a job for a man. Do a jobbie, they'd say to children, when they were being toilet-trained. Or of dogs: he did a job on the carpet...The Book of Job.&quot;), sometimes completely ripped-off of any emotions, yet almost physically hurtful with recognition and fear of it possibly coming true.Granted, Margaret Atwood did write about a woman deprived of her rights in a male-dominated world here, but I don't believe it is a feminist pamphlet. It's a book about human condition, as any other good book; talking about what people are capable of doing, good or bad.Another note. This, of course, is a speculative fiction, a dystopian one, like Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; or Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. However, I have heard many people say that this one is the least probable one in terms of ever becoming a reality, and therefore fruitless in its message. To these people, I would recommend reading some news from Afghanistan, since Talibans took over."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"&quot;I wish this story were different. I wish it were more civilized. I wish it showed me in a better light, if not happiness, then at least more active.&quot; So says master writer Margaret Atwood regarding her tour de force, The Handmaid's Tale. Set in the present-day Massachusetts of the future, Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is the chilling portrayal of a totalitarian society as told through the eyes of a Handmaid named Offred. Offred, who can remember the time when she had a home, a husband and a daughter, now serves as a &quot;birth vessel&quot; and is valued only for her powers of reproduction.Offred (her name was derived from &quot;of&quot; and the name of her own Commander, &quot;Fred&quot;) is forced to live her life in a new dictatorship called the Republic of Gilead. Offred is allowed to leave her Commander's home only once each day; her freedom, like that of other ordinary civilians, has been stripped from her and she exists at the mercy of the heads of state who are known as the Commanders.The Republic of Gilead, however, is a society in the midst of crisis. Its land and atmosphere have been polluted by nuclear waste and all but a handful of the population has been rendered barren. Those infertile women, women who will never, or never again, reproduce, are known as &quot;Unwomen,&quot; and are sent to the Colonies where they must toil as laborers with no privileges, working to clean up the nuclear waste. The only exceptions are the infertile Wives of the Commanders. Women lucky enough to still retain their fertility, like Offred, are considered a treasured &quot;object&quot; of society and one whose role is to bear children for the Wives of the Commanders who cannot. In the Republic of Gilead they have a saying, &quot;There's no such thing as a sterile man...there are only women who are barren.&quot; Offred, though, knows that in this nuclear aftermath, sterile men do, indeed, exist, and so she prays for a baby; not a baby that she, herself, wants to love, but one that will keep her from the dreaded fate of the &quot;Unwomen.&quot;Many of the events in The Handmaid's Tale are derived from the biblical story of Leah and Rachel and Atwood has chosen to use many biblical names throughout the book. There are Handmaids and Marthas, Angels and Guardians and many others.The Handmaid's Tale is written in Atwood's masterful prose but this is not a linear tale. Be prepared to drop back in time, then flash forward, then drop back again. The writing, though, flows effortlessly and Atwood, as always, manages to keep readers riveted to the page.Although many people might feel that The Handmaid's Tale is too futuristic to be plausible, many of the events depicted have happened or are happening somewhere in the world at this very moment. It doesn't take more than a few minutes to recall places where gender discrimination and human rights have all but been stripped away. Atwood, herself, said, &quot;One of the things I avoided doing was describing anything in the novel that didn't happen in this world.&quot;Chilling, moving, vivid, terrifying and sometimes even humorous, The Handmaid's Tale is a profoundly moral story. It is a true masterpiece of power and grace that will someday attain the status of a classic."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale - by Margaret AtwoodTHE HANDMAID'S TALE is a frightening look at a not too distant future where sterility is the norm, and fertile woman are treated as cattle, to produce children for the upper class who cannot have any.

Once a month she is tested by a gynecologist to ensure that she is healthy, and then is taken to the Commander and his wife in the hopes of becoming pregnant.Offred, along with the other handmaid's, are not allowed to look directly at anyone else. They all wear the same outfits; red long dresses and headgear that cover their bodies. They live together, spend most of their time together, and are taken care of, in the hopes that they will produce children for this barren society. In this society, most women are not allowed to read, and are treated as if they have no minds. The government dictates their role in society. If they disobey, they are punished severely.Offred's memories often go back to a time when she was happily married to Luke, and with their daughter they were looking forward to a long and happy life together. Things changed when a military group took over the government, and immediately their lives as they knew it were over. Women lost all rights to ownership; bank accounts were frozen, land was taken away; fertile women were taken away from their husbands and families. A handful of older women were made into \`Aunts', and their duties were to instruct and guide the handmaids, reminding them of their role on this earth, which is to procreate.I have to say that my feelings during this book were of shock. In some sense, what has happened in this book has already happened in other parts of the world and can happen again. The control over women is very much like that of the women in Afghanistan. The control over religious choice brings to mind Nazi Germany, as one of the issues in the Handmaid's Tale is the elimination of anyone that refuses to be as one with the new government - religious persecution is justified and encouraged.The Handmaid's Tale is a horrifying story of a government fully in control of each person's life and totally out of control. The book was so riveting that it took me only one day to read. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is the story of Offred, one of the few fertile women left in the Republic of Gilead, a dystopia at its worst. Toxic waste has left population levels dangerously low and religious leaders have taken control of the country, using desperate measures to repopulate the Earth. Offred is one of the many &quot;handmaids&quot; who are forced to live with a commander and trys to conceive a child with him once a month. The book chronicles Offred's life as she is living with Commander Fred (hence &quot;Of Fred&quot;). Atwood wrote this novel at a time when there was the possibility of religious leaders establishing a theocracy. She portrays the havoc that can come about when a democracy loses its control over the people. Atwood does this extremely effectively. Since the whole book is through Offred's eyes, the one-person limited view point makes you use your imagination to fill in the gaps left by her lack of knowledge. The book isn't so extreme that it's unbelievable and is so descriptively written that it almost feels as if it the events already happened in history. It was truly a great read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I had this book on my bookshelf for three years before I finally decided to read it. Now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long! The Handmaid's Tale is awesome and it has completed my favorites list of 2002. Highly recommended.Margaret Atwood's story is set in the future after the United States has undergone a nuclear war and the government has been destroyed. In place now is a strict and dangerous political scene, where any type of crime can result in an execution and a public hanging on The Wall. Not only that, but women are made secondhand citizens and are no longer able to hold jobs, make money, read or write.The Handmaid's Tale is told through the eyes of Offred in the former state of Massachusets, now called the Republic of Gilead. Offred is a Handmaid, or a surrogate mother of sorts, who is appointed to an infertile couple in order to get pregnant and help boost the population. However, it isn't as easy as that since the only legal way to get pregnant is the old-fashioned way, which causes jealousy and tension throughout the household. And with the rigorous government, Offred isn't allowed to complain or refuse unless she wants to be shipped off to clean up toxic nuclear waste for the rest of her life.I absolutely loved this book and will recommend it to all my book friends. The Handmaid's Tale is the perfect book for book clubs as it will evoke numerous discussions on feminism, nuclear war, radical government policies, slavery, etc. Margaret Atwood poses the question of &quot;what if?&quot; and one can only hope that this tale remains fiction. Excellent, thought-provoking, fascinating and heart-pounding -- this novel will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I really enjoyed this novel. But, if you aren't able to enjoy non-linear narratives, don't read this book. In this memoir of a woman living in the not-too-distant future. A time where the Christian right rules. The Handmaid (Offred) is basically leased to a high-ranking family for the use of her reproductive system. I really enjoyed how the parallel between the religious society in the story with fundamentalist muslim religion. Those who don't believe that the Handmaid's Tale could ever happen, fail to see it happening today in many places throughout the world - Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc. I think that readers really miss the point when they get stuck on the fact that this story takes place in the future. Keeping in mind that in some countries, women are not allowed to own realty, have bank accounts, must cover their heads and faces, cannot go out in public without a male escort, are not allowed to drive, and cannot become educated or become employed outside of the home, I was reminded of how greatful I should be that I do not live in a country where I would be a handmaid, wife, aunt, or domestic.As like in real life, the characters in this story are all so real; everyone has an agenda, has something to hide, yearns for personal contact, status, and power. It is women who are used to control women and men still break the rules that they themselves created. Humanbeings will risk their lives to fulfill their desires."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I could probably make a case for the implausibility of the concept that the book puts forward, but only if I got specific, the situation where people (men or women) are used as merely property and not allowed to have any rights of their own still happens all over the world, whether you like it or not. Ms. Atwood is too smart to try and predict what the future might bring, instead she merely illustrates what happens when you stop regarding people as people, when rights of a few take precedence over the rights of everyone else (for the sake of expediency, alas). In this wacky world, women aren't allowed to read or write due to an ultra-Christian (?) (they quote from the Bible) takeover of the country. Women are divided into Aunts, Marthas, Wives and of course the Handmaiden's, who exist to have children and are given to various Commanders to try and make kids. The novel concerns itself with the story of Offred (Of Fred) and it flips back and forth between her life before the takeover, during her education in those dark days before the present time and her current life as a Handmaiden. Atwood protrays all of this in very poetic language, the words she chooses are sometimes breaktaking, but mostly it's in the images she puts forward and in the general aura that the novel is given. There's a sense of inevitable helplessness, Offred isn't going to change the world by herself and the world isn't going to change in the next day, she realizes that and still wants to fight but isn't sure how. The flashbacks are all rendered quite nicely, and given the right sense of eerie timelessness. The story is never given a date so it could happen anytime but the point illustrated is more important than the details. Some might find her a bit too immersed in the concept, the story tends to float blissfully along but she never gets preachy and even though has the country taken over by an orthodox Christian group, she's not bashing Christainity, just about any religion has buried in it somewhere the same primitive attitudes about women. But for me, it's about more than women, it's about people and what happens when all of a sudden people are property, how it dehumanizes everyone, even as you try to remain as human as you can. A fine story, with the people brought vividly to life, warts and all, and one gives one pause to think. Also, don't skip the historical section in the back, it's a bit wordy and academic and doesn't really explain the cliffhanger ending any better, but gives a better glimpse in everything. All it takes is a little perspective, I guess."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Experiencing a world that people can only imagine was a feeling brought forth when experiencing this fine novel. Set in a new world called Gilead (once the US), Margaret Atwood portrays a society run by men, with women as subservient creatures. This novel is a fictional journal of a girl named Offred (pronounced Of-Fred). Offred is a handmaid in Gilead who becomes an unhuman figure of her Commander, Fred. This novel brings insight into what a world would be like if ran by men and left in the hands of men. Most people, including myself, would consider this novel a feminist novel, although, Margaret Atwood contributes numerous other style elements. Incorporated into this novel includes themes of self-knowledge and a presence of gothic imagery of the way the government controls womens lives. In this new society there are classes of women. No longer are women equal. They are divided into the Handmaid's, there purpose is only to create new humans; Martha's, the maid's of the houses; Aunt's, teachers and in charge of Handmaid's; and Wives, they are married to the Commander's and basically sit at home doing nothing. The men also have ranks, yet all of them over-power the women. In this novel, every page thats read wants you wanting more and I can turthfully say that whoever reads this will not want to put the book down. The reader will experience the day to day life of the main character Offred. It's as if you are really there experiencing it. The vivid descriptions of the house she lives in and the way she describes the city paints numerous pictures in the readers mind. In this novel, you will experience different characters, such as Nick, Ofglen, The Wife, and The Commander, which are emanate objects in Offred's life. The descriptions of these characters are wonderfully written. Motifs of flowers and nature make the reader feel comfortable and at home, while the motifs of dark colors and wilting flowers makes the book even more intense, if thats even possible. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good reading and likes such books as &quot;Brave New World&quot; or &quot;1984&quot; or even if they enjoy books that show courageous women struggling to live in a twisted world. It is said that Margaret Atwood wrote this book to convey a satirical message of a subservient world where women do not have the right to read, write, vote, hold jobs, or do anything thats commen in our world today. Some might say that this book is patterned after a Puritan world. Although the women have no place but in the home in this novel, they are protected from such evils and the secular world that once was, since anything secular was demolished. A perfect world is what the men in Gilead had hoped to create, did they succeed? Did Offred gain her freedom? Well, i guess you'll just have to read &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; to find out. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"When I first picked up this book in grade eleven, I hated it. I thought it had a slow start, and that it was very unrealistic. I couldn't wait to put it down. However, as I got deeper into the plot of A Handmaid's Tale , I couldn't stop reading it. I grew attached to the main character Offred, and I was so disturbed by the conditions she lived under, even though it could really happen. It was so sad that she was taken away from her family to be a carrier of a man's child whose wife could not bear children. She accepted that. It was devastating that the things we take for granted now, brought her happiness, such as magazines, body lotion and even a simple board game. Throughout the book I wondered many times if this sort of dystopia could actually happen. Would women be oppressed, would they be under man's power again? Could society advance and yet revert back centuries? It is very possible.I thought Margaret Atwood did a wonderful job at portraying the city of Gilead, and even though I did not read the Historical Notes which could have given me a better understanding of The Handmaid's Tale, I thought it was exceptionally well written and a must read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This novel belongs within the pantheon of dystopian fiction, along with Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World. Anyone curious about what kind of world Christian fundamentalists envision, or some of the reforms that social conservatives want to introduce to the United States need to read this book and imagine the slippery slope that can lead to world that Margaret Atwood depicts. It's no accident that Planned Parenthood and the funding of birth control is a major issue for the Republicans despite the fact that economics are clearly the most important issue for the next election. A brilliant novel that will make you think. If you have teenage daughter, encourage them to read it and then talk about it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Although parts of this book were disturbing to me, as a whole I really loved it! A very different approach to the whole feminist idea. I loved that you had no idea what was going to happen next. Full of surprises and good writing."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In The Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Atwood created a dystopian society after a sudden war over religions, originated from the fundamental actions in the 1980s when religion pressed into politics. In a seemingly simple and highly restricted fictional society, Atwood took many possible scenarios to extreme to back up its faulty appearance with complexity. In addition, she incorporated many themes into this novel, such as feminism, religions, and politics, giving the readers multiple aspects to focus on.Uniquely, Atwood used the voice of a Handmaid, who belong to the bottom end of the society with minimal freedom, to narrate the story. One might argue with the limited information and points of view available to readers, but this technique gives Atwood the ability to go behind the scene of this extreme, sexist society and reveal its ugliness. Although the atmosphere of the setting is serious and filled with fear, Atwood extensively used ironies throughout Handmaid Offred's narration. The language can be criticized for its crudeness, but it effectively creates the kind of business-like and emotionless feeling. The first person narrative voice also forms a more intimate connection between narrator and the readers and it evokes sympathy from the readers for the injustice this dystopian society does to women in general. Atwood provides more than adequate information through Offred's personal flashbacks for comparison between the current Republic of Gilead and the pre-Gileadean period.Structurally, the text is divided into fifteen chapters with a futuristic presentation on the republic at the end. All the odd number chapters except one are called \\"night\\", where the Handmaids can only lie in their beds and make no noise. The even number chapters in the first half of the book narrates the Handmaid's duty in the day when they are most \\"active\\" with lots of concrete details. Ironically, Offred's characters develops more quickly and completely at night when her physical freedom are striped away, but she has nothing else to do than thinking which Gilead has not yet taken control of. Through her memory flashbacks, comments on incidents around her at the time, and various violations of the laws, her character expands toward a rounded and dynamic protagonist.Although the male has most of the power in this society, Offred is the only person given personalities, providing a strong feminine factor to the novel. Atwood treated both sex quite fairly. Males are ultimately sex machines and women are walking wombs. As a feminist novel in a dystopian setting, no male appears truly evil. Instead of depicting them as control freaks, Atwood portraits more of their humane sides. The \\"Aunts\\" acting as tools of the regime for the oppressed women contribute to the sexual balance.The ending of the book seems too much like the Dues ex Machina in classical Greek plays. It actually further demonstrates the complex relationship between parties and individuals. It also removes some of the depressing darkness created by the dystopia. Overall, this novel gives the reader a different reading experience than most other books."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In Atwood's near future, a revolution has turned the United States into Gilead, and some number of mostly unnamed things have caused the birth rate to go down significantly. As a result, powerful men get not only Wives but Marthas (cooks and housekeepers) as well as Handmaids, whose job it is to procreate on behalf of the Wives. Unsurprisingly, not everyone is happy with the new world order, and one of them has managed to write about it for posterity.This is a classic in the dystopian novel genre for good reason, along with Brave New World and 1984, which are often read in literature classes, although the fact that much of the plot revolves around the society's sexual practices make this thoughtful and thought provoking novel appropriate for a slightly older audience."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Handmaids are a class of women who are hoped to be fertile in a stark and creepily crafted future world, where infertility has become rampant. This novel echos problems beginning to arise in our present society: increasing government control over daily life, powerful homeland security obeying a law of its own and control over women backed by religious-based laws that become eerily muslim-like. The story follows the uncomfortable and seemingly hopeless existence of a woman previously married, but now farmed out as a surrogate and sex slave to a wealthy and well connected couple. We see the progression of her entrapment through flashbacks: her first inkling that something is wrong when her credit account is signed over to her husband. Then a woman in a store tries to steal her child. Atwood beautifully describes the condition of a frog failing to hop out of a slowly warming beaker.This book is a good read, and a classic for our times."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I picked up The Handmaid's Tale on an impulse. Up to this point, I hadn't read anything by Margaret Atwood, but I know some people love her books and I feel like I see The Blind Assassin in every used book store I go into, so I thought I'd give her a shot.How to describe this book? At the lowest common denominator, it's a novel, but beyond that I don't know how to classify it. It's kind of historical fiction despite being set in the future. It feels like it has a bit of a sci-fi twist even though the characters are a living a medieval life in some ways. There's a clear feminist bent to the story, but I wouldn't call it a treatise or manifesto. The Handmaid's Tale just does not fit neatly into any one category.In line with my inability to classify this book, after finishing it, I'm still not quite sure how I feel about it. The story is set in the United States, vaguely in the future, after some kind of religious coup d'&eacute;tat. The U.S. is struggling with an infertility epidemic and women's rights as equal citizens have been completely stripped away and replaced with very strict roles related to childbearing. Every woman is forced into one of the following categories:- Econo-wives: Poor or lower class women. They don't play a large part in the story.- Commanders' wives: Women married to high-ranking military/religious figures. Typically infertile and forced to welcome Handmaids into their homes in the hopes of having a child.- Aunts: Responsible for \\"raising\\" the Handmaids to understand their roles and the insane rituals they participate in.- Handmaids: The child-bearers. Forced to have sex with the Commanders in a very ritualized way in an attempt to bear children. Any children they have are not considered their own, but the children of the Commander and his wife. Dress all in red (to signify fertility).- Marthas: Servants.- Residents of the colonies: Women who can't or won't serve in any of the above roles. Typically responsible for cleaning up toxic waste and usually die within a few months of arriving in the colonies. Again, not a huge part of the story, but being shipped off to the colonies is a lingering threat for all women.The Handmaid's Tale takes place in Gilead, where the society is structured around this need to have children, but in a weirdly Biblical-slash-militant way. Entire rituals are devised around a single story or line from the Bible, yet there is nothing Christian about the way the society operates (note the role of women mentioned above). In the middle of all this is Offred, the handmaid of The Handmaid's Tale. The story is told from her perspective as a handmaid who needs to get pregnant or face deportation to the colonies. Offred used to have what we would call a normal life - a husband, a job, a daughter, her own money, friends, books - but now she exists for the singular purpose of getting impregnated by the Commander. Offred's narrative flips between her current life as a handmaid and everything she remembers from her earlier, normal life. She does what she needs to do, but hasn't bought into the premise behind life in Gilead like some of the other handmaids.I can't say I enjoyed this book, but I still found it interesting and I'm glad I read it. It definitely made me think and even thought it was written in the 80's, a number of Atwood's points about the environment, women, power, and technology are still relevant. However, The Handmaid's Tale mostly just left me feeling unsettled. I realize this isn't a ringing endorsement for the book, but I kind of think that was the point. Atwood made Gilead so extreme in order to make her readers to think about the roles of women, the impact of paternalism, and how religion can permeate a secular society. Like I said, hard to classify - Atwood hits a number of point in a relatively compact story - but does so without beating you over the head with them.In a nutshell: More than a novel, but not quite a treatise. An interesting but unsettling story. THree stars."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" in my English intensive course at school. Though, I usually wanted to read another book, since our teacher gave us the opportunity to choose from several proposes of her, I was pretty asthonised that the book was yet so interesting and also easy to read for a non native speaker. Nevertheless, I notized from the opinions of some guys in my class that the novel is more likely to be a book for women, because it treats issues like pregnance, suppression of women, patricharchial systems etc. which some were not as interested in. But on the other side, there were also a few of them who liked \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\", as it also treates about totalitarian regimes and suppression. Personally, I didn't like the middle part of the book, because it is more boring than the rest, with few action, but mostly descriptions of the handmaid'd feelings and thoughts. Another part I disliked was the chapter where the ceremony is discribed. It is a very disgusting and unhuman act. All in all, the novel has its highs and lows, but I would recommend it to all, who like dystopian novels, like \\"Brave New World\\" by Aldous Huxley."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Offred is a handmaiden. What does that mean? It means she has been given the societal role of surrogate mother. She is not past her child bearing years and has had a healthy child in the past and is now expected to do so again- for society. Some un-named disease or mutation has caused a lack of reproduction among humankind. Each society deals with this effect differently, but we only get to see how it's dealt with in North America. A new society is created where they look back in time for protection. Reading is outlawed to all but an elite few. Estates with servants are recreated. An oligarchy is created wherein its own citizens are turned into accomplices for the injustices brought against them. A twisted version of the bible is used as the rule book. And handmaidens are used in the style of Sarah's handmaiden, Hagar, in order for these elite to beget children. Offred (who's possessive title actually breaks down to of Fred, who is the commander whom she is the handmaiden for, we never learn her real name), tells us her story in the first person, conveying her sense of malaise and hopelessness at her own situation.When reading the reviews for this book, one word kept jumping out at me- Dystopia. The clearest definition of this word I found was \\"a society characterized by human misery, as squalor, oppression, disease, and overcrowding.\\" I have to say I don't really think this definition fits this book. People did not seem to be in squalor, there did not seem to be disease or overcrowding. Yes, there was human misery and oppression (as there is in every society), but we only saw the society through the eyes of one person. Was Offred miserable? I'm not even sure about that. She seemed to be at the beginning,b ut she also seemed to be complacent about the role she had been given in the society and by the end of the book, she'd carved out her own niche. Once she found that niche, she seemed to not mind the oppression. She seemed perfectly content to do as she was told and not question; let others make the decisions for her. Right up to the end. As much as I enjoyed this book, I had trouble feeling truly sorry for Offred as she seemed so complacent in what happened to her in her life. She seemed complacent even in her flashback stories.One thing that bothered me reading this book, perhaps more than it should have was that Atwood placed it in the U.S. and made Canada the golden land people tried to escape to. This didn't bother me because I felt the U.S. shouldn't be the bad guy or Canada the good guy. It bothered me because Atwood is so clearly from Canada and it shows through in her writing, her phrasing, her use of slang and references to common items. I felt I might have been more inclined to be sucked into this world if I hadn't had to keep stopping and re-reading something and thinking \\"that's not what it's called/how it's referred to in America.\\" That would snap me out of the story and I'd have to fight back in. And it was a fight to let myself be fully caught up in this book. It's one of those books written with the intention of horrifying you, which by itself makes it difficult to get caught up in. This also speaks to the books credit, the fact that in the end I DID get fully caught up in this book despite the revulsion it illicit in its readers towards that form of society is a testament to its strength.I look forward to reading Oryx and Crank to see if she approaches this society from a different viewpoint. I felt it was sad that I did not get to understand at all the viewpoints of the Marthas or the servants such as Nick or the Guardians or even the Wives."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I received the CD very promptly.

Without warning the reader is thrown into a totally different environment including time, state and - most important- society. Women are controlled by men, they don't even have the right to go down the streets by themselves and are there only to reproduce children.The protagonist of this novel is a woman named Offred. She tells the story- her story. How her world and life have changed after the president's assassination and a very new governmental system was established. As a result she lost her job and her family, she was put into a so called 'Red Centre' to become a handmaid like many other women whose only purpose was to be impregnated by their commanders.The subject of this story is very frightening in my opinion. The author based this novel on facts from the present or the past, so that there is the real possibility of this society coming true. Hopefully it never will!At first it was hard to figure out what this book is about and the many shifts from past to present make it difficult not to get confused.. A few descriptive scenes were really disgusting to me but make you feel sympathy with the protagonist.Once I got used to the style and the way the story is presented it was exciting to read to the end.(Finnja)Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaids Tale\\"is a very good book to show how a world could be, if it's controlled by only one gender.The young Handmaid Offred lives in the totalitarian state Gilead, which is controlled by men.She lives in the household of the Commander Fred and his wife Serena. Offred is only accepted because she can give birth to children. On the one hand having a child is a kind of status symbol for the wives and on the other hand Gilead needs children after an atomic accident. The children should be conceived in an inhuman ceremony with Offred, Fred and Serena.Don't wonder when you begin to read the book. The first chapters are really complicated to read because you get so much information you can hardly cope. But after a while you understand it.The ending is like is like the beginning: very abrupt.The only critical aspect for me is that the book has an open end. I would like to know, what is going to happen to Offred after she is being taken away by a van of the secret police.There are a lot of parallels between the book and reality as we know it. When you read about Offred's way of clothing you think often on wives in Afghanistan and other Islamic countries with there veils about their faces.For me \\"The Handmaids Tale\\" is a very good book. It's interesting, exiting and very instructive. I would recommend the book to everybody, young and old people.(Ann-Kathrin)When I first saw this book I was really shocked. \\"It has so many pages\\", I thought. Also when I started to read I didn\`t feel better because the book starts with a flashback of the Red Centre and that really confused me. Right away you are in the story and flashbacks tell you what happened in the past. But then when I had read a few chapters I was really surprised that I started to like the book.The characters are really good and credible. I had the feeling that some day when leaving the house I could meet Offred or Nick.The whole story is credible, I think. The story includes facts of the history but it is a story about the future and how the future could look like. The future according to Margaret Atwood will be governed by men, and women will be only tools, but is this so incredible? I don\`t think so because it\`s like in the Bible, and religion is more and more important for us and our lives.The structure of the story is very good and interesting. Flashbacks tell about the past of Offred in a non-chronological order so that the tension is increased.All in all I think the book is good and believable. The future could be like that.(Lisa)When I started to read this book by Margaret Atwood, I was really confused at first. You don't know, where the story is set and what's happening at all.But when you've read on a bit, the way of narration is very interesting, because you only know, what Offred, the main character is thinking, all the time. The things you have to know to understand the story aren't explained.The themes of the story are old one's like the position of the women or the status of power of some \\"higher\\" people. But it's an unusual setting to deal with such themes. The story is about a state in the future, where the women are completely oppressed. Everybody has their assigned job and there aren't individuals anymore.What I didn't like is the way Margaret Atwood deals with the Christian or Jewish religion. Thegovernment justify the state of Gilead in \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" by saying it's based on the Old Testament. It's right, that the situation with Rachel and Leah and their maids looks like that situation Offred is in. But, actually, it's not comparable, because the background is completely different. Also some other parallels that are taken from the Bible are \\"right\\", but they're taken out of the context and completely misunderstood. That's okay for the state of Gilead, because the regime wants the people to believe those wrong things, but what I am dissatisfied with is, that it doesn't become clear enough, THAT these passages from the Bible are used in a wrong way. You would think, if you lived in a state that's like the one the Bible tells us about, it would be like Gilead in the book. And that's sad, because Jesus teaches opposing principles.(Nora)When you want to read the novel \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" by Margaret Atwood you need a lot of stamina. But when you get throw the first phase of boredom and confusion, you will recognize that Margaret Atwood gives an interesting and gripping portrait of a society which is shaped by inequality and injustice.Because they are afraid of the women who get more and more emancipated, the men create the state of Gilead, a dictatorship, where women have the lowest social standing.Offred, the protagonist and first-person-narrator of the novel, shows in a sensitive and impressive way how the women suffer in this regime.Separated from her husband and her daughter, she lives the life of a Handmaid, who has the task to give birth to a child. The only right she has is to live. But even this right isn't granted under any circumstance.Especially the way Margaret Atwood describes the beginnings of Gilead is impressive and alarming at the same time. How fast and smoothly a democratic country, the USA in this case, can be turned into a totalitarian system is shown in this novel.(Sabrina)"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Offred, a sexual slave, writes a memoir of her experiences in the repressive male dominated future of the United States. The US experiences a serious drop in reproductive levels due to environmental degradation, birth control, abortion, etc... As a result, a religious militant cult forces these women to be breeding vehicles and restore reproductive levels to it's former levels.What's most interesting is the perverse use of religion to justify its cruelty toward women and ironically many of the enforcers of this nightmare are also women. It's an easily read book and a dire warning to fight the current illogicality in religion in today's age"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It's America, in the near future where right wing Christian fundamentalists have taken complete control of all women, decreeing that women may no longer read, write, have jobs or have any opinions of their own. They are divided into classes..wives, owned by men of the ruling class, Martha's, household domestics, Unwomen, those who have proved to be infertile and Handmaids, women who have proved their fertility by giving birth to at least one child.If these fertile women had been married to a divorced man, they were classed as being promiscuous and therfore enslaved.Infertility is rife among the ruling classes as the result of some kind of ecological disaster, so the idea of using the words of the bible where Ruth uses her handmaiden to act as a surrogate wife to Jacob, so as to have a child, is taken as truth, and all childless officials are allotted a handmaiden with whom he has a ritualised form of sex, once a month, with the wife lying with the handmaiden between her legs.I found this book to be terrifying in the thought that this kind of madness is not beyond the realms of possibility if any kind of fundamentalism is given a foothold in society. It's the stuff of which nightmares are made !!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book is a first-person narrative from the perspective of a character named Offred (who is a Handmaid). The whole society is based on about 5-10 verses from the Bible which, when ripped out of context and twisted, would seem to indictate that Christianity is anti-women.The basic idea is that an unnamed Protestant Christian denomination takes over the USA and totally reconstructs the society in a radical way. There is some sort of disaster/war which sterilizes a large segment of the female population thus the remaining fertile females are pressed into service as breeding machines (called Handmaids).There is a whole new social structure set up with Aunts (who train Handmaids; Aunts are the only class of women allowed to read and write), Commanders of the Faithful (leaders), Angels (protect the Handmaids) and so on. Atwood gives subtle hints about the workings of the Republic of Gilead (the new name of the USA after the fictional revolution) but they are not sufficient for one to understand Gilead society. As an appendix, there is a section called, &quot;Historical Notes,&quot; which is an academic conference set in 2195 (approx. 150 years after the events of the novels) and some more details emerge. This section was probably the most interesting in the book.The novel is an interesting spin on 20th dysopia fiction. Its specific innovation is to emphasize the oppression of a specific set of persons (women). However, &quot;Brave New World,&quot; by Aldous Huxley and &quot;1984,&quot; by George Orwell are MUCH better dystopia novels."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I had to read this book in high school (ahem) over 13 years ago, and it still sticks in my mind as one of the best books I have read. We read this story along with 1984, A Clockwork Orange and Heart of Darkness (with seeing the movie Apocalypse Now as a modern comparison) and along with 1984, it gave me nightmares on what the future of society could look like. I suppose the premise of a rightwing (very, very, very right wing) takeover (which both books anticipate) seems scary because of the possibility of it actually happening someday. That is not to say that I believe that the world population is becoming infertile and that women are going to be reduced to a servile status, but there are many other portions of the book that seem highly realistic as a future for an apathetic society.In a society where something like 30% of the population votes in presidential elections and a president is elected with 42% of that 30%, I could envision a strong, charismatic person (megalomaniac) usurping power. Just look at Hitler. Anyway, Ms. Atwood uses some interesting literary devises, reverting everything to its lowest common denominator (like New Speak in 1984). All signs are pictures as opposed to written words, little details like that. There are portions that could get confusing to the reader who is not paying attention, and the ending is left as a bit of a cliffhanger, but this was a fascinating book, contemplating society and what it potentially can become.(AFTERTHOUGHT: for those of you out there who have to read this for class, don't bother trying to watch the movie, there's too much you'll miss....)"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Like &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot;, this is an incredible blend of science fiction/fantasy with social criticism. A very creative, terrifying, and engrossing novel. Virtually flawless."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"From time to time, an author may wish to hold her society up to a crooked mirror to present an image of what may go wrong should that current trend of wrongs and ills continue unabated. In THE HANDMAID'S TALE, Margaret Atwood wrote of the fears that were then wracking her pro-feminist worldview. In 1986, when Atwood was writing this book, she feared greatly what she saw as an onslaught on human rights in general and feminine rights in particular from a Ronald Reagan led attack by the Christian Right. Atwood saw Reagan as the vanguard of an attack, which included bible thumping televangelists, all of whom wanted to keep women gainfully unemployed, barefoot, pregnant, illiterate, and dependent on men for the bare necessities of life. Atwood chose to write of her alarm in the time honored tradition of the dystopia, a form of literature that presents humanity as de-evolving into unthinking brutes. George Orwell, in 1984, wrote of the crushing of the human spirit under Stalinism. Ray Bradbury, in FAHRENHEIT 451, wrote of a similar crushing of the intellect by a mind numbing pursuit of effete pleasures. And in THE HANDMAID'S TALE, Atwood was alarmed primarily by the loss of the right of a woman to choose whether or not to have an abortion.The narrator is a mid-thirties woman named Offred, not her real name. She \\"belongs\\" to her male captor, Fred. Thus she is \\"of\\" Fred. We never learn her former name. What the reader does learn is that sometime around the end of the twentieth century, the forces of the radical right merged with those of the Christian Coalition to usurp political power in the United States. The President is assassinated. Most United States Senators and Congressmen are eliminated and a theocracy is brutally instituted. The Bill of Rights is \\"temporarily\\" suspended, and a perverted Christian thuggery takes over. It is with no small amount of prescience that the new regime seems to have been a model that the Iranian Mullahs might have read as they were crunching on women's rights at about the same time. Women in the new America are forbidden to work or to have money. Clearly Atwood has read carefully her Orwell, since both writers share many of the same plot devices. Orwell has the Thought Police; Atwood the Eyes. Orwell provides flashbacks how Big Brother came to be: Atwood similarly unfolds the origin of the theocracy of Gilead. And both present humanity at the lowest common denominator-as worthy only of being a face stamped on forever by a boot. However, Atwood's nihilistic vision of a dark humanity is leavened slightly by her subtly suggesting that such a religious rot is only a local phenomenon, limited to the new Republic of Gilead. Other countries, like Canada, seem to have been spared the ubiquitous lashing of the rod by a host of Jimmy Swaggart types. What becomes clear by the novel's end is that the fear of an anti-feminist rogue regime is more feminist paranoia than even a remotely possible dystopia. The feeling that one has after finishing Atwood's polemic is one of amazement that there must have been so many women-hating, bible thumping thugs in positions of power who were awaiting the first chance to turn the United States of America into a copycat regime that now controls the lives of women in nearly every country of the Mid East. As such, THE HANDMAID'S TALE can now be read for its tremendous drama rather than for its original mission to spread the alarm of the end of feminism."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book tells the story of \\"Offred,\\" a woman in a futuristic and highly repressive society. Women are relegated to either Handmaids, who bear young for the Wives, who are considered morally superior; and the \\"Aunts,\\" who train the Hadmaidens and uphold the scriptures of the society's religion. (It is hinted that a chemical disaster has left many women unable to breed.)Offred was caught, along with her husband and daughter, as they tried to escape to Canada. Right now, she must find a way to live in a society that prevents women from reading and doing more than housework and giving birth. Her world is further complicated by the fact that it is difficult to tell between friend and possibly future accomplice, and undercover spy.Intriguing and thought-provoking, the book will stay with you long after you finish the last page."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Intense. Tragic. And sometimes even humorous, The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood exposes the troubles of her time and the future it may hold for America. Opening in the fundamental Christian dominated Republic of Gilead, where the protagonist Offred, is basically a reproductive sex slave. Offred herself is a conflicting character. Though the readers may pity Offred when reading about her oppression and her \\"job\\", Offred's own flashbacks to the early times make you wonder if she deserved her punishment. Her adulterous activities make the readers wonder about their view on Offred as a character. Offred's own thoughts were a mystery to me also well. Did she have an intense dislike for the system? Did she easily replace Luke with Nick?Atwood attacks fundamental Christianity and the Moral Majority in her novel, and shows support for a moderate feminism. But, Atwood made it clear in her novel that not all sects of Christianity is violent and militant, a view shown in the kind Quakers. The corruption of some women, the Aunts, and the pitiful description of some men, the Commander, reveals Atwood's own position on the feminism movement. However, I think Atwood was too extreme in her view of fundamental Christians. Much of the descriptions of the leader's of Gilead seemed very biased. The massive dominance over the people and the violence shown to the common people seem impossible to me.The hypocrisy of leading officials of the Republic reveals a hypocrisy that may be found, not only in fundamental Christians, but also in all man. The Commanders, while dictating laws that outlawed extramarital sex, often visited prostitutes for pleasure. Offred herself, while not necessarily liking Serena Joy and her Commander, continues to obey their will.This novel is gloomy by nature, and offers a cliffhanger at the end of the story. What truly happened to Offred? Was the Republic overthrown or not? All of these questions flickered through my mind. It might as well be Atwood's own style, but the lack of a true resolution seems incomplete.Overall, it was not a very enlightening nor agreat book for me. Though at times, there are places where Atwood grabs you, the intensity soon ends."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Already a dystopian classic, THE HANDMAID'S TALE is particularly impressive in the way that Atwood reveals the details of the repressive Christian theocracy of Gilead. Narrated from the point of view of Offred, the tale moves at a deliberate pace, allowing the reader to piece together from small details and events a nightmarish puzzle. Given that the author predicted an Islamic attack on the West and given the current predilections of the religious right, a coup by Christian fanatics is not out of the question today. If Obama wins a second term, some of these fanatics' heads are going to explode. The Old Testament subjugation of women in the novel is right in line with their thinking."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is a very interesting book that offers a different perspective on the relationships between men and women. Offred,the handmaid who is the main character of the novel, lives with her Commander and his wife Serena. Her job is to get pregnant by the Commander, give birth to the child, then give it up so that the wife can raise the baby as her own. The novel follows the thoughts of suicide, scandal, and betrayal that Offred has throughout her journey. The society in which the book takes place is fairly new, Offred can still remember life before it. It is very difficult to obtain items that would indulge any vanity. The only way to go about finding things like lotion, magazines, lingerie,etc. is on the black market. Offred and some of the other handmaid's who she meets along the way wish to corrupt the society and break down its very structured walls. Read the book to find out if she succeeds.I thought that this novel was very suspenseful about what Offred would encounter. It kept me reading. This was a challenging book to understand, filled with lots of symbolism, etc. I would reccommend it to anyone who wants a change from the everyday love story."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Everytime I read this book (and it's been about 12 or 13 times now) I take something new out of it. It will change the lives of any female or male who reads it. You'll think about it the next time you go to the ATM or use a credit card or anything. The book will haunt you in the scariest, best way...Read it. Go. Now. Don't wait."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"If you are a reader or a thinker and you haven't read this book, read it! The Handmaid's Tale is definitely a classic, it has a dramatic impact on most readers. Atwood tells the tale of how the United States became the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocratic government and the resulting society, from Offred, the handmaid's point of view. Offred has been assigned to a class: a reproductive handmaid. In this society of declining births, the handmaids are valued only if they are able to become pregnant by the men they are assigned to. And, if a child is born, the child will be turned over to the &quot;morally fit&quot; Wives. Offred recalls the past throughout this horrible present and tells how this society came to be. This book gives the reader interesting insight into societal standards, feminism, and right wing paradigms of thinking."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood is a master of the modern novel, and THE HANDMAID'S TALE is no exception to the rule. Brilliant, tightly knit, and fast moving, I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining, moving, rawly emotional book about a world so easily derived from our own."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Imagine a world where you suddenly can't think your own thoughts. A world where you must forego being human, and become a machine, performing on demand, never feeling, just giving.This is a story, similar to a George Orwell, \\"1984.\\" But in this story the world has taken away women's right to read, dress however they want, play, and move about, on their own terms.It is a wonderful book to read, to place yourself in this world, and befriend each of the characters, so that you come out appreciating the little things that we have, as a result of the risks that many took before us.And although this book is clearly written for women, I think it's a great read for the man who wants to break out of the traditional-male thinking, and not feel like he is being emasculated."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book is one written with precise ideas and a unified vision. Atwood knew where she was heading from the beginning and writes a novel dedicated to the corrupt future humans may have if we keep on the same path. An exceptional choice!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"How often do you hear that? NEVER! This book was so intensly facinating that you can't help but keep reading. Sure, it was perverted and there was a lot of swearing, but I think the author was just telling it like it is. Atwood kept the book and me going so strong, I kept thinking this was an actual journal I was reading! I may be 16 years old, and I may have been reading this for a school project, but the teacher suggested it to me. And I suggest it to anyone who has strong points of view of how a \\"Christiansociety\\" would work. Believe me, you won't take everything you have for granted any more! And if this book was \\"too grown up\\" for you, I suggest you read something else, along the lines of THE GIVER, if that isn't too perverted."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Wow! What can I say? Margaret Atwood writes like a poet. This whole novel is like a jigsaw puzzle that the reader puts together. There's great use of imagery, symbolism and metaphor to tell the story of a woman trapped in a dystopian, patriarchal future governed by the credos of the bible. It's a tremendous novel about the power of the individual, the direction our hedonistic society is heading, the subjugation of women and the dangers of totalitarianism. Ultimately - The Handmaid's Tale is definitely the finest book Atwood has ever written, and deserves a place high in the literary canon."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. I've read it multiple times and each time I find something new that I hadn't realized before. I think it is incredibly powerful and really makes you think. I had to write a school report on a dystopia and I chose to do it on this book. There is so much in this book to talk about. It's a fast read, very interesting, thoughtful, entertaining, and even a bit scary. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great book to read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"First, let's get one thing straight: Margaret Atwood can write. And I mean weave a story that you just CAN'T put down. I couldn't. Futuristic tales of this sort (1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451) are so compelling when they have roots in current events. Atwood takes today's subtle misogyny (or sometimes not too subtle at all) and brings it to a natural end. What if men and the state had complete control over a woman's fertility? What if women returned to the property-status we once held? How powerful is religion on people's conception of gender roles or sexual norms? (Note: Atwood points her finger at no particular religion. So Christians, she isn't neccessarily talking about you or anyone). But she also shows the strength of women. Women who will go underground to help others, women who will die before they submit or women who will lie in wait, slowly plotting a revolution."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"So many people want to shut up anyone who doesn't think like them. This science fiction novel shows how some use religion and violence to do that. The women are just vessels for carrying children, in an age when reproduction has become difficult. Margaret Atwood makes science fiction seem like something that's really happening, because she keeps it realistic and emotional. No aliens or lasers...just the very real threat of intolerance."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In her novel, The Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Atwood effectively portrays a woman's struggle to retain her power.The Handmaid's Tale describes a future in which a radical religious sect-the Sons of Jacob-has overthrown the United States government. A backlash to blas&eacute; attitudes regarding sex, this group aimed to cease the objectification of women, but only succeeded in creating a new form of objectification. The Sons of Jacob formed a caste society in which women must either \\"\`fulfill their biological destinies'\\" (220) or be declared \\"Unwomen\\" (10).The novel is told from Offred's-a Handmaid's- perspective. The regime forced her from her life of freedom to become a Handmaid-\\"a chalice\\" (286). Offred, like many women today, is too scared and unsure to defend herself. Readers easily identify with this character and cannot help but internalize Atwood's message of empowerment. The Handmaid's Tale drives home the theme of women's power with mastery.The novel is intended for women. It is told from a woman's perspective and details horrors of sexism. Atwood stretches modern antifeminist thoughts to their haunting conclusions-urging women to take a proactive stance against sexism now, before it's too late. The book's fervent message is a response to growing antifeminist attitudes in the 1980's when feminists were accused of wrecking the traditional home. Atwood wrote The Handmaid's Tale to illustrate the chilling impact of the antifeminist sentiments that women belonged at home and men are more powerful than women. These attitudes are stretched to become \\"\`But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence'\\" (221) and \\"\`she shall be saved by childbearing'\\" (221). The author was also influenced by the American Puritans' conservative values and the Iranian monotheocracy during the 70's and 80's. She takes these values and draws them to their logical conclusions.The book's feminist message carries through the plot, which focuses on Offred's empowerment. After being imprisoned, stripped of her name, and sent to an elite household to bear children, Offred's spirit is shattered. She is utterly powerless against the new regime, which forces her to submit to objectification or die. Every month, Offred and the Commander must perform \\"The Ceremony\\" (93)-a sexual act that reiterates Offred's loss of sexual power, as there is no choice, intimacy, or love involved. The Commander asks Offred to meet with him secretly to play Scrabble and to talk. As women are forbidden to read or write, and the meetings are kept secret from his wife, this lends Offred a small power. Later, the Commander dresses Offred like a whore and brings her to Jezebel's, a brothel for elite men, for \\"\`just another crummy power trip'\\" (243). At the end of the novel, Offred must either assert herself, or fall back \\"into the darkness\\" (295) of her powerless state within society.I fell in love with this book on two levels-as a woman and as a reader. Atwood's fervent message of female empowerment humbled me. Previously, I regarded books like Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God as feminist. Atwood's satirical take on the matter, however, coupled with the narrator's relatable personality gave The Handmaid's Tale much more impact. Unlike Hurston's novel, this book is not clean-cut or uplifting. Its messy and despondent nature renders this tale's message more powerful. Women who read this book cannot take it lightly, but are forced to confront their own way of life. Atwood achieves her intended goal-to make the reader question and, therefore, empower herself.The questions raised by Atwood added to the imagination stimulant this novel provides. Atwood's distopian world intrigued me. The Handmaid's world is wholly imaginative, with a few connections to modern American society that ground it in reality. This odd blend of fantasy and reality forms a plausibly extrapolated distopia. Atwood's spare style enriches this world. She uses short, simple sentences such as, \\"I don't need to smoke this cigarette\\" (209), to create an austere and distant tone.Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is intellectually, emotionally, and imaginatively stimulating. She effectively urges women to recognize and demonstrate their own power. Atwood's work speaks for feminists everywhere when it states: \\"Nolite te bastardes carborundorum...\`Don't let the bastards grind you down'\\" (186)."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It has been years since I last read this so I figured I would pick it up again last week.

The main character is endearing, intelligent and speaks for women who are concerned about the direction of our country. She tries to escape to Canada--where the author of the book Margaret AtwoodThe Handmaid's Taleactually lives--but instead is caught, along with her husband whose whereabouts she never ascertains, and forced into sexual slavery and her young daughter \\"confiscated\\" by the new authorities and given to a military family that is \\"fit.\\" (ie not a product of a second marriage-- that is in Gilead considered evil and invalid and hence fair game for confiscation.) This book is about a coup d'etat by a group of hardcore fundamentalist Right Wingers who machine gun the Congress and deprive women of their civil rights. The constitution is permanently suspended and all sorts of violations are perpetuated by the usurpers. Anyone who is concerned about the direction of this country should read this book.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I didn't like this book at first. I found it difficult to get in to, and at times it dragged, and by the time I finished it I still wasn't sure about it. But maybe I was just in a bad mood BECAUSE I started thinking about it when I put it down and the more I thought about it, the more I liked it. This is really a great book to chew on (not literally...though my dog tried). It's fascinating once you get through the frustration of trying to figure out what the heck happened to her. Make a friend read it and then have a nice big discussion about it...it's what a book like this is good for.Bottom line: read it, stick with it, it's all worth it in the end."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Even if Ms Atwood claims this book is \\"main fiction\\", there is no doubt in my mind that it has all the traits of very good sci-fi.It is a dystopia depicting a very stark future, but not impossible in occurrence.In a not so far future, a theocratic government has taken power over USA using violent methods. The new society is shaped as a patriarchal hierarchy, relegating women to a very subordinate position. One step after other this totalitarian government has banned gays, other religious groups and political dissidents.The story is told by a Handmaid that is to say a fertile woman used as an official concubine by high ranking officials. Women have been stratified in rigid classes: Wives & Daughters, Handmaids, Marthas, Aunts and Housewives. Each class has its codified role and attributes under constant surveillance of males. Males are also stratified: Commanders, Angels, Eyes and Guards. They also are subjected to very strict behavior codes. Any intent of deviation is harshly punished.The Diary gives the reader inkling into the new society and how it came into existence, but not a detailed and complete picture, rendering the novel very believable and interesting.Ms. Atwood prose is very ascetic; short phrases devoid of adjectives gives her novel a very special taste. The reader is introduced into this stark universe little by little and the whole image takes some time to be grasped. As a final result a griping tale emerges.This novel has been compared, deservedly, with Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" and in my view it stands to par with them.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book is set in a future; the main character occasionally flashes back to a time earlier in her life, not too different from our own time. In it she details some of the seemingly innocuous events that led to the creation of the society she is currently suffering in-- and you may be surprised when you realize that some of these things have happened to you.I strongly recommend to ignore any sense of current politics while reading this book. By that I mean that a number of people found this book to be heavy-handed criticism of feminists, or else heavy-handed feminism. I found it to be neither when I read it the first time; I think that the fact that I know virtually nothing about the author probably helped that.At any rate, it's a rather chilling account of a future that at times seems almost comical, and at others is horrifying...mostly because it's not impossible."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Sometimes, its not what you say, but how you say it. Story lines and plots are constantly recycled, but what sets them apart is how the author takes the idea and journey and makes it his/her own. Thus, Handmaid's Tale should not be taken for granted over Orwell's 1984. Atwood is too proud of a woman to let such raw energy slip past her fingers and she has proven to be quite a versatile writer by producing a surplus of immaculate novels.To me, the protagonist, Offred, is a timeless character - a submissive woman, who is so secretly rebellious, that she doesn't even realize it herself until half-way through the novel. Atwood puts Offred in the beginning years of the Republic of Gilead (formerly the United States), in which religion has taken over as an oppressive totalitarian government. It is an age of decline births, as few women and men are left fertile. Women's stations in the society have been reduced to roles that would make the medieval wives cringe in fear. A commander of a household would possess several women: his wife (the abstinent head of household), his Marthas (sterile women who act as servants and workers) and his Handmaids (the women designated for procreation purposes). Offred, acts as our tour guide through this horrific world, while carrying the burden of her lost liberties and her separation from her husband and daughter.Through grace and tortured language, Atwood gives us a sociology lessen about a world that could possibly become our reality. Readers cannot help but be spellbound by the unique voice of Offred, who must adapt to a world where women are not allowed to read and are no longer allotted any simplistic comforts, such as make-up, photo albums and the freedom to speak and think openly. This book grabs you from the first page and the reader must succumb to the feeling of hopelessness that is embedded in almost every figure of society.I think that's why I kept reading though - there is a chance for change and hope. All of the characters, no matter what their position in the caste system, seem to hate the society. Special moments, such as the commander inviting Offred to play scrabble with him. The gesture seems like a modest act of sympathy from a man who seems to resent his own superiority. Every character is worth exploring until Offred makes her own decisions to involve herself with a man who could either be a member of the rebel resistance movement or the secret police.The Handmaids Tale has the storytelling quality of Anne Rice and the literary qualities and social criticism that one would expect to find from an Adrian Rich collection. I won't lie, this story is an epic journey and has been told before by other writers, set in different worlds with different voices. But I have yet been able to find one that touches every emotion the way that Atwood does. Good stories should always be treasured, but the one's that make you think are true gems."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In this novel the Handmaids are potentially fertile women assigned to Commanders, who are high level members of a right wing regime whose wives are infertile, you can guess the rest. This is in an era after the U.S. Congress and the President were murdered, and these right-wing bible followers form a society (called the Republic of Gilead) where women have no rights and are valued primarily for their reproductive ability, the Handmaids are'nt even allowed to read. Purges of political enemies are frequent. The primary character is portrayed through a diary she has written, it gives a moving personal account of her life as a Handmaid, very introspective. Overall, this novel seems to be a satiric expose' of where extreme right-wing religious and political thinking can lead us, and these elements do exist today in the United States of America, some actually even in power. A very interesting and well written novel, it kept my interest and should be appealing to most people."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Rarely does a book fundamentally change your outlook on life.

Sometimes it sounds bizarre, even shocking, but it remains profoundly meaningful (for a female reader).

The stream of conciousness style is incredably evocative and draws you entirely into Offreds world - not necessarily a place you want to be.

It really makes you think about the way we are going."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This has been my favorite book for years -- I've read it so many times that I had to tape the cover back on. Each time I come back to it, it offers me something different. It's certainly not a light read, but this is Atwood at her frightening best. The potential reality she depicts is disturbing and thought-provoking, written with amazing force and imagination. She gives us one of the best narrators in literary history, a woman with infuriating yet understandable weaknesses. The ending is pure Atwood, for better or for worse. I insist that you read this book... at least three times."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"What an excellent book. By following Offred's daily routine we learn about a frightening new society, one where a religious faction has taken control of the government and subjugated all who do not agree with their doctrines. This story gives rise to disturbing thoughts about what could happen if a zealous religious group did gain control of the government. The beginning is a bit slow, which is necessary to introduce you into the monotony of Offred's daily life. The novel picks up soon enough, to the point where I read the last half of the book in one sitting. All in all, an excellent book. I would recommend it to almost anyone."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A friend of mine gave me this book last year.

I have read Oryx and Crake, then it was about genetic engineering, corporate power, etc. This time it's about female rights and warning women to assert them to what I can engender. Now, I can handle a book with a weak and obvious message, however, Atwood decided to use Orwell's technique of boredom but throughout the entire book. It worked and I was incredibly bored.

I didn't even keep it. Don't know if I gave it to a thrift store or what.I was surprised this is a well known author.

The ending is awful. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone. I read it after rereading the giver and that's a similar story line but this story jumps around but with no warning.

This book (set in the not too distant future) is actually nothing more than an attack on conservative Christian values.

There is no good reason to read this book. It is just another way to get off for the men who believe this way of life would be great for them and want to keep things as conservative as they can already, and it is just another way for women to get traumatized by reading this. I was actually traumatized by this book. Women know the problems with society, and this book offers nothing helpful; it simply adds to the pain. If you are an adult, feel free to damage your soul some more by exposing yourself to more pain and violence. Under no circumstances should a minor read this book.

That really is the only place for it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I never normally get around to writing reviews but this book was just so terrible I felt compelled to write something for once. Atwood seems to want to tease the reader by failing to explain any of what is going on directly, and instead wastes our time describing how things used to be, ie. the real world that we all still live in. The plot is implausible, the characters are dull and many of the events described are horrific.

I did not like this book (this I am afraid is a grose understatment of my feelings towardes 'The Handmaids Tale') I read this book and was shocked and discusted by the sextual content and the vularity. The book in some way uses the characters sexual activitys and swearing as sings of rebelion. I do not think this is the best way. The plot might have been intresting to me had the characters not all been so sleezy, and lustful. they were always, it seemed, dreaming/doing sextual things.

I was a fan of dystopian fiction, but this was something else.

It changed my life and I credit it with my feminism and healthy distrust of organized religion and government. I've read it many times since, and I'm always surprised at how much closer to this reality we're getting, rather than farther away."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is an interesting novel that was ahead of its time.

Margaret Atwood has written a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book came highly recommended from friends and family. I must be the black sheep because it did nothing for me (well - it did annoy me a lot). I disagree with many of the negative comments - I simply do not care if it's anti-Christian (it's anti-fundamentalist, and if Christians automatically assume she's refering to Christianity alone, if that's how her depiction of this fictional society immediately says \\"Christianity\\" to you, you might want to do a little soul searching on your choice of religion). I dislike this book because the plot alone is so overdone and cliched (Orwell did it much better and with greater and quieter horror implicit in the plot). Atwood seems to think we need to be hit over the head with her point that fundamentalists in Western society (especially the U.S.) attribute every disaster to us just not being Right With God, and the solution to life's iniquities and tragedies is a return to the era of extreme religious control of society. I actually agree with her view, but the book is just too literal - the \\"mating\\" scene (as I call it) with handmaiden, husband and wife screams \\"Oh my god, isn't this AWFUL?\\". Yeah, if I cared anything about the 2 dimensional characters, it would be. The evil are evil, the good are dull, and both extremes have no subtlety. It's also predictable and not very original premise that the sexually repressed think of little other than sex, and those that aren't having sex are a pretty surly bunch. The writing is self-conscious and the ending is so lame (forgive me, but it is the word that comes to mind -imagine it with all the condescending distain of a 15 year old). Unfortunately, it has prevented me from reading anything else by Atwood. I shouldn't allow it, but I don't think I could approach her work without trying to find fault with it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"times when women everywhere are losing their rights and freedoms left and right. Reproductive freedom is under attack in America. White nationalists are worried about \\"race suicide\\" because so few white women are bearing more than two children. Feminism is under attack by right-wingers and religious organizations.This book is about Offred's life and escape from anti-life, anti-woman, totalitarian religious republic of Gilead, where fertile women are forced to breed and to relinquished their children for elite women reminiscence of the age of slavery in which black slave women have no control over her reproduction and that her children and husband can be taken away from her at anytime. Marthas are to be work drones for the elite, much like black housekeepers during slavery and segregation. Jezebels were to be hidden from society in state-licenced brothels/bars to please the commanders and foreign dignitaries(mainly Japanese and Middle Eastern) on demand. Nonwomen are to be worked to death so that they won't be of any challenge to the male-dominant elite. Dissenters are to be put to death as soon as possible as are those of other religions. Blacks are to be relocated to \\"homelands,\\" which are nothing more than death camps. Those from \\"unofficial\\" religions either convert or die. No middle ground exists. Everything is either/or, us/them, women/unwomen, etc.Offred has done everything in her power to survive in such an inhumane society. She knew that if she doesn't get pregnant within a limited time period that she would be condemned to the colonies where most women worked themselves to death or being slowly poisoned by the nuclear waste there. Working at Jezebels is no real choice either because once a woman fail to please the powerful men who frequent there, she'll be dead as well. Being impregnated by doctors is risky proposition. She could be execution for doing so. Reeking of double standars, huh?This book and the movie adaption is very chilling to the very soul and should be recommended to those with thick skin and the serious-minded."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In one of her most famous and highly acclaimed novels, Margaret Atwood takes her readers on a journey of insight and frightening possibilities. The Handmaid's Tale is a speculative novel situated in the near future in a place called Gilead that used to be the United States of America. Western society has made a complete and utter turnaround, destroying the concept of feminism, as well as any form of individualism. A group of puritan-like religious fanatics has turned the American government into a theocratic dictatorship in which every aspect of citizens' lives is controlled from occupation to sex partners. The central most valued part of this twisted society is fertility and reproduction. Toxic waste and chemical explosions have made prolific women scarce and sterile men abundant. With her hard as nails writing style, Atwood transports readers into the mind of a woman who is being used for breeding purposes. Her real name is no longer existent and her daughter has been ripped from her arms and given to a new family. Her husband, and the love of her life, has been frozen forever in her mind; his fate for her is undetermined. Her life now rests in her ability to produce healthy offspring and also in the hands of a man many years her senior who must give her a baby to save her life. In the tradition of George Orwell's 1984, the reader is taken on a gripping journey of isolation and witnesses the effects that a dystopia has on the individual person being surrounded by mass conformity. The purpose of this novel is to educate the reader as to how easily society could be transformed by a manipulative group of people using the excuse of \\"national emergency\\" to take away basic human rights. It explores significant issues such as feminism, sexuality, theocracy, conformity, abortion, cults, totalitarianism, infertility, religion, human rights, and popular culture. Ultimately, this novel leaves its reader with the final question of, \\"what are we, as a species, capable of?\\". The Handmaid's Tale is shown at its best through its strong imagery and symbols, allusions to both history and the present, and stylistic elements. This novel is shown weakest through its poorly developed main character, ambiguity, and lack of a satisfying ending.The imagery and symbols of The Handmaid's Tale are very powerful. Atwood describes settings in great detail so as to give the reader an intense feeling of actually being a part of the story. The novel opens with a depiction of the gymnasium in which the narrator, Offred, is sleeping. The reader can almost smell the faint under-odour of sweat and feel the atmosphere of loneliness and sense of dread as women lie, afraid to speak, on army issue fold-up cots. Every inch of the narrator's room is described, from the worn varnished wood floor to the missing chandelier to the Nolite te bastardes carborundorum graffiti scratched by a suicidal woman in the closet. This contributes to the mood/atmosphere in an infinite number of ways. The reader agonizes with Offred over suicidal temptations and the anguish of realizing that there is, in fact, no escape. One important symbol in the novel is the hanging wall. Similar to the parading of traitors' heads on stakes in medieval Europe, the hanging wall displays those who have rebelled against Gilead and, fundamentally, God. It is a symbol of the fate for those who revolt against mass conformity. The hanging wall explains to the reader, in laymen's terms, the complete and utter lack of choice for people in Offred's position. The handmaids' or concubines' garments are also a very necessary part of the novel. Handmaids in the novel are forced to dress in identical burqa-like robes that hide their bodies entirely and white scarves to cover their heads. This is a symbol of captivity. Women are no longer free to choose something as simple as clothing or hairstyle, every aspect of their lives is regulated. Pornography in the novel is a symbol of the treatment of women prior to Gilead. It is used by figures of authority to demonstrate to women the way they were once treated as sex objects and often lived in fear of rape. This ironic contrast with the \\"safe\\" environment of theocratic Gilead provokes reaction from the reader, causing him/her to feel outraged. Atwood presents imagery and symbols with such poignancy as to make the reader feel unity with the story.The Handmaid's Tale is a rational novel and a profound example of speculative fiction due to its allusions to both the past and the present. Atwood's theocratic/totalitarian government comes from an allusion to several different types of society that existed or still exists today. The first is to the early puritan era in the United States. In the name of religion, the Puritans forbade pleasurable activities such as dancing and singing and also persecuted non-puritans who refused to convert. In addition, Gileadian society is similar to the Nazi Germany of World War II. Discrimination against the Jewish race ran rampant and anyone who spoke out was sent to a concentration camp where he/she would be liquidated or, in other words, murdered. In Gilead, non-conformists or unwanted people such as unfertile women are sent to the Colonies, places where they perform physical labour for the government, eventually causing death. The Taliban regime exists today in many parts of the Middle East. Women are forced to cover themselves in tent-like burqas and strict laws are enforced, forbidding them to leave the house without male supervision. In Gilead, women are greatly oppressed, and, like Middle Eastern females, are forced to cover themselves for modesty reasons. A lot of The Handmaid's Tale comes from a literal interpretation of the Christian Bible. In the first of three epigrams at the beginning of the novel, the biblical story of Rachel explains how Atwood's idea of the handmaid bearing children for an infertile wife was inspired. Another biblical allusion in the novel is in a sinful, forbidden club called Jezebel's. Jezebel is the name of a very sinful queen in the Bible; therefore, the name causes one to think of wickedness. Furthermore, Marthas in The Handmaid's Tale refer to women who are infertile but useful for performing household chores. In the Bible, Martha and Mary are sisters, but where Mary chooses to listen to Jesus, Martha throws herself wholeheartedly into housework. Mary is praised and Martha, scorned. In Gilead, Martha is the one exalted. Atwood also makes allusions to religious history. Her idea for soul scrolls, prayers sold for money, can be related back to the selling of indulgences in exchange for cleansing of sins by Catholic priests in seventeenth century Europe. Allusions draw realism into an otherwise farfetched novel, sending chills down the spines of its readers. Atwood effectively uses these allusions take away from any science fiction aspect of the novel, making it undoubtedly speculative fiction.Atwood has a distinct flair for writing and uses many stylistic elements in her novel. Similar to J.D. Salinger's The Catcher and the Rye, The Handmaid's Tale is written in a stream of consciousness type format. The reader is exposed to the moment-to-moment emotions of Offred: depression when she is depressed, uncertainty when she is considering rebellion, self-doubt at the point where she wonders whether her husband will understand her predicament, and agony when she remembers losing her beautiful little girl. Offred's many descriptions of the world around her convey feelings of boredom and her limited perception shows readers just alienated she is. The use of a series of flashbacks makes it seem like Offred is speaking directly to the reader, giving the novel a personal touch. Atwood's talent is evident in the style of The Handmaid's Tale.While the reader respects Atwood's writing abilities, the author fails in her attempt to create a well-rounded narrator. The character of Offred is extremely passive and disappointing. Although the novel examines issues of feminism and portrays many strong women, Offred is not one of them. Throughout The Handmaid's Tale she is dependent upon the men in her life for consolation and guidance. Luke, her husband, is the one who initiates a plan of escape and it is Nick, her lover, that later finally helps her to leave Gilead behind forever. Offred often expresses dissatisfaction with her situation and yet when she is presented with the opportunity to gather top-secret information for the aid of those rebelling against the government, she is too frightened. The reader cannot help but feel for Offred's plight, but her lack of drive gives her a disappointing air. In addition, the fact that the reader never learns Offred's real name is a barrier that takes away from the personalization of her character.Another flaw in this otherwise brilliant novel is its ambiguity during some scenarios. Offred describes two possible outcomes as to the fate of her husband, Luke. She admits, however, that she is not really sure what has happened to him. The reader never discovers Luke's whereabouts and is left puzzling over the mystery. At another part in the novel, Offred explains her first encounter with Nick, her lover. The reader reads through an entire account of the experience and is then informed that Offred created this fictitious story from her own imagination. She then proceeds to tell the reader what really happened and then admits that the second story was made up as well. Because these scenes did not really come to pass, they are rather redundant and serve no purpose except in confusing the reader. Certainly, Atwood's vagueness is an unnecessary portion of the novel.The ending of the novel is also a disappointment to the reader. It ends with historical notes; new characters are introduced who exist farther into the future in South America and are examining Offred's story and what happened to her. Upon first reading these historical notes, one finds that they are quite mystifying. In addition, they don't answer many of the questions that need answers in order for a successful conclusion. The professors in the historical notes are able to pinpoint Offred's household but don't know her name or where she went subsequent to her escape. The historical notes are again redundant and perhaps should be omitted from the novel.Unquestionably, Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is one of the most well known Canadian novels ever written. Similar to Atwood's Oryx and Crake, it provokes questions from its readers ultimately leading to change. Margaret Atwood has written seventeen novels, winning numerous awards as a revolutionary Canadian Author. The Handmaid's Tale won several awards including the Los Angeles Times Book Prizes, the Governor General's Literary Award and the Arthur C. Clarke Award. It clearly deserves recognition as a great Canadian novel and is a must read that will glue your eyes to its pages."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The story is written as either a warning or a prediction. Very real and terrifying if you remember the crap the GOP's war on women has accomplished and/or tried to do.

The story is so well crafted that the rooms, characters and scenarios become very real."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"An interesting read from Margaret Atwood.This is definitely a story noire, set in the not too distant future in a dictatorial, 'Orwellian' society . Life is a struggle and one does whatever one has to do, just to get by. And whatever one has to do just to get by, is usually controlled by the state.I like Margaret Atwood's style of story telling; she takes a decidedly different plot and surrounds it with interesting characters and circumstances. As with most of her books, there are a few twists and turns along the way to keep you on your toes.Conclusion:Not a particularly happy story, but intriguing enough to keep the pages turning, IF, you don't mind a somewhat Draconian tale right out of \\"1984\\". If you can deal with the subject matter at hand and if you like Atwood's style, you'll enjoy (or at least appreciate) 'The Handmaid's Tale'.Ray Nicholson"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I just finished The Handmaid's Tale which I found fascinating with an thought-provoking open-ended finish. It takes place in a future with a declining birthrate and a repressive regime in America that came about by way of a bloodless coup. Not surprisingly this ultra-puritanical society has it's own corruptions and hypocrisies and it's own rationalizations for them.I love the image of the Handmaids in long red habits with white wimples having built-in blinders; somehow in my imagination this image is much stronger then in my memory of the movie version of this book. The image I do recall from the movie was the Ceremony which is introduced in a subtle startling way. In particular it was the image on Serena Joy's face when her husband, the Commander appeared to be enjoying the ritual. I guess both forms of this story have their strong points but I think the book is superior. Perhaps it was the blackness of the story that I found difficult to accept on first exposure, or perhaps it is just the realism/cynicism of a more mature perspective but I was even more enthralled with the written version of the story of Offred (she has even lost her name), the Handmaid who's tale we are hearing (we never learn her former name or the name of her daughter who was taken from her). There are some very inventive touches such as the Marthas, the Unwomen, the Wives and Econowives in blue, the Handmaids in red who are always in pairs, the Aunts, the colonies, the Salvagings, the Guardians, the Angels, and the Eyes. Also the irrepressible character of Moira who gives yet another perspective on this society.And also the names of the stores of the town: Lilies of the Field, Milk and Honey, and All Flesh. This world is a well-wrought creation."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book should be required reading for every woman in America. Period. Brilliant, haunting, genius. I've read it a million times and never tire of it. One of the modern classics."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I found The Handmaid's Tale was a type of warning sign of what a society with few limitations on what a person could do. And this shows what could happen to a society if something drastic happened and the government had to take complete control of everybody. And the religious leaders take over and tell everybody what to do. And people who weren't their religion. People who didn't convert were hung such as the Jews and they were hung on a wall with a label on them for everyone to see and the label was to tell what they did. Homosexual acts were also forbidden and you could be hung for that also.In the future the woman tried to fight back against this government because they have taken everything she has ever owned from her. Her job, husband, money, daughter, life were all taken away from her. Everything material was taken away from her she wasn't allowed to keep anything personal. They even took her name away a she has been given the name Offred. This hasn't only happened to her it's happened to all the other women. The U.S. is no longer it is called Gilead. The new place was the government runs everything that you do. Offred keeps having flashbacks of life before the big change. Part of her memory has been erased so she doesn't know what happened to her husband Luke or her daughter. In this New World she searches for another man and seeks for their love. In this time women are used as sex objects and their told that's all there good for so finding a man to love is hard and its not something your allowed to do.I recommend this book to any person who wonders of how the future could end up and is scared of what could happen. This is a good example of how lucky we are to live in a society that we live in now. And in the book they take everything for granted. Once they turn into the Gilead they realize how lucky they were and they wish they took advantage of what they had when they had it. This book is also for a person who gets really into the book and doesn't put it down. You need to constantly be paying attention or you will become completely confused and won't know what's going on. This is not the happiest books but it will make your mind think. This is a good book for women to read because they will get into it and what's happening to the women in the story they will find unbelievable and how could something like this ever happen. Reading this book would insure them like something like this would never happen. The book is sometimes a little sketchy and they go back an forth a lot it can get a little confusing at times. The mystery of the book and the ending makes the people seem very real and they way the author makes them act is very realistic she doesn't leave anything out and tells you exactly what is going on in their mind. Other than that I liked the book and I don't read many books. It keeps me wondering and I had to pay attention very closely while I was reading it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is definitely a work of literature.

I've always been a fan of her short stories and finally took the time to read Handmaid's Tale. She creates a setting that seems so possible and real that I almost felt like I was there. Gilead is a republic that exudes safety and protection, yet is filled with bondage, imprisonment and fear. Atwood dares the reader to contemplate what society would be like for women if they were to let go of everything they love and cherish. This not only includes people and places, but also intelligence, emotions, friendship and love. Atwood's use of symbolism using colors and \\"the eye\\" enhances the haunting novel. What is Atwood attempting to imply with her ambiguous ending? Although there are many possible interpretations, we do realize that Offred is leaving her world of nothingness into somewhere free, whether that is death or ultimate escape. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and am looking forward to reading Alias Grace, which I hear is one of her best works."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I simply couldn't put it down.

I loved how the author didn't describe every single nook and granny of the scenery, allowing more space for plot development."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is a novel of stark and chilling beauty. The most frightening story is often not the most gruesome story, rather it is the story that is not so far removed from our own present day reality. The spartan, strictly regulated, puritanical world that is the subject of the novel is paralleled by the economical use of words by Offred, the narrator of the story. Offred recalls longingly through bittersweet reminiscences, the world she once knew and never truly appreciated until it was snatched away from her grasp. As the narrator's story unfolds, the reader learns of the role Offred plays in the mundane, frightening existence granted to women living in her society. She is part of a world where women are treated as asexual objects, while the ability to reproduce is divorced from being a mother and set upon an inviolate pedestal. In this frightening world, not quite different than our own, fertility is one of the last remaining bastions of feminine power. Sex is a passionless transaction conducted by means of a perversely, unholy triangle of Husband, Wife, and Handmaiden. After I finished reading the Handmaiden's Tale, I was left with the desire to begin to make an effort to appreciate the mundane and seemingly meaningless rituals which are a part of daily living.

It got me reading up to page 100 in almost one time. However then it becomes more and more the same thing over and over again.

I read the book through the end but I was really glad it was finished another 20 pages of this I would not have read. On the other hand this book gave me the happy feeling being in Belgium far from the land where Moral Majorities and other Religieus fanatics try to get grip on society.

In the book the Handmaids Tale the maincharacter is Offred. A Handmaid that lives in Gilead. Offred who was aHandmaid had the Commander as her man. His wife who was a gospel singer is namedSerena Joy. While Offred was having her monthly cycle she was to have sex withthe Commander while his wife Serena sits behind her holding her hands. Thereare rules that the Handmaids need to follow. They are restricted to do thingsthat every other woman who wasn't a Handmaid could do. She cant leave the housefor normal foods shopping trips. The Gilead police kept a close eye on whereshe was at all times. While the story is going on she really puts a little moreinterest into the story she flashes back when things remind her of certainthings.During these flashbacks there is the new world and the old world. In the oldworld she had a affair with Luke who was divorced and married Offred and had onechild. Architects in Gilead took over completely, the military assassinatedthe president and his followers of Congress and said they were taking over.This age was where the woman were abused and used for prostitution. The Congressdecided that its time to tighten the rules for woman and having them not beingable to work or and have property. While this was occurring Offred lost herhusband and daughter through the mess.Life while being the servant of the Commander was a lot different but alwaysthe same. It was the kind of life that kept things the same and in the routine.She sometimes takes trips with Ofglen to get some food. When she finally getsaway from the routine to go the doctor but it wasn't a good checkup he wants tohave sex with Offred to get her pregnant, but Offred refuses to have it becauseif she is caught she could be send away. Then the Commander demands his gardenerNick to go and see her. When he sees her he keeps going to see her on a regularbasis.Ofglen who is Offred's friend tells her that she is a member of the \\"Mayday\\" agroup of people or organization trying to overthrow Gilead. She tries to findthe Ceremony that is different now that she knows the Commander. Then shereally is unhappy and she expresses her feelings to the Commander and he getsmad and makes remarks that aren't very nice. Offred and the Commander had beentrying to have a baby for quite a long time and she really doesn't know whatelse to do so Serena the Commanders wife tells her to go and have sex with Nickhis gardener. So when she has a baby with him she can say it was the Commanderwhen it really wasn't.The novel ends by Professor Piexoto explaining that Gilead. Then he explainshow important Offred story but no on really knows what went on in the escape ifNick helped or not and where did she go.The Handmaids tale was a book that was a very good but book. But however it wasa little confusing for the average reader. When she jumped back and forth withher flashbacks it was hard to follow if that just happened or if it was really aflash back. I suggest this to any reader that tries or does read it because itwas a book that put the reader in the character's shoes more then other books.It showed how terrible it was to be a woman"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale takes place in a future not too long after the 1980s. The world is environmentally destroyed and widespread infertility leads to fertile women being treated as commodities. This is accomplished by a military coup of the US government with strong religious undertones.This is a decent idea for a story on the surface. However, Atwood's execution was poor. She has done some decent writing, this book is just not an example of that.I can see that many people liked this book. If this is the first book of this kind that one reads, I could see why. It's not the worst book ever written. Still it's bad enough to not warrent a read.There is nothing original about this book, unfornuately. George Orwell's 1984 was written much earlier than this book and yet still surpasses it in foresight, complexity, and language.Atwood's only claim to fame is her incessant hatred of the politics of the \\"religious right\\" as she sees them. She really didn't have to write this ridiculous book to get across the point that religious views are damaging when taken too far. Anti-religious views can be equally taken too far. They can lead to long drawn out and boring books that teachers use to punish their students.A bad book was made into an even worse movie. Please save 2 hours of your life and never see it.Attwood's writing style is what perhaps makes this book hardest to stomach. It's bad enough that she basically rewrote George Orwell and still managed to do less of a job. Her plot and character development is so poor, and her command of the written word so trite, that anybody who reads avidly will wish they had picked something else off the shelf.For those who like this book, I respect your opinions. Please read A Clockwork Orange by Burgess, or 1984 or Animal Farm by Orwell. Those are books that are not only written by much better writers, but also much more original and meaningful."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read this book for an English class ('Sex and Gender Issues'). Without hesitation, I can say it is among the worst books I've ever read. The prose is acceptable and fits the novel, but I can scarcely think of a more blantant rip-off than The Handmaid's Tale. Without improvising the anti-Utopian genre, this book cheaply copies 1984, Brave New World, and We. Handmaid's Tale fails miserably fails to approach the realism and totality of those works; while satire is not necessarily intended to be realistic, this book is not really satirical.Why is that so? Atwood wrote this book as some kind of reaction to the US' slight movement Right in the early 1980s. She does not, however, understand American political realities; it's almost painful to imagine what she was thinking as she penned the novel. The shift of the Republican Party away from Ford's centrism was not rooted in a religious revival- in fact, it was quite the opposite. While Southern religious Conservatives emerged full force in 1980, Barry Goldwater set the table much earlier (particularly his 1964 Presidential bid). Goldwater was actually pro-choice, and never associated with the religious Right. Likewise, Reagan was not fundamentally driven by a sense of moral duty.Inevitably, Atwood's political ignorance results in a hackneyed and utterly unbelievable setting. I even laughed at certain elements of her 'Republic of Gilead.' Discussing the book's fantastic elements is almost difficult, despite being obvious. A bizarre group somehow gets the military to pledge it's loyalty (which is, of course, ridiculous). Worse, Congress is \\"machine gunned...\\" by the Army and the President is assasinated. US soldiers are trained to disobey illegal orders, and that is exactly what would happen- not that an entire bureaucracy like the US military could be easily turned against the country, anyway. Oh, and Catholics are persecuted by this regime; I suppose the fact that the military is over 1/3 Catholic posed little challenge to the \\"Commanders.\\"Red is an appropriate motif of the novel- because that's what color Atwood's politics boil down to. She (imagine fingernails scratching a chalkboard) heaps racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism etc ad nauseum into her Leftist field day. Her essential claim is that the end of Conservatism is a 100% Patriarchal, White society of zero tolerance and zero love (and zero freedom). Atwood's understanding of organized religion is also called into question here, as the RoG is some kind of new Christian Sect (at one point, the book reveals them to be in conflict with Baptists). Consider for yourself: a random new religion appears, it's leaders take over the country, and Harvard is the HQ of their Secret Police. Yeah, right...If you need to read a book about Gender, \\"The Garden of Eden\\" by Hemingway is quite good. If you need to read about anti-Utopias, the three novels I listed previously are all very powerful. This book is not a significant work in either sense. Time has revealed its silly urgency to be unfounded. It serves as part complaint, part scare tactic, and part political statement; perhaps feminists enjoy it for precisely those reasons, but preaching to the choir is not the mark of a good novel. The praise this book has garnered is downright weird... I think it speaks to a paranoia with regard to religious people (among leftists, especially feminists), and a more subtle hatred of people that \\"oppress\\" women. Serene Joy mocks the notion of religious women...the epilogue essentially describes a better world that is free of White people (and perhaps Christians). Thinking about it, I do not recall a more offensive and ludicrous book from my experience, though they surely must exist..."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"for son's assignment, Senior English (high school).

If you don't agree with me, you are WRONG."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It would be hard to dispute that the Handmaid's Tale is quite well-written. Atwood creates highly sympathetic female characters and then places them in the most heart-wrenching of circumstances. Their story is cleverly laid out, with a well-structured plot. I found myself immersed in Offred's world, needing to know her fate.However, unlike many women, I did not find the Handmaid's Tale frightening. Some have said that we are on the verge of such a society, only one disaster away. I say that's baloney. Women in the West today have more opportunities and rights than at any time in history, and more power. We are blessed to live in such times.Gender discrimination and sexual exploitation do exist: they are very real evils, even in America. However, we in the West, especially America, have a tendency to cry \\"discrimination\\" and \\"oppression\\" at the drop of the hat. The Handmaid's Tale plays on this tendency-a tendency which makes us look like spoiled fools to the truly oppressed women of the world. If not for this book's alarmist undertone, I would have given it four stars."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I am not a fan of dystopia genre so that may be one of the reasons I disliked this book. Atwood writes with a conscious attempt to place this book neatly into the genre. Her language is overdone, her plot completely tiresome, the characters only create a mirage of being real characters. Atwood's book is a representation of ideas rather than a novel. She writes consciously with not enough innovative ideas. She doesn't let the novel create itself, it is as controlled as the style."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I actually love futuristic novels. And to be frank, i was excited to read this book because it sounded quite promising. However, that lasted only for several pages. I am truly sick and tired of various writers portraying Christianity as some kind of fundamentalist cult that only wants to make women into slaves and supress all kinds of freedoms. There is no Christian church(and i am not including various so called \\"fundamentalist\\" fruitcake cults because these are not Christian, they only claim to be one)that promote the \\"ideas\\" in this novel. Why is that, that anytime there is totalitarian goverment described in the novel its always conservative right/christian? I think if I didn't know anything about Christianity I just might buy into the story about it being the very Devil as many reviewers have but since i don't count myself as one of the sheep who listens to media propaganda, this story is a travesty. Most goverments that were totalitarian as they are in this novel, are either Communist/Socialist or Islamic. Insert the words Taliban and there you have a real life events portrayal of something that already happened to women in Afganistan. This had a potential to be a really good story since i think its quite well written. Alas, the usual attacks on Christianity makes it a total loser for me"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"There's too much interruption in train of thought.

What happened to the women in the military at the time of the takeover? Did they just give it up for the country? This book was written in '85 or so, according to my copy, and the US (the story is about the US in a possible future) has had women in the military for years. Did the author just ignore this? Please. Can you see any woman, civilian or military, going along with this nonsense? I can't.Also, this was a very primitive future society--they execute by hanging. How hard could it have been to hit someone over the head, steal clothes/weapons/trucks and just leave? The &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; employed while reading fiction (this utterly fails as science fiction) is impossible with such a laughable storyline.Women everywhere should be offended by this book, as they are here portrayed as being dumb as dirt, motivated only by clothes, cosmetics, and women's magazines. So dumb, in fact, that they deserve what happens to them in this story.I am sorry to see all the reviews mentioning this as required reading--the sorry state of education the world over, I guess.Also, if this is the best Canada can offer the world in terms of literature, I wouldn't brag about it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In Gilead, USA in the near future, a woman Kate (Offred) is captured trying to cross the border and is sent to the Red Center. All of the women in Gilead are forced to either bear a child for other couples or to go to the colonies. At the Red Center the women are taught that bearing children is a blessing and not to misbehave or they will have severe punishment. The Commander Fred and his wife, Serena Joy, is a couple who has requested a &quot;Handmaid&quot;. And Nick is their chauffeur. The rising action starts when Kate came to their home from the Red Center. Serena is not happy because she once was a famous singer until the new law went through, and she doesn't like Offred. Then after three months of living with Commander Fred and Serena, she still has not conceived a child. But the climax has not come just yet; it occurs when Offred and Nick are together. That is a major sin/crime punishable by death. In her room Offred has discovered unusual clues like: a Latin quotation carved in the closet, the &quot;blind eye&quot; on the ceiling, and the windows that don't open. All are clues to the disappearance of the former Offred. In the climax scene Offred tells Nick that she is pregnant with his child. She tries to convince him that he should escape with her. The falling action begins when Offred goes to Jezebel's with Commander Fred and sees a friend, Moira, who had tried to escape Gilead and was sent to Jezebel's instead of the colonies. Offred is lucky-she didn't get caught. But, Serena finds everything Offred wore to Jezebel's, Offred know she needs to vanish. The resolution can be confusing, but the book ends when Offred is taken away from Commander Fred and Serena in the middle of the night by the &quot;angels&quot;. They don't know if she is being taken to the colonies or going to another commander. You will have to read to learn the resolution. She also could have escpaed."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I loved reading this book because, for the first time in a long time, I found something that I couldn't put down. The story makes readers wonder about the security in their lives and the control so many people have over us without our even knowing it. If you read any Atwood novel, as I have also read Cat's Eye and Surfacing and found them...lacking, read this one! It is unforgettable and amazing! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"'The Handmaid's Tale' is both a carefully contructed dystopia and also an exemplary example of (almost) post-modernist literature. The 'time - jumps' of the narrative make the story seem more real, as though these are truly the thoughts of a fallible, human character, and not some omniscient, distant author/narrator.While there have been criticisms of the portrayal of the various male characters (I think that one that I haven't yet classified as a 'sleazy bastard' is the guy that gets ripped to shreads) and the ambiguity of the ending, I believe that both these aspects are important to the book. The 'conclusion'- where Offred steps into the van, allows us to draw our own conclusions, whether the escaped or was captured, whether she is carrying Nick's child, or whether she encounters any of the other characters again. The rather negative portrayal of most of the characters reflects the negative aspects of the work, such as the brutality of the regime and its people, the 'weakness' and capitulation of Janine and the rather foolhardy defiance (admired, certainly, but hardly conductive to survival) of Moira, and also Offred's procrastination.While I first read the book when I was about 15 (and took it literally - so I had nightmares for a week), it's probably better to wait a couple of years (I'm 17 now), before one can be more aware of the use of metaphor and symbolism of the work,the poetic quality, and the exaggeration (at least I hope its so) of Gilead so we can examine the world more critically.I would recommend this book to (almost) everyone, but I doubt it is meant as an 'easy' summer read, or to be taken at face value."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I thought that The Handmaid's Tale was an incredible book. I think that Atwood made many comparisons and analogies to actual events and occurrences in her book. One such comparison is to the Holocaust. The narrator (later renamed Offred) was somewhat oblivious to the changes going on in her world just before the Gileadean revolution took place-- just like many people did not pay much attention to the things that were being done to non-Aryans just before the Concentration Camps, etc were constructed. Another important analogy in The Handmaid's Tale is obvious-- Atwood has created Gilead to mirror Puritan society. There are many proofs of this comparison-- the existence of a theocracy, the prevalence of public punishment ceremonies, the labeling of anyone who does not readily conform to the standard codes of behavior of the society.. the list goes on and on. Thirdly, Atwood creates an analogy between an overly-leftist society and a society which is severly dominated by the Religious Right. Atwood shows that these societies are both dangerous-- the overly-leftist society led to the inception of Gilead, an oppressive, reactionary theocracy. Aesthetically, I thought the book was amazing. I love the way in which Atwood uses minute details to convey a huge impact. And the book was creative temporally as well, effectively and effortlessly shifting between different times and places. I never had any problems following along with the story. A few people have said that The Handmaid's Tale moved slowly at first, and I disagree with that. From the first pages of the novel, I was sucked into Offred's story and could hardly put the book down. The Handmaid's Tale is truly an important novel for everyone to read-- I think that Atwood wonderfully constructed a story that cautions us against assuming that history cannot repeat itself and I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

It is filled with one cliche such as looking/gazing as a form of power to more cliches such as the wall where executed dissidents are hung. Plotwise, the book chronicles a birthgiver in a fabled but familiar society where birthrates cannot replenish the population. Women in this society are second rate citizens who have very formal and subordinate roles. Sex and romance are prohibited and men are the powerholders. Her imagery is interesting at times and so is her use of color but I find her writing very self conscious. Moreover, the interesting elements of her book, the fable structure and color imagery disappear in the second half of the book and is replaced by rather tired episodes of underground bars, etc. If someone can explain to me how this is a great book worthy of study, please let me know. Otherwise, those looking for more allegorical, visual, and mythlike structures, read Borges, Calvino, Marquez, etc."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Offred, the narrator of the novel, is a Handmaid, or live in surrogate for a couple that are unable to have a child. There are scores of Handmaids in this town located somewhere in the US northeast, and each are assigned to a family. They have very limited rights and can only go certain places at certain times with certain individuals. Life is governed largely by religion, but only a certain and conservative type of Christianity. There is no religious or personal freedom. The Handmaids dress all in red with white wings attached that prevent them from making eye contact with others. They are discouraged from conversing with others. And they only have three attempts to bear a family a child or they will be banished, or worse, killed.This is the story of Offred and her experiences living with the family of her Commander. She chronicles her life as a Handmaid with glimpses back into her life before the country took such a drastic turn. We learn, through her, what it is like to be a female in this situation and the frustrations that come to her because of the limits that have been placed. She also explains how some find a way around the rules, but that everyone basically lives in fear of being wrongly persecuted and put to death.This book was very strange for me. An extremely interesting concept was lost for me in the format. The author mixes Offred's present day experiences with her past within single chapters and often with confusing transition. And the true nature of what is actually going on is revealed so slowly that the first third of the book was simply confusing. This novel strikes me as the type that is often made a part of literature classes while leaving many students confused and in the dark. The ending felt even more disjointed than the majority of the book and left me wondering about the stability of the author.I realize this is a highly acclaimed novel, but it simply did not find a fan in me.

In the books that I normally read there has always been a name for the main character, but not this time. Reminds me of those &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; books of the 80's.

It was a welcome relief from the endless parade of books in school that focus on race (Black Boy, The Joy Luck Club, Bless Me Ultima) and one that foucsed on the writing and emotions. As for criticisms about repetition, Atwood used it to get the reader to understand that Offred's was unimaginably boring, but some were, again, just looking for an action story.

I wish it were more civilized. I wish it showed me in a better light, if not happiness, then at least more active.&quot; So says master writer Margaret Atwood regarding her tour de force, The Handmaid's Tale. Set in the future (in what is currently Massachusetts), Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is the chilling portrayal of a totalitarian society as told through the eyes of a Handmaid named Offred. Offred, who can remember the time when she had a home, a husband and a daughter, now serves as a &quot;birth vessel&quot; and is valued only for her powers of reproduction.Offred (her name was derived from &quot;of&quot; and the name of her own Commander, &quot;Fred&quot;) is forced to live her life in a new dictatorship called the Republic of Gilead. Offred is allowed to leave her Commander's home only once each day; her freedom, like that of other ordinary civilians, has been stripped from her and she exists at the mercy of the heads of state who are known as the Commanders.The Republic of Gilead, however, is a society in the midst of crisis. Its land and atmosphere have been polluted by nuclear waste and all but a handful of the population has been rendered barren. Those infertile women, women who will never, or never again, reproduce, are known as &quot;Unwomen,&quot; and are sent to the Colonies where they must toil as laborers with no privileges, working to clean up the nuclear waste. The only exceptions are the infertile Wives of the Commanders. Women lucky enough to still retain their fertility, like Offred, are considered a treasured &quot;object&quot; of society and one whose role is to bear children for the Wives of the Commanders who cannot. In the Republic of Gilead they have a saying, &quot;There's no such thing as a sterile man...there are only women who are barren.&quot; Offred, though, knows that in this nuclear aftermath, sterile men do, indeed, exist, and so she prays for a baby; not a baby that she, herself, wants to love, but one that will keep her from the dreaded fate of the &quot;Unwomen.&quot;Many of the events in The Handmaid's Tale are derived from the biblical story of Leah and Rachel and Atwood has chosen to use many biblical names throughout the book. There are Handmaids and Marthas, Angels and Guardians and many others.The Handmaid's Tale is written in Atwood's masterful prose but this is not a linear tale. Be prepared to drop back in time, then flash forward, then drop back again. The writing, though, flows effortlessly and Atwood, as always, manages to keep readers riveted to the page.Although many people might feel that The Handmaid's Tale is too futuristic to be plausible, many of the events depicted have happened or are happening somewhere in the world at this very moment. It doesn't take more than a few minutes to recall places where gender discrimination and human rights have all but been stripped away. Atwood, herself, said, &quot;One of the things I avoided doing was describing anything in the novel that didn't happen in this world.&quot;Chilling, moving, vivid, terrifying and sometimes even humorous, The Handmaid's Tale is a profoundly moral story. It is a true masterpiece of power and grace that will someday attain the status of a classic."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book was very thought provoking. How could we live in a world like that with all we know now? A book well worth reading. One of the best books I've read in a while."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Experiencing a world that people can only imagine was a feeling brought forth when experiencing this fine novel. Set in a new world called Gilead (once the US), Margaret Atwood portrays a society run by men, with women as subservient creatures. This novel is a fictional journal of a girl named Offred (pronounced Of-Fred). Offred is a handmaid in Gilead who becomes an unhuman figure of her Commander, Fred. This novel brings insight into what a world would be like if ran by men and left in the hands of men. Most people, including myself, would consider this novel a feminist novel, although, Margaret Atwood contributes numerous other style elements. Incorporated into this novel includes themes of self-knowledge and a presence of gothic imagery of the way the government controls womens lives. In this new society there are classes of women. No longer are women equal. They are divided into the Handmaid's, there purpose is only to create new humans; Martha's, the maid's of the houses; Aunt's, teachers and in charge of Handmaid's; and Wives, they are married to the Commander's and basically sit at home doing nothing. The men also have ranks, yet all of them over-power the women. In this novel, every page thats read wants you wanting more and I can turthfully say that whoever reads this will not want to put the book down. The reader will experience the day to day life of the main character Offred. It's as if you are really there experiencing it. The vivid descriptions of the house she lives in and the way she describes the city paints numerous pictures in the readers mind. In this novel, you will experience different characters, such as Nick, Ofglen, The Wife, and The Commander, which are emanate objects in Offred's life. The descriptions of these characters are wonderfully written. Motifs of flowers and nature make the reader feel comfortable and at home, while the motifs of dark colors and wilting flowers makes the book even more intense, if thats even possible. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good reading and likes such books as &quot;Brave New World&quot; or &quot;1984&quot; or even if they enjoy books that show courageous women struggling to live in a twisted world. It is said that Margaret Atwood wrote this book to convey a satirical message of a subservient world where women do not have the right to read, write, vote, hold jobs, or do anything thats commen in our world today. Some might say that this book is patterned after a Puritan world. Although the women have no place but in the home in this novel, they are protected from such evils and the secular world that once was, since anything secular was demolished. A perfect world is what the men in Gilead had hoped to create, did they succeed? Did Offred gain her freedom? Well, i guess you'll just have to read &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; to find out. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Words are items that can effect us individually in many different ways. I say thankfully it's just words because one can learn a great deal from reading Atwood's text. Offred is in limbo and realistic to anyone who reads the story. What's scary is the fact that the scenes in the book are far too real and transport the reader to a place they can easily escape from, unlike Offred. Thankfully the book is composed of words that we can learn from. This is a book you'll want to put down in horror and pick up the very next second in intrigue. A must in any library or future generations."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In a time of reading one paperback fiction book after another, The Handmaid's Tale is an awakening.

This book was on my AP English summer reading list and happened to be the first one I decided to read. Once I started reading I was hooked. I loved the way that this society, although extremely different from the society that we live in, started out just like ours. The irony of it is, that Atwood based this book on historical fact. We could end up like the Republic of Gilead. Hopefully, that won't happen. This book was the most unique portrayal of the future that I've ever been exposed to.

This is a kind of dystopia that I wish had been explored a little more, so we could get a clearer idea of how the changes came about, especially with the names like Offred. The government in here is horrifying, they even encourage a sort of illiteracy by using pictures instead of words, and sterile women have basically no value.

It's still a good book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Some of the other reviewers complained that it was boring listening to the main character's thought processes.

I found myself unable to put it down, and read it in one sitting, but the ending left me wanting some relief from the situation Offred was in. I definitely had some emotional responses to the story. It was frustrating what the government was doing to the rights of women, backpedaling on hundreds of years of work seemingly within moments. Also, I was waiting for an answer for the tough circumstances Offred was in, and there seemed to be no end to her suffering. Overall, I think the ending was left unwritten so that the reader could decide Offred's fate.

A haunting dystopia that will stay with you. I have read it several times - still feels prescient."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale knows no boundaries taking the suppression of woman as sex slaves to the extremity of reproductive Handmaids. Dictated by the totalitarian Republic of Gilead, Atwood's Ofglen restricts the readers to sympathize with her struggles and concerns with reoccurring flashbacks to her lost identity amidst the constant turmoil of her role as Handmaid. Her internal conflicts dealing with her resignation within the dystopia is further enhanced by her willpower and determination to escape.Masterfully plotted, symbolically insinuated, The Handmaid's Tale evokes a sense of hope and liberation through the drastic turn of events by juxtaposing the confines to which Ofglen is valued based on the functionality of her uterus. Through constrained and controlled diction, Atwood forces the readers to experience Ofglen's perspective limiting them to seeing the Republic in a disjointed narrative. Provoking senses of regret, lust, and longing, Atwood stresses the depressing and heartbreaking position in which Ofglen is condemned to. Love is forbidden to her, simple pleasures are refused to her, and all she can do is wait, wait for her impregnation by a man she doesn't even love nor care for. Ofglen is truly a tragic character, yet her resigned attitude in the beginning makes the conclusion even more riveting and climatic. Leaving her fate as ambiguous stresses Ofglen's escape of a past she has no place in and Ofglen's embrace of a future she is unconsciously willing to pursue. Eliciting finality, Atwood's emphasizes Ofglen's willingness to accept her fate of a new beginning or end. She knows no fear but rather clenches onto hope as she is carried off in the black van.Inciting rage, frustration, sympathy, and relief, Atwood's Handmaid's Tale monumentally constructs a thought-provoking account that is both intriguing and all-too realistic. Her syntax blossoms the barren and fruitful emotions that consumes Ofglen; in addition to the constant strife of self-identity. Throughout the novel, Atwood builds upon the multi-faceted persona of Ofglen, unfolding her identity bit by bit. This novel both mentally and psychologically stimulates the readers to feel for Ofglen and her subservient role.The Handmaid's tale brilliantly encapsulates an array of emotional turmoil, leaving an aftertaste of satisfaction and completion in the conclusion. This book displays the true ingenuity of Atwood and her stylistically engaging syntax, allowing the plot to bloom into a novel of hope and acceptance; truly an embryonic gem within a dystopia collection."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is without a doubt one of the best books of all time. The US government has been crippled by nuclear war and overthrown by a Christian Theocracy, which subjugates women and persecutes anyone who does not subscribe to the stated belief system. It's strict and secluded. The theocracy claims to protect its people, its women from how the world used to abuse them through rape and sexualization, by blaming the women and then perpetuating a worse sort of lifestyle. This book focuses on the story of one Handmaid, Offred (a name given to her after becoming a Handmaid). You can tell that Atwood is coming out of the feminist movement, as well as the backlash against feminism... Serena Joy was a lot like Phyllis Schlafly, who was quite vocal in her sense of traditionalism for women (and popularly, her stop ERA movement). Offred wasn't born a Handmaid; she remembers what life was like before and how the US changed. Much like the political apathy of today, most people in the US just slept or shrugged their shoulders, convinced that their world would go back to normal soon enough. By then, it was too late. Atwood's way of drawing out Offred's emotions, of putting visuals and sensations captivated me. I couldn't put this book down it was that addictive. I really felt what Offred was feeling and I understood why and how she came to be what she was. I only hope that the ending is what I believe."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Even if Ms Atwood claims this book is \\"main fiction\\", there is no doubt in my mind that it has all the traits of very good sci-fi.It is a dystopia depicting a very stark upcoming, but not impossible in occurrence.In a not so far future, a theocratic government has taken power over USA using violent methods. The new society is shaped as a patriarchal hierarchy, relegating women to a very subordinate position. One step after other this totalitarian government has banned gays, other religious groups and political dissidents.The story is told by a Handmaid that is to say a fertile woman used as an official concubine by high ranking officials. Women have been stratified in rigid classes: Wives & Daughters, Handmaids, Marthas, Aunts and Housewives. Each class has its codified role and attributes under constant surveillance of males. Males are also stratified: Commanders, Angels, Eyes and Guards. They also are subjected to very strict behavior codes. Any intent of deviation is harshly punished.The Diary gives the reader inkling into the new society and how it came into existence, but not a detailed and complete picture, rendering the novel very believable and interesting.Ms. Atwood prose is very ascetic; short phrases devoid of adjectives gives her novel a very special taste. The reader is introduced into this stark universe little by little and the whole image takes some time to be grasped. As a final result a griping tale emerges.This novel has been compared, deservedly, with Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" and in my view it stands to par with them.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"A Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is an amazing book! This book is a very good read, and keeps you on your toes. This book describes things that we only fear. The mere thought of all of these horrible events happening in real life, is what keeps you involved in this book. This book is not an easy book to read. You have to be avidly reading to catch some of the vital clues in this book.Atwood describes some of the most horrible treatment that a woman would have to go through. She does it in such vivid detail that it catches you off guard. As Offred, an oppressed Handmaid, lets her mind travel through time, you see the events that are happening right now in real life. However, when she comes back to reality you see how horrible life for her really is. Offred explains how our society becomes such a horrible place. You get to see all of the things that we take for granted each day are what Offred wants the most."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's TaleThe Handmaid's Tale, By Margaret Atwood, focuses on the life of the handmaid, Offred. Offred lives in a futuristic, male-dominated, religious society (reminiscent of Orwell's 1984) where sterility is common. The handmaids are women with healthy ovaries who are rotated through wealthy households, with the goal being a child for the wealthy couple to raise. Offred tells her story directly to the reader focusing on her life in the past, with her husband and child, and her life in the present, in the household with her \\"Commander\\" and his wife. This book explores many themes, including religion, totalitarian government, gender roles and sexuality. Overall this book very effectively conveys these themes and I found it very well written.Margaret Atwood uses many techniques to achieve the ultimate message found in this book. First, Atwood draws the reader into the life of the main character Offred. Offred is a character that most women can relate to. Before the revolution that toppled government as we know it, Offred was a young mother who had recently married. She was an average American woman. When the government is overthrown by the religious group known as the \\"Eyes,\\" she loses the freedoms she had always taken for granted. Atwood this novel in the style of a recorded diary, the reader is pulled into the story because of the sense of urgency created. \\"I must be telling it to someone. You don't tell a story only to yourself. There's always someone else\\" (40).Another way the Atwood makes this book exciting is through her writing style. The author uses short chapters and mixes memories in with the current action, creating a present plot and a past plot. This shows that the main character was denied any personal time in which she could have made a formal diary. Some of the writing is also a stream-of-conscious style that helps to show the pain that Offred goes through to recount some of her horrible memories. \\"In Hope. Why did they put that above a dead person? Was it the corpse hoping, or those still alive?\\" (106). The writing style effectively captures the emotions of a person deprived of all freedom. The characterization of Offred overall conveys Atwood's themes of male-domination and the effect it has on the victims.Secondly, the author effectively draws parallels between the society Offred lives in and the society of modern America. Americans gained rights during the twentieth century through the civil rights movement and through the efforts of feminist activists. The society in the book represents a backlash on those ideas. The men who run the government (called the \\"Eyes\\") are against everything gained in these movements. \\"It was after the catastrophe, when they shot the president and machine-gunned Congess and the army declared a state of emergency. They blamed it on Islamic fanatics, at the time\\" (174). The \\"Eyes\\" can also be seen as a representation of the \\"religious right\\" which is currently gaining support in modern America. There are many people in this country, who, like the government in this book, believe that morals should be enforced through law.Thirdly, Atwood also uses these societal parallels to attack certain aspects of American society that could ultimately lead to the type of backlash that occurred in the book. One of the problems that the author identifies is credit. Offred describes that in the time before the overthrow of the American government, everyone had stopped using paper money. Everything was paid for on credit. \\"I guess that's how they were able to do it, in the way they did, all at once, without anyone knowing beforehand. If there had still been portable money, it would have been more difficult\\" (174). By identifying problems that the reader can relate to, this book stays engaging and conveys the themes of religion and government (and their connections).Although this book is written very realistically, there are a couple of points that Atwood has glossed over. For example, when she describes the takeover of the government, Atwood does not go into the detail that is expected when compared to the other subjects that she covers in detail. The reason may be that how the government was overthrown is not really the issue; it is what happens afterward that is vital to the book. Still, including the description of the takeover in more detail could have brought up more points supporting her themes including the government and the religious fanatics who end up in power.Altogether, this book achieves the ultimate goal in literature. It effectively conveys the author's opinions on the themes that she chose to include and keeps the reader's interest at the same time. Atwood does this through her use of characters and the fictional society that she creates. This society is an extreme backlash to the freedoms we enjoy today. This book leaves the reader feeling scared for their own future."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, is the story of Offred who once lived a normal life with her husband Luke and her daughter. After trying to escape from a changing world, then taught her about the new world around her and her new role in it, Offred was brought to a family. Her sole job is now to become pregnant; every month the captain tries to impregnate her. The reason that this is her job is because the number of children being born each year is decreasing at an alarming rate and they now believe this is the only way to solve the problem. Offred's life is sad and boring until her relationship with the captain changes and his wife makes an interesting proposition.I believe that this novel created controversy because of the role of women in this world. All of the \\"lower\\" class women, like Offred, are basically prostitutes without the pleasure. They offer a sexual service in return for payment, but this payment is in the form of providing the basic necessities of life, such as room, board, food and health care. Many people might have a problem with this novel because of the moral and sexual questions that it raises. The women, like Offred are alive for one reason, only to have children that will be taken away from them and treated like the children of their captain and his wife. Once the women have given birth, they will leave and go to a new family that needs a child. I do not have a problem with this novel. I see it as a warning to the society and the world that women need power but we can not let men do nothing because they do not help to further the society. This novel is simply a warning that changes may not seem drastic in the beginning but slowly they will change our whole way of life.I think that his novel has positively contributed to the literary world because it has allowed other controversial novels about women to come out and be published. It has allowed other \\"warning\\" novels about women to be published. I would recommend this novel but it is not for everyone. If you do choose to read this novel, approach it with an open mind and it will evoke some interesting feelings.

It is an imaginative, thought-provoking story. Offred is a handmaid and servant to the Commander in the Republic of Gillead, a dystopian society with a rapidly depleting population. Individual thought is not allowed, and pleasure is prohibited. The job of the Handmaids is to become impregnated to counteract the population loss, and to be obedient to the innumerable restrictions of the society. However, Offred feels confined and ultimately goes with her true beliefs, even with the high risks involved. I enjoyed this book a lot because it caused me to think about the freedom that we so often take for granted- the freedom to express individuality and a difference of opinion. Although it has a complex plot and meaning, The Handmaid's Tale is certainly enjoyable to read.By Michelle Lanham"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was skeptical about reading this novel, particularly because I had never read anything by Margaret Atwood and could not compare it to any of her other works.

The way that Atwood portrays Offred in a very real and true sense is one of the many techniques that she uses to keep the reader interested. This novel is one that anyone can relate to, not because of the characters circumstances, but because of the personlaity of the character. If there is only one novel to read this year, this would be on my top ten list."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I would recommend reading the Handmaid's Tale, but don't expect to be blown away. The plot moves very slowly, and little changes about the main character's situation throughout the novel. I often felt bored, and it was hard to feel suspenseful. Unlike many other dystopian novels, there is nothing heroic about the main character which makes it harder to root for her and to feel personally connected to her. Also, the government and the history of Gilead are never given a full explanation. The explanation that is given has a lot of holes. For example Atwood writes that in the former United States there was a massive terrorist attack in which the president and most of congress was killed. The government then declares martial law and ignores people's constitutional rights in the name of safety, which is easy enough to envision. What doesn't make sense is that it then jumps directly to the government stripping the rights of women, something that doesn't seem like the next logical course of action. Sometimes it also feels like the issue of feminism is overplayed which takes away from the big picture, that a totalitarian regime is taking away everyone's rights.However, the message in this novel alone is enough to make it worth reading. It shows the danger of people blindly believing what they are told. It shows how small injustices need to be stopped immediately or else they will build up into something much worse. There is definitely a theme of antitheism in this novel. Atwood shows the true danger of religion in government, while exposing the hypocrisy of many current religions. So, overall not an incredible book but definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Narrator had a resigned tone. I kept reminding myself that this ridiculously misogynistic society is reality for many women living in other countries. I never quite found myself in love with Offred, but that's all right; she was supposed to have been stripped of what made her unique in the past life. I kept wishing she would say more about her daughter, but the book was staying true to the numbing effect of her training. Speed-read the last chapter, and the end was completely open. Liked that. All in all, left me a little cold, but I won't forget it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I had seen the movie and was intrigued by the setup, which has been explained by many reviewers. I was pulled into the story for awhile. It unfolds very slowly and held me in a kind of suspended disbelief. But then it began to feel as if there was too little plot. It was all about being alienated; variations on the theme of alienation, loss, tricks of memory, coping by obliterating yourself. If the prose had been truly breathtaking, that might work, but it wasn't. It's good, but I needed more happening, more insight into the situation and into the main character herself, other than these memories colored by her grieving for her old life.What I liked was the way she painted a very detailed world in her description of what they wore, the streets, the way familiar buildings were used for new purposes, the food, things like that. Also, her explanation of how the new government took over was very interesting and made me worry about how we are entrusting so much of our lives to computers, losing control in the process and making ourselves vulnerable in so doing.But many aspects of Gilead are only described in broad brush, and therefore left unexplained. I kept waiting for more detail about what was really going on, who was in charge, what was the vision of the leaders, why some women were 'wives' and others 'handmaidens' and others 'econowives', what conferred status, what exactly the Commander did, were they aiming to take over more than the US, etc, but there was no further explanation.I think this a case of a great idea for a book that has nowhere to go once the setup is done. Oddly, the movie was a bit more interesting. It took out the little bit of plot, added to it, heightened the romance, and made it more of a story than a diatribe on the dangers of political extremism."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"\\"In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from. Don't underrate it.\\"The world of the near-future has changed. Women are no longer free, independent thinkers; now, they are segregated into tasks. Wives, Marthas, Handmaids, Econowives. This is the world, Offred, a Handmaid, now lives in. This is the world she must survive.This is an amazing book. With all these dystopian novels rushing to print, with more thought to romantic pairings than to the actual dystopian society they live in, it's refreshing to read something like \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\", a tale that wonderfully, yet scarily, dictates a future in which women's liberties are virtually gone.We see this scary world through Offred's eyes. Once upon a time, she was married, had a child, but that is all gone. What keeps her going is the memories of the time before: the time where she fell in love with a man, where she had friends, such as Moira, where she had a job and an education and a life of her own. I enjoyed learning about her past, how she got to be a Handmaid, how she survived the day-to-day ritual. Offred is a strong woman, more than all these nearly masculine \\"action girls\\" we see so much these days. She has a strength of character, a strength of heart that carries her through this novel, that keeps her alive.The world that Atwood paints is, unlike many dystopian novels (the one I'm thinking of is Divergent), startlingly convincing. I could believe that religious zealots could take over, that they would try to solve the population problems by resorting to the Old Testament stories. I could believe the divisions in women's roles, their freedoms being stripped away. I could believe the drastic measures against those that defied the rules. Atwood has done an amazing job of finding what is most important, what makes a society work and has brought that forth in a changed view. And her creation is most terrifying. It could easily be me in Offred's shoes. It could be me that suddenly has no job, that suddenly has to rely on men for money, that suddenly is torn away from my family and friends, that suddenly is trained and indoctrinated into being nothing more than a body to get pregnant.If I have any faults with this book, it's the speed with which this society has taken root. I understand that it is still in rebellion with the surrounding areas, but I still thought it strange that almost overnight the government is in the Religious Reformists' hands. I know these things can come quickly, but still, I felt it almost weird.The other fault I do have is I found the story somewhat hard to follow, since Offred slips between present and past quite fluidly. I listened to this on audiobook and had to constantly backtrack to figure out where I was. Oh, and the narrator, with her rising pitch at the end of nearly every sentence (even when it isn't a question), was annoying. I am still not sure what she was trying to do with that.This is one of those books you should read before you die, even if you aren't a science fiction/dystopia/speculative fiction fan. This book gives insights into our society today, shines a light on what is important, and warns of what could come in the future.Nolite te bastardes carborundorumBrought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margret Atwood created a complex dystopian world for her novel A Handmaids Tale. This story portrays a disturbing world where religious fanatics have taken control of the United States and the birth rate has vanished because of pollution. In the Republic of Gilead women have been stripped of most rights and many are forced to become \\"Handmaids\\", mandatory surrogate mothers for the leaders of Gilead. Atwood's brilliant novel discusses many intricate topics through the eyes of her narrator Offred. She uses Offred's unique perspective on the world to show readers the effects of living in this carnivalesque world and its perspectives on survival, loneliness, and extremists.Offred describes in great detail how the religious government has stripped her freedoms away. She has been placed into the role of a servant and silent sex slave; she owns no property, not even her own body for that belongs to her Commander. This novel conveys her loneliness and sadness while still showing the strength she has to survive. She survives by withdrawing inside herself, speculating on the future, and remembering the past. Everyday she remembers her past life with her husband and her young daughter; this gives her strength that she might see them again. Even though the despair creeps around every corner Offreds inner monologue and her off-beat sarcastic humor keeps her sane and the reader interested.Along those lines one of the most interesting aspects of this novel is Offreds narration. Her complex thoughts and the structure of her language creates a novel that places the reader directly into the mind of a unique character. Through her words we can understand how she has come to terms with her difficult existence, \\"I wait. I compose myself. My self is a thing I must now compose, as one composes a speech. What I must present is a made thing, not something born,\\"(66). Her inner voice gives her strength to survive each day even though the weight of this religiously charged world crashes against her. Offreds distinct perspective as a handmaid later reveals the hypocrisy of the ultra Christian society.Margaret Atwood uses her novel as a vessel to speak against the dangers of extremism. Atwood does not have issues with Christianity even though the government in this novel is based off of an ultra Orthodox Christian sect. She chose a Christian form of extremism because of all forms of extremism Christianity would be the most likely to be accepted in the United States. The novel speaks how the rights of humans become violated when one radical faction gains control over the majority.This novel stands out amongst others because of its powerful message, complex narration and captivating story. Atwood keeps the novel interesting at every page as the reader learns more and more about this mysterious world and its strange customs and as the reader experiences the horror that Offred must survive. The novel also has socio-historical context as well because it is comparable to modern countries where woman have had their rights stripped away. I would highly recommend this novel to any of my friends or family."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I started reading this book and was immediately consumed by it's compelling narrative - it's a page turner alright, but then it started to get weirdly sexual, and I was like, What am I reading? Is this some sort of 'adult' themed fantasy? Why did amazon recommend this to me? I put down the book and did a quick wiki search on it (which most smart people do before purchasing, oh well ...) and find out it's quite the literary achievement. Side note - wiki is a spoiler alert, it gives away everything. Anyways, as the book went on the weird sexiness calmed down and a very entertaining story emerged. I found myself speed reading through some of the lengthy descriptions to get on with the story but I have no patience, so most won't be bothered by that. Great book, lots of fun, enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book is a helluva introduction to Margaret Atwood. 'Handmaid's Tale' seems to me like a dystopian unbaby ofGeorge OrwellandVirginia Woolf. Very stylized, very provoking, spooky but at the same time not scary. I think for its punches to really land, you have to be a woman. I liked how the novel's narrative was structured, complete with the metafictional epilogue."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This untidy tale of a new society fuels a polarizing debate: Are women better off in a world where they are free of objectification, safe from rape, protected and revered, but have no freedom whatsoever? It's terrifying in its occasional brush with a reality that isn't so hard to imagine. What if the U.S. president and all of Congress were collectively assassinated? It was unthinkable when I first read this novel for a Canadian literature class in the late '80s, but not so hard to picture now.One thing Margaret Atwood masters is the ability to drop the reader directly into the Republic of Gilead and let him or her figure out the rules and regulations as the story unfolds. Nearly every scene is unsettling and disturbing. Newborn infants are rare and priceless, and the description of those that aren't perfect -- as \\"shredders\\" -- is among the most squirm-inducing."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I can't really add anything to the other great reviews of this book. But I found the themes to be similar to The Iron Heel by Jack London, which was also outstanding, and could have been an inspiration for The Handmaid's Tale."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Especially with what's going on with the Taliban. Reading it will ensure that you never take your freedom lightly again."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"Learned to read the New Testament by reading Dr. Dobson's Koine text. As one recovering from a brain injury, a person can gain much by reading Dr. Dobson's books...(Hebrew and Greek) Still working through the Hebrew text but it is written in the same straight-forward manner as his Greek text (further adventures in neuroplasticity)"},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"I was particularly interested in the CD, but found it extremely disappointing. The readers sounded bored and very American. There was no \\"teaching\\" attached to the CD, just reading words and paragraphs in uninspired voices.The cover claims one could start reading meaningful verses after just 2 hours. After 2 hours I was still struggeling to decipher the differences in the Hebrew letters.If someone wants a reference book to the language, this works fine. But it has a weakness in its teaching sequence. A lot of steps are missing."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"As a Bible student, this has been a great help."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"I first studied biblical Hebrew in college forty years ago. Hebrew is so very different from Western European languages that it was hard for me to wrap my mind around it. Dobson's book aims at making the study of Hebrew fun and at giving the student success each step of the way. He aims to get the student reading worthwhile sentences and many of them as soon as possible. It is still the learning of a language, so it is not a \\"for dummies\\" project. But, Dobson presents the most frequent verb forms first and gets those drilled into the student's mind so they become very familiar. He does this rather than the approach used by Weingreen in my college class in which the student memorizes all forms in a paradigm and then later tries to pull some meaning out of the paradigms in the experience of translating. I especially like the audio CD. It allows the student to engage hearing as well as seeing in fixing a lesson in the mind. Dobson attempts to use current understanding of how one learns in order to make the material familiar territory for the student. I think I might not have let my Hebrew lapse over the decades had I learned with an approach like Dobson's the first time.I have the advantage of using this book for a review and refresher. I already remember some vocabulary and some grammar. I can tell that makes using Dobson's book easier than it might be for a newbie to Hebrew. I would be curious to observe someone with no Hebrew who learns it with Dobson's approach. Still, the results he describes in the introduction are impressive. He speaks of students who struggled with Hebrew winning awards for their progress when they began to use his approach."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"Mr. Dobson teaches in a way that is both very informative, and often humorous. By the completion of this book, I had translated the book of Jonah, as well as passages from nearly every book in the Old Testament. I would highly recommend this book to someone who wants to learn Biblical Hebrew, even if you (as I did) already have some knowledge of the language. This is truly a profound book. I learned much more than I expected to learn when I bought this book. My only complaint, is that the meanings listed for words are in (abstract) english, such as the Hebrew word \\"chai\\" which Mr. Dobson says means \\"life\\" which it does, but the word actually means \\"stomach\\" and was a Hebrew sign of life. Though you would rarely even consider translating the word as \\"stomach\\" it is nice to know the ancient meanings behind the Hebrew your reading... still, a very good book."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"The Dobson book takes more of an \\"immersion\\" approach to teaching Hebrew in that it jumps right into speaking and reading Hebrew, without making the distinctions in syntax and grammar. For me this has been a very helpful 2nd year Hebrew grammar book. I used Kelley's Biblical Hebrew for my first year. Dobson makes a lot of assumptions and glosses over a lot of things that, I think, would have been very confusing if I had used it in my introduction year to Hebrew. But, knowing what I now know about the Hebrew language (which is not a lot!), Dobson's book serves to get me going on actually reading and listening to Hebrew. The companion CD with this book is a MUST HAVE!!Overall, it's a good book. But I would not recommend this for a solo beginning Hebrew grammar. It should be paired with a book like Kelley's Biblical Hebrew to give the best results."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"I've been using this book for about 5 months now to learn Hebrew from scratch. Been going rather slowly through it (I'm in no hurry), and although the lessons do go at a fairly fast pace, you can take your time through them (I'm currently 1/3 through the book). There is some repetition of words, to help you review along the way. Having no prior knowledge of Hebrew (but having learned other languages), this book is wonderful. The CD is quite beneficial too. Writing Hebrew is not stressed much in this book--just learning to read and speak Hebrew, using passages from the Bible."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"This review is based on my personal experience, I do not have the qualification for a technical rating of this work. Having this statement in mind I recommend other students John H. Dobson's \\"Learn Biblical Hebrew\\" as a rapid and efficacious method to grasp the essencials of this difficult, but rewarding language. An immersion in biblical hebrew is an irreplaceable tool to better enjoy and understand the Old Testament, the unfolding of the living message that came to us by means of the writings of many sons of Israel during centuries of agitated history. Dobson's system of learning, on the other hand, demands tough dedication from the student. The rapid pace of the work takes the learner's language skills for granted. If you are not skillful enough to catch the subject you would be stuck for weeks in the same lesson. Of great help is the CD provided with the book, it enables you to get the ear training on the unfamiliar sounds of this semitic tongue, so remote from our closer indo-european superfamily of languages. The presentation of the alphabet in the first chapter is a challenging but unavoidable step in the process of learning. Again, dedication and hard working are necessary to take the most from this work. Doing so is the key to a successful introduction to the amazing benefit of reading the word of God in the original language."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"I heard about this book from a fellow linguist who has been using this method to lead translation seminars overseas. I'm delighted with Dobson's approach. He lays out the course in a way similar to the best approaches to learning modern languages: slow immersion and lots of repeated, comprehensible input, with exercises that solidify the learning and allow the student to \\"think Hebrew\\".My only complaint is that the initial introduction to reading and pronouncing Hebrew is terribly confusing. Most pronunciations described by comparison to English words, which vary by region, and the sounds that do not occur in English were confusingly described. An audio resource on the CD would have been more helpful to a general audience; an IPA chart or a straightforward phonetic description would have been more helpful to me. However, once I persevered beyond that first chapter, listening to the CD gave me a better sense of how to pronounce what I was reading. It is unfortunate that this frustrating chapter should be the first one a student encounters, though.Overall, I would heartily recommend Learn Biblical Hebrew for newcomers to the language. Its approach, based on how human beings actually become proficient in language, is humane and not nearly as artificial as most introductions to ancient languages. It is practical to use this text for a solo study, though as with any language-learning endeavor, it would be best used with a mentor or with a group of fellow students."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"This is one of the best methods for introducing Hebrew I have found. Having taken several courses at a local seminary, I bought this to use as a reference. Then after reading the first few lessons, I really wished I'd had this book available when I first started. The author uses a type of immersion style that is really encouraging to new students especially when they start sounding out basic words in the first few pages."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"I have several years of the basics down and gone through other how to learn Biblical Hebrew books, as well as 2 years of University classes on it. I have to stress that I have use several other Biblical Hebrew books, and had no expectation one way or the other of this text. The result however was frustration and constantly having to add corrections in the book. The author lists several advanced examples when explaining other basic examples, and does not explain or mark examples that will be covered several chapters later. Hehs where often printed as Chets, An example of page 5 is not covered until page 13. Two exact same letter and vowel sets on page 13 with different pronunciations. Not properly marked Alephs pronounced as O. Adding the definite article where it is not in the Hebrew. Listing glossary pages incorrectly. Of the 87 books I have on learning Hebrew this book had the most mistakes, I do assume some are printer errors. However I would never recommend this book when there are ones with less errors in them. Even a poorly conceived book that covers very little ground is better than this one, as they are consistent on not wrought with errors. I would recommend Biblical Hebrew, Second Ed. by Victoria Hoffer. Though there are also a few errors in her text, they are all printer errors."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"Like the author's book on New Testament Greek, this book is pretty easy to get into. The CD is fun to listen to. I especially like the voice of the woman who does some of the narration. I feel, however, that some of the diphthongs should have been explained in more detail."},{"Title":"Learn Biblical Hebrew","review":"I have been studying Biblical Hebrew in a recreational fashion for 23 years, and have purchased and studied numerous Biblical Hebrew texts, including Weingreen, Mansoor, and others. Dobson's \\"Learn Biblical Hebrew\\" provides a practical approach to learning the language that does not require the \\"feeling\\" of studying that most other works I have encountered require. I think it is a great book for the layman, or casual learner, who wishes to learn a basic working knowledge of the language without needing to master all of the precise details of grammar and tense. It comes with a companion CD which makes it easy to develop and hone pronunciation as well.I highly recommend this book as one of the best of practice, and recommend his other work, \\"Learn New testament Greek\\" for those wishing a similar approach to Greek.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Weddings Southern Style","review":"I really enjoyed this book and have misplaced my copy.

As a wedding planner, I find it invaluable...I have lost my copy and very much need another!"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"While this book was written over a decade ago, its words still have some real-life meaning and implication. The conspiracy of \\"The Illuminati\\" rings true even in this day and age, and as such, books like this remain relevant. Regardless of what your feelings are on the subject, Larry Burkett has written a very well-thought and intriguing read, which certainly merits recognition among Christian readers. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"I really enjoyed the book. It had action and suspense without vulgar language, inuendo or sexual content or just plain nasty stuff. The late Larry Burkett did an excellent job of describing a pre-raputure world. I just wished he had written more of this kind. What goes on in his work of fiction echoes of what we are seeing now in our world. But his ends happily for a 50 year break before the devil tries again. I fear we will not be as fortunate as the heroes of this book. To get a glimpse of what our world is heading for...I recommend this book. It will make a normal person sit up and take note. Kind of like George Orwell did."},{"Title":"The Illuminati","review":"This is a novel, but boy does it read like something out of today's headlines. Really good stuff.

Nicolle's work answered the mail admirably. The work is exceptionally well composed, indicative of a pleasing format and supporting browsing as well as research. Though the work cannot be called profound, factual information of considerable depth is nevertheless available to the targeted searcher. The book is admittedly weak on the theological underpinnings of the religion, though it nowhere claims to be an exploration of Islam as a religion per se: for such information, may I recommend Michael Jordan's handsome \\"Islam: An Illustrated History\\" (London: Carlton, 2002). I flatly disagree with those who claim that Ruthven's work is superior to Nicolle's: indeed, I found the former to be boring; superficial in its rigid obedience of the two-to-four-pages rule for every article; and, one might say, helter-skelter in its overall organization. While spelling errors in Nicolle (e.g., proselatize for proselytize) and typographical errors do not impress me, I shouldn't be too harsh, given that modern typesetting and typography for the consumption of the demanding twenty-first-century reader present such formidable challenges. (That, and a certain je ne sais quoi that probably deals with some intractable element of depth, justify my withholding of the fifth rating star.) Well done, Dr. Nicolle."},{"Title":"Historical Atlas of the Islamic World","review":"This book is overflowing with beautiful maps, fascinating photos and insightful descriptions. I find Nicolle's Historical Atlas of the Islamic World to be one of the best introductions to the history of the Muslim world. The layout is astounding, and puts much pricier atlases, even the Oxford Atlas of World History, to shame.One should note that this is not just a history of the Muslim religion, but a broad description of the history and culture of Muslim countries, covering Spain, Africa, Central Asia, Southeast Asia and of course the Middle East.Mr. Nicolle's approach to Islam combines sympathy and neutrality. He is obviously one of the most eminent authorities on the Muslim world."},{"Title":"Historical Atlas of the Islamic World","review":"Although obviously intended for high school level, the text presents a great deal of fascinating historical information on the medeival Islamic world (even including the Bulgars, the Timurids, etc.), often rare to find elsewhere; it marks the inadequacy of Islamic studies in English that there are few scholarly books on Islamic history with the same breadth of scope. Although some statements concerning earlier Islamic history run counter to orthodox Muslim belief, the author is undoubtedly one of the best writers of Muslim history. The pictures and maps are also great."},{"Title":"Historical Atlas of the Islamic World","review":"This is an outstanding atlas of an oft-neglected area of history. The details in the maps are unparalleled and ideal for the historian. As a military history enthusiast, additional levels of battle maps would have been wonderful but even without them this is a fine collection with an appropriate level of text subservient to the cartography. Exactly what one would want in such a focused atlas. For more detailed historical and political commentary, you will want to seek out additional books in that genre to complement this atlas."},{"Title":"World Enough and Time: The Life of Andrew Marvell","review":"Marvell's is not an easy life to write. His remarkable caution in a remarkable time led to a dearth of biographical source material. Murray, at times, seems to have limited sympathy for Marvell, and the thinness of his source material sometimes gives the impression of 'slightness' to his treatment. But in the last third of the book, I got a glimpse of a Marvell I'd never seen anywhere else - tough, fearless and at risk in ways we can't imagine. I give the book THREE STARS, but relative to other available biographies on Marvell, it probably deserves FOUR. If you're interested in Marvell, it's well worth reading."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on The Bible","review":"Wow, I really have to say--this is one Cliffs Notes that I can appreciate. It actually has a purpose. This is the perfect book for those of us who are forced by parents and sunday school teachers to read the Bible on penalty of everlasting suffering and torment. I wish this was available when I was growing up...it is the perfect tool to decieve those that would try to force us to read the incomphrensible gibberish that is the Bible. And frankly rounding out at just under 100 pages, I can say that this is about as much of the Bible that I can bear. Easy to read and understand and without the mind-altering, brainwashing side affects. A+, highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on The Bible","review":"I was a good bit confused when I saw that Cliffs Notes had published a Notes on, of all things, the Bible. I mean, coming from someone who reads their Bible often, I never thought someone would need a copy of the Notes to understand the Bible.That being said, I found the Notes interesting, to say the least, but not really saying anything I didn't already know. For those of y'all out there who are having trouble understanding some particular Bible passages, I would recommend this to you... but make sure you've actually read the passage first. You might have learned something- you just didn't know it."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on The Bible","review":"I buy Cliff Notes all the time mainly because of the definitions provided at the end of each few chapters. All Cliff Notes contains definitions to help readers understand the vernacular of that period. Rarely do Cliff Notes give definitions for modern words that we can just look up in the dictionary. More often, definitions are given to explain what words/phrases meant in that books particular time period. For example the term \\"making love\\" today means the physical act of sex, but only 50 years ago it merely meant to woe/court someone into a romantic relationship.Even today.many words/phrases have completely different meanings depending on the country you are in. So I cannot imagine that words and phrases didn't mean something totally different 2000 or so years ago, in a country halfway around the world. Also everytime a book is translated from one language to another, meaning is often lost or changed. If someone from the Christian Era suddenly appeared in todays culture (we'll just assume that they can speak English), I somehow doubt they would understand any of our colloquial expressions. If the Bible Cliff Notes cannot help in these areas, can anyone suggest a book that can? I would merely like to understand what the Bible is trying to say.PLEASE NOTE: MY RATING OF 2 IS ACTUALLY MEANINGLESS.....THAT IS UNLESS THERE ARE NO DEFINITIONS."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on The Bible","review":"What I liked most about the CliffsNotes version of the Bible overThe Complete Idiot's Guide to the Bible, Third EditionandThe Bible for Dummiesis that it takes a no-frills approach. The other two are humorous and certainly entertaining, but also a bit distracting for me.The one drawback I've noticed is that, in true CliffsNotes fashion, these are simply summaries without verse cross-referencing and not quite the step-by-step stories that are given in \\"Dummies\\" and \\"Idiot's\\". I'd say this book would be better suited for those who already know the Bible fairly well to be used for high-level commentary and \\"big picture\\" analysis.While this one is absolutely worth picking up, I'd also recommend getting either of the two others for a more user-friendly tool."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on The Bible","review":"I'm a pastoral studies student and this book has been a jewel for all my related classes.

But Cliff Notes you might ask?Yes, Cliff Notes. If you want a good, concise introduction to the very long, complex and even intimidating book that is the Bible, this is a good one.

And it would have saved me many years of stress while attempting to fit my round peg into too many square holes.The Conative Connection is based on a system to discover our action orientations which are our instinctual methods of 'acting' or performing tasks. The four basic 'action modes' are Fact Finder, Follow Thru, Implementor and Quick Start. There are three levels of performance for each Action Mode. People either insist on one or more of the modes, resist or accommodate.Facilitators are fairly equal in their use of all the action modes. Though some who seem to be this way have actually forced themselves for so long to fit and meet all expectations that they are 'in crises' and no longer recall what their less stressful original orientations were. It seemed to me that any job I had ever had expected everyone to be the same and to be facilitators, therefore creating a lot more stress and burnout than necessary.What I discovered about myself from reading this book confirmed some insights I had had in high school from which I had strayed. More than &quot;What Color is Your Parachute&quot;, this book helped me to get more on track and find a job that was less stressful and more satisfying. The Conative Connection even surpasses the useful &quot;know yourself&quot; information I discovered in &quot;Please Understand Me&quot;(a wonderful book on the Myers/Briggs type and temperament personality test administered by some companies).As Marshall McLuhan said, &quot;Education is a process of shutting off our talents&quot;.

His Billy the Kid helped establish once and for all the legendary status of the Kid. Wyatt Earp reported Burn's first visit to his friend, movie star, Wm. S. Hart, saying he was happily convinced Wyatt would allow him to do his story.Unfortunately, for both Burns and Earp, Wyatt's friend John H. Flood Jr. had just written Wyatt's story, which was being circulated to publishers with the help of Wm. S. Hart. More unfortunately was that Earp loyally declined Burn's offer out of regard for Flood. The rub there turned out to be that Flood obviously couldn't write for beans. (Ask me. I found, bought and published his work after historians had sought for years this rare document, all copies of which had dropped out of sight.) As one editor said of Flood's work, it was \\"stilted and florid and diffuse.\\" That may have been an understatement.In any case, shifty Burns, despite what others have more kindly said about the sequel, tricked Wyatt into thinking he would instead do a book on Wyatt's intimate, Doc Holliday. And under that pretext he got a lot out of Wyatt, and used it to do a book that Wyatt finally concluded, was more about him than Doc. In fact when it occurred to him that he'd been tricked out of what amounted to the most interesting part of his life story he considered suing Burns. His friend Hart encouraged him, and thought he'd probably win big time. But suits cost time and money just as they do today. Moreover, Wyatt was old and tired. So Burns got away with his trickery, and brought out one of the most interesting, and accurate, books on what had gone on during what could be called the Earp, Behan, Clanton, McLaury, Cowboy Gang Feud. Behan was the crooked sheriff in spades. Burns did not learn that beneath much of the violence at Tombstone lay the fact that Wyatt had swiped the sheriff's cute, young, gal, Josephine Sarah Marcus. (Who later became his third and last wife, at least by common-law.) SEE THE STORY OF HER LIFE WITH WYATT ON AMAZON: \\"I MARRIED WYATT EARP.\\"Burns success in portraying things as they were was based on the fact that he found many of the participants still living, just as he had in the case of Billy the Kid. Burns was, however, basically a tenderfoot. For example, while researching Wyatt, an idea for another book occurred to him to cover the shenanigans of the many colorful old timers out in Cochise County, and he proposed to have the father of my old friend Ben Sanders act as his oracle and guide in seeking out old scoundrels. Bill Sanders reaction was: \\"You must be joking. These people are my neighbors!\\" If the implication isn't obvious to law professors from back East and that sort, he meant he'd have to move out if he blew the whistle.In any case, this is a book well worth reading. It's author ended a colorful career shortly after the book came out, by dying quite young. Pity.There is less fiction here than modern writers, who are shot in the pants with debunking, would like us to believe. Burns knew the foremost guide to writing such books was \\"stick to the facts, till you run out of them, and only make up as much as you have to in order to eat regularly.\\" Editorial ethics then and now were much the same. In any case, Burns was not \\"stilted and florid and diffuse.\\"Since Flood's Ms. was not saleable, when Stuart Lake came along a few years later he took it over and made it that way. And Lake's so-called biography of Wyatt is a lot more truth than fiction. Read it, too: WYATT EARP: FRONTIER MARSHAL.Burns was the first of the big name writers that started Wyatt Earp on the trail to fame and eventualy six-shooter Sainthood. I have a notion Wyatt would have liked the money in it, but not necessarily the fuss and bother of meeting celebrity seekers."},{"Title":"Tombstone;: An iliad of the Southwest (Penguin books)","review":"I read somewhere that more movies have been made about Wyatt Earp than all the U.S. presidents combined! There's something about the gunfight at the O.K. Corral that touches the mainspring of American imagination. Tombstone is the book that made Wyatt Earp famous and shaped forever our perception of him. I read Tombstone first when I was in high school back in the 1950s and I've since dipped into it countless times. Some might object to the author's purple prose and made-up dialogue and newer scholarly studies of the Earps and Tombstone may be more accurate and balanced. But Burns drew his material from interviews with old-timers and Tombstone newspapers and I'm confident that he comes about as close to fact as you can get.

Burns takes a more balanced view of both sides in the conflict, exploring their shortcomings and their qualities.

I got an urge to do some research on the OK corral shootout, and this book has a snazzy cover and was well reviewed.I wanted a scholarly type thing, that went into details about the personailties and dynamics of that event. I was delightfully surprized that style of this book is more like the pulp fictionstories popular when it was first publish.The period is covers in detail is sometime shortly after the civil war to the begining of the 1900's. It made me pause and reflect on the conditions of that time, and how a generation that survived our countrys bloodiest and most deadly war adjusted to civilian life. While PTSD has only recently been recongized, I suspect its effects where influencial in the lawlessness and genocide this period is known for.Its not all about Wyatt Earp and Ike Clanton, although they are there, and does endorse this work, but the history of the entire region. It tell hows Tombstone was founded, the men who ran it, and lastly its decline into tourism. Its a story of shoot outs and desperados, boom towns and dance halls, lost treasure and broken dreams.Sorry, I got caught up in it there...its really entertaining.The only real issue I have is that the information is not referanced, so its hard to tell fact from fiction. The sources are readily, from newspaper accounts, court records and first person interviews, but its just not always clearly stated where the facts end and the speculation begins.So yes, its a fun and informative.

Howard, they enlisted the aid of L. Sprague DeCamp and Lin Carter to polish Howard's grammar, soften his more &quot;politically incorrect&quot; statements, and fill out the saga with pastiches. This, the last of the stories, is 100% pastiche, but it still has the flavor of Howard's barbarian. I first read it as a teenager, but now that I have passed the half century mark, the story has new resonance. In this adventure Conan anticipates George Foreman by several millenia. He may be old; he may not be the man he once was; but he can still outmuscle most foes, and those he can't outmuscle, he can outfox. At the conclusion of the book you might just get a little misty-eyed when Conan ends his adventure and sails off into the mists of time, never to be heard from again."},{"Title":"Conan of the isles","review":"The book starts extremely well with one of the best scenes ever written about Conan (The tavern scene). It's forever burned into my brain. Burn it into yours. The second half lags a bit but over all it's very entertaining. The Isles is an important book in the Conan series because it's the last Conan story. Conan shows that even at 60+ he's still got more than it takes. Great ending."},{"Title":"Conan of the isles","review":"When Lancer set out to produce the complete Conan saga in the 1960s, it called upon L. Sprague de Camp, Lin Carter, and Bjorn Nyberg to fill in the gaps and complete the saga. For the most part, they comported themselves well.This is the final tale in that series, and for a non-REH story, it's pretty good. Carter and de Camp both had been around Conan enough by the time they produced this that they get the general flavor of what makes Conan, well, Conan. I probably should give it more stars, simply because of all the pure pablum that has been produced by would-be REH imitators over the past 20 years or so, but its still not quite anything more than an above average book.Regardless, its well written and clearly attempting to honor REH's Conan tales. In this book, Conan is in his twilight years and is still looking for one final adventure, or adventures, as the case may be. Clearly, Conan has no intention of dying of old age in a bed surrounded by grandchildren.The early chapters of the book are probably the best as Conan evenutally sets off sailing and finds himself in a new, unknown world (presumably America). Naturally, this being a Conan tale, he soon finds himself enmeshed in adventures in this new world. And, relying on not only muscle but guile, Conan naturally triumphs.Given the fact that I am now in my 40s, this tale may resonate more with me. The fact that a 60-ish Conan is still vital and more than willing to fight kind of inspires me. The ending actually leaves the door open for further adventures, even though this was to be the final tale in the Conan saga (of course, others decided there was still money to be made off the poor guy, so all kinds of junk is still being written about Conan today).Stick to the Lancer series and its reprints and ignore all that other junk."},{"Title":"Conan of the isles","review":"I know a lot of people get down on the contribution of Carter and de Camp to the Conan series, but these were the first tales I had ever read about the big guy and they hold a special place. In this novel Conan is the grizzled king of Aquilonia. His wife has died and his oldest son has almost reached adulthood. And the shadows strike, taking noble and pauper equally to a horrible fate. Conan gives up his crown to his son after receiving a vision from the Gods, and reunites with old companions to sail to the new world and confront a city of demon worshipers and their dark God. And very good tale, and the climax to the series. I really enjoyed this book. In fact, it's falling apart on my bookshelf from all the attention it received during the years. Howard purists may not like it. That's OK. I'll still recommend it."},{"Title":"Conan of the isles","review":"Conan is goes on a Christopher Columbus type adventure, sailing off to Western shores and unknown danger. In that regard, it is a totally unique Conan experience.L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter can be very hit or miss in their stories. Often times they write as though they have no real understanding of the big Cimmerian, his language or gestures. They also lack the ability to make poetry out of the most abhorrent violence, the way Robert E. Howard did in his original works. But in this case, the authors managed keep me interested. Maybe it is solely because Conan is on such a unique adventure, or maybe this is just better writing than some of their other pastiches. In any case, this is worth reading as the final Conan adventure."},{"Title":"Conan of the isles","review":"No, not the story. The story was good. I'm talking about the book itself. It was so old that the glue holding it together dried out. I came late to the stories of Conan. That was in the early 1980s. 1982 if I'm not mistaken. It even inspired me to write my own stories about a barbarian of my own.In this book, Conan's 60. The ghost of his guardian angel,Epimeterius the Sage, comes to him in his sleep and tells him to abdicate in favor of his son, Prince Conn, who's Conan's heir. Conan writes the letter of abdication and setsout to fight the Red Terror, a magical plague that's spread across the world by the sorcerer priests of the remnants ofAtlantis.

It is to entertain. It is escape reading in which one escapes clear out of the real universe. But, come to think, these tales are no more 'unreal' than the many whodunnits wherein, after the stupid police have fallen over their own big feet, the brilliant amateur - a private detective, a newspaper reporter., or a little old lady - steps in and solves the crime.Heroic fantasies combine the color, gore., and lively action of the costume novel with the atavistic terrors and delights of the fairy tale. They furnish the purest fun to be found in fiction today. If you read for fun, this is the genre for you.\\"However, this book is perhaps a little light on the fun, unfortunately, in the last of the Lance books.King Conan is getting on, as de Camp introduces the story, and feeling generation gapped from the kids, etc.What to do?

And how - without assistance by unnatural applications of reason and science - we're precisely the same if allowed to be. It raises questions of how we can possibly save our natural world and truly believe in a spiritual reality if we and the natural world are subjected to modern thinking found to be so successful.Focusing on Sumer and Egypt we find the ancients didn't separate man from nature. Man was part of society embedded in nature, dependent on cosmic forces. Long before Old Testament declarations of conquest over nature, man was not in opposition. They obviously struggled \\"against\\" a \\"hostile\\" environment, but this account is our language describing their situation, not their state of mind. Reminiscent of Campbell's clarification between modern and ancient perspectives as \\"it\\" vs. \\"thou\\", our authors describe this difference as \\"subject\\" vs. \\"object\\". The ancients had one mode of expression, thought, speech - the personal. Everything had a will and personality revealing itself. They could reason logically but such intellectual detachment was hardly compatible with their experience of reality. Impersonal laws did not satisfy their understanding. When the river doesn't rise, it's not due to lack of rain - the river refused to rise. You'd not hurt yourself in a fall - the ground chose to hurt you, or not. Their view was qualitative and concrete, not quantitative and abstract.In science we apply a procedure, progressively reducing phenomena until subjected to universal laws. We \\"de-complicate\\" systems to understand them. There's a hierarchy of complexity making planetary motions simpler systems than say, living cells, thus more or less complete theories of each, but we've proven since Galileo initiated modern science that we're so close to the truth of nature (the judge of our understanding) that our theories can earn our acceptance through success of their predictions and utility. We really did build Voyager to that understanding and it really did what we thought it would when released to nature's command - three billion miles from earth, still obeying our grasp of nature. Furthermore, accurate theories are able to predict things never dreamed possible when created. Relativity still yields such surprises. We see phenomena as manifestations of general laws, not by what makes them peculiar.The ancient mind is termed \\"mythopoetic\\". Their perspective is why scriptures were written when they were and not anymore - writings imbibed with mystery and inflation of life one assumes we've lost to critical reason and economic forces. But the mythopoetic mind is still here, the natural mind we are born with. It's why we have palm readers, cults, astrologers, ghosts, UFOs, Creationists, pet psychics, TV conversations with the dead, best selling books on how to \\"know\\" God and beliefs that flying jets into buildings will send their pilots to heaven. All expanding lives otherwise sterilized by 9-to-5, traffic jams, ignorance, poverty. In Mexico women are advised to remain inside during a solar eclipse, least they become spontaneously pregnant. As my Aunt said of Columbia, \\"If God wanted us to be in space he'd given us wings.\\" If God wanted us to drive cars he'd given us wheels, or to live under roofs, he'd have put shingles on our head. What some battle as absurd is also quite natural, dangerous and capable of elevating life, avoiding deconstruction and reductionism applied to humans made of more than carbon and water. A dilemma revealed by this book. And if Tattersall is correct, this behavior may have a lot to do with our messy brain structure, a condition we're stuck with."},{"Title":"Before philosophy;: The intellectual adventure of ancient man (Pelican books)","review":"\\"The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man: An Essay on Speculative Thought in the Ancient Near East\\" is one of the books which shaped views of the Ancient Near East for serious-minded students during the whole second half of the twentieth century -- although not all its readers may immediately recall it as having that title. If you check its product page, you will see that Amazon gives it the date of 1977, but this refers only to the trade paperback edition, with some bibliographic updating. It was in fact first published, under that title, in 1946, as an \\"Oriental Institute Essay.\\" The list of contributors was extremely impressive -- in fact, only one doesn't have that badge of modern celebrity, a Wikipedia article. (And I assume that the addition to that list of H.A. Frankfort, better known professionally as the art-historian Henriette Groenwegen-Frankfort, is just a matter of time.)However, it was for almost three decades better known as \\"BEFORE PHILOSOPHY: THE INTELLECTUAL ADVENTURE OF ANCIENT MAN,\\" a slightly-abbreviated mass-market paperback edition released in 1949 by Penguin Books, under their Pelican imprint, and kept in print into the 1970s. This was the version I encountered in High School, and re-read in its entirety several times over the decades. Many readers will probably find it quite satisfactory, if a used copy can be found at a reasonable price.The main difference between the two editions was the omission by Penguin of William A. Irwin's forty-page treatment of \\"The Hebrews,\\" a competent piece of work, but containing few if any surprises for readers acquainted with the Hebrew Bible (\\"Old Testament\\"). This left a few comments in the Introduction (by Henri and H.A. Frankfort) without support from the rest of the volume, but otherwise probably wasn't missed. I, at least, feel comfortable in reviewing both variations in much the same terms.Under either title, the bulk of the book consists of attempts to explicate the main ideas behind two contrasting ancient civilizations, that of Egypt, and that of Mesopotamia; Irwin's contribution added a third point of comparison, one with a direct presence in the modern world.The introductory material, by Henri Frankfort (1897-1954)) and H.A. Frankfort, is a brief presentation of the idea of a \\"mythopoeic\\" period of creativity in human culture, with direct reference to the then-recent work of Ernst Cassirer, in \\"The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms\\" (three volumes; only later available in English translation, and definitely worth reading, although his short \\"Language and Myth\\" is more approachable). In an early review, Samuel Noah Kramer, the distinguished Sumerologist, took exception both to the theory to some of the reconstructions of Sumerian imagery with which the Frankforts expounded it. Their examples were defended decades later by their apparent source, Thorkild Jacobsen. (See \\"God or Worshipper?\\" in \\"Essays in Ancient Civilization Presented to Helene J. Kantor,\\" [Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization No. 47] 1989.)Without going into the fascinating, and sometimes problematic, details, Cassirer (among others) described a branch of human thought as turning observations and theories about the world into images and narratives, producing gods, demons, and events, rather than reducing them to abstract principles, producing propositions, theorems, hypotheses, and Natural Laws. At one time, the mythopoeic mode was the preferred form of intellectual activity, so that the texts and images representing them have to be \\"decoded,\\" but not as conscious allegories. Although the theory treats it as a characteristic way of thinking, dominant in a culture under certain circumstances, both proponents and opponents have treated it as a \\"primitive\\" mode of thought, superseded by \\"rationality,\\" which misses much of the point.A presentation of Egyptian thought, by John A. Wilson (1899-1976), along with his 1951 book, \\"The Burden of Egypt\\" (better known as \\"The Culture of Ancient Egypt,\\" needs some updating, but, so far as I can tell, is by-and-large considered sound by his fellow Egyptologists. Wilson concentrated on the \\"eternal verities\\" as seen by the Egyptians, although pointing out that Egyptian culture did change, sometimes drastically, over the course of millennia. Many of the Egyptians texts he quotes in his own translations are among those which appear in full in his contributions to \\"Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament\\" (edited by James B. Pritchard, 1954; third, revised edition, 1969).The treatment of Mesopotamian civilization (or civilizations, given the various languages and regional variations) by Thorkild Jacobsen (1904-1993) is a superb exposition of his views at the time; views which changed over the years, subtly but importantly. His contribution is well worth reading, but should be supplemented by his later works, most notably \\"The Treasures of Darkness\\" (1976), which revisits his treatment of the Babylonian \\"Epic of Creation\\" (Enuma Elish), among other myths. And even some of the reconsiderations have themselves been emended, at least partly due to additional textual discoveries. His brief quotations from Sumerian texts should be supplemented by his massive collection from 1987, \\"The Harps that Once... Sumerian Poetry in Translation.\\"Unlike some approaches to mythopoeic theory, Jacobsen did not assume that it is a timeless, ahistorical, form of thought, but attempted to show that it responded to social (and other environmental) changes, and that new conceptions were superimposed on older ones. I think that this is implicit in \\"Intellectual Adventure,\\" but it is a structuring principle in \\"Treasures of Darkness.\\"\\"Intellectual Adventure...\\" is, at this writing, available directly from Amazon, as well as through Amazon dealers.

The book gives a very in-depth analysis of the style, background, and subtleties of Joyce's manipulation of English.My only criticism is that Kopper never warns the reader-\\"This part is a hard part to understand.\\" But, most people will get that by page two of Ulysses anyway."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes On Joyce's Ulysses (Cliffsnotes Literature)","review":"For those voyaging through the original, but murky, literary waters of James Joyce's novel ULYSSES, the CLIFFS NOTES ON JOYCE's ULYSSES is a superbly helpful guide.This book contains contains explication on all eighteen sections of ULYSSES, character analyses, and a list of the novel's myriad characters.If you're going to tackle ULYSSES, take this CLIFFS NOTES guide along."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes On Joyce's Ulysses (Cliffsnotes Literature)","review":"You can read Ulysses without guidance. You can. Certainly it's likely that if you do, you'll miss out on a fair amount of what's going on in the novel. That's not a bad thing, necessarily, as if you're anything like me, Ulysses is a book you'll come back to again and again, and there will be something new, some whole new thread of theme or motif, some new chain of allusion, to grab you anew. It's a novel, and it's a way of reading.I've read a few Cliffs Notes, and I've written a fair number of Masterplots entries (and other guides and reference works of that ilk), and in my opinion, if used in conjunction with a careful reading of Joyce's novel, Kopper's little book is a nice first guide. It sketches you a map that will carry you through on your first trip. Maybe, if you have the time and interest, you'll reread the novel with Harry Blamires's Bloomsday Book as a companion, or even Gifford's Ulysses Annotated. And Thornton's Allusions in Ulysses. And-- ...But the Cliffs Notes are quite good for what they are.When I first read Ulysses 25 years ago, I did it like this: I read an episode, then I read the Cliffs Notes, then I reread the episode, and then I moved on. That's how you'll get the most out of this tool. If you use it for what it's supposed to be and don't let it read the book for you, you could do a lot worse. When I taught the novel, I was pleased to recommend this guide to my students.In the interest of full disclosure: I first studied Joyce as an undergraduate with Ed Kopper, but as I haven't spoken with him in at least 20 years, I think you can consider this review minimally biased at worst.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is about a negro kid that gets murdered by some racist jerks and his grandfather puts a curse on the town that makes it rain black and it turns normal people into murdering maniacs.The cop in the story once he figures out who might be behind this rain, also figures the best way to put a stop to him is with a bullet through the brain.It is far fetched, but this is horror at it best and something different."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Hey, I'm as much a Laymon fan as the next guy, and I don't pick up his books expecting Tolstoy or anything, but I thought this one was pretty limp. The violence is so overbearing it comes off as cartoonish (not even fun cartoonish, just yawn-inducing), and the characters are as 2-dimensional as they can be in a story like this. Want some fun Laymon? Pick up \\"Ths Stake\\" or \\"Island\\"."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Richard Laymon has a knack for basing an entire story in a short amount of time. The last book I read by him, Among The Missing, also occurred in a single evening. And Laymon makes it all seem so easy and natural, or unnatural as the case may be.This is another excellent book in that vein. This time a mysterious black rain falls on a town and everyone who is struck by it turns into a enraged killer. As is also normal, a wide number of characters are all involved in the story and each and every one of them seems real. And that tops off what you would expect from a horror novel: a good story, excellent characters and a fast paced read. Definitely a recommendation!"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I thought that one rainy night was ok, but not one of his better works, when I read his book bite, I couldn't put it down, with this one , it just didin't keep my interest as well.

It wasn't as rich and textured as a good Koontz novel, and the ending wasn't as developed as I'd hoped (and grown used to), but overall I enjoyed it. If gore turns you off, you might think ORN is excessively violent for violence's sake--lots of blood, very graphic descriptions, some cannibalism--but given the plot it seemed to fit. ORN was a fast read with enough oomph to pull me along to the end. Not a fantastic book when compared to Koontz, King, Wilson or McCammon but definitely worthwhile for horror fans."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Sorry, as a longtime fan, this 1991 reprint lacks the subtle yet brutal depth of his later works: Check out Savage, Bite, to name a few. Yes its titallating, gross and violent, but seems more cartoonsih than his later works...C'mon Leisure Books, release Body Rides and other 90's novels.."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Superb, sick, perverse, gory, and detailed. All of the ingredients for a Laymon classic. 100% unbridled gore from beginning to end. A fantastic, and compelling read"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I am a huge Horror fan, but for some reason I never got around to reading any of Laymon's work, and in all honestly I don't know why. People that I know who has read his work told me that One Rainy Night is where I should start. I have to say that I really enjoyed this story.It had my interest from the first page. The action starts early and never lets up. I wouldn't suggest starting it unless you have a lot of time to spare. You will not be able to put it down. I couldn't peel myself away from it.I thought the story was very original. A black rain starts falling on a town, and anyone who gets it on them turns into a Bloodthirsty Maniac. Anyone with the misfortune of being in close proximity to someone whose been caught in the rain pays dearly. I must warn that the gore level is very high in this story. I wouldn't suggest anyone with a weak stomach reading it. It gets very graphic in parts.The only real complaint I have is that Mr Laymon didn't devote enough of the story on what was causing the rain. You will find out the reason, but he doesn't go into a lot of detail, and that really frustrated me. I also felt like the ending was a little rushed. I think that the story should have be at least twenty pages longer.I really enjoyed One Rainy Night. It is face paced, and very gruesome. I recommend it for anyone who likes No Holds Barred horror."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"When I see a book on the shelf by Laymon, whether it be new orused, I feel like a gunfighter in a spaghetti western... I can herethe theme for &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;... In my mind, that best describes the books of Richard Laymon... I consider &quot;One Rainy Night&quot; to be one of the &quot;good&quot;. The story goes from 0 to 60 from page one and somehow, keeps going full bore for 416 pages! Doesn't seem that long, but it is... Blood and guts, sex and rape, it's all here in typical Laymon fashion... a B-novel that's a definite no- brainer! And despite it's flaws (weak characters, poor dialogue...), it's perversely enjoyable! Though I do agree with the reviewer who recommended &quot;The Fog&quot; by James Herbert, it truly is a classic!"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Something very strange is going on in the town of Bixby. A black rain has begun to fall turning everybody it touches into Homicidal Maniacs. Just why the black rain is falling is not explained by the author but it does give him the perfect excuse to indulge in his tired old Themes of Teenage Lust, Violence and Rape which are so prevelant in his books.I keep on reading Laymon in the unrealized hope that perhaps one day he just might have written something original. Howver as usual he repeats his usual Themes ad nauseaum.If I was a teenager I would take serious offence at the way people of my age are always portrayed in his books , namely Lust Crazed Kids With Out Of Control Raging Hormonal Desires. I give this book 5 stars because I live in the vain hope hope of reading something fresh and new from Laymon and once again he has delivered his usual trash masquerading as Horror and I was naive enough to buy this book thinking it may be different from the rest of his works."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I'll make this short and sweet (like the book)...Lots of gore, sex and violence with a fairly original plot device...What more can a gorehound ask for? Its not a thought-provoking sociopolitical drama/thriller to be sure, but is that what anyone who reads Laymon is looking for?I wouldn't shell out big bucks for it, but its worth 7$. It's a nice, bloody romp in the park."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I'm a huge fan of Richard Laymon, and this is by far my favoritebook I've read of his. Some of his other novels are so gore-soaked, the plot gets lost in the mess, while others get muddledin extraneous dialogue and outrageous sex (not that I have aproblem with outrageous sex, lol.) One Rainy Night strikes theperfect balance between these extremities. Its breakneck pacing, over-the-top violence, and interesting plot kept meturning the pages well into the night. Basically, the plot goesas follows: In a small rural town, a black high school studentis brutally murdered by his classmates. The next night, a strange black rain begins to fall. Anyone who comes into contact with this rain becomes a murderous lunatic. Nobody (well, almost nobody, I'll get to that) is immune-even cops andkids are affected. In a matter of hours, the few dry people find themselves in a life-and-death battle against the crazies.In different parts of town, a cop, babysitter, artist, and others try to find out what's happened to their once-peacefullittle town and protect loved ones. The mystery is who or whatis causing the rain, and how to stop it. Is it a plague fromGod, punishing the citizens for their crime? Is it the spiritof the slain boy, exacting revenge for his death? The answer isn't as important as the implied message the story puts forth:Human nature is to destroy and kill, and that primal urge liesjust beneath the surface, waiting to be dug up. That's a scaryenough thought, but Laymon is all too happy to show us the depthof this depravity and violence in all its gory glory. You thought Stephen King was sick? Laymon often makes King look like Mister Rogers by comparison. People wallow in the blood ofpeople they've killed. Blood is sucked through bullet holes like soda through a straw. A woman is forced to swallow gasoline and then immolated. If you're squeamish at all, avoidthis book (or anything by Laymon, really) like the plague. Andthis is actually less gory than many of his other books. But ifover-the-top violence and creepiness are your bread and butter,you'll be in heaven. There were a few things about this book that keeps me from calling it perfect, unfortunately. First ofall, despite the unique plot, character development is givenlittle attention. You want the main characters to survive, butyou could really go either way, like the one-dimentional actorsin a slasher film. The dialogue isn't bad, but it's not reallyany better than what you'd find in the previously mentionedslasher flick. With so much focus on gore, Laymon seems to havephoned the rest in. My only other complaints are with the ending and a few plot holes. The ending makes sense, considering the rest of the story, but its so simply done it might have been stolen from a less ambitious novel. And its nothing you haven't read a dozen times before. Still, the journey to get to it is such a thrill ride, you won't care. Finally, a few plot points will make you scratch your head. Theworst one is Sandy, the only resident of this town who can fightthe insanity the rain causes. No explanation is ever given whyshe's so gifted, or how she controls it. It would have been better if other people in town could fight the rain as well, but it's only her. The other thing is someone blows up a gasstation. It's never happened to me, but I assume if I lived ina small town and the only gas station exploded, I'd hear or seeit, nighttime or not. In this book, it explodes and is nevermentioned again. It's almost as if Laymon wanted the reader tothink the main characters would discover this and go there, butthen forgot about it. And, oddly enough, the only way to curethe crazies is to WASH THE RAIN OFF. Still, these are just minor quabbles about an otherwise amazing story. I consider this one of the best horror stories I've ever read, and it evendoubles as a morality tale, which is a nice twist. If you likehorror at all, READ IT. If you think horror is trash, then you'll liken this to raw sewage. Either way, you may feel the need to bathe afterwards."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I have read about 15 or so of Laymon's books, and this one is by far my favorite one. I love Laymon books for the raw energy in most of them. This one I think has been the most bloody and demented. How scary to think that a drop of rain can turn you into some kind of psycho, sadistic killer! This is one wild ride that grabs you by the throat, and if you are lucky lets go at the last page."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I wasn't really enthused about this book after reading the first chapter. I actually put it down for a couple of days which is unusual for me. But boy oh boy when I picked it up again, it grabbed me and wouldn't let go. A black rain is turning ordinary people into homicidal cannibalistic maniacs (think Living Dead). Only those who get wet are affected so the folks who were inside when the rain started have to do whatever it takes to survive the night. And the ending is a real original. Don't miss out on the thrills of this one!"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Richard Laymon writes highly entertaining, swiss cheese horror. What I mean by the cheese analogy is that many of the plot twists don't fit, don't make sense, and make it seem that something is missing. Kinda like watching a B-horror movie. But I like cheese, especially this kind. Laymon has written a fast paced, enjoyable novel about a small California town plagued by black rain. Rain that for some unknown reason turns those who touch it into raving, murderous lunatics. Horrific events follow, ranging from stabbings, shootings, cannibalism, and rape. When I was reading I kept thinking of this as Night of the Living Drenched, as those affected by the rain have no real control over their actions. But they do know what they're doing. That in itself was frightening. But this book really relies more on the gross out factor than all out fear. Which will probably turn off some readers. My only complaint was the entirely predicatable ending, but that does add to the B-movie campiness. All in all if you like horror novels check this one out, you won't regret it. And you will invest in a raincoat and umbrella!"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"A few years ago (maybe more than a few...) I saw ONE RAINY NIGHT in a certain BookClub magazine. I was 'horror selection of the month' or something like that and below the picture of a blood-smeared knife lying in a gutter were the words, 'Warning - contains explicit violence and is not suitable for those of a nervous disposition.' So I bought it. How could I refuse a challenge like THAT? And, boy, was that warning right! This is lightening fast horror. As bloody and revolting and shocking as you could want. And then some. A few other reviewers mentioned Romero's zombie movies. I would also compare this book to Peter Jackson's excellent BRAINDEAD (DEAD ALIVE to all you Americans out there!) Carnage galore and characters you really care for, this book has it all. If you've ever wondered what would happen if people stopped pretending to be civilised and just did whatever the hell they felt like, then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I really enjoyed Laymon's first Leisure Books release, BITE, so when ONE RAINY NIGHT came out I snapped it up. It has been a long time since any book has captured my attention like this book did, keeping me up well into the night to finish it. Leisure has made a very intelligent decision to finally bring this American author back home to the US mass market. I never thought Leisure would outdo releasing Piccirilli's HEXES or Masterton's PREY, but they did it with ONE RAINY NIGHT."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"'One Rainy Night' is at times one of Richard Laymon's best books and simultaneously one of his worst. Gone from the narrative are the unnecessary and sometimes tedious flashback sequences that mar titles like 'The Midnight Tour' and 'Blood Games'.Unlike the above titles, 'One Rainy Night' is tautly written, suspenseful, and extremely disconcerting and horrifying. The characters are more well-drawn than in his other books and actually come to be more 'real people' than two-dimensional archetypes of the genre.There is very little backstory, as the novel jumpstarts from the very first page and doesn't let up until the very last passage. That being said, Laymon seems to have ignored MOST of the impetus for the novel in the book's climax. It was as if he simply didn't care about what would cause black rain to fall on a (racist) small suburban town, and therefore he glosses over the ending to make everything a little too tidy.It is an interesting, if a bit EC Comics, sort of premise and is enjoyable (definitely) for those who like Laymon's other works. People who have read other Leisure books - Jack Ketchum, Brian Keane, Bentley Little, and Edward Lee - just may like this book as well. Extreme Horror."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This was my first book by Laymon and the only one I halfway liked.A 3.5 really. It seems to me that Laymon fans like him for his campiness. He quite frankly is a sub-par writer, who relies on buckets of blood and vile sex scenes. Why does he have scenes like this in almost everyone of his books? I did really enjoy the simple, straitforward style of this book though. He captured the teen scream movies of the last twenty years. I just wish he would take his time to wrap up loose ends a little more and flesh out his characters(who always seem a little bland to me). Still its energetic and filled with a weird vibe throughout. Slasher flick fans will enjoy this trip."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"A small band of people trying to survive as a town goes berserk from toxic rain. I'm a big fan of apocalyptic fiction and this book is one of the best of that genre. As typical of Laymon, it's a fast and suspenseful read loaded with violence and gore."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"One Rainy Night is my fourth Laymon book afterIn the Dark;Darkness, Tell UsandAmong the Missing.I have learned not to expect any depth or character development in a Laymon book. All of this is thrown overboard in favor of suspense and action.But in this one, I don't know. It just didn't hang together well. Don't get me wrong, the idea is killer. An isolated town where simply going outside will turn somebody homicidal. It could have been Laymon's'Salem's Lot. In the hands of Stephen King or Bentley Little this would have been a classic.Part of the problem is that Laymon focuses on too small a group of people. Maybe between chapters it would have been helpful to show what else is going on in the town. After the first few chapters you forget that there are more than ten people in Bixby.Also, it often seems like the characters aren't especially concerned. One of the groups you follow has the time to park it on a sofa and watchA Fistful of Dollars. Why wouldn't they spend that time barricading themselves in?Another thing is the crazies themselves. It seems like the rain drives people over the edge and turns them into animals. Great! Then later in the book they are acting more rational. Being scared off by threats of violence. Where was the madness we saw earlier? When some of the good guys get wet the can just sort of shrug it off. We aren't even told how they do it. It just seemed like Laymon changed the rules whenever it suited him.If One Rainy Night were a movie, it would be the type of move where you are hoping for a remake to improve the original. The idea was there, it just wasn't followed through.My review was three stars, but I would really rate it two and a half."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Part horror novel &amp; part B horror movie. Laymon gets away from the mad slasher type book and writes another great horror story."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"One Rainy Night starts with a simple premise that quickly involves you in a story that raises troubling moral questions. In a small town a black student is brutally murdered. Revenge is arranged in the form of an unrelenting rain composed of a black viscous fluid. As soon as it makes contact with someone's skin they are filled with homicidal feelings. Some attack people at random while others set out with specific victims in mind. The best scenes involve a group of people trapped in a restaurant desperately trying to stop countless homicidal maniacs from killing them. The restaurant patrons are forced to resort to escalating levels of violence and because the methods they use, while graphic, are never over-the-top it is easy to relate to the feelings of those in the restaurant. How far would you go and what would you be willing to do in order to survive? And would you attempt to save yourself by running into the rain and becoming one of the killers? Laymon's book is fast, entertaining and ultimately thought-provoking."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This was my second attempt to find a successful Laymon novel. After all, with his list of A-list writer's recommendations at the front of the book, you'd think we'd have something decent once in a while. You would think wrong.My first complaint is the excessive use of the word \\"rump.\\" Laymon uses it over 15 times throughout this novel as if he's scared to use a common synonym. This wouldnt be a problem, but the novel is filled with every other bad word imaginable and \\"rump\\" just sticks out. Not to mention that there are scenes of intense rape, murder, and gore, and he still uses \\"rump.\\" It sticks out.I think Laymon had a checklist for weapons in this book. Every character shows up with something different: a gasoline pump, a bike pump, whatever. Wouldnt most people use a knife or a gun? He shows us the crazies have intelligence and their normal psyche, but still some opt for a spear other than a knife. Who has a spear hanging around?Bad dialogue. Lame ending. The list goes on and on. No matter how awesome the premise on the back of a Laymon novel sounds (and they do SOUND awesome), I wont toss away seven or eight bucks again on him. Read the King instead."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Is it just me or is anyone else driven crazy by the word \\"gals\\" and Laymon's overuse of it? It's GIRLS...unless maybe you're living in the 1930's or something...OK, now that I've gotten that out of my system...this was a good book and Laymon is still great! But it's \\"GIRLS\\" not \\"GALS\\"!"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This book really did nothing for me. It was the first of Laymon's books I read and probably the last. I don't mind far-fetched story ideas, in fact I love Stephen King, but this was borderline ridiculous! Halfway through the book I couldn't wait for it to end, not because I really wanted to know what was going to happen, but because I felt I was wasting valuable time living! After reading it, I thought Laymon might be a new author still trying to find his style, but then I caught a glimpse of his picture and bio on the inside back cover and - oh my! If you're looking for some classic horror, I'd suggest Stephen King's PET SEMATARY, Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND, or some newer authors like J.G. Passarella's WITHER and Ronald Damien Malfi's THE SPACE BETWEEN (more sci-fi, still a good book). Whatever you choose, I would not recommend this book!"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"People read books for different reasons. Some look for intricate plots, symbolism, deep meaning ... I read for all these reasons, but I also read for entertainment. Laymon is pure entertainment.One Rainy Night is like a zombie movie with a revenge plot and a bit of voodoo mixed in. It's all B-movie schlock, but it works quite well. It's a fast read you can plow thru in an evening. Don't expect anything too deep, just read the book and enjoy your damn self!"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Probably my least favourite of the books I have read by this author. And I love him, I do. Just not this one.The bit on the back sounds really good, \\"crazy rain making people into savage killers!\\" Neat. But the book isn't that good, it really isn't. It's BORING. I don't know how it's possible for crazy rain making people into savage killers to be boring, but it is.I will never be convinced that if a woman has been raped, her clothes ripped off during an attack, or there's a naked female corpse, that apparently ALL males nearby will become sexually excited. I mean... you're under attack by crazy, slime-covered maniacs, your wife is freaking out, your child is home with the babysitter and you don't know if she's okay, people are being disemboweled and torn to pieces around you... and you're still going to take the time (much less be able) to become excited at the sight of a half-dressed woman?Also ridiculous is the fact that when the character John realizes that the maniacs can be \\"cured\\", he still rampantly and without remorse shoots them in the head and kills them. Hmmm.I don't even want to get into the fact that Richard Laymon talks about the little 8 year old girl's \\"panties\\". Not cool. He always does this in his books, \\"rumps\\" and \\"panties\\"... but my god. This is supposed to be a CHILD. Pretty gross.This is not his goriest book, his most creepy, nor his most interesting. Not a good Laymon book at all."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"this book wasn't all that great. and, that's being nice. i love horror, and it had mediocre reviews on here, so i thought i'd check it out. i was disappointed. it does have some good points. i enjoyed the sections with the young babysitter and the little girl she was watching. but, the rest just sorta sucked. the rape scene wasnt frightening. it was ignorant. and, it isnt all that gory of a novel. as for the political point, we get it. that factor is too simple, too cliched, and too trite to mention. also, the trying to overcome the racism aspect of the book makes the book racist in itself. as simple as it is to read, im having a hard time getting through to the end. and, the other reviewer on here was right, he uses the word \\"rump\\" about 117 times in the novel. buy another book, instead. or, do what i did, check it out at the library."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"water? This novel will make you afraid to walk in the rain or you may turn into a raving, blood-thirsty lunatic!! Laymon takes a silly concept and turns it into a fairly interesting read. He does a great job of setting the story up, but his characters are not fleshed out like in other novels.However, he does a great job of describing the action and the scene in the restaurant is classic Laymon. It is something \\"Laymon-ite's\\" will instantly recognize as classic, vintage Laymon. The survivors of the black rain battle the blood-thirsty rain soaked (undead?)!!Some of the survivors are then forced to go to the house of a vodoo priest to stop the rain and the ending is Laymon at his best. He doesn't pull any punches and this book reads like a screenplay for a George Romero film. It should be developed into a B-movie film, maybe straight to video?An enjoyable read and solid outing from the late, great Dick Laymon."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Rarely do I read more than one novel by the same author in a month. But after finishing Island by Richard Laymon, it was nearly impossible not to pick up another one of his novels. And while One Rainy Night doesn't match the achievement of Island, its still a great read.The premise of the novel is simple: after a racially motivated killing, a black rain begins to fall driving anyone exposed to it into a homicidal frenzy. Following a small collection of people, Laymon illustrates the effects of the black rain and the actions taken to stop it.Like Island, the characters are somewhat shallow but that's really not the point of his novels. Laymon writes to entertain and he's ridiculously successful. Above all, One Rainy Night is a lot of fun to read. Think of it as a low budget horror movie in novel form.Laymon writes a good book - they're entertaining, easy and quick yet thoroughly engaging. Definitely check this one out."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"this is the first Laymon book I've read and it wont be the last. Yes, the plot is simple but who the hell needs a complicated plot anyway, especially when they are writing fast pace horror such as this. This book will put you in the middle of a bloodbath; a town which has gone crazy and where no one is truly a hero. Don't go out in the rain whatever you do, it wil prove to be deadly. The book starts off with a murder of a black boy and basically the thrilling ride accelerates from there. Some will say its B rated material but i think its true horror or what I would deem a horror novel; certainly in terms better then Anne Rice puts out that is suppose to be horror. Buy the book and you will see what I mean. It might make you cringe a bit but what's horror without a few blood and guts and rape scenes."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Make sure you've got a little time to kill when you open One Rainy Night, because once you start, you won't be able to put it down until you're finshed. At that point, of course, you will probably be experiencing heart palpatations and dehydration from profuse sweating. This book delivers the goods! A fast-paced, high-energy excursion. This is one of Laymon's best. Pick it up and experience it, you will not be disappointed. I guarantee."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I always try to keep my reviews short and sweet. Laymon is definitely not for everyone. LAymon always lived in his own world where common human psychology does not apply to his characters. (Example: a girl gets raped and an hour later she is ready to get it on with another character; or someone's boyfriend gets killed and later she is off having fun.) However, Laymon is usually an easy read that does not go very in-depth. This book was not as enjoyable as other books I have read by him. It was rather boring and very preposterous with too simple of an ending - even for Laymon. My recommendation: start with something different by Laymon."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Richard Laymon novels are often a hit or miss affair. For every classic like \\"Island\\", there's a dud like \\"Endless Night\\", and out of the 20 or so novels of his I've read I must admit that close to half were nothing to go nuts over. But I have still found it worthwhile to slug over mediocre works of his because the payoff is that when you find a Laymon book that's good it's REAL good. \\"One Rainy Night\\" is certainly one of his best, and it typifies the things that Laymon does best: Fast-Paced action, buckets of gore, graphic body violence and evil-to-the-core villains.The setting takes place in the small California town of Bixby, where the peacefulness of the town is shattered overnight by a thick black rain that pours down and inexplicably turns its citizens into homicidal maniacs. Citizens lucky enough to be indoors when the rain starts to pour are now faced with a more trying dilemma: stem the tide of ghouls trying to break in.A very simplistic plot it certainly is and Laymon keeps it straightforward throughout. \\"One Rainy Night\\" has all the qualities of great b-movie horror, such as graphic gore, horny teenagers, a town sheriff, a small hicktown setting. Comparisons to \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" are certainly just as the novel has many scenes of people barricading themselves inside in an attempt to ward off the creatures lurking outside. He even attempts to lend credence to an otherwise unbelievable central concept (killer rain) by tying in the story with a voodoo-practicing elder man who put a spell on the town to avenge the death of his grandson.The entire events of the novel take place over one night, making it an engaging read with a fast pace. Laymon's writing is very sharp, free of the often pointless dialogue that plagues some of his other works and he does an excellent job of instilling dread at the thought of the pouring rain. He intertwines several different scenarios together with seamless ease, as characters who never crossed paths throughout the novel bond together towards the end to fight the rain-soaked maniacs. Like many other Laymon novels, this will satisfy those horror fans looking for the literary equivalent of a fun horror b-movie."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This book was bad. Plain and simple. I've only read two of Laymon's other books, The Traveling Vampire Show and Among the Missing, and this book pales in comparison with those two. I got about 1/3 of the way through the book, and I totally lost interest and stopped reading. Even if you are a Laymon fan do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"An intriguing premise--Romero's NOTLD and &quot;The Crazies&quot; combined with black magic--yields little of major interest. Characters are two-dimensional cutouts from B-Movie cloth, and, despite the previous reviewer's comments, tend to stick to assigned hero/villain roles in the narrative. Plot rules appear to change at a whim, with some psychotic characters conveniently able to &quot;hold it together&quot; when plot momentum requires them to do so. Furthermore, some possibly interesting themes, such as heroism versus safety, and anonymity versus altruism are never developed.Like old horror films, this ends in cliche fashion. The heroes and heroines embrace after the rather weak climax, while suffering no consequences--psychological or otherwise, for the actions taken in order to survive.For a simple, fun read, one could certainly do worse, but this was somewhat of a disappointing introduction to the author."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I remember passing this book by when I first saw it in 1991. Having just completed it, I wish that I had passed it by yet again.&quot;One Rainy Night&quot; is a very quick read. I finished it in more or less one sitting. Normally that's a good thing, and I will credit Richard Laymon's ability to create story flow. However... he left so many gaping holes and unexplored avenues throughout the novel that it became tedious less than halfway through.One of my major problems with this novel was dialogue. The character of Kara may be nine years old in the story, but her lines are those of someone well along in years. And how many high schoolers do you know that refer to kids as &quot;ankle-biters&quot;?I can see the parallel one other reviewer had with this novel resembling a George Romero movie. Although I find &quot;One Rainy Night&quot; to be more like the film &quot;The Crazies&quot; than any of the &quot;Living Dead&quot; films.Rape are gore are prominent throughout the novel. This may have been meant to be shocking..but after a while you'll notice that's all there is. A half-hearted attempt at splatterpunk. If this is indicative of the rest of Richard Laymon's work, I'll most probably pass those by as well.Readers may want to check out the horror classic &quot;The Fog&quot; by James Herbert. A significantly better novel by a master story teller."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I'm not really a big fan of gore. I'd rather read a psychological thriller or a good old fashioned ghost story. However it's not the gore the reason I give the book a low rating.Seen from a distance the plot is SO simple. You have this rain that makes people insane, some key characters manage to stay dry and live through the night in &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; style -locking up themselves, fighting with makeshift weapons. One of these characters has a theory of why the whole thing is happening and, as it turns out, it really WAS the reason.What I really disliked about this book was a number of far fetched situations and some terribly loose ends. You have this rain that makes people stark raving mad, which is pretty well stated in the first quarter of the novel when the killings start out of the blue. But then these insane people start displaying intelligence, plotting against their intended victims. You have scenes where &quot;crazies&quot; run naked in the street holding knives above their heads, mixed with &quot;crazies&quot; that think &quot;it would be better to drive to this other house so the people in the house I intend to brake into have no idea&quot;...Another loose end -probably the worst in the book- is the character of Sandy, who suddenly appears in the final third of the book, and near the end is the only one who inexplicably can control the effect of the rain on herself, up to the point where she leads the group that will eventually come face to face with what is causing the black rain.Another one? You have Tom, Lynn and Casey in the restaurant, outnumbered, pinned to the floor, ready to be slain and all of a sudden their attackers are gunned down. Who gunned them down? Who knows.Other really hard to believe scenes, like a mother telling the babysitter &quot;it's ok to ask your boyfriend to come while we are gone&quot; (yeah, right) helped in me not really liking this book, and, again, it had nothing to do with the gore.A two and a half star actually."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Richard Laymon's One Rainy night was a decent read. I have read others from him like The Island, The Lake, Midnight Tour, Savage, Into The Fire and many more. This wasn't one of his best works but an entertaining read all the same. The story has that \\"Pulp Fiction\\" style where it revolves around different characters who seem to tie into each other at the end. It has it's moments of gore and violence, not as much raging hormone, teenage sexual thoughts and sex as he is known for; to be exact there was only one sex scene, and even that was a quickie. I don't mind that at all. Sometimes I felt that there was too much going on to really visualize it (since it's about heards of people going blood crazy when the black rain touches their skin). A lot of chaos that it tends to get scattery. The end was decent... I'm confused as to how Sarah's character had the rain \\"rained in\\" at the end. The rain touched her but yet she managed to somehow control it and not go violently crazy. Not much explanation there. When you read the book you will see what I mean."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Richard Laymon has written another fast-paced-read, with characters that you can relate with.This is one of those books that makes you want to keep glancing ahead - you know - looking over to the next page, to make sure that the characters you like are going to be okay. . . :-)myspace.com/horror_reviews"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This is a surprisingly quick read for a 400 page book. I finished it in a single sitting (like many of the other reviewers on here mentioned). The entire book takes place in under 24 hours and unfortunately for the readers, after about the first 20 pages this book is VERY predictable.Short Summary:Last night a teen aged black boy was tortured and killed in a racially motivated hate-crime. Suddenly, 24 hours later, a black rain pours from the sky... anyone in the rain suddenly turns black and starts a homicidal/sexual rampage, killing everyone they see.This seems like a pretty fun concept, and at first it is. There is a ton of gore, you figure out right from the start who murdered the black boy and know that his murder has something to do with the rain. Mass chaos, pandemonium, lots of gore and violence lead the reader to believe this is going to be an absolute blast. About half way through though, Laymon losses control of his story, and when he does it begins a quick trip down hill. Suddenly the people who are rained who were main characters in the beginning, are capable of controlling themselves... the maniacs on the murderous rampages are suddenly not so scary because they have both control and fear. Also, it's pretty easy to figure out who is going to live and die in this book right from the beginning, so there are few surprises or shockers in that regards. On top of all of that... it seems that people are very quick to figure out the rain and how to cure it... and the idea of the maniacs curing themselves seems a bit preposterous.When we arrive at the ending, it is pretty much what we expected to happen, I kind of hoped for something a bit more \\"exciting\\" but everything about this book goes exactly as one would expect. The characterization is fairly typical for a Laymon novel, in that there really isn't much. The bad guys are all men, rapists, and obsessed with womens breasts. The good guys are all a bit dense, nice to women, and obsessed with womens breasts. I admit that I was a bit disturbed with his characterization of the 9 year old girl and his description of her body and panties. At some times she acts like a five year old, at others she's far brighter than most of the adults in the book.If you have some extra time and just want a quick trashy read with a lot of violence, gore, rape, and jiggling [...], this is your book. If you are looking for something exciting, exhilarating, mind blowing, or thought provoking, there are far better choices out there. This is a fairly mediocre book in respect to the others Laymon has written, I have read both better and worse in regards to his collection of works."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I didnt read this novel until recently because I was skeptical of the synapse on the back. I dont know what I waiting for cause it was awesome!to be frank.I think it was probaly his goriest novel, of course it would be being about people going crazy and killing eachother after they are exposed to a mysterious black rain. After a black highschool student is murdered by three meat-head white kids, the rain mysteriously comes down in bloody torrents!An orginal story and action end to end it was one of the better Laymon novels I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Let's be honest here, I really don't expect too much from Richard Laymon when it comes to the plotlines of his novels. I read his books for the over-the-top violence, and the fact that they are easy reads, and ridiculously addicting/enjoyable. This goes for One Rainy Night as it does for most other Laymon novels. True, Laymon did write some novels that relied more on atmosphere than violence (Traveling Vampire Show, Night In The Lonesome October, Bite, etc.), but most of his novels are really just written to shock and maybe even disgust the reader. One Rainy Night delivers totally on that second level.As soon as the book starts, we are introduced to characters that encounter the black rain that is pouring down on the town of Bixby. It appears that whenever the rain hits a victim, that person turns insanely violent, and goes for the nearest living human around them. These \\"crazies\\" retain all forms of human intelligence, they just now have an urge to kill people and eat them. Throughout the novel, we follow about 3 or 4 main storylines. The characters aren't really developed at all, and when Laymon takes a break from the violence, the break is usually used for an actual sex scene, or a sexual fantasy from one of the main male characters. Therefore, there is not much emotional attachment when the characters meet their demises. To cancel out that, Laymon goes with extremely descriptive, brutal violence that is played out on almost every page of this book. The black rain is the main catalyst throughout the story, but Laymon, as always, makes sure to throw in some references to the dark parts of the human consciousness. When the non-affected humans are doing things that are worse than the crazies, it just gives the story a little more of an interesting aspect.What this novel really plays out like is Richard Laymon's version of a \\"zombie\\" book. Instead of the crazies being stupid and clumsy, however, they are smart, and much more dangerous. The intensity of the novel is what really saves it. Only Laymon can get away with doing this kind of book, though, for me. When it comes to reading Richard's books, since there are no more to look forward to, it seems as if I have much more of an appreciation for his ability to write a good novel, without showing much of an ability to be a truly great writer. His true talents are displayed in many of his works, but this isn't one of them. It is still, however, definitely worth your time if you are a fan of horror fiction."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"The rain was black, pleasantly warm and it fell heavily in the small, unremarkable town of Bixby. After the death of Maxwell Chidi, in a possible racial attack, it began to fall with the coming of the night and it did very &quot;strange&quot; things to all those caught in the rain.This book is classic Laymon and it tears along at a rip-roaring pace with little time to catch your breath between what have almost become his violent &quot;set pieces&quot;. The premise is slightly odd but what else have we come to expect from what must be one of the modern masters of horror writing.One Rainy Night will grab you from the first paragraph and you will feel slightly cheated when it comes to an end; not because of the ending itself but because it has ended."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This is definately true Laymon style!! It totally keeps you on the edge of your seat. A great read for any fan of Mr Laymon indeed. There is plenty of gore, lots of suspense and some black rain to make it interesting...."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"The town of Bixby seems like an ordinary enough place to live. The people live their ordinary lives with their ordinary jobs to attend to, dreaming dreams of being fairytales that defy the mundaneness of their existence like most people find themselves doing. Then comes the event in which a boy is burned alive because of the color of his skin and the girl he dated, followed by the black rain that changes everything in the blink of an eye. As it falls, people find themselves coated in sodden clothing and polluted with more than just physical, but also emotional, grime. They wander the streets that they've lived in maddened with murderous rage and primal desires while the people \\"lucky\\" enough to avoid those sooty skies cringe as the night of the \\"wet people\\" descends. And that is just the beginning.In the realm of horror writing, the story seems a bit clich&eacute; at first. There's a catalyst that causes something ominous to descend upon a town, thrusting its occupants into a state of evolving madness. Within it are wondrous forms of gore and a potential victimology being birthed, but it seems to state that, in the end, all actions have consequences and that even the innocents suffer at the hands of those willing to sacrifice them. The thing that makes it good, however, is that the story is crafted in an entertaining fashion and the black rain finds a nice way to construct a tale that says that its author, Richard Laymon, understands how to divulge the fabric of his thoughts and break through the mundane. Through the use of introduction to a town that seems like so many other towns and citizens that have lives and feelings, he melds their thoughts and reactions into a world where every turn has a potential disaster looming with an axe in the shadows. He showcases little pieces of the world outside but, for the most part, the story is a character-driven one and the fear and loves his constructs entail look and act like the realities of emotion. Pain, loss, watching the death of people that you have cared about and loved and knowing that, in some rights, you yourself could have caused this, is spoken each time one of his people looks outside and breaths. Everyone has the potential to falter and fall down that spiraling staircase, becoming a victim or a monster or at least a person marred by experience. Personally, I find that favorable when reading about some bedevilment laying stretching out its hand.If you are someone that is looking for enjoyment that isn't groundbreaking but that does entertain in a gruesome fashion, then you might enjoy this and other pieces from the mind of Laymon. He has a way with the tapestries woven, one that many other people lack in their storytelling, and is worth staking out because there is always some sacrificial lamb worth watching as it suffers through page after bleak page. Some are better than others, mind you, and some have more to say as the author progresses and grows, but they all have something within them I find worth reading."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Another great Laymon book. Laymon is well known for being able to reveal and develop the dark nature that hides in people. This book is dedicated to that idea.A mysterious black rain is the catalyst that sets off a small town. Once exposed to the black rain, ones darkest natures are able to rise to the surface and take over.One Rainy Night shows us what could happen when not just one or two people throw off the shackles of civilization and succumb to the darkness, but a significant portion of the population.This one kept me on edge though the whole story and I just could not figure out where it was taking me (another great trait of a Richard Laymon story)."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This is my first Laymon book, and it was defintiely an enjoyable read. He wastes no time with suspense building, and very little with character development. Instead he launches right into the action. A mysterious black rain falls on the small town of Bixby,,CA, turning everyone it touches into homicidal maniacs. Various groups of heroes are followed through the night as they fight for survival against the crazies. This book is like a novelized version of one of those arcade games where you shoot seemingly endless swarms of murderous zombies. Not much for depth, a bit gory, but a fun book nonetheless. Reads fast despite its 400+ pages."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Having read this novel last year as an import, I was thrilled to see it on bookshelves here in the US. This book is an excellent example of the writing abilities of this author. &quot;One Rainy Night&quot; opens with the murder of a black student by a bunch of rednecks. Shortly thereafter the small town is plagued by black rain that continues to fall without end. The townspeople who are exposed to the black rain find themselves becoming increasingly violent towards each other. Within a couple of chapters the whole town has become insane. Killings are rampant as decent people turn into maniacs. At every junction where people meet there are attacks. The violence is extremely brutal and raw. What makes it even more disturbing is that all the acts are completely realistic. Laymon has a way of exposing mankind's ugly side that would make even the most hardened reader cringe. This is not gratuitous gore like you find in a lot of hack horror novels but a glimpse at what happens when good people give in to their animal nature.Another distinction in Laymon's writing is that he takes the conventional roles of hero, victim, villain and completely turns them around. It is not uncommon for the hero to become a victim, for the victim to become a villain and so on. In Laymon's books heroes sometimes die and villains get away. The battle between good and evil rages on, often within one character. The character's in this book are real people forced into the most extreme of situations with shocking outcomes.Without giving away too much of the storyline, I must add that the ending was a big surprise. The twists and turns that occurred within the story kept me guessing through the end. The book was a fast, action packed read that pulled no punches. I highly recommend it but be warned it is not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"If you are easily grossed out, this one isn't for you. Laymon takes readers on a campy ride through one fatal night in Bixby. A horrible racially-motivated murder leads to voodoo revenge plot. Hmmmm....ONE RAINY NIGHT depicts graphic violence and sex underscoring the dark side that supposedly lurks beneath us all. Once the mysterious thick black rain starts to fall, townsfolk begin to run amuck. This is an easy read; I finished it in one sitting. You won't find any award-winning dialogue, characters or plot. Many things go unanswered here: what about the suffering of the murdered boy's family? how do a couple of people quickly figure out the rain's secret and accept it without question? why does 9-year-old Kara sound like my loveable elderly aunt? Laymon's typical ability to raise the hair on the back of your neck shines through however. If you are looking for deep-meaning horror with subtle twists: this isn't it! RAINY does what it intends: it gives you a few chills, has you racing toward the finish, but all in all leaves you with the feeling that you just spent an afternoon watching that low-budget horror film you've always loved. I enjoyed reading it; I love Laymon's writing in general. But don't pick this one up expecting to have to figure out the plot. It's simple: an eye for an eye, be careful what you wish for, and humans are just animals underneath the fancy clothes. Sometimes you want steak, sometimes you secretly pig out on cheeseburgers. This one is a fun, greasy cheeseburger: easily consumed, quickly forgotten."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"The plot of ONE RAINY NIGHT can be summed up easily: black rain falls, turns people into killers, and the unaffected few must try to stay alive. That's it.Granted this is my first Laymon novel, and I already have BITE so I will give that a chance, but if this lowest-common-denominator material is the sort of horror people are raving about, I feel sad for the future of the genre. This is b-movie stuff, and fit only for a short story or novella, if that. Like Bentley Little's UNIVERSITY, the author simply uses a device (in this case, the rain) as a vehicle for sex and violence, but there's even less to this particular story.ONE RAINY NIGHT is easy to breeze through, and if you're looking for something to read on the train or on the beach it may be perfect. I thought it was a disappointment."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Don't read Laymon looking for the kind of rich character development that you find in Stephen King's work. But he does go for a balls-out approach to horror that really works.On one particular night in the town of Bixby, a mysterious black rain begins to fall, turning anyone it touches -- man, woman or child -- into a savage killer.The story tracks multiple characters who try to survive the night without either being killed or turned into marauding monsters themselves.One Rainy Night is an enthralling read that will have you burning through the pages to get to the end. Laymon cheats on his premise a couple of times, (as in when one character decides to &quot;rein in&quot; her bloodlust) but you forgive the occasional lapse because the story is so damned entertaining.Get this book, curl up with it on a dark night and prepare to be gripped."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Richard Laymon has outdone himself with &quot;One Rainy Night.&quot; A small California town falls victim to a viscous black rain that turns anyone who gets wet into a murderous maniac. This is a high octane homage to &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; that will keep you turning the pages. Be warned this novel contains rape and a great deal of graphic violence."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Laymon was one heck of storyteller, I have to say that. His tales move so fast that it is almost too easy to skip over the important plot details, which I guess happened to a few of the negative reviewers here. All the plot holes seemed to be filled to me. The reason for the rain is made abundantly clear and the overcoming of the psychosis (which simply entails washing the black fluid off of the victim) happens to more than just one character in the book and certain character's awareness of, and ability to fight off, the rain's seduction to violence seems to depend more on the character rather than the situation.All in all One Rainy Night is a brisk, blood curdling b-movie of a read, the literary mirror of George Romero's The Crazies (aka Code Name: Trixie). This was the first Richard Laymon novel I have read and will certainly will not be the last. I have become a fan for life."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This story, like many of Laymon's stories, begins with a simple premise and rollercoasters from there! Mysterious rain follows the brutal murder of a Black high school student. Is there a connection? Whomever the rain hits gives in to violent, murderous impulses, regardless of age, gender, or temperment. It's a fascinating story as Laymon taps into primal fears of mob violence, the uncertainty of strangers and the urge to act on one's impulses. Contrary to some of the other reviews on-line here, his plot is logical and his prose is gripping. This is one author that uses visual imagery so intense that the reader is struck thinking, &quot;What kind of a person could think of something like that?&quot; His characters as well are flawed, just like the rest of us, and face horrible situations/tribulations they must overcome in order to survive. Laymon is one of the few authors who will get you to care about a character, then viciously kill them off later. Heroes don't always make it to the end, neither do the villains. It makes for good reading from sheer unpredictability alone. If you have never given Laymon a try, pick up a copy of this book. You won't be disappointed, although you might find yourself avoiding strangers the next rainy night..."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I love Mr. Laymon's novels. This one was great nasty fun until near the end when it came to an abrupt, what-the-hell-happened climax. He has the occasional habit of just leaving his characters dangling. And I don't much care for his referring to women as &quot;gals&quot; all the time. I'm not a stickler for PC terminology, but that just rubs me the wrong way... However, this novel is most certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"If you like horror and enjoy reading for pleasure and entertainment only, you should take a look at Laymon. This is not Faulkner; you are not going to learn anything from this book. This is the second Laymon novel I have read, and I must say I enjoyed this much more than I did Bite. The characters were a little more real this time, and a couple of them were even likeable. I still can't really figure Laymon out; the whole time I am reading him, I have a gnawing feeling that the guy is just a hack, yet he does a good job of keeping my interest and entertaining me. He's just here to tell a good story, and it may be unfair of me to expect something more from him--Laymon certainly seems comfortable in his style, and I admire him for that. That in itself is the sign of a good, confident writer. And he does tell a good story. Action is the name of the game here; the writing style is very direct. Basically, all of the important characters wind up wet at some point, so we must judge them by how they act under abnormal and normal conditions in order to &quot;understand&quot; them. Good and bad exists in all of us, and Laymon certainly seems to recognize this fact. One thing sticks out in my mind--I am bemused by the fact that Laymon's characters are always hungry. They can survive an assault by a bunch of wet, black, terrifying people and then immediately sit down to eat: restaurant employees (those still alive) start serving dinner before dead rioters can even be stowed away. Denise and Kara, a teenager and young girl (the true heroes in my mind), eat popcorn in between acts of defending their very lives. When I think of some of the actions and events in this book now, they almost seem laughable. While you are reading it, though, these things don't matter. Laymon makes it all work somehow. Those disgusted by gore should not even be reading this review, yet Laymon's gore is not as bad as it is made out to be; the gore in this book belongs here, really, and it does not seem to be employed purely for shock value. All in all, Laymon is an intriguing writer, and I can't really understand why this American author, while popular in Britain, has never made much of a splash here in the States--he is certainly a better writer than John Saul, for example. Laymon is unique; some will like him and some will not, but you can't know how you will react to him until you actually try him out."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"ONE RAINY NIGHT is the quintessential Laymon novel. If you had to define the essence of Richard Laymon in just one book, ONE RAINY NIGHT probably does it. Brutal, uncompromising and fast paced, ONE RAINY NIGHT tells it like it is. There are no passages of comfy prose, no time to catch your breath. ONE RAINY NIGHT is set in a world gone mad and Laymon captures that chaos beautifully. Watch out especially for the restaurant scene which is one of the best desperate situation scenarios that I have ever read."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I really liked this book. It reminds me very much of Dean Koontz. I finished this book in about three days. It is a page turner and the graphic details kick [rear]!"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"As an avid reader of horror fiction, I looked forward to reading this author's material for the first time. I was quite disappointed.Yes, it is a page-turner, but a very shallow page turner. I found myself skimming as I hit the middle of it...and once I begin skimming, that's the death of a novel to me.The characters have absolutely no depth. Their various motivations make little sense. Why would a police detective run an obstacle course of insane murderers to find a woman he knew only a few days...risking the lives of people under his protection? Why were three teenaged boys so bad to the bone? So many more inconsistencies and unexplored questions.I seriously doubt I'll pick up another of his books."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Yeah, I pretty much had to use that title, especially since this novel and that \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode share not only a supernatural meteorological phenomenon but themes of hatred and divine judgment. But don't take that to mean that the novel is necessarily trying to be a serious commentary; it IS Richard Laymon.MILD SPOILER ALERT\\"One Rainy Night\\" is evidently Laymon's take on a classic horror premise: the zombie apocalypse (albeit a localized one). On the night after an apparent hate crime, a black rain falls on a small town and turns anyone caught under it into a violent, homicidal barbarian. Note that I didn't say \\"mindless\\" because these aren't zombies per se; they're human beings who just have their inhibitive \\"KILLING IS BAD\\" functions switched off, perfectly capable of communicating with others and thinking their murderous courses of action through. Not that this significantly distinguishes the story from the \\"living dead\\" approach, but hey, it's an intriguing idea.The action is divided between five main characters, all of whom are intertwined in \\"six degrees\\" fashion and most of whom have their own subplots:Officer Trev must escort a mother and daughter to safety, though he's more concerned about finding his would-be girlfriend. Babysitter Denise and her charge try to stay safe from the chaos outside. Lou and his friends, who committed the aforementioned hate crime, take a woman prisoner. Maureen, Trev's would-be girlfriend, happens to be the woman taken prisoner. And John and his wife become trapped in a restaurant surrounded by a horde of rain-drenched psychos. While the narrative is mostly engaging, I didn't much care about the restaurant plot, partly because of John's weird and clumsy characterization.[BEGIN MILD SPOILERS]And that's far from my only criticism. There's a sex scene that feels rather pointless and incongruous (not the rape; that's pretty much obligatory for Laymon). The way Trev learns what exactly is causing the storm feels a little convenient, though that's a minor complaint. Far more convenient is how one secondary character somehow resists the rain's effects and contains her urges; deus ex machina much? Also, the death of another secondary character near the end comes out of nowhere and feels kinda cruel and unwarranted, but that's also a mere quibble. Finally, the girl Denise babysits just had to be a precocious little problem-solver, didn't she? Man, that got corny.[END MILD SPOILERS]But the good outweighs the bad. And even though \\"One Rainy Night\\" doesn't take the concept of intelligent \\"zombies\\" to its logical extreme, it still leaves us with a basic zombie-style story. And zombie stories are awesome, amirite?8/10"},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This was my first book I read by Richard Laymon and have been a fan ever since. I love this book I enjoy the way how Laymon can make ordinary things extraordinary. By far the best Laymon book I read. I recommend this book to anyone and I had some of my coworkers read this book. They love it."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This was my first Richard Laymon novel. It comes off as a second-rate version of James Herbert'sThe FogandThe Dark, both of which I highly recommend. One Rainy Night is the same story but told with less plot and on a smaller scale.A mysterious substance (in this case, black rain) falls on a small American town, turning anyone exposed to it into horny homicidal maniacs. The only twist here is that once the rain is washed off, the infected return to normal. There's lots of rape and gory violence but that's about it. The characters are okay, but they don't always act believably. The ending is a letdown.To its credit, the book is written in a clean, crisp, accessible style that is a notch above the usual paperback trash, but unfortunately, it does nothing more to try and elevate itself. It's a bit forgettable, really, being entertaining while you read it, but nothing sticks with you. I give it 3.5-stars, but I could see how some people could give it 4.Fans of 28 Days Later-style fast zombies, mysterious plagues, and mini-apocalypse scenarios may enjoy this."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"I have loved this book for quite some time. Laymon has been one of my favorite horror writers, and this book I've always come back to. I think it would make for a great movie, considering it has a minor resemblance to zombie's (mindless killing and craziness) which I find thrilling."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Once you've picked up one of Richard Laymon's books and opened to the first page you're hooked. Laymon has a way of drawing you in and before you know it, you're halfway into the story and it's two in the morning. ONE RAINY NIGHT is that kind of story. What would you do if most of the townfolk who had come in contact with the rain were suddenly turned into homicidal maniacs and you were one of the few sane survivors? You'd pray that Laymon had written a happy ending for you."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"If you like Stephen King and Dean Koontz, then you will most likely enjoy Richard Laymon. \\"One Rainy Night\\" is a fun, fast paced book, that even a slow reader would have a tough time stretching across 3 days.The basic storyline is that soon after a black high school student is killed and set on fire after a school dance, a strange rain begins falling across town, a black rain. Those caught in the rain turn into homicidal maniacs looking to butcher anyone who isn't \\"wet\\". We are introduced to basically four different groups of people experiencing the black rain across the small town. A couple at a fancy restaurant, the daughter they've left at home with a babysitter, a police deputy and two women he's trying to protect and the final group we meet are the thugs who murdered the student.Laymon keeps the action popping between the various groups, there is plenty of bloodshed and gore sprinkled throughout the pages of \\"One Rainy Night\\", and for the most part the heroes of the novel are fun to read about. I did have a couple times where I didn't quite \\"buy\\" what was going on in the story, for instance the murderous Buddy and his friends seemed to cartoonish to scary and I can't imagine anyone being threatened by this Moe, Larry & Curly trio with all the other mayhem going on during the storm. There were a couple other things I had issues with in the novel as well, but don't want to spoil anything so I'll just say if you want a fun page-turner give \\"One Rainy Night\\" a try, if you are someone who obsesses about a story's logic, you might want to give this one a pass."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"This was a fun (but rather silly) gory adventure. It was a suspenseful read and certainly grisly with its violence, but definitely entertaining. The main vein of the plot - a black rain falls from the sky, transforming those who get wet - was certainly unique, and the opening scene was downright shocking. The explanation of the rain was not the high point in the book, but it didn't detract from the fun of this horrific read."},{"Title":"One Rainy Night","review":"Laymon so obviously wrote this book very quickly. Why else would he leave so many plot holes(some people are ok in it) and such a silly and sudden ending? What I like about it is that it's a quick and easy read. No multi-layered plot lines and deep characters, just fast and violent gore. If you want to read about some people acting like maniacs and doing acts that would make Lucifer smile, read on."},{"Title":"Famous Guitar Intros (Riff Notes)","review":"I think another reviewer may have missed the point of this rather small book -- its whole premise is (see the title, due) to run some classic intros by the player. I think it succeeds quite well on that front.Besides, it's actually a lot of fun to grab the axe, open the book and be able to nail a new riff or two in no time flat. This book is fairly well packed with intros that are fun to jame on.JMHO"},{"Title":"Famous Guitar Intros (Riff Notes)","review":"I bought this hoping to get a few dictinctive, recognizeable licks under my belt quickly. I was greatly disappointed. The snippets are mainly tiny, especially for the better songs -- several are so short you do not even get a feel for the song. Others do not seem authentic and vary from other tab/music scores I have seen (Sunshine of Your Love for example varies from two other versions that I own and is inferior to both). For Layla I don't think they chose the best guitar part (the original has at least 4 guitars). My girl is just one measure/barr!!

Some of it is very clever, and the references to pop culture still work, but more might have been made of the human and emotional back stories of the main characters. Neve Campbell's character, for example, doesn't have the emotional resonance years later that (to take up a similar example in a different film genre) Molly Ringwald displayed in her movies for John Hughes.I look forward to CURSED, the new collaboration between Kevin Williamson and Wes Crave, though the rumors of the re-shoots and re-takes, actors being fired, etc., and dissatisfied test audiences, make one wonder if it won't be more like KILLING MRS TINGLE than SCREAM.

The whole book is trying to find out who the killer is. They brought a bunch of new faces to the film who have become famous such as Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette who recently got married. This is the movie that started their careers. The book is just the script to the movie with pictures and added scenes. I loved this book so you should like it too. anyone who likes a good murder mystery. Also catch the movie.

It's great for people like me who have seen the movie a billion times. But, those who like horror books will also adore this book. The book also has a little bit of dialouge not heard in the film.

Yeah, a confession after all these years that the gift wasn't strictly 'un-used'. Anyway, I won't go into the plot of Scream, anyone reading this probably already knows it better than I do, having only seen it twice, but I will note that devoid of its visuals (beyond a few movie freeze-frames included in the book) Williamson's writing in this script comes off as better than I remember it being in Scream. Its campiness is elevated to funnier than on screen, its pop culture/film references seem more apt, and the twist the run-time builds up to is reinforced as decently unexpected. (The screenplay also spares the reader a lot of the visual violence that distracts in the case of reading for the sake of broadening insight into the spoken words of a film.) I've read scripts to a few other movies, the best being The Usual Suspects, and every time I've thought how it's a shame more people don't read the scripts to their favorite films, and how un-selfserving that more directors don't publish their screenplays.Scream isn't a favorite of mine, and it's not high art but if you like the movie, pick this up sometime.

This is a must have item for any Craven or 'Scream' fan - It is as intense as the movie, but still has an slighter edge thanks to Kevin Williamson's character and scene descriptions. It was just as riveting, just as chilling and is equal to the movie. I had memorized the entire novel in a few days and was constantly reading it. It's like saying 'Well I can't see the movie now, I'm in school, (work, church, bathroom, etc.) so I'll do the next best thing - read the screenplay!' and you will because it isn't too long and can be read in less than an hour, plus it has pictures from the movie and pictures from the sequel. Kevin's introduction realy gives you a insight to what made him make this screenplay, from how he came to know horror, and what eventful night gave him the ideas for the story. All in all, a very handy thing to have in your backpack, (briefcase, over your bible, medicine chest, etc.)."},{"Title":"Scream: A Screenplay","review":"This is a great read.

Hellinger's message is one of humility in accepting what is, especially the natural order of relationships. For instance, rather than bemoaning an abusive father, Hellinger will stand by the victimizer and have the victim, a son or daughter, humbly acknowledge the father for being the father and to place the circumstances as secondary. In this action, the natural order of the relationship becomes untangled. Hellinger is more interested not in details but in finding what works in resolving problems. The past is past, he seems to say with each page's turn, and focusing on making things right is his intent.From my personal work, I have seen how this work is indeed powerfully effective, and because of Hellinger's non-linear, often intangible approach, he is a controversial and immensely popular figure in psychotherapy. This review does not do this book or Hellinger's work justice. In reading Love's Hidden Symmetry, I found myself reading only a small section, then putting down the book to sit with whatever I had just read. Each section is worth more than the space on its page, in other words. It took some time to complete it, and a better understanding of what he says will probably only come in time and in multiple readings. Hellinger's work talks precisely about being humbled by each other and our processes and how things work as they do. Moreoever, through his readings and family constellations I have discovered how powerfully my lineage influences who I am. The brilliance of this work is in its systemic significance: how noted events, such as war or murder, can have lasting effects transgenerationally.My only criticism his is limited inclusion about environmental factors and the role of civilization in contributing to individual psychological problems; this area is not seeming to be his focus. Instead, Hellinger, a master psychotherapist, appears more interested in redirecting our entangled relationships with each other. I leave my first reading of this book still intent on people finding healthier ways to live, rather than just necessarily focusing on their healing; at the same time, I am blown away by what Hellinger does for the individual and family end of things. It is simply unlike no other I have been exposed to before."},{"Title":"Love's Hidden Symmetry: What Makes Love Work in Relationships","review":"This is a marvelous book that addresses fundamental issues in our contemporary Western society with great, heart-felt insight.The author discusses his theory and practice of the phenomenology of intimate relationships, which has the power to uncover the hidden dynamics of family relations, in order to heal individual people and their entire family system.The author explains in great detail how any loss of balance - in our sense of belonging, give-and-take, and need for structure - within family systems necessarily causes feelings of guilt in both the family conscience and individual consciences of its members. Loss of balance in one part of the system invariably causes compensation in other, weaker parts, most often children - who will be adults later in their lives.If the, mostly subconscious, causes of these compensations are not properly recognized and addressed, then therapy is bound to fail. If however we start from fundamental insight in the system dynamics well explained in this marvelous book, then we will be empowered to take the right course of action.All sorts of causes are phenomenologically explained in this book, in order to provide fundamental insight in their \\"karmic\\" structures of cause-result: divorce, child adoption, sexual abuse, suicide, homocide, criminal behavior, abortion, unfaithfulness in marriage, a scape-goat within a family, different sexual needs within an intimate relationship, tragic loss, re-marriage after divorce, a child mothering or fathering a parent, homosexuality, jealousy, refusal to accept a parent, legal custody, illegal children, neglecting a partner in favour of children, and so on.The author offers fundamental insight in these matters, as well as sound strategies to address them decisively. There is a sense of \\"natural magic\\" in his therapeutics, when Bert Helling has a client re-enact (and correct) their family constellation. One can easily understand that Hellinger must have learnt much of this from his work as a former Catholic priest among the Zulus of South-Africa, where a kind of \\"innate wisdom\\" must have been awoken in him - The short biography in the appendix anyway explains a lot about the developing \\"spirit\\" of Hellinger during his life.In conclusion: This book may teach us to gain our rightful place within our family system, one that is our birth-right; gain freedom from \\"systemic guilt\\", and live in peace within our family.What I like about this book is its redeeming spirit and its knowing heart, which anyone can understand. It is deeply human and I like it tremendously. If any book can change your life by gaining fundamental insight in family dynamics, then this is the one. I wish I could rate it with 6 stars."},{"Title":"Love's Hidden Symmetry: What Makes Love Work in Relationships","review":"Provocative, candid, controversial, filled with hope. Poetic and wise, this book captures the profound and extraordinary potential of understanding and restoring balance in families. Truth was discovered on every page; the book is easy to read and contains entertaining insights. Hellinger blends storytelling and transcript material to demonstrate and unfold his theory giving hope and ammunition for healing family dynamics."},{"Title":"Love's Hidden Symmetry: What Makes Love Work in Relationships","review":"For me chapter one alone is worth the price. As a group facilitator, Hellinger's insight on the how the system balances and how to approach it from the practitioner's point of view reveals a lot of system thinking in family/group situation. I particularly appreciate he sees his role as a Tao Master, which is really doing something by doing nothing. This book is now in Chinese and we have a study group and an on-going practitioner's group around the topic."},{"Title":"Love's Hidden Symmetry: What Makes Love Work in Relationships","review":"Love's Hidden Symmetry is a book that will change your life. Bert Hellinger's wisdom, the love that shines through everything he says and does will touch the reader's soul. His work with family constellations is the most effective, gentle and graceful tool for re-creating harmony in our troubled family lives. A must for anyone interested in therapy and personal growth.Frank Arjava Petter, author"},{"Title":"Love's Hidden Symmetry: What Makes Love Work in Relationships","review":"I had therapeutic results just reading the book. Bert Hellinger reveals Truths that make a shift in one's heart that effects how we react to others and how they respond or react to us.Hellinger explains how injuries in one individuals' emotional field can effect someone else in the system, often for several generations. He also shows how one individual can \\"balance\\" the system. No one has to change, one only does what needs to be done. For example, a mother may have a hurt from her reaction to her husband, and tell a son, \\"your father is no good.\\" She may also tell the son, \\"you are just like your father\\", so the son feels rejected by the mother, that there is something wrong with his father and him. He may turn to drugs or alcohol to cover the feelings of unworthiness, and no amount of rehab will work until the family system is balanced and love is reconciled.Hellinger shows how these fields impact us, causing us to behave in destructive ways. When one \\"sees\\" what is going on, without moral judgement, and just does what needs to be done, amazing healing can happen in the whole system.The work is quite profound. It is not an easy or fast read. It is a book that you read a few chapters and process the information; then you read it again and again."},{"Title":"Love's Hidden Symmetry: What Makes Love Work in Relationships","review":"This book is book is blessed with a depth of understanding rarely seen. Though parts of it may seem outragous at times, upon reflection often show an understanding of famly dynamics at a much deeper level. 'Love's Hidden Symmetry' describes very skillfully some of the immensly profound material laid bear by Bert Hellinger. Definately worth reading, though this should be done slowly and with much thought."},{"Title":"Love's Hidden Symmetry: What Makes Love Work in Relationships","review":"For MDs, psychologists, counselors of all kind, and psychotherapists, here is the basic text for Family Constellation work. My experience over the last few years with Family Constellations suggests that it is the most dynamic development in the field of psychological and physical healing in decades. The book is a flowing combination of narrative, anecdotes, transcripts and didactic material, illustrating how members of families carry each others traumas and misunderstandings, often for generations, and how these are resolved through re-establishing the proper \\"orders of Love\\". The theme of the book is much broader and deeper than \\"How To Have A Good Relationship\\". It is about the unacknowledged rules of love and relationship and the restoration of integrity to family and relationship systems.I have consistently seen long term psychological and physical problems which have not responded to other forms of healing be resolved in a single constellation. Everyone in counseling work needs to read this book, and understand this material.Oddly enough, when you consider how popular psychotherapy is in the United States, we are just about the last country on the planet to recognize and embrace the merit of Bert Hellinger's work."},{"Title":"Love's Hidden Symmetry: What Makes Love Work in Relationships","review":"I read this book over five years.

Learn to use dereflection and paradoxical intention. Understand the application of these methods with OCD and suicidal patients. Learn about the fundamentals of Logotherapy with schizophrenics. Frankl describes applications and limitations of the methods he founded, and he elucidates them with case reports. Lecture and Q&A; session. Excellent audio quality.Tape 2. Mans Need and Search for Values. (Religion in Education Foundation, Oct. 1963) Frankl makes preliminary remarks and then is the subject of a discussion with knowledgeable experts who challenge him to reveal the essentials of his philosophy. Frankl distinguishes between values and meaning, elucidating the distinction between objective and subjective meaning. This tape affords an opportunity to experience his passion and scope. Lecture and Q&A; session. Superb audio quality.Tape 3. The Pluralism of Science and the Unity of Man. (University of Vienna, May 1965) We are damned by the limitations of our lenses and redeemed by the depth of our vision. In this wide-ranging lecture, Frankl alerts us to the danger of reductionism in science and psychotherapy. He describes the need for a unitary perspective that encompasses basic human strivings. Lecture. Fair audio quality.Tape 4. The Concept of Man in Logotherapy. (Iowa, Nov. 1965) Here, Frankl offers a profound and articulate of vision of the transcendental nature of man. Inspiring and edifying, Frankl is the poet laureate of meaning. Quoting from the masters, he demonstrates the heights of his existential perspective. Lecture. Excellent audio quality.Tape 5. Public Lecture. (Neurological Policlinic of Vienna, circa 1960) This tape features two lectures, one of 30 minutes on the philosophy underlying Logotherapy, and one of 20 minutes consisting of a clinical presentation on the collective neuroses of our time. Together, they bring listeners Frankl at his best. He is clear, erudite, insightful, original and inspiring. Superb audio quality.Tape 6. The Meaning of Suffering. (Los Angeles, Jan. 1983) Frankl discusses how meaning can be found regardless of age, socioeconomic status, or race. Meaning is possible in spite of suffering: Despair is suffering without meaning. Frankls case for optimism, or belief in the possibility of meaning even in the worst of circumstances, is explicated. Two-part lecture and Q&A; session. Good audio quality.Tape 7. The Unheard Cry for Meaning. (Public Lecture, Massey Hall, Toronto, June 1977) Frankl discusses how feelings of meaninglessness and emptiness (the existential vacuum) are related to suicide, and how man will choose to take his life if he feels that life has no meaning. He also touches here on what he has characterized as the mass neurotic triad - depression, aggression and addiction - phenomena which only can be understood, he says, in light of the existential vacuum that underlies them. Lecture. Good audio quality.Tape 8. San Quentin Lecture. (San Quentin Prison, California, May 1966) Frankl discusses how man fulfills meaning and that meaning must be found, it cannot be given. Conscience is the intuitive capacity of man. Frankl also describes three distinct ways of discovering meaning: by doing or creating something, by experiencing something or encountering someone; and by choosing ones attitude toward suffering. Lecture. Good audio quality."},{"Title":"Love's Hidden Symmetry: What Makes Love Work in Relationships","review":"I think what Mr. hellinger observed is how karma works in this world, though he said his finding is different from karma's ordinary definition. I believe we carry our original temperament and karma, and we are influrenced easily by people around us with their karma. In order not to be influrenced so easily, especially, by negative engery, we should pray oftenly to God for protection.

An Illustrated History of the Ford T-Bird (The Ford Road Series, Vol. 4)","review":"I have owned this book for about 16 or 17 years. It is a fine reference piece, but it should not be compared to current Thunderbird books. There are scores of close-up photographs that show the finer points of Thunderbirds, from the Volumatic Radio to the SwingAway Steering Wheel. The black and white photos do not in any way detract from the history or technological correctness of everything that is presented. If you need color photographs then look elsewhere. If you want well-researched data and wonderful close-ups, then this is the book for you. The book itself is a collector's item because of its period correctness and the fact that when it was published there was no other book that could come close to it in lavishness or completeness. I think that still holds true today."},{"Title":"Thunderbird!

Although not complete with respect to information on every aspect of a concours restoration, and hindered by mostly black and white photos of the details of each year, it is still an excellent resource for anyone restoring a 1966 or older Thunderbird. It is especially good for those interrested in the two seaters from 55 - 57.

Schmidhauser interviewed Otto Mueller and composed the book from tapes of the interview. Otto begins with a brief historical sketch that tells of the movement of the Germans into Russia following Catherine the Great's Manifesto of 1763, then details his experiences of life growing up in the well-developed German-Russian village of Ebenfeld in the early years of the twentieth century. He recalls the good and bad--childhood mischief, the design of buildings, holidays, spankings, a natural famine, grisly attacks by roving barbarians, weddings, visiting on Sundays, and trips to market and the shoemaker. He recalls the extremely hard physical work that motivated a bright and studious boy to think about going to theological school (which never happened).In the late 1920s, revolution blew in like a dark storm. A new communist government he viewed abstractly as \\"the regime\\" upset their ordered lives, beginning with language rules. Then, as it consolidated its power, it moved to force the people onto collectivized farms. Because of their relative prosperity, the Muellers found themselves labeled kulaks and formally classified as state enemies. Otto's much older brother Heinrich, who was discharged from the army in 1927, foresaw what was coming, which enabled him to adjust more quickly than other members of the family. But Otto's father refused to believe things would get as bad as his son predicted and protested the changes. The worst began to come true when, as a result of the family's refusal to become members of the collective farm, they were evicted from their home and their possessions were removed. The men were sent off to the army or hard labor, and many families who remained, including the Muellers, huddled in a shack on the outskirts of the village. His sister Ida was sent to a hard-labor camp in Siberia for three years for trying to cut some sunflower seeds for the family to eat. For many reasons, they came for other families too. Friends and neighbors disappeared from the Muellers' lives, singing hymns whose words he still recalls. The Mueller family attempted to go to America in 1928 but was not successful. Finally, they did leave Ebenfeld of their own volition, thinking to take up land opened to settlement in Siberia. They went to Slovgorod and then eastward, living for a time in a town with many German refugees. Otto came to view life itself a gift. \\"It was [my mother] who taught me how to learn to accept one's fate, without hitting back or hating the aggressor. She taught us that love is a much stronger force than any hate. She used to say, \\"Just imagine that you are in the other person's place and act accordingly.\\" In 1933, the family returned to the Ukraine and to Ebenfeld. His father also returned, a shadow of his old self. His father's dying words were, \\"You have to avenge my death.\\" Otto long mulled the conflict between these words and his mother's admonitions.This time, the Muellers endeavored to accept life on the communists' terms and settled into the collective farm structure. Otto went to school at Achdus, became a young communist, and parlayed his excellence as a student into a leadership position. Sensing a need, he went to school to learn cattle husbandry. But fear remained a central fact of their existence: \\"...the fear of banishment was evident in everybody\\"s behavior. \\"Fear was a constant companion.\\" \\"The Jews were our saviors in those times because they were less afraid of the communists.\\"Their lives changed again and yet another time. When the German armies came into the area, Otto served as their interpreter, but he and his family still had a sense of living with one foot in jail. They tried to maintain hope and survive emotionally, physically, and spiritually even after they became aware that the Germans had killed the Jews who had been their friends. They remembered that \\"Hate always generates more hate.\\" Eventually, Otto was taken into Germany along with thousands of other ethnic German refugees from the Ukraine. Next he endured the coming of the Russian troops and was caught up in the midst of the slaughter and suffering of active warfare. He was caught both physically and psychologically between the two armies even after the active fighting stopped.In the effort to find a secure place to live in the last days of war and the early days of peace, Otto's remaining alive at all depended more than once on coincidence and luck. He worked and lived in many places, chamelion-like assuming whatever identity would help him survive the day. He suspects that he may have been the only person of an original group of 1,500 to survive in the west. He married in Germany despite not knowing what had happened to his first wife (whom he married in Russia) in the war.Otto and his family migrated to Canada in 1951, where they were helped by Jews, Lutherans, and Mennonites. Their first years in Canada were difficult, beset with many temporary jobs and poor housing, their problems exacerbated by language difficulties. As time went by, memories of the old days troubled Otto, but he endured in his search for a better life. Fifteen years after their arrival in Canada, the family, which now consisted of two boys and two girls, moved from the Winnipeg area to Vancouver. Otto bought, fixed up, and sold houses, sang in choirs, and involved himself with the German Cultural Society. The children became educated, they moved into a beautiful home, and then, in 1971, they became Canadian citizens. \\"Finally I had arrived home,\\" says Otto.A negative in the book is Schmidhauser's erratic punctuation. This weakens it, but this is not a reason to avoid reading it. Otto Mueller is careful about dates throughout, using them in chapter headings and in the text. The dates will be very useful when books like this are used as anecdotal information by those who will write the formal histories. He tells a most absorbing story of heroism augmented by faith.Also about this period:Boardman, Edna. \\"Martha Liebelt: A Woman Who Wouldn't Return to Russia for a Mountain of Gold.\\" Heritage Review, a publication of the Germans from Russia Heritage Society, 1008 E.

The photos are colorful and well done. For someone who knows nothing about Conures and parrot species in general, it may be a good place to start. I found the explanatiion of Taxonomy to be beyond the the average pet owner needs or even wants to know. The book had a clinical, scientific feel to it, but did little to explore the joys of owning one of these highly intelligent and affectionate birds. If your budget can only afford one Conure book, you should pass this one up. For those collecting books about these faciniating parrots, it's a good addition to your parrot book library. Those wishing to start breeding their own Conures will find the section on breeding helpful, it provides a good overview of the process and is something that is hard to find in most books about particular parrot species."},{"Title":"The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece","review":"For any fans of this film, and indeed, for its detractors also, this is a must have guide to learning more about the behind the scenes gossip. I am glad this book was not written/published until the 25th anniversary of the movie, as enough time has passed for an objective view of the film to be made. There is no denying that this is a powerful, interesting and even disturbing film. I am espcially pleased that a great number of the actors took part in this book. I have always wondered what happened to Ronee Blakley, (who played the fragile Barbara Jean to a T in the film). Do not miss this book if you love the film."},{"Title":"The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece","review":"Robert Altman's Nashville is a movie that has been praised as one of the greatest American movies ever made and conversely has been derided as an overblown, preachy ego trip. Whatever side of the fence you may fall on, Jan Stuart has written an interesting, insightful account of the making of a complex film. Through interviews with just about everyone involved in the film, Mr. Stuart gives us an insider's view of not only the movie itself, but of the film's maverick director. We are transported back to the July &amp; August, 1974 when the cast and crew invades the Music City. Mr. Stuart paints a vivid picture of the town at that time and the feelings of the city's residents towards the Hollywood people. We get detailed accounts of the origins of the film, the path screenwriter Joan Tewkesbury took to creating the 24 characters and writing the script, the casting choices for the roles (how some actors like Robert Duvall, Louise Fletcher and Susan Anspach backed out), the filming of the scenes and the mood off camera. Mr. Stuart offers so much detail that you feel as if you were actually on the set. As with any book written about a movie, Mr. Stuart obviously considers Nashville to be a masterpiece and Mr. Altman to be a genius. Although he does praise both, the book is not a gushing love letter towards them. He does not overtly interject his feelings and tempers the praise by detailing the criticism the film received. All in all, Mr. Stuart lives up to the high standards of the movie, by writing a superb book."},{"Title":"The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece","review":"What a magnificent job Stuart has done with this intricate, intelligent history of one of the seminal films of the last century. Clearly possessing the diligence of a detective (or an archaeologist), Stuart has researched every aspect of &quot;Nashville&quot;'s creation and production, as well as its place in history, and has come up with a stylishly written, highly readable book. He makes a strong case for the film as a kind of happy accident in which a wild cast of characters--before and behind the camera--collided and created a masterpiece. Reading this book makes one want to weep for the state of the American film industry today, which could never produce another &quot;Nashville&quot; if it tried."},{"Title":"The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece","review":"I had no idea that there was so much anecdotal material to be had from the making of Robert Altman's country and western music opus, NASHVILLE but Jan Stuart has managed to interview nearly everyone involved. He traces the film's origins right up to what everyone involved (including country music insiders) thinks of it now. This is an exhaustive, detailed account of every aspect of how Altman's film was made but written in a very entertaining, engaging style.If you're a fan of Altman's films then this is definitely required reading as Stuart provides fascinating insights into how the man works and collaborates with others. The best thing I can say about this book is that it makes you immediately want to watch NASHVILLE all over again and appreciate how much hard work went into it. Great reading."},{"Title":"The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece","review":"A creditable piece of work by Mr. Stuart. I would have liked a little more on the artistic process and a little less on the soap opera of the cast and crew. It IS interesting to see how people have such complete misapprehension of one another and the motives of others. I guess that's what &quot;Nashville&quot; is really about, too. Stuart also tells us what happened to the cast in subsequent years, which I've alway wondered about and was glad to know. You come away with a reality-tempered respect for Tewkesbury, the screenwriter, Altman, the director, and most of the cast -- who obviously threw themselves into the parts and did the best they knew how to do. For some, their best was transcendent, and Stuart gives us the story behind those moments. A fine book that was obviously a labor of love -- and just a lot of pains-taking labor -- for Stuart."},{"Title":"The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece","review":"The 24 primary actors offscreen motives mirror the inspirations, for better or worse, of the 24 characters portrayed in the movie. I would have liked to have seen an Altman discussion of how he and his cast differed--if at all-- from the fameseekers so carefully-chronicled in his movie. This self-reference issue becomes particularly intriguing when one considers that Altman was encouraging his young actors to bring their own &quot;baggage&quot; to the lives of the characters. Overall, a very thorough discussion of a very brilliant movie."},{"Title":"The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece","review":"Film critic Jan Stuart has written a wonderful behind the scenes expose of the movie &quot;Nashville&quot;. John Leonard, a book critic for The Nation, media critic for CBS News &quot;Sunday Morning and television critic of New York magazine writes: &quot;Stuart reads everything and tells all, from the drunken cookouts to the vicious tongue-lashing temper tantrums, to what became of everybody in the afterlife of all this surprise and excess, to the scenes that wound up on the the cutting-room.&quot;A must read for fans of Robert Altman, the movie Nashville, or movies in general."},{"Title":"The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece","review":"Loved the movie. loved the soundtrack, although I wish live versions of the songs were included (especially Barbara Harris' \\"It don't worry me\\")The book is merely the icing on the cake."},{"Title":"The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece","review":"great book. job well done. thanks jan!"},{"Title":"Sleepwalkers: A Roadtrip for the Soul","review":"This book is absolutely incredible!

It was the first metaphysical fiction book that I'd read, and I was profoundly impressed with the way the author weaved the high-concept into a storyline that was both demonstrative and entertaining.Today, I look back at this book and see that it still holds its own. Indeed, after reading it a third time, I'm still amazed at the author's ability to write a work of fiction that encompasses such abstract concepts, while taking the reader on a ride down the highway of the soul. Dorchak must have faced many challenges during the writing of this novel, not the least of which was the fact that very little of this kind of fiction actually exists.

You don't often see metaphysics in novel form. I wish Mr. Dorchak had the talent to tell this story better! There's a lot of teenage-style angst about what it all MEANS, terribly self-centered, as if the main character and perhaps Dorchak have no idea that these questions have been asked by anyone else, ever. The writing is frequently stilted and just bad (\\"Linda and him\\"). The German trainer at the gym says things like \\"Choo been holding out on me...? Dat's not a good ting choo do...\\" Too bad, since there's a good story to be told about a middle-management type suddenly forced to deal with multiple realities."},{"Title":"Sleepwalkers: A Roadtrip for the Soul","review":"Wow!

It blows away ideas of rules and processes and reminds us of just how open physical experience can be. (And some of us need lots of reminders!) After getting caught up in yet another game of limitation I read Sleepwalkers, and it brought me back to 'reality'.Some of the ideas included are probable reality shifting, the validity of dream experience, and probable selves. It also touches on our deeper connections with other people and that roller coaster of energy that can push us closer to our true selves when we've become bogged down or bored in life.This book is a great adventure that lives on, well beyond the last page turning. If you're not familiar with the Seth material and other related ideas (quantum physics, consciousness expansion, New Thought), this may be tweakage extraordinaire. It's a great ride, though-- hang on to your shoelaces!"},{"Title":"Sleepwalkers: A Roadtrip for the Soul","review":"A novel of ideas is a difficult trick. Ideas are abstract by nature, but fiction replicates and illuminates life through concrete metaphor. Ideas can be muted, lost in subtext, skimmed over by hurried readers. Or ideas can dominate, trampling the &quot;story&quot; until what's left is a tedious lecture. The balancing act between concrete and abstract, between subtext and tale is delicate.F.P.Dorchak's &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; is a pleasurable read because the author does a fine job of weaving his ideas into a clever mystery narrative. Daniel Grant is aging, unemployed, and disillusioned. Through a series of adventures, comic replications of post-modern fracture, the author takes Daniel through an exploration of the nature of consciousness. Because his themes fit his forms, the author keeps the reader's attention (and patience). I do not enjoy most metaphysical novels-- too many fall victim to mistakes of balance. But I recommend &quot;Sleepwalkers.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sleepwalkers: A Roadtrip for the Soul","review":"Sleepwalkers: A Roadtrip for the Soul......Sleepwalkers, by Frank P.

He was fearless in inserting himself into situations that would terrorize most other travelers. If he needed to sleep, he lay down under a palm tree by the Bay of Bengal; what's the problem? He's so far above criticism that any comment is pathetically inadequate. What can you say about a guy who wrote, of his fellow vagabonds living out their lives in a charity home in Madras, India: \\"Sad fate, indeed, for those who, in the years of their strength and inspiration, had made the world their playground, to be sentenced thus to end their days in the meager bit of space to which sightless eyes or paralyzed limbs confined them, while they wandered on in spirit over boundless seas and trackless sand.\\""},{"Title":"A vagabond journey around the world;: A narrative of personal experience,","review":"Great Travel Books, A Vagabond Journey Around the WorldAmtrak train from Penn Station NYC to Rochester, NYAugust 19, 2007Homepage: http://canciondelvagabundo.googlepages.comGreat Travel Books page: http://canciondelvagabundo.googlepages.com/greattravelbooksA Vagabond Journey Around the World- This is the classic, seminal work of Harry A. Franck, who was life long traveller and writer. Of his twenty or so books that describe his travels through nearly the entire planet, this is his first and, and in my opinion, best. The travels that make up A Vagabond Journey were undertaken when the author was young, adventurous, and not yet a professional writer. In this book, Franck describes rather than explains; show rather than tells. Simply put, he wrote this book from the hip, with the seeming intention of documenting his experiences and impressions of the world as he found it- and nothing more. His focus seems to have been more on travelling the world than writing a book, which I feel is a necessary recipe for compiling a good travel book. Travel first, write second. This book is about adventure- pure and simple. It is about the simple human urge to GO , to walk over the farthest hill. . . just to find that the only thing there is the journey over the next hill. In fact the journey that made up the book was started as a be. From the Forward of Explanation of A Vagabond Journey Around the World:Some years ago, while still an undergraduate, I chanced to be present at an informal gathering in which the conversation turned to confessions of respective ambitions.\\"If I had a few thousands,\\" sighed a senior, \\"I'd make a trip around the world.\\"\\"Modest ambition \\" retorted a junior, \\"But you'd better file it away for future reference, till you have made the money.\\"\\"With all due respect to bank accounts,\\" I observed, \\"I believe a man with a bit of energy and good health could start without money and make a journey around the globe.\\"Laughter assailed the suggestion; yet as time rolled on I found myself often musing over that hastily conceived notion. Travel for pleasure has ever been considered a special privilege of the wealthy. That a man without ample funds should turn tourist seems to his fellow-beings an action little less reprehensible than an attempt to finance a corporation on worthless paper.A rebellion against this traditional notion suggested a problem worthy of investigation. What would befall the man who set out to girdle the globe as the farmer's boy sets out to seek his fortune in a neighboring city; on alert for every opportunity, yet scornful of the fact that every foot of the way has not been paved for him?Were I permitted an avocation it would be the study of social conditions; what surer way fo gaining vital knowledge of modern society than to live and work among the world's workmen in every clime? In the final reckoning, too, an inherent Wanderlust, to which, as an American, I lay no claim as a unique characteristic, was certainly not without its influence.In this way, A Vagabond Journey Around the World was born.What I find to be most impressive about this work is that Franck did not bother trying to educate his audience or finding obscure little historic anecdotes to ensure that his book would be regarded as a work of literature. No, he simply wrote through the lens of his own experience and nothing more. All assumptions about the lands and people that he travelled amongst must be made through this record of experience- through the man himself. Franck was a man who wrote; the author cannot be removed from his words. A Vagabond Journey is a pure testament to the Wanderlust in all regards; I bow down and defer to it as a classic. This book is a joyous celebration of the Road. This is the tale of a true Vagabond Journey Around the World.It sets my feet a walking. . . with a smile on my face.I wish for all travellers to read it."},{"Title":"A vagabond journey around the world;: A narrative of personal experience,","review":"This is a fantastic book.

They are the stories of two early 19th century romances -- one involving an already-married couple, the other involving a pair of potential mates -- that show the same level of sophisticated observation of human nature that Austen aficionados love. But, you haven't re-read them over and over, unlike &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot;, or &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. They are a must for any Austen-holic"},{"Title":"The Semi-Attached Couple and the Semi-Detached House (Virago Modern Classics)","review":"In The Semi-attached Couple, a very young Lady Helen marries handsome, rich Lord Teviot. She loves, but does not comprehend him; he loves, but does not comprehend her; a series of misunderstandings and jealousies threaten their happiness.The Semi-Detached House follows the lives and loves of two families living side by side in (you guessed it) a semi-detached house. Young, lively Lady Blanche moves into the house to await her confinement, while her beloved husband is abroad on a diplomatic mission. She dreads meeting the family next door, whom she imagines will be low and vulgar; but she is soon enchanted by the Hopkinsons, a family which includes two pleasing daughters near her own age, and strikes up a warm friendship with them.These two short novels display a charming and witty style which has something of the flavor of Jane Austen, though falling short of Austen's works in plotting and characterization.

At first, the missing dog plot didn't seem like it would be able to sustain an entire book, but the way Nancy Bartholomew weaves the story with mystery and humor, the plot actually works! The humor in this book is definately similar to that of Janet Evanovich and this series will keep Evanovich fans entertained between Plumb outings! Sierra is a rare character in the fact that she is unappolgetic about what her profession is. She likes being an exotic dancer (NOT a stripper! &lt;G&gt;) and takes pride in doing her job (and her sleuthing) well. Do yourself a favor and buy this excellent book. You won't be sorry. :)"},{"Title":"The Miracle Strip (A Sierra Lavotini Mystery)","review":"I was so happy to come across this fun series.

Can't wait to read the rest in the series now!"},{"Title":"The Miracle Strip (A Sierra Lavotini Mystery)","review":"The Miracle Strip is a fast-paced mystery featuring earthy characters living in the underbelly of our culture. Nancy Bartholomew gives us a humorous yet realistic view of the frailty of people who both express and occasionally contain, the raw emotions we all feel. Her heroine, Sierra Lavotini, is an exotic dancer with beauty, brains, inner sensitivity, and a fierce loyalty to family and friends. She displays this with a reckless &quot;kick butt&quot; attitude that sets her on a wild adventure beginning with a vow to rescue her friend's dog, Arlo. Sierra's amazing and humorous acceptance of others is displayed in her description of Raydeen, her loyal friend and neighbor, who happens to be a paranoid schizophrenic. But Sierra's own comic complexity is enhanced by her struggle to be true to her &quot;inner child&quot; and a hidden desire to be a writer, as opposed to her love of making money and engaging in the fast-paced and exciting world of a stripper.Nancy Bartholomew is a keen observer of our physical reality, has a great understanding of human motivation and behavior, and appreciates the humor found in our incongruous natures. She is quick in her thinking, and her stories pull us in and move us along. I'm looking forward to more tales of colorful characters and their adventures. Bravo Nance!"},{"Title":"The Miracle Strip (A Sierra Lavotini Mystery)","review":"As a first book, Miracle Strip is not horrible, but it would not compel me to buy another book in the series. The protagonist, stripper Sierra Lavotini, never seems to have justifiable motivation for her actions. She recklessly starts investigating the disappearance of her friend, even when it becomes clear that her friend has been lying to her and has been mixed up in some sort of drug deal gone wrong. Like some hardboiled PI, she never tells the police all she knows, although her motivation for witholding information is never clear. She does one stupid thing after another and you can't figure out what she has to gain by acting like that. The book was made more irritating because Sierra, the narrator, uses poor grammar on an infrequent enough basis that it just seems like a narrative trick, to make her background more &quot;real.&quot; The portrayal of Sierra as a stripper didn't ring true, and the strip club is too abstract and uninvolving. Nevertheless, as the author polishes her craft this series may turn into something really worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Miracle Strip (A Sierra Lavotini Mystery)","review":"A lot of comparisons were being made between this series and the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. While there are some similarities, this book didn't quite grab me like an Evanovich book.....which I will normally read in one setting!

The \\"stripper\\" character , I feel , is totally believable .The mystry is also written better, there is actually a mystery.

Not unlike Evanovich's Plum series, Nancy's writing improves with each book in the series and I was addicted after #2. The heroine Sierra Lavotini is a \\"real woman\\" not some overdone dream woman, women of any age can relate to Sierra.

MacDonald or Carl Hiaasen will be left wanting by this tepid first novel by Nancy Bartholomew. Her Philly-born exotic dancer heroine, Sierra Lavotini, is a mass of contradictions, but for all the facets Bartholomew tries to build into her, she remains a warmed-over knock-off of Hiaasen's sleuthing stripper from &lt;Strip Tease>.

It's too bad that this writer felt it necessary to take a small story about one young woman's (Maya's) bad relationship choices and draw questionable parallels with political strife in Israel.

Though the Hussein threat seems to be over, Israeli Tami Shachar still struggles with personal battles. She is drifting away from the three people she cares most about in the world. Tami feels alienated with her spouse and mother, and perceives her son feeling that way towards her.Tami's American cousin Maya goes to Jerusalem University because she feels that how she can finally cement a relationship with her mother. She lives in a very religious part of the city with Gil, who takes out his mempories of his military time on the West Bank on Tami. Living below Maya is Holocaust survivor Shifra, who sees the American student as some sort of savior. The lives of these three women have intertwined as each struggles with modern questions of identity and healing. If they can break out of the sealed rooms of their minds, they may find personal salvation.FROM A SEALED ROOM is a tour-de-force novel that provides the reader with an insider's glimpse into the personal problems confronting Israeli and American Jews.

Ms Kadish waves a complex and moving story which encapsulates much of modern Jewish history and geography. While reading it, one feels as though one were actually walking along the pink and gold stoned byways of modern Jeusalem and walking through the Polish countryside during the middle years of this century. The first read is a sensual and emotional experience. The second read makes one even more aware of the poetry in Ms Kadish's words. This is not an easy read, but is well worth the time spent. This is a writer from whom I am sure we will hear again."},{"Title":"From a Sealed Room","review":"This book grips the imagination with it's powerful writing and compelling story.

The characters were kind of thrown into your face at the beginning and I had a hard time keeping them straight in my mind as I continued on to the second, third chapters. I didn't care for the characters either. I felt no connections. I didn't believe they each were very well developed. If one of them suddenly died, it really wouldn't've affected me. I got half way through the book in a matter of weeks, and have since put it down.This is a very sad moment when I cannot finish a book.

The sealed room, where Israeli families spend their nights during SCUD missile attacks, becomes a symbol for the break in communications these women suffer. Tami is isolated from her family, seems lost, &amp; does not know her way back to the hearts &amp; minds of her husband who loves her, her confused boy/man son, &amp; her somewhat eccentric mother. Maya, the young American, escapes to Israel to find what is missing in her life - if only she had been able to open up the lines of communication with her mother before her deathbed scene. She seeks identity in the relationship of an abusive, tortured artist, lacking the strength to share her pain &amp; walk away. Finally, there is Shifra, mentally locked into the trauma of surviving the Holocaust, while others did not; she speaks as a Psalmist, in the tongues and language of an Old Testament sage. Each woman has her own way of exiting the sealed room, &amp; it is with poignance, credibility, &amp; honesty that Rachel Kadish approaches these sensitive subjects. At the same time, the knowing reader is aware of how much the country, Israel, becomes yet another living character in the story. Nowhere else could &quot;the blacks&quot;, in this case, the ultra-Orthodox, present another 'sealed off' situation, awaiting the tape to be torn down. As the young man who finds Shifra's body realizes, too late, three was another tortured soul who needed a friend, &amp; just because she was a woman, he did not turn his back, avert his eyes - but it was too late. There is humanity everywhere, waiting to be shared. For a first novel, Rachel Kadish has set herself a very high standard of achievement.

Kadish uses the voices of three women -- a young American trying to find her own voice against the background of a dominant, ambitious mother; a middle-aged, somewhat dreamy Israeli emotionally cut adrift from her family; and a delusional yet visionary old Polish immigrant to Israel -- to explore the problem of making room for the past without crowding out the present and the future. All the characters in her book are rich and well drawn, but these three women, painted in exquisite detail, wrestle with their humanity in a way that will blow you away. I was stunned and moved to tears by the subtle and increasing profound returns of themes: how to be honest with oneself and others in a complicated world, how to live with the pain of the past without losing touch with the present, how to love through fear and anger, and more. Give this book time. It is a work of real artistry and deep wisdom. It deserves all the attention it might get, if not more."},{"Title":"From a Sealed Room","review":"Fantastic! Amazing! Great! This book is the literary adventure of a lifetime. The multi-faceted characters come alive and the descriptive power will knock you off of your seat!

The complexities of a nation united under the constant threat of war, yet within it a people divided among themselves, are laid open through the story of one extended family. Kadish presents the narrative through the eyes of three women; points of view spanning three generations, each the product of a distict cultural backround. Their individual stories are fascinating, yet woven together expose deeper themes that will carry far beyond the last page.

I disagree with the review stating it does not provide an in-depth view into the actual unit- anything available on this extremely obscure unit is in this book.The book also gives a short but accurate description of the motivations of Soviet POWS to enlist in German ranks on the whole. Many took up the nazi uniform to get away from the terrible prison camps.Apart from the nice illustrations by Darko Pavlovich on the front and cover of this book, it contains many, many photographs which you won't find anywhere else.I reccomend this book to anyone with an interest in collaboration by Soviet citizens.

Much of the original text is somewhat hard to understand, at least on a first reading, although Karcher's translation &amp; commentaries are radiant with clarity. The text, in its discussion of the Way (Tao) and Change, explains the spiritual/metaphysical mechanisms underlying the *I Ching*; familiarity with the *I Ching* makes this text much more accessible, although the wisdom of this text may entice some readers to work more closely with the *I Ching*. Karcher (who, with Ritsema, did one of the most brilliant English translations of the *I Ching* ever) is deeply familiar with that work, and thus is able to bring those insights to this work. This is a book one could read again and again over the years, learning more on each reading.

The panic, according to Sinclair, was orchestrated by several very powerful capitalists in order to dethrone a rival trust company. They did this because man's revenge over being smitten by a woman, to put the anti-trust President in his place, and greed. The ruin of the rival trust company caused a stock market crash and a bank rush which ultimately cost thousands their jobs and savings and put the entire world into financial turmoil.The story is told through the eyes of Allan Montague -- a successful lawyer living in New York. Through the course of the story he becomes introduced to several power players -- many of whom have millions riding in the stock market. These big players, also use fronts and shill companies whose only purpose is to sell things -- they do not make anything. This gets the public and the government to invest in their companies which ultimately go bankrupt.The players in the story aren't too terribly interested in money. They use it as points and live to out maneuver the other. Sinclair reveals the back room shanagans of the stock market and the manipulations they pulled on the market. In addition, he points out the press was unable to print the &quot;truth&quot; on account that many of the corporations owned the newspapers.The book was a little hard to follow despite Sinclair's lucid writing style. There were many players in the story, many making brief and periodic appearances. Also, the economic theory behind the maneuverings could leave a reader a little bewildered if they aren't up on the subject of trusts, stocks, high finance and corporations. Although, I suspect that many of the manipulations the capitalists did have been corrected thanks to modern checks and safeguards, the book does reveal the vast amount of corruption on all levels of the American system: the government, banks, and other businesses manipulating other businesses. This book was almost a thriller / mystery and was entertaining and informative throughout."},{"Title":"The Moneychangers","review":"This is a quick, easy read. Simple story with a simple message that still rings true today. Could be the official handout of occupy wall street. This particular edition of the book is weird, though. Book is awkwardly large and floppy. Find a more standard paperback if you can."},{"Title":"The Moneychangers","review":"While this book was written almost a century ago it is surprisingly current with the economic situation we are presently in."},{"Title":"The Moneychangers","review":"The Moneychangers is Upton Sinclair's indictment of the national economy, particularly the events that caused the Panic of 1907. His book, along with calls from other reformers, almost certainly impacted the Pujo hearings of 1912, where the House Banking and Currency Committee investigated the Money Trust. One of the big issues of the 1912 Presidential Election was the reform of trusts, which were seen in the novel as corrupt and controlled by a few powerful men, led by the all-powerful Wall Street financier, J. Pierpont Morgan. The New Nationalism of Theodore Roosevelt and the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson were similar, with one big difference on how trusts were viewed. Roosevelt wanted the government to control bad trusts and monitor good trusts while protecting the rights of workers and consumers, while Wilson wanted all trusts broken up to promote competition. Wilson and Roosevelt did agree in using strong executive leadership, and promoting Initiative, Referendum, and Recall to induce more involved citizen participation in government.The third candidate, Republican Incumbent William Howard Taft, had angered Roosevelt after being his hand-picked successor to the presidency in 1908. The popular Roosevelt regretted his 1904 campaign promise that he would not run again in 1908, but Taft seemed a reasonable choice. Taft then fired Gifford Pinchot, Roosevelt's trusted ally in issues of conservation, shortly after his election. Taft also abrogated an agreement that Roosevelt made with J.P. Morgan: that Morgan's U.S. Steel Corporation could gobble up the Tennessee Coal & Iron Company, a prize normally unavailable to him for anti-trust reasons, for saving a speculative brokerage firm whose failure would have caused huge financial ripples in an already faltering economy. The Taft administration prosecuted U.S Steel for a violation of anti-trust clauses. Of course, Taft had to deal with the public outcry when this bargain with J.P. Morgan was exposed, while Roosevelt was insulated from the criticism, in Africa for his widely-promoted safari.Upton Sinclair exposed this deal in the Moneychangers, changing the name of the participants enough to avoid a libel suit while keeping the facts similar enough to real life so that the public understood Sinclair was making a statement against the Money Trust - and actually, all trusts in general. Dan Waterman had a lot in common with J.P. Morgan, an active Episcopalian church officer, and an avid collector of the arts who also owned a lavish yacht named the Corsair. Morgan was a married man with several mistresses, including the famous actress Maxine Elliot, and possibly his librarian Belle de Coste Greene. In his book about the Morgan empire, Ron Chernow mentioned that Greene was discrete about her affairs so as not to anger a jealous J.P. Morgan.The stock market crash of October 21-25, 1907 occurred when an attempt to corner the United Cooper market failed, and its stock price fell. Alarmed depositors of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, whose president was associated with speculators trying to corner the market of United Copper, began a run on the bank which could not possibly be sustained. When Knickerbocker Trust failed, other trusts, such as the Trust Company of America, were on the edge of financial collapse. In the Moneychangers, the failure of the Gotham Trust Company set off a run on the Trust Company of the Republic.The famous steel magnet Andrew Carnegie and his assistant at the Homestead Works, Harry Frick, are also represented by fictional doppelgangers. Their famous story occurred in 1891, when Carnegie left the country for his annual trip to his homeland of Scotland, leaving Frick in charge when the labor contract at the Homestead Works was about to expire. Carnegie had modernized the equipment at Homestead, which no longer required skilled workers at the plant, and the salaries that they demanded. Carnegie let Frick handle his upcoming labor contract, which called for cuts in wages that the strong union at Homestead would not accept.Before the workers could strike, Frick declared a lockout, but workers still managed to occupy the Homestead plant. A platoon of Pinkerton security guards were sent to break-up the strike, but their efforts failed. A boat was arranged to gain access to the plant via the river adjacent to it, but the employees prevented any sort of amphibious operation. They even pushed barges of explosives toward the Pinkerton boats in an attempt to remove the threat suddenly. The Pinkertons finally surrendered, but the frustrated workers indiscriminately killed some of the Pinkertons after their surrender.An anarchist named Alexander Berkman, boyfriend of radical Emma Goldman (Emma the Red), tried to kill Frick. His assassination attempt failed. Carnegie earned millions more in the steel industry until he sold out to J. Pierpont Morgan for a staggering amount - which Morgan admitted was not the full amount he was willing to pay for Carnegie's business. Carnegie then became a notable donor of libraries and other cultural institutions across America.The Ice King mentioned in the story is probably Charles Morse, who was involved in the attempted corner of the copper trust by Otto Heinze. One can also see some of Rockefeller in Jim Hegan, the railroad magnate that Montague went to see about selling Lucy's shares in the Northern Mississippi Railroad. Hegan's daughter, who was involved in many charitable causes, had a lot in common with Anne Morgan, the daughter of Pierpont. Unfortunately, she would have been a poor match for Allen Montague, considering that she liked girls. Charles T. Barney was the president of Knickerbocker trust. Elements of Barney can be seen in Stanley Ryder, the president of the Gotham Trust who is more than a minor character in the Moneychangers.Sinclair's story isn't meant to be an actual account of the Panic of 1907. Personal vendettas did play into business decisions, but probably not here. Morgan did lose over $20 million from his efforts to stop the Panic of 1907, so there was some altruism at play in his actions. Of course, his businesses relied on a strong economy, so Morgan's altruism had a motive. People were probably angrier about his purchase of government bonds during the Cleveland administration. The Panic of 1893 was caused by a run on gold, and the Cleveland administration had to sell 4 waves of government bonds, payable in gold, to shore up dangerously low reserves. The level of reserves dropped so quickly after the second issue of bonds that the Cleveland administration didn't have time to sell the third issue of bonds publicly. In fact, the day Morgan bought the bonds, the New York Federal Reserve branch had less than $10 million in gold in its holdings, and a check for $10 million was said to be outstanding and ready to be cashed. Grover Cleveland was forced to act with alacrity. Public scorn occurred after Morgan bought the bonds for 103-1/2 but sold them over 110. In fact, the bonds were trading at 120 shortly afterwards in the secondary market.The Aldrich commission, established to investigate the Panic of 1907, recommended the creation of a central bank. After the Pujo hearings of 1912, Congress did organize the Federal Reserve Act to create a national bank to handle liquidity issues and maintain the money supply. President Wilson promptly signed the bill. The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 was passed to give the government extra power to break up trusts. Books such as The Moneychangers convinced the public that Woodrow Wilson's position, that all trusts were bad, was better than Theodore Roosevelt's position, that some trusts were bad. While the connection isn't as direct as with Sinclair's book, the Jungle, and the Meat Packing Acts of 1906, the Moneychangers did affect public policy. It is another one of Sinclair's recommended works."},{"Title":"The Moneychangers","review":"This is the kind of book for which \\"a searing indictment of the financial system\\" is neither an exaggeration or overly dramatic.Upton Sinclair exposes with entertaining and unsettling detail of the murky financial waters of the banks and Trusts of 1907, and how their leader's egos and petty strife sets them to crash the banking system to take revenge for the tiniest of matters. The games moguls play has tragic consequence for thousands of people, causing an enormous bank run in a perfectly foreseeable yet unbelievable manner.An uncannily accurate description of modern times, yet set in 1907. Simply by changing 'cabs' for 'taxis', it would describe 2008 perfectly. It's a shame Upton Sinclair is not read more widely. Four stars because although the book is great, Upton can be a little serious. You might need a laugh after this.You will never look at Wall Street, regulators, newspapers, and deposits in the same way again. Andrew Ross Sorkin's Too Big to Fail looks timid compared to this book."},{"Title":"The Moneychangers","review":"Upton Sinclair's first major novel, Manassas, details the end of the antebellum period before delving into battle horrors at the beginning of the Civil War. Why is this relevant? That book's protagonist was Allan Montague. In 1907, following on the heels of his monumentally successful \\"The Jungle\\", Sinclair wrote an indictment of a Whartonian high-society in \\"The Metropolis\\", and it starred... a character named Allan Montague - a man who appears to be an idealized cipher for Sinclair himself. This book, \\"The Moneychangers\\" is the direct sequel to \\"The Metropolis\\", much in the same vein though with more of a focus on finance than society.So what about the book? Well, it's a really good book. The prose is really quite precise and assured, with some excellent phrases turned here and there. It flows rapidly from plot point to plot point, and even when it descends into lengthy descriptions of the ornate surroundings and opulent Newport mansions it never becomes boring. Contrary to what Chris Bachelder's hilarious \\"U.S.!\\" would indicate, Sinclair's writing was not consistently wooden, but generally lively and erudite. And the lack of style and plot-arc that plagued the last third of The Jungle is nowhere to be found.What is most striking is how much in the way of financial strategy Sinclair works into the novel, and how the shell game of overleveraged assets played in 1907 was nearly identical to the shell game of overleveraged assets played in 2008. Sinclair is highly literate about economics, largely because of his strenuous immersion into Socialism, and he brings to life the complicated and inscrutable economic power plays (read: frauds) that are invisible to the public and most investors. Montague is a good \\"center mass\\" for the story because he has a conscience, but nonetheless must peel away the fact-onion underlying the economic tragedy at the same pace as the reader.I don't want to give away too much of the story, but know that it is generally tragic and dour, but there are far more moments of lively characterization and humor than in The Jungle or The Overman, and the book is written in a more mature style than King Coal. In fact, it's my favorite Public Domain (pre-1923) Sinclair novel thus far (and I've now read seven), and probably one of my favorite books, period.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Moneychangers","review":"As usual Amazon delivered the requested book to my Kindle.

I read the free Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Stolen Lake","review":"Of the many reasons to read the works of Joan Aiken, two stand out: the irresistable pluckiness of the heroines (especially Dido Twite), and Joan's marvellously detailed alternate history of the planet Earth.An alternative history is one of the staples of science fiction. What if the Nazis had won World War II? Or what if the South had won the American civil war? These subjects have consumed many a book. But Joan Aiken is unique, in my view, because she has crafted a detailed alternate history of England and America, and has used it as the backdrop, rather than the focus, of the story. Just take it for granted that the Stuarts managed to keep a hold of the English crown. This is just one of many ingredients in Joan Aiken's stories.But in &quot;The Stolen Lake&quot;, Joan's alternative history writing is at its most creative, and that pushes its prominence forward in the book. Rather than fading into history, the ancient kingdom of Arthur and the remains of the Roman Empire stole the boats of the invading Saxons and fled to South America where they founded &quot;Roman&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Latin&quot;) America. King Arthur still sleeps, but Queen Guenivere has basically sold her soul to keep herself alive through the 1300 years, awaiting her husband's return. Into this, the young and plucky Dido Twite arrives, and upsets the corrupt regime.This only scratches the surface of the detail of &quot;The Stolen Lake&quot;. Alternative history buffs, fans of King Arthur tales, and fans of the plucky Dido Twite will find plenty to enjoy in this richly detailed tale that is a standout of Joan Aiken's books."},{"Title":"The Stolen Lake","review":"Dido Twite, the quick-witted (and sharp-tongued) heroine of &quot;Black Hearts in Battersea&quot; and &quot;Nightbirds on Nantucket,&quot; is back in this sequel.

Is she, as she claims, the widow of King Arthur? If so, how has she managed to survive the centuries? And why aren't there any girls Dido's age in the entire country? For that matter, why did the midshipman of Dido's vessel take ill as soon as they arrived in port? With the same entertaining blend of Cockney common sense and sheer gutsiness that saw her through her earlier adventures, Dido manages to get to the bottom of things--saving an imprisoned princess and, yes, restoring a &quot;stolen&quot; lake in the bargain. All in all, a fun, fast, rollicking read for youngsters and adults alike."},{"Title":"The Stolen Lake","review":"Aiken's unsinkable Dido Twite is making her way back home when she finds herself entangled in the politics of a Celtic state located in the South American Andes.

(OK, I haven't read Dido and Pa, but of the others.) It really has no connection to the other books in the series, and I don't think that it's the greatest read for very young children, however it is the most thrilling, the least predictable, DEFINITELY the most imaginative, and the most mature. It's not as humourous as the others, but it has its moments, and I personally feel that this is the climax of all Dido's adventures before she gets home to meet Simon again. As always, unforgettable characters (Cap'n Hughes, Mr. Holystone, Elen, Bran...) that are always believable, no matter how fantastical the plot is, and well, an all round fascinating, entertaining, frightening, happy-ending, beautiful book. MUCH more adventurous than the previous books in the series.The King Arthur connection is brilliant, even if Arthur did actually die BEFORE the battle of Dyrham... but those with a basic knowledge of the legends and history will appreciate it, and if you learn more about Arthur etc. your appreciation of the book will only grow richer. Also, make sure to pay attention to the marriage of Latin American and Welsh cultures, which is also brilliantly done (Dafydd Gomez, Juan Jones, Jos&eacute; Glendower - should that be Glyndwr?) although it begs the question, if the Celts settled the area in 577, when did the Spanish come? But ignoring that, a BRILLIANT book, definitely read it."},{"Title":"The Stolen Lake","review":"I have been a huge fan of Joan Aiken ever since I read Nightbirds on Nantucket in grade school. This book departs from her usual British &quot;flavor&quot; but I still found it fascinating. The characters and plot resonate with you long after the book is over. People who are familiar with the King Arthur legend will get the most from this book, as some of the references are hidden or not explicit.

These are wonderful books, and as I've said in previous review of the series, if you didn't read them as a kid (or only read the first, The Wolves of Willoughby Chase), don't let adulthood stop you from discovering them now.The action begins not long after the third book ends, with Dido steaming for home with a new crew (the old one mysteriously disappeared Alien 3 style while we were between books). While they're on their way, Hughes, the ship's captain, gets an urgent plea from the Queen of New Cumbria, down in Roman America (in the alternate universe we live in, New Cumbria is at the head of the Amazon River, and seems to occupy part of western Brazil and part of eastern Peru). So Dido is forced to make a detour on her long journey home. Dido, Hughes, his steward Mr. Holystone, and a few of the other crew members disembark at Tenby, the only port into New Cumbria, and head for the capitol, Bath Regis. Things start going awry quickly, though...It's somewhat amusing that it takes us almost three-quarters of the book to actually get to Bath Regis and find out what the queen wants, especially given that the object of all this mystery is the title of the book. Still, you probably won't care much, as Dido and her companions find no end of scrapes to get into on the way, what with savages, evil seamstresses, duplicitous diplomats, ex-pirates who may not be so ex-, a passel of missing kids, aurocs, snakes, piranha, and a mysterious bard all along for the ride. Aiken also takes the opportunity to do a great deal of worldbuilding in this book, as she has various characters relate the history of Roman America as it relates to Britain. It's all quite fun. Another good book in a good series. ***"},{"Title":"The Stolen Lake","review":"I love Aiken's Wolves Chronicles, but this one isn't even worth being part of the series. It's fairly good writing, and a pretty interesting plot, but it has no relevance whatsoever to the rest of the books. For some reason, Aiken leaves off with her pseudo-Dickens mode, which makes this book a lot less amusing. The legends of King Arthur and Guinevere that play such a major part in this book are completely improbable. Read it, but not as part of the series."},{"Title":"The lore and language of schoolchildren,","review":"Most of the material for this book was gathered fifty years ago in British schools, but I'm sure readers in all countries, for all time, will find it amusing and revealing.

When you do, when you recognize its value and if you apply it to your daily life, you yourself can truly change. This book, in the hands of one who seeks, can be a key to the start of a path to a larger and richer world.How well do you *really* know yourself? Are you willing to go digging? The world is waiting, and a man named Piotr Demianovich Ouspensky saw fit to help you know both it, and yourself, in ways you never guessed.Yes, there are books that can truly change lives. This is one of them. Do not read if your aim is only to remain comfortable. I wish you the best on your Way."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution","review":"A spare, terse distillation of the no-nonsense call to waking up in the manner of the 4th Way, which takes place not in the monastery, but in the ordinary conditions of life. Basically, Gurdjieff's transmission of esoteric understanding through Ouspensky's language."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution","review":"If you're new to Gurgjieffian thought, this is the book to start with. It gives a general overview of G.I. Gurdjieff and P.D. Ouspensky's main philosophical ideas. The book is in the form of five short lectures that each tackle a particular topic. The major emphasis of the book is that humans need to learn to stop being meachines and to acquire self-consciousness by self-sudy before any upward motion along the lines of knowledge and being can be accomplished. Contains very practical advice."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution","review":"Some people have very negative opinions of Ouspensky and his books but for reasons that rarely have anything to do with the books themselves or the knowledge they contain. Usually they are associating everything with a bad experience they had in one cult or another that probably exploited all or some of the knowledge in books like the Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution, or, they're working from some uniquely conceived intellectual fetish like the 'Laws of Manu' and how their tradition is attempting to renew itself and strike terror into Democratic Man, or whatever... There's nothing about the Laws of Manu in this book by Ouspensky, nor is there anything having to do with cults or cult manipulation. The book itself explains very clearly the basic psychological side of what has come to be known as the Work, which is simply the universal ideas and practices of inner, spiritual development put into a very clear and precise and practical language. Aside from its unique terminology it is the inner meaning and goals of the New Testament, Stoic philosophy and some Buddhist literature (just to name a few examples from the full spectrum of universal influences...) This book doesn't contain the cosmological side of the Work which provide the metaphor and models for understanding the psychological side of the Work, but that can be found in Ouspensky's other major books the Fourth Way and In Search of the Miraculous. All these books require real effort in the area of study to learn the language that they contain as-well-as enough of a development in your life in the areas of physical activity, creative activity and the absorbtion of the lowest to the highest influences in the realms of art, philosophy, music, imaginative literature, history, religion and science. At first you're fighting your own ignorance. Later you fight your own laziness. The ultimate goal is to, in a very practical and real way, build your inner, spiritual body which requires conscious efforts in the right direction (a right direction that it is very possible to find on your own without the 'guidance' of a group or so-called school, in fact Ouspensky himself said late in his life that this Work could be learned on one's own without a school ['school' as that word is understood by the common schools associated with the Fourth Way, yet in the Work 'school' has a higher meaning as well, and is found in your everyday surroundings and the friction of going up against what in the Work is called the General Law...]) Learning a book like the Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution puts you on the road to the whole experience."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution","review":"In spite of his difficulty in accepting Gurdjieff as an authentic teacher Ouspensky kept in contact with Gurdjieff from 1915 until their last meeting in France 1930. He started lecturing the 'system' already in the twenties in Constantinople and continued until close to his death in 1947.(By the way I have yet to see a negative review with an e-mail address!)When you take this book for what it is - a short introduction to the psychology of an extensive 'system for personal development' - then it certainly serves its purpose. The book was written to be read aloud to people waiting for Ouspensky to start his lectures. His audiences ranged from just a handful of people to some hundreds.'The Psychology' gives you an overview of the psychology of Gurdjieff's teaching."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution","review":"This book, a little over 100 pages, is packed with Ouspensky's philosophy.

I own both of these other books and have just started reading &quot;Miraculous&quot;. I can see why many prefer Ouspensky's writings over Gurdjieff himself."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution","review":"The \\"Fourth Way\\" is a term given by Gurdjieff for a special spiritual path to practiced in the world, in ordinary human society, which is not one of the three traditional ways of the fakir (yogi), monk (bhakti), or philosopher (jnana yoga), which roughly correspond to physical, emotional, and mental paths. According to these teachings, the Fourth Way is a path of energy and consciousness where a person can generate an evolutionary energy called \\"Do 48\\" through a meditation practice called \\"self remembering\\" more deliberately, rapidly, and efficiently than the other paths, which have to work harder to produce a small amount of this energy in a more indirect way. This book is based on a series of introductory lectures that Ouspensky gave in London and in other places. These lectures inspired many people in London to form a group there, many of them part of the \\"intelligensia\\" of the area, including Orage, Maurice Nicole, Kenneth Walker, and others. Many of the ideas of the Fourth Way did influence the formation of many branches of western psychology and even brain research. Gurdjieff taught, for instance, that humans were \\"three brained beings\\" and this idea became the basis of the research into the R-complex (reptilian brain), Limbic system (mammalian emotional brain), and cortex (intellectual human brain) of Restak and Macclain. Gurdjieff also made other scientific assertions that were later verified by western science. The Fourth Way is a variation of Sufi teaching that was related to the Sarmoun community. In Gurdjieff's own writings, he mentions several of his teachers. The books by Ouspensky, IN SEARCH OF THE MIRACULOUS and THE FOURTH WAY are a good systematic presentation of the teachings Gurdjieff left behind. Ouspenky had a very good memory and the accounts in the book IN SEARCH OF THE MIRACULOUS do give a flavor of how Gurdjieff taught. However, both IN SEARCH and THE FOURTH WAY are very thick books with highly condensed material which presents a fairly complete system of spiritual growth. The only essential part of the work that seems lacking in these books is the sacred dances that Gurdjieff felt were needed to create the functional fusion of the inner centers which was necessary for a more permanent state of awakened consciousness. These dances are rarely detailed in books, because this medium had not been felt adequate to properly teach them. Only in the last ten years or so have videos of those dances come out which give a feeling for this part of the Gurdjieff work.THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MAN'S POSSIBLE EVOLUTION by Ouspensky is a brilliant condensation and introduction to the core ideas of the Fourth Way and presented in such a manner that I feel a person could verify the validity of most these ideas in their own immediate experience. It is a less intimidating way of entering into the whole system of Fourth Way teachings and one that does not lose sight of the practical day to day part of how we can grow into objective consciousness.I suspect that some negative reviews of the books by Ouspensky and even Gurdjieff come from a dogmatic cult flavor behind many of the groups who practice the system. Some of the groups that me and some of my friends have encountered, indeed, do not seem healthy or balanced. One person I met worked with a teacher who did eventually commit suicide. I think part of this has to do with the writings of Ouspensky having a pessimistic flavor, teaching that man cannot 'do', and making the effort awaken feel so difficult that it is easy to get discouraged. Maurice Nicole, a student of both Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, does not have this pessimistic flavor and even held a vision that all humans might fully awaken, while Ouspensky felt only a few could \\"escape\\" mechanical human life. Gurdjieff was more optimistic as well, and mentions a blueprint for healing this world in his writings called BEELEZEBUB'S TALES where a Saint develops an initiation system that spreads across the planet until thwarted by another being. Although it seems to be talking about a past saint, Gurdjieff did confide to John Bennett that he was really talking about a possible future and that the opposition was more of a warning about what could go wrong.While I would caution anyone about joining a Fourth Way group and would recommend that they steer clear of any group that has an authoritarian dogmatic flavor (whether Fourth Way or not), I feel the ideas of the Fourth Way are valuable and I feel worth practicing for a length of time to see what happens. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MAN'S POSSIBLE EVOLUTON is a good place to start, to see if one has an affinity to the ideas. I had a time with this work and found the insights and growth I gained through work with this system very valuable. My preference, though, is to work with Buddhist teachings and Buddhist meditation practice. I feel the Buddhist inquiry into the illusory sense of self is a valuable remedy to \\"crystallizing a false sense of self\\" that the Fourth Way has a danger of creating as well as the Mahayana emphasis on compassion being an antidote to the danger of the work becoming overly intellectual."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution","review":"My first reading of this book was like a casting off of \\"dogmatic slumber\\" for me. Never had I read a work that laid out so very clearly and precisely what is required to work upon ourselves and begin to live intentionally in the world. This is not only the first book to provide someone interested in the Gurdjieffian 4th Way, it's a pivotal work for anyone demanding more of themselves and life than what is provided by alleged exoteric authorities.

The book is written before Ouspensky published his bookIn Search of the Miraculous, which goes into much more detail, but this book has so many little gems that it is worth every penny spent. To me Ouspensky is more accessible than reading Gurdjieff directly and gives a very good overview of the 4'th way teaching."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution","review":"I don't see what purpose this book serves. Ouspensky is the greatest occult writer the modern world has produced, but this little book has nothing in it that isn't in In Search of the Miraculous; and in any event, the books by Ouspensky that matter are the ones that have nothing to do with Gurdjieff.The Gurdjieff work is a hundred miles wide and one foot deep. Just deep enough for those who can't swim to drown in, as Ouspensky almost did. The work isn't without value; many of Gurdjieff's ideas are basically correct, but everything he knew can be found in superior form in other places. And all of Gurdjieff's ideas are distortions of things he got from other places. He wasn't sophisticated enough to tell the good from the bad, and he mixed wisdom and foolishness together in a salad of roughly equal parts. Much of what Gurdjieff taught, such as the necessity of group work or self-observation as endless toil, is the opposite of truth. Gurdjieff was a man who asked the right questions, but got all the answers wrong. Partly because he was a second-rate mystic with a second-rate mind, and partly because he was like all gurus: he had a deep-seated need to manipulate others and take financial advantage of them. I have seen his type repeatedly and known some of them personally. They are all the same. They take bits and pieces of other people's ideas and use them to impress the gullible. They have an amazing recall and ability to spout things they pick up here and there as if they are original.Ouspensky was able to separate what little good there was in Gurdjieff from the little con man himself, and put it into his own superior version of the \\"Gurdjieff work\\" but grew too attached to the ideas before finally rejecting them for the ego-inflating trap they are.It is Ouspensky's own work that is of serious interest, but really only parts of it, mainly his thinking on spatial dimensions. It is a tragedy of epic proportions that Ouspensky abandoned his real work for the shallow occultism of the dubious Gurdjieff, and it doesn't speak well of Ouspensky's more mystical side. But that isn't the side of Ouspensky that will stand the test of time.To this day, his two books Tertium Organum and New Model of the Universe are at the cutting edge of human thought. They show the real direction that our conceptions of space and time should take, not the mathematically correct but logically ridiculous direction physics has taken. And yet, no doubt largely because of his association with the little Armenian con man, the enormous importance of Ouspensky's work is largely forgotten by all but a few.Those two books show how to overcome the paradoxes of not just physics, but of philosophy. Nothing like them exists, or has ever existed. If you understand his ideas, their truth cannot be denied on any level. Unlike the endless double-bind prison that constitutes the \\"thought\\" of the \\"fourth way\\", the essays in those two books can change the way you perceive the world in the most fundamental way imaginable. But they are beyond both the reach and grasp of people with no more intelligence or common sense than occult disciples, which is why the people most likely to encounter them get very little from them.To his eternally recurring credit, Ouspensky abandoned and renounced the Gurdjieff system late in life, realizing at last that it was a dead end, a dangerous distraction. It is ironic that Ouspensky is remembered mostly for his book on Gurdjieff, which is the least of his works and the very thing that keeps the Gurdjieff movement going. Indeed, much of the better stuff people tend to give Gurdjieff credit for was, in fact, Ouspensky all along. Without Ouspensky to make his ideas semi-coherent, there never would have been a Gurdjieff movement. It would have died with Gurdjieff.In any event, it has been noticed by too few that many of the ideas credited to Gurdjieff, such as the antiquity of the Sphinx, for example, are mentioned in Ouspensky's books long before Gurdjieff professed them, in altered form, later on. And Gurdjieff himself said he would beg Ouspensky to be his teacher if Ouspensky \\"understood\\" his own books! From this we can gather that Gurdjieff read Ousepensky's early classics, admired them, and very likely appropriated many of Ouspensky's own ideas, only to regurgitate them back at their originator later on, as part of Gurdjieff's own admittedly \\"stolen\\" hodgepodge of ideas. No wonder Ouspensky was so impressed with him.My recommendation is to read Ouspensky's two early classics, Tertium Organum and New Model of The Universe, and to stay away from Gurdjieff's poison until you are far enough advanced not be be seduced by it."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution","review":"Interesting book.

The claims for the esotericism of the Work, derivative from Sufism, whatever their merits, are needlessly and quite egregiously burderned with this aura of the archaic Russian reactionary. Ouspensky's almost de Maistrean viewpoint, so popular among oblivious liberal westerners lured into this esoteric hunger by its beguiling inuendoes, contains the absurd suggestion that spiritual esotericism condones and sanctifies one of the most oppressive exploitations in history. Check the history here, unvarnished, and the place of this thinking in the destruction of the Indian Buddhist world. The Code of Manu is an impostor, and springs from the post-Buddhist consolidation of the brahmins whose legacy was to make spiritual equality seem anomalous, when it was always fundamental. Such thinking emerging in the context of early twentieth century fascism was, and is, provocative in the extreme, and should be laid to rest.What is surprising is the inability of many adherents of this so-called spiritual path to face the simple reality that the classic spiritual paths were and are more compatible with a basic democratic attitude than otherwise. The reason is desperately simple, these ways prosper better in an open society!Never feel obligated to take this nonsense seriously."},{"Title":"Twilight Dynasty: Courting Evil","review":"Kyle Morrow is a dynamo among the high-powered Toronto law firm Holt, McQuaid, and Morrow.

Though this delicacy has long been recognized as a favorite by mid-century minimalists such as Yves Klein and Josef Albers, Ashcraft proves the tortilla is a relevant medium for contemporary art as well. Her stirring arrangements of lettuce and shredded cheese display a keen sensitivity to color and emotion, and establish her as the unrivalled queen of postmodern cookery.Also, she demonstrates out that the tortilla can be used as a frisbee, a parachute for small pets, and--with a little creative hole-punching--a terrifying face-mask!

If you want to go deeper into the subject of Anabaptism then you need to get this book.Menno Simons was an early leader of the Anabaptist movement. Many of the later Anabaptists would take their name from Menno Simons and be called Mennonites.Menno was a very well educated and intelligent man, who renounced his life of sin to take up his cross and follow Christ wherever He may lead. Menno was one of the few early Anabaptist leaders who did not suffer martyrdom, and so he lived a long life in which he was able to write. This is to our advantage as Menno knew the Scriptures in a way not many do today. He had a good grasp of both Old and New Testaments, and what it meant to be a \\"Kingdom Christian\\". He understood what it meant to live in the world but not of it. He, by the grace of God, understood that to be in God's Kingdom we must come out of our worldly one.This book will challenge you deeply and should not be read simply as a text book, but as a disciple sitting next to one of God's greatest undershepherds.Here are some link to other helpful and related books on the Anabaptists, Amish or Early Church:1.They harry the good people out of the land: Essays on the persecution, survival and flourishing of Anabaptists and Mennonites2.Will the Theologians Please Sit Down3.Will the Real Heretics Please Stand Up: A New Look at Today's Evangelical Church in the Light of Early Christianity4.The Kingdom that Turned the World Upside DownDoctrines of the Bible5.A History of the AmishThe Amish in Their Own Words"},{"Title":"Sound Health, Sound Wealth","review":"Dr. Oakes' book, Sound Health, Sound Wealth, is one of the most important books I've ever read--and re-read!

I would say the CD alone is worth the price of the book. I play it in the car, every day, on the way to meeting my clients. I have found it keeps me centered and focused on my job. I also play it when I am picking my boys up from the scouts. My eldest son has asked me to play it on the way to school as it helps him to relax, which is a huge accolade, as he is currently listening to the \`Nickelback' and \`Guns and Roses'CD all the time and doesn't like any of my CDs.The bookThe book resonated with me from the introduction as Luanne speaks about the power of changing your thoughts to change your life, which is of course the title of my blog. So I was grabbed straight away as I firmly believe in the power of thoughts to change your life.The book itself is split up into eight chapters, each with a principle:Chapter 1: The principle of resonanceChapter 2: The principle of future memoriesChapter 3: The principle of Your Magical Diving ExperimentChapter 4: The principle of Energetic Boundaries; The power of \`No'Chapter 5: The principle of transforming timeChapter 6: The principle of Sound and Light, Part One; The biology of hopeChapter 7: The principle of Sound and Light, Part Two; How to enhance your life forceChapter 8: The principle of True wealth; Sound wealth is true wealth.I don't want to go through all the principle above. Instead I have chosen the two that resonated with me the most and the ones which I could use in my daily life.The principle of future memoriesLuanne has introduced a new phrase \`Quantum Hologram' which, as I understand it, is your own personal belief on the being, or the force which is helping you in your life. She takes great care not to bring religion into the book but it is clear that she is speaking to people form all beliefs and faiths and the Quantum Hologram is your belief in what controls the world around you including synchronicity. The Quantum Hologram sounds like something from Star Trek (The Next generation) but it is a good way to visualise the life force which helps us in life.Your thoughts are part of that life force and ultimately you are controlling the life force which in turn helps you to create the life you want.Luanne describes a system using \`Feeling based faith' to create your future memories and is quite powerful. It is a way of connecting your feelings and mind to the Quantum Hologram to get what you most desire in life. The analogy she uses for this is \`like sending an e-mail'. Luanne advises keeping a feeling based journal, describing the different feelings you have experienced throughout the day. By writing these down you are releasing the energy of them from yourself out into the open, which leaves you feeling lighter, more energetic and less burdened in order to send your own wishes out into the universe. OrAlthough I didn't use a journal for the feeling based writing I tried it for a few days in my head and it does help. It's like putting a label on your feelings and then releasing them out into the open, quite powerful.Luanne litters this chapter with stories about science and personal experiences which I found very interesting.The principle of true wealthI am deeply interested in prosperity and wealth and am forever clearing my thoughts and actions for the attainment of wealth and prosperity. Every day I am coming to an understanding of true wealth and what it really means and the more I understand the more I am receiving.That's what this chapter is all about. Luanne tells a story of a homeless person by the name of Simon who taught her about true wealth through the friendship they struck up over the years.I am slowly beginning to realise about wealth being an inner game and this book and this chapter reinforced this for me.Luanne advises that there are certain principles to true wealth which are:* Being in the present moment* Being in divine flow* Frequent experience of Compassion, Reverence, Love Peace and Joy* The ability to forgive* Giving without attachment* Certainty that we are all one* Certainty in a power greater than yourself* Certainty that there are enough resources for all of us* The ability to accurately assess your own and others strengths and weaknesses* The ability to be grateful for something* The ability to reduce the intensity for negative thoughts.Belief is also an important part of attracting wealth into your life. If you believe you can't make money or don't deserve it you will never receive it.ConclusionI found the book a great read and I particularly liked the stories in the book. Although it said it is a scientific look at health and wealth there is not much science in the book that explains manifestation. I also found that Luanne was using new phrases to describe old concepts but you will recognise these straight away as trying to bring the old concepts into the minds of a newer generation.I enjoyed the book and particularly the CD and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the \`law of attraction', \`Manifestation' and becoming healthy and wealthy."},{"Title":"Sound Health, Sound Wealth","review":"Completely riveting read.

It is not full of all of the practical advice I had expected.This book does have some useful tips, but it is way too light on covering protocol for traditional weddings. It glosses over important points too quickly, without the explanation and emphasis they deserve.Also, it gave some bad advice. It suggested this: if your intended Maid of Honor is married, to make her Matron of Honor, and appoint an additional Maid of Honor! Although I believe in complete flexibility and customization, this was very impractical, and has only led to confusion in my friend's wedding.Also, it seemed to often take a high-society attitude, and to assume that everyone wants an absolutely traditional wedding (I certainly didn't). I want to be guided by tradition, but everything should ultimately be what the bride prefers (barring \\"bridezillas\\", of course). I hoped that a \\"guerrilla handbook\\" might be in line with these ideas, but it wasn't.I am going to look around for other books.

Mrs. Cleaver or Aunt Bee would be perfect hostesses for this type of game. I can't see anyone born post 1940 being entertained.Overall this book reads like an outdated Emily Post primer filled with information which is obvious.

The premise of the book seems to be that although it is an honor to participate, being in a wedding is like going to war, which is really a silly comparsion. A main theme running through the book is you must forgive the bride of almost anything because she is the bride and therefore not her usual sane and sensible self. But each bride is different and they don't all play toilet paper games at their showers or pick out big, fussy bridesmaids' dresses or fight with their mothers-in-law. After all, this is the 21st century and not the 1950's. However, there was helpful information on different religious ceremonies and the question and answer section was interesting so there were some interesting nuggets of information between its covers. But in summary, this book seems to be stuck in a time warp and does not have in mind the modern bride who has good taste and good manners and displays both from her engagement through to when she has written her last thank you note."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid's Guerrilla Handbook","review":"For women only!!!

Chandra (the author of this book, who also has an orbiting X-ray telescope named after him..some guys have all the luck), who was amongst the most meticulous of theorists and who worked with bigwigs like Eddington, Russell, Dirac, Bethe, Fermi and Von Neumann amongst the most luminous, wrote this massive (and his last) work of Newton's Principia. This is Chandra's take on Newton's work. Don't think its a light read - It isn't.You cannot take it with you to starbucks (its big and heavy) sip cappucino and browse the work. You'll need to be at a table with a straight-back chair and concentrate intensely. If you know Chandra's work, then you will know that chandra always said just about what was required and said it in great English (possibly influenced by Eddington's writing) and his work is un-apologetically mathematical. So essentially this is a 20th century giant interpreting the work of THE giant of all time. It is NOT a verbatim reproduction in English of the original latin publication of the Principia. It is expensive for a reason. Its beautifully written and bound very beautifully in a red jacket with Newton's bust and handwriting on the jacket. If you bought it, the red cover is attractive enough to make it stand out of your living room book shelf. Most importantly, Chandra tackles each aspect of Newton's principia in a his own manner. GET IT if you can afford it and if you can't, try a used book place. But get it anyway."},{"Title":"Newtons Principia for the Common Reader","review":"perhaps the title \\"...for the common reader\\" is the issue here. \\"the common reader familiar with calculus\\", perhaps...there's simply no way anyone without a very solid grounding in mathematics can read this book and understand it. we are talking about the laws of motion & gravity here, etc.i compared this (a bit dogeared) copy of a book sided by side with a modern copy of principa in a bookshop, and for anyone wishing to tackle this monumentally important work, i cannot think of a better pairing. a modern copy of newton's principia and chandrasekhar's great work for those who wish to see a thorough explanation and working of the equations.it's like a lot of things; be realistic with your expectations.someone who is not very competent in mathematics is not going to be able to ever fully comprehend the contents of this book, misleading title notwithstanding.perhaps the person that gave this book one star would like to let us know what scientific books he has awarded five stars to if he thinks so lowly of this one?i say all this, because i'm currently self-studying algebra to be able to self-study calculus next year, just so i can try and understand some of this all-important book.so don't knock the book, just keep putting the time in & struggling (and it's a struggle, alright) with the mathematics that unlock its secrets."},{"Title":"Newtons Principia for the Common Reader","review":"I am working through this book. I am impressed with Chandra's insight into the Principia. But it's very difficult. Beware that Chandra's insight can only be as profound as your command of mathematics. (Knowing calculus is not enough, you need to know at least classical mechanics as well.)Chandra wrote this book because the original Newton's Principia is not accessible to modern physicists (because they lack familiarity with axiomatic classical geometry). But Chandra's book is not accessible to everybody else. Thus, Chandra's term \\"common reader\\" probably refers to common (and modern) physicists.In my independent investigation into Newton's mathematics, I noticed that Newton seemed to work on the \\"new analysis\\" method early in his career but then seemed to discard it around mid 1670s for geometrical demonstration. He never looked back. His mature research papers and treatises such as De motu, and the Principia itself were composed in the style of the ancient, i.e. synthetic geometry of the Greek. There has been many confused speculations about this. Some says that it was his peculiar way in confusing the reader, or trying to be obscure - as he was extremely averse to censure and criticism. Others however believe that he used Euclidean construction so that the work can be accessed by the public who did not possess profound knowledge in Mathematics.However, modern historian now understood that it was because Newton came to believe that the synthetic mathematics of the ancient, i.e. ruler-and-compass geometry, was a superior method to that of the modern \\"men of recent time.\\" Newton believed that the ancient had their own method of analysis which had been lost to history. Newton was also concerned about the certainty of mathematics as the language for describing nature that led to his quest to restore the ancient method (analysis in his time was not rigorous). In the end however it was never clear whether Newton did discover the lost method. But Newton's preference of synthetic geometry was probably the reason why his notations in calculus are not as successful as that of Leibniz. Newton never bothered to refine his analytical notations for the purpose of demonstration. He clearly believed that synthetic geometry was the way to go and he used it successfully in all of his investigative efforts. Through out his later career, Newton was concerned that he utilized algebraic notations heavily in his youth - which he strangely found to be lack of taste - and wanted to suppress those early works.Having said that I believe to understand Newton's philosophy we should read him in his original (synthetic geometry) rather than replacing them with advanced notation of modern calculus and analysis - as Chandra did here - which only makes sense to graduate students in math, engineering or physics.To understand the original Principia, I recommend that first you find yourself a copy of \\"Force and Geometry in Newton's Principia\\" by Francois De Gandt (translated by Curtis Wilson). This is the best book that I know which explains and orients readers of Newton to the language of his geometry. In Newton's time, some physicists such as himself and Christian Huygens investigated the nature of force and motion through geometrical method. De Gandt's book is excellent because it did not just explain the math (geometry) but also the concept of force as understood by Newton and his contemporaries. De Gandt's book is therefore essential if you want to understand Newton in his own terms - not just the Principia but his other later works (such as De Motu) as well.Another excellent book isIsaac Newton on Mathematical Certainty and Method (Transformations: Studies in the History of Science and Technology)by Guicciardini. This explains Newton's approach to mathematics and his mathematical philosophy. If you are serious about understanding Newton's mind, you should check these two books out. Please note that some knowledge of Euclid (about first 4 books) and Apollonius's Conics and Archimedes's treatment on Spiral are needed too. So it is wise to have them as reference."},{"Title":"Newtons Principia for the Common Reader","review":"I read the Principia a few years ago (the I. Bernhard Cohen translation from 1999), and like anyone else who has ever read it, found it very hard going in the places where it wasn't downright impossible. This isn't the fault of the translator, who did a great job, but of Newton, who was notoriously averse to criticism and made sure that his work was as hard as possible, in order \\"to avoid being baited by little Smatterers in Mathematicks.\\"Fortunately, the great astrophysicist Chandrasekhar has given us this Guide, and it truly is a revelation. As he mentions in the introduction, his goal isn't to cover every theorem in the Principia, but rather to help us understand the great theorems and mathematical techniques in Newton's work. Reading this book is a humbling and awesome experience. Here we have one great mind showing us how another great mind works, and conveying to the reader his unbounded admiration for Newton's intellect and scientific achievements. He does this by showing us how Newton's geometric reasoning unfolds while translating the math into modern calculus, which is one reason why this book is invaluable. This book reminds us that Newton wasn't just a smart guy who invented calculus and came up with gravitation and the laws of motion, but rather the greatest scientific mind in history and a man who grasped the laws of nature with an ease that was downright frightening.I'm warning you, however, that you won't get anything for free. If you want to read this book, you should first of all read Euclid's elements, upon which Newton modeled his work, and then read the Principia itself. Then you should make sure that your math skills are up to snuff - you will be doing many equations in your head along the way, and Chandrasekhar isn't going to make it easy for you. But it's worth the effort in the end, when, after working through a particularly difficult theorem, you lean back, smile, and think, \\"How incredibly beautiful! I could never have done that!\\""},{"Title":"Newtons Principia for the Common Reader","review":"This work, although beyond my competence in mathematics, is designed for \\"the common reader.\\" With just--a desideratum I lack--calculus and geometry, Chandra demonstrates certain fundamental scholia of Newton's treatise. But he does more than this. He shows us what Descartes suspected--that the classical geometers and Newton, in a way, new the same things. Descartes was the first to voice his \\"suspicion\\" that the classical mathematicians knew the methods of modern, calculus-based numerical analysis, but did not reveal such (Descartes' foundational act, his creation of \\"analytical geometry,\\" is the point of \\"closest contact\\" ( Leo Strauss in a different comparison: Xenophon and Machiavelli) between ancient mathematical science and modern. By casting \\"Principia\\" in classical geometry, Newton--in a tradition profoundly indebted to Descartes and, therefore, Spinoza, shows his assent to Descartes' premise. If Newton's \\"Principia\\" can be elaborated by Euclid's methods, then, perhaps, Euclid is not so Parmenidean after all. In other words, there is a kinematicism (Parmenides) and a dynamism (Heraclitus)--i.e., Einstein and quantum theory--within classical mathematical science.I find this in Euclid's ambiguous definition of \\"point\\" within his \\"elements\\" and within his non-theorem, but postulate, the famous \\"fifth\\"--which scholars have labored in vein to derive from his other four axioms.They have now discovered that it cannot be done, which is why it is a \\"postulate,\\" rather than an \\"axiom.\\"Newton, to say nothing of Euclid, chose all words carefully: Chandra brings this to light for us. This should not cause us to shrug our shoulders and say, \\"Well, then, it has all been done before, why do anything in science?\\" It should, rather, challenge us to say, \\"How can I prove that?\\"Maybe you cannot, and I know I cannot: So it has the effect of conserving for us the greatness of our tradition, while asking us to go beyond it by not allowing us the, \\"We stand on the shoulders of the shoulders of giants, so we see farther than they\\" platitude. Therefore, above all, the mystery of Newton's cosmology is revealed to us. We have found our way out of the Labyrinth of millenial confusion only to recover the greatness of Our Tradition: Our gratitude to Chandra is infinite! So, perhaps, is the cosmos in which it emerged.Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy"},{"Title":"Newtons Principia for the Common Reader","review":"I expected this to be a walkthrough for people like myself who have a knowledge of physics but are far from being experts and are interested in reading the classics of science.

The reason I'm still bothering to write a review is to make you feel a little better if you're dying to find it. I noticed it got rave reviews in certain circles. I've wondered if these were friends of Talleur's, or if he simply has a good reputation. I'm an intermediate flyfisherman, and I really didn't find this book as useful as I hoped. It's a *good* book, just not a *very* good book. I found the chapter on leader construction quite useful. The book seems to assume that you'll be fishing during a hatch on classic trout waters. This is only a slight exaggeration, but let's face it - the vast majority of trout flyfishing done in this country is not during the Hendrickson hatch on a calm pool on the Beaverkill. The chapters on casting and rod/reel selection are only mediocre (although I've read better casting instruction, most equipment discussions in books seems to be mediocre.) So that leaves the fishing. And I can't help but noticing a subtle bit of arrogance in Talleur's writing, as if he seems to be saying &quot;This is a great book.&quot; I can't put my finger on why. I would have to recommend other books for the fishing aspect, such as Rosenbauer's excellent &quot;Prospecting for Trout&quot; or Humphrey's slightly off-beat &quot;On the Trout Stream&quot;. I have glanced at Kreh's &quot;Presenting the Fly&quot; and that may be a real winner - we'll see!"},{"Title":"Fly Fishing for Trout","review":"There are a slew of beginner how-to fly fishing manuals out there.

The book was scant on breaking down the nomenclature and utility of specific gear. The hatch/fly section was useful but far more attuned to the etymology than the lure strategy.

I do not find Mr. Talleur's style overly arrogant. I believe that this is a tightly targeted work, aimed, as it says in the title, for beginners. Just before the beginning of every season I read it again, and I am always a better fisherman for it.For an experienced angler, there would be better books, but if you are the person in the title, a beginner, this should be the first book you read."},{"Title":"Photographic lens manual and directory","review":"The author was famous, and for those with a purely intellectual interest in camera lens (geeks = myself) it really is a fine little book."},{"Title":"The Plainswoman","review":"I picked up the audio version of this book, and found the story bland.

Destitute, penniless she is forced to eat garbage and to work as a servant and laundress until she finally lands a job making rugs. Eventually, she ends up out west where she buys acres of land and employs a handyman.I like historicals... But the execution of the storyline left me cold. There is a modern feel and attitude in this story. Amity's desire to go it alone seemed difficult to believe. I didn't feel immersed by the storytelling. Parts that were described were boring... Parts that she skipped over writing (such as her journey west, and her first nights on the homestead) were skipped. At times I felt I was being told the story rather than shown the story. I felt annoyed that the origins of Amity's amnesia wasn't explored more fully at the beginning since this seemed to be such a serious issue.I found myself bored after about 45 minutes of listening. Although I am intrigued about what happened to Amity and why she lost her job, I found myself not caring enough about the character or buying into the authenticity of the setting to care.2 stars."},{"Title":"The Plainswoman","review":"I truly enjoyed this book- it is a great example of historical fiction from the 1860's - 1870's era of the West.

Furthermore, he observes that popular religion admits error but denies guilt.Yet according to Littell, a Christian theologian of towering virtue, \\"the crucifixion of the Jews is an unavoidable reality,\\" for churches exemplifying a shameless fact. This reminds one of Littell's eloquent call, in Simon Wiesenthal's Sunflower, for increased awareness of the earnest nature of the \\"choice between good and evil, between innocence and guilt.\\"Israel's very existence, he writes, disproves the replacement theology that would have the Jewish people withering away. The state's strength refutes that idea that Israel and or the Jewish people will eventually be assimilated or annihilated, as well as a \\"traditional Christian myth about their end in the historic process.\\" For this reason, Littell argues that Israel creates a crisis in much of contemporary Christian theology.To his great credit, Littell recognizes that it is not only the Christian peoples of the world that cannot define themselves without reference to the Jewish people. The same situation presides for Muslims, whose definition of themselves also stems from Judaism.Meanwhile, although the Jewish people define themselves in reference to gentiles, it defines neither Christians nor Muslims nor any other non-Jews, but calls them all gentiles and asks only that they abide by Noachite laws--in other words, follow seven of the 10 commandments; all who do so, Judaism considers righteous.Moreover, the Jewish people need neither Christians nor Muslims to define themselves, which Littell believes perhaps to account for much of the hatred Jewish people have faced over the centuries and today.Littell recounts quite thoughtfully the history of church anti-Semitism, putting all of this detail into the context of its relevance today. There is a struggle with the past in all churches, he writes, a trial which remains as yet unresolved.During the Holocaust, he observes, Jewish people died en masse because other peoples and nations did not recognize their people- and nationhood. \\"Christians, with the exception of a minority of martyrs and confessors, betrayed the life unto which they were called.\\"But Israel, after all, was and remains the thing that places Christianity into crisis, although Littell admits that Islam's crisis is far deeper than that of Christendom, the Islamic spiritual and intellectual unity remains that of an \\"unscientific religious culture,\\" which hasn't yet \\"entered the period of voluntary adherence, pluralism, skeptical study.\\" Littell places the monastic mindset of Islam today on the same plane as the Christian culture of the 13th century.This hardly relieves Christianity of its grave responsibilities, however. According to Littell, the post-Christian eras of Marxism, secular humanism, postivism, and various forms of fascism must be added to the crisis in values plaguing the west. The assured oral tradition of earlier eras has eroded seriously, he writes, far mores than in the Muslim states, which boast \\"hafiz,\\" or living libraries, people who have committed many books in the Islamic tradition to memory.During the Yom Kippur War, Littell recalls the anti-Semitic press pundits whose grossly anti-Jewish ideology boiled to the surface in vulgar BBC, newspaper and even parliamentary oratories and essays. \\"This was obviously not the same Britain that had stood courageously alone against the Nazis or even the one that under Anthony Eden's leadership had checked Nasser's illegal military operations in the Suez, Sharm-el-Sheik and the Sinai in May 1967.In France, \\"even handedness\\" in 1973 allowed for the training of Arab fighters, a surge in Gaulist right-wing anti-Semitism, and arms shipments to Saudi Arabia and Libya.In Germany, the nation that in 1952 had admirably embarked upon a rapprochement with Israel, now capitulated to the Arab League. These Christian nations, once Christendom's heartland, \\"acted in a crucial moment without regard to religious or ethical considerations.\\"As for free churches such as the Quakers, Landrom Bolling's \\"Search for Peace in the Middle East\\" and other similarly titled editions were blind to the ethics, sensitivity, courage and confrontation of injustice for which Quakers were traditionally famous, much less to the facts of the regional history. Most important, these reports all ignored the 1 million Jewish refugees forced from their homes and businesses with nothing by the 22 Arab Muslim nations.The left wing of the churches, Littell observes, has so often tended to focus on the reformation that it has completely ignored the model set by the Jewish people, forgetting that the new covenant of Christ was laid on the foundation of service to God set by the Jewish people. This, Littell observes, is what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called \\"cheap grace.\\"Every thinking person of faith should read this shining example of Christian righteousness.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"The crucifixion of the Jews: The failure of Christians to understand the Jewish experience","review":"Elijah was one of Israel's greatest prophets who fled for his life from the Sidonian princess Jezebel, who was married to Ahab, a King of a divided Israel, the division happening after King Solomon's son Rehoboam. Elijah told these words to his servant to tell Ahab that he (Elijah) would appear before him and to stop looking for him. Ahab was the worst of Israel's kings, Jezebel, a gentile, their worst queen; they made unholy alliances and killed the prophets I Kings 18:13 and 19:10. They also killed and slandered and stole see I Kings 21 about Nabaioth's vineyard.G-d always sends someone to speak to an apostate people, someone like Elijah. The apostates are those within the ranks of the faithful who reject the tenets or teachings of their faith. This book was written to analyze anti-semitism, its sources, its nature, its expression, its danger. There are two appendices in the back of this book, the first contains a document entitled \\"A Statement to our Fellow Christians\\" which was drafted by a committee working for the National Council of Churches for which the author served as chairman. Of the 18 theologians who contributed to this letter, one third were Roman Catholic, one Greek Orthodox, the rest all Protestant; 16 of the members were American. They address basically what the attitude of Christians should be to Jews and the nation of Israel and cite scripture and historical events to bolster their arguments. Their last point equates antisemitism to that unforgivable sin, the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit Matthew 12:31. They state: \\"The pain of the past has taught us that antisemitism is a Pandora's box from which spring not only atrocities against Jews but also contempt for Christ. Whatever the antisemite inflicts on the Jews he inflicts on Christ...\\" Littell warns in this book that \\"Recent studies show a rise in anti-semitism in the United States\\", yet he wrote this book nearly 30 years ago. What about today? One evening in Massachusetts, I sat at a table with all Irish Catholics and one replied \\"those dirty Jews\\". I'm sure that not everyone felt the same way, but the question remains where did he get that. In a lesson I'm completing from a National Bible study attended by mostly Protestants, one of the questions asks, \\"What will unbelievers refuse, causing them to be deluded to believe a lie (2 Thessalonians 2:10-12?\\" Yet can't believers believe lies too? Didn't Christian Germany believe the lies of Hitler? Doesn't Christ himself say that 'Many of the elect will fall away?' Translation: Many will apostize. Hmm. Jesus also said in John 16:2-4: 'the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to G-d...They have not known the Father, nor me. I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you will remember that I told you of them.' It's interesting to remember that Jesus never set foot out of The Holy Land and always spoke to audiences of nearly all jews.As Littell shows, one source of anti-semitism is Christian teaching itself from its earliest days which is termed displacement theory or supercessionism. This teaching supplants judaism by suggesting that the Church, now in Christ, has nullified everything that went before in the Old Testament. And then there is the deicide charge, that the Jews crucified Christ, which is inaccurate on many counts, and is ignorant of the fact that the Romans crucified many jews before and after Christ. This teaching was not omitted from Vatican II as Littell writes despite much discussion over it. Littell does not trace antisemitic teachings to the Apostle Paul, neither do I. His (Paul's) attitude to his fellow Jews is best expressed in the letter of Romans which is cited by Littell in his second chapter entitled \\"Christian Antisemitism\\".There's much in this little book, much of which I've not relayed to you. I leave you with this statement of Littell's: \\"A rise of Antisemitism is often the first seismographic reading on a serious shifting and shearing along the fault lines of bedrock Christianity. The fundamental fault line...is a line of false teaching about the Jewish people.\\" Well worth the read, highly recommended for my fellow Christians."},{"Title":"The crucifixion of the Jews: The failure of Christians to understand the Jewish experience","review":"One of the problems in this book is that Littell attacks as anti-semetic Christian teachings such as so-called supercessionism which seperates Christianity and the Church from judaism. The teachings are essentially that after Christ, we as humans are all now equal in God's eyes and that we are not to read into prophecy a special role (prophectic or otherwise) for the Jewish people. Such ideas are not anti-jewish, rather they are the modern foundation of co-existance between christians and jews.The book ignores the other strain of christianity which rejects these ideas. Starting with the Plymouth Brethern and John Darby, there arose in America a set of very dangerous doctrines which sees the Jewish people as a \\"means to an end\\" in Christian Prophecy and religion. God is said to have a special role for the Jewish people which involves first the re-creation of Israel, then the re-construction of the temple, then the driving of all Jews in the world to Israel, then the depature of Christians out of the world to the side of God, and then a war in the world where the majority of Jews will die leaving only christian converts as survivors.Their theology is nothing less than \\"blessing\\" Israel by leading it to the slaughter. His modern followers see it as their duty to keep Israel at war with its neighbors and to help coax it along to what they consider its inevitable descrution. All the while along the way, they work to convert Jews in fufullment of other aspects of their prophecies.I've heard these people say in public that the holocaust was an expression of God's will and prophecy to enable the re-creation of Israel as a nation. They go into a panic at the mention of Israel making peace with anyone because peace for Israel can only be the work of the anti-christ.The greatest source of anti-jewish theology in christianity today can be found among the so-called evangelicals. They hide it will in that in public they talk about blessing Israel and their love for Israel, but what they believe in their hearts is that Israel's destruction in war is inevitable and necessary. And that while god will take every christian away to protect them from that war, it is the role of the Jews to be destroyed.The problem for Littell and his book is that he is fighting the previous battle against anti-semitism while remaining almost totally blind to whats going on around him *today*.So-called supercessionism is compatable with the modern idea that Jews and Christians can co-exist. Darbyism and its followers see it as their role to bring about the end of the world and lead israel to descrution.There are other reasons for me not giving respect to Franklin H. Littell. He has over the years made alliances with certain disreputable groups and organizations. He has published in their magazine, received a medal from them, signed petitions on their behalf and has turned a deaf ear to the critics of that particular group. While he falls to his knees in guilt over christianity, he has bent over backwards in obediant service to an utterly reprehensible organization.In his guilt, he lost the ability to know right from wrong. And has undermined his work since at least the early 1980s."},{"Title":"The fantastic stories of Cornell Woolrich (Alternatives)","review":"This long out of print volume consists of 8 short stories by the legendary Cornell Woolrich. The stories were selected for inclusion because of their undeniable connection to the realm of the occult and the supernatural, which is to say that nightmarish dimension where fantasy and horror coexist.The titles of the 8 short stories are:- Kiss of the Cobra- Dark Melody of Madness- Speak to Me of Death- I'm Dangerous Tonight- Guns, Gentlemen- Jane Brown's Body- The Moon of Montezuma- Somebody's Clothes- Somebody's LifeEach story is painstakingly constructed so as to maximize suspense and dread. And each provides spine tingling imagery guaranteed to captivate any reader brave enough to venture into the outer reaches of Cornell Woolrich's frighteningly depraved psyche.All of the stories are quite good and well worth reading. My personal favorite: Jane Brown's Body. A genuinely macabre, bone chilling tale that effectively updates the Dr. Frankenstein legend to the era of air travel and Chicagoland gangsters.The Fantastic Stories of Cornell Woolrich provides a showcase for what the author was capable of when his storytelling was completely freed of the restraints the rules of the natural world necessarily impose.

How many people do you know who are in your yoga or martial arts classes who have gone into Samadhi??? nobody!!! and you know why??? because they don't place strong enough emphasis on the mind, they talk but never get there.

Would not recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Concentration: A Guide to Mental Mastery","review":"since ancient times,people have climbed into caves in desolate mountains ,spent their entire lives in monasteries trying to tame their minds.This was when the world wasn't in such turmoil as it it is in,these days.Can a little book promise you and deliver the greatest accomplisment of all when for centuries the efforts of our forefathers too have been found wanting? This book is freakish in the sense that it's author believes that modern man can master his mind.We are supposed to tame our minds while living in a troubled society where we have to somehow adjust our lives in such a manner that among the chaos of the world today,a few ten to fifteen minutes of practicing concentration exercises is supposed to make us masters of our minds.Absolutely ridiculous! Was the author smoking ganja while writing this book? no,mouni sadhu or m sudouski (his real name) has spent a major proportion of his life in isolation.Years will pass by as you slowly progress from one exercise to another and then,say by chance,you are unable to perform your stipulated exercise for a month or two,you will find yourself moving down the ladder,your progress would have been lost,and you may not have to start from scratch but you will find yourself making up for lost ground.In that case it would take you several lifetimes to accomplish any of the results that the author promises you.Live in a desolate monastery or in a jungle (which may i add,the author did himself,for a brief period of time),renounce everything of the world and then try to tame your mind.Are you capable of that? This book is a joke.Ramana Maharshi once said 'that which is not permanent is not worth striving after'.Are the results of practising concentration exercises permanent?As long as you keep to the schedule,you'll move ahead at a frustrating slow pace.And speaking of the schedule,the author recommends 10 - 15 minutes of practise everyday,nothing more is required he says.By the time you sit down to practise your exercises and by the time your thoughts have calmed down even slightly,you'll find that your time for the day has elapsed and you'll be left with the feeling that your day's efforts have been inadequate.Also the author gives 'helpful instructions' before the actual exercises commence,such as speak less,control your temptations forcefully etc,all of which are directed at strengthening your will-power,he says.These things only caused me distress,I felt suffocated.Life is short.do you want to spend it struggling with impractical and inadequate exercises,satisfied with fragile results? Surely there must be a more 'healthy' way.I could go on with practical advice and instructions but this is a book review and i'll keep it at that."},{"Title":"Concentration: A Guide to Mental Mastery","review":"I know of a man who practised the exercises outlined in this book and subsequently,he developed this so-called ability to concentrate,to quite an astonishing degree.I didn't meet this person for a few months before I ran into him again,and he seemed quite distressed.I asked him what had happened and he told me that his endeavours at attaining control over has mind had brought about an unforeseen predicament. Apparently,his effort and his subsequent fractional success at mastering his mind had resulted in an increase of his spiritual strength wherein he was less prone to giving in to temptations. This in turn had \`caught the attention of certain hostile entities' and without getting into too much of the alarming details of his experience,he was told to halt his progress or else he would make himself eligible to harsh and unpleasant tests,tests which every desiring aspirant had to undergo. Being the curious person that I am,I pressed on the matter and asked him to elaborate on these \`hostile entities' and he went on to tell me that he had recurring dreams in which he was repeatedly threatened by a fierce ethereal being which revealed itself as being a \`raakshas'.A rakshasa or raakshas as he pronounced it ,is a Sanskrit term whose most accurate English equivalent would be \`demon'."},{"Title":"Concentration: A Guide to Mental Mastery","review":"In the late 1960's and early 70's there was a phrase that was made popular which went, &quot;Tell it the way it is.&quot; It came about as a result of the falsehoods which society was being inundated with from all sides of life.

In this book, published over four decades ago, Mouni Sadhu &quot;tells it the way it is&quot; in regard to the art and discipline of meditation. He pulls no punches and does not try to sugar coat the cold, hard facts about the development of the ability to concentrate and its necessity in being able to meditate properly.Mouni Sadhu is the religious name taken by a Westerner who studied with Sri Ramana Maharshi, a famous and much beloved Indian spirtual teacher who passed away at the mid-point of the twentieth century. The word &quot;mouni&quot; means &quot;silent&quot; and &quot;sadhu&quot; refers to a wandering holy man of the Hindu faith. Though the author had tried many paths on the route to self-realization, it wasn't until he came upon his Indian teacher Sri Ramana that he managed to successfully break through the ego's hard exterior and into the infinity of being. He is therefore a bona fide spokesman for the truths which he recollects in this book.Written in a simple and easily understandable style, Concentration is a classic among books on the art of meditation. Published, as it was, before our fascination with things &quot;New Agey,&quot; it dispells many of the myths and misconceptions that have arisen and been promoted out of that movement. And for this reason alone, for the preservation of the truth, it is worth its weight in gold.First and foremost among the myths it dispells is the idea that developing concentration is really of no consequence in the practical application of the art of meditation, as some so-called New Age gurus would have people believe. This is like saying that for an automobile to function properly it doesn't need gasoline! Without the ability to concentrate, our efforts at meditation will result only in going nowhere, in spinning our wheels in an unending rut.Concentration is the cornerstone upon which our ability to engage ourselves in true meditation is based. Without its proper development it is as though we are in a car without a steering wheel. We have no way of directing ourselves toward our ultimate goal.A second myth that is dealt with, which has been promoted in recent years, is that it is not important to be able to develop within oneself the ability to quiet the mind of all extraneous thoughts. This is the subject of Chapter Fourteen wherein is given a method of beginning to develop this ability to quiet the mind. In his usual straightforward way, Mouni Sadhu states quite unequivocally, &quot;The key to success in this study is just the losing of interest in uncontrolled thinking. With that key you may open the golden gate, from which you expect so much. Without the key, there is no purpose in even beginning the exercises.&quot;Mouni Sadhu gives a powerful presentation of all the aspects leading up to the attainment of the ability to concentrate, structuring the book into four sections. The first seven chapters deal with the definition, method, use, and roll of concentration in a spiritual search. The next seven chapters cover the psychological preliminaries and the keys to successful use of the techniques (which themselves are outlined in the third section of seven chapters) for developing concentration. The last chapter, Twenty-Two, deals with what he calls &quot;guided intuitional knowledge, also called the wisdom of the Self, which is the ultimate aim of concentration.&quot; Here, whether you are a beginner or an old hand in working with the mind, is a compendium of inspiring information in the practical experience of the higher states of consciousness, useful in helping one to corroborate one's own experience with someone who has been there.In this slender book, Mouni Sadhu manages to cover a great deal of important ground for the person interested in developing his mental faculties. Though he states at the outset that such abilities are not easily won, he does encourage the reader to follow his own inclinations regarding the level of commitment he is willing to make. He stresses not getting ahead of oneself, but to take it one step at a time. This is all one need do to have success with these exercises."},{"Title":"Concentration: A Guide to Mental Mastery","review":"This is a excellent book. It is not a difficult read, although it should be read carefully for understating of the subtle issues being addressed in the book. It is truly as the title says, a guide to mental mastery. But I must warn readers. Reading this book is not a assurance of mental mastery. A reader must be deligent and patient with the exercises in the book, in order to reap the long term benefits.

This book is a guide through this difficult process. There is no royal road to mastering yor mind, but this book at least sets out some good guide posts.My only quibble with the book is the author's fascination with his Indian Guru, and his acceptance of the Indian Hindu belief structure. This is not a serious enough quibble to harm the utility of the book. I reccomend it to all who wish to make their mind their tool."},{"Title":"Concentration: A Guide to Mental Mastery","review":"When I first encountered this little gem of a book, I read it once through and didn't give it too much thought afterward. I was mainly interested in improving my concentration in an effort to strengthen my intellect, and, at the time, it seemed to me that there were better ways of doing this. This probably isn't the case, though. While Sadhu's exercises are almost insanely difficult, they are practically guaranteed to bring results. And the great thing is that much of the advice offered in the book is compatible with almost any theological or philosophical outlook. The only thing that I found a little off-putting about the book is all the Eastern mysticism and such that Sadhu makes references to and seems to believe in. That's not even nearly enough to detract in any way from this book's value, though."},{"Title":"Concentration: A Guide to Mental Mastery","review":"Any time you spend reading from this book and doing the exercises, no matter how minimal your discipline, will be time well spent."},{"Title":"Concentration: A Guide to Mental Mastery","review":"Sadhus book is an excellent book on concentration.

This book gives a practical, step-by-step guide to the application of the principals at the heart of Yoga. The instructions allow the student to cut through the dogma and get to the essence of mastering the mind."},{"Title":"Concentration: A Guide to Mental Mastery","review":"This is the second book that I've read on concentration(first being Theron Q. Dumont's Power of concentration, that I actually recommend to read before starting with this book). Actually, it might be the third - if I considered the first self help book I've ever read (a long while ago).This book is written with the spiritual seeker in mind, the person who is aware that focusing the mind is the basic practice for everything that lies forward, but it can actually be studied by anyone since it has nice gradual exercises. I think that the name of the author means \\"silent yogi\\" in an Indian language (could actually be Sanskrit).Concentration book is structured in four parts, touching the purpose and usefulness of studying concentration and other preliminary explanations (part 1), achievements of some masters (saints, yogis/rishis) of both East and West and outlines their training methods (part 2). The third part is about the exercises themselves, and they are graded - each of them assumes you mastered the previous ones (he emphasizes you need to actually master them, not just do them a few times then move to next series). Finally, in the ending chapters the author touches the issue of using the new skills to meditate and deepen understanding of the purpose of life.There is something interesting about this book.... He says you shouldn't even read the next chapters until you have mastered the exercises in the current chapter. Well, I tried to do that, started the exercises, then, well, dropped. Started again later, dropped again. In short, it took me basically one year to read it fully (no, I didn't master anything, but after a while I decided to read it anyway). Now I do the exercises here daily (well, almost, this is a crazy and busy world).I would suggest reading first Power of concentration by Theron Q. Dumont. That book has some shortcomings in the exercises part, but is excellent in building the motivation (it focuses on mundane objectives like following through, succeeding in business, overcoming bad habits, etc.). Actually, this book also builds motivation, but on a deeper, spiritual level, hence some people would be better off by following my suggestion.I personally liked all the spiritual teachings and warnings, and one could ignore them and just stick to the exercises. Power of concentration (Theron Q. Dumont) probably took things too lightly. This book takes them too seriously, but then again, training the mind is something serious. If you think about it, you cannot take your belongings with you after death. Heck, you cannot even take the body, even if you are a world champion bodybuilder. But, you could take the mind with you - or at least this is what Eastern masters tell us. So, mind training is something not to be taken lightly. I do believe however that he exaggerated a bit - people who want to go far probably already know about potential perils, and the rest will probably never need to understand why he said that anyway. Actually, he didn't exaggerate, but my take is that the book would be better by emphasizing it less.To end this, a book is as good as the changes it determines you to undergo. A book is a book. Results and changes are something else, and they require efforts and dedication. There is no such thing as a short path to mastery - be it medicine, computers, sports, and of course concentration and meditation. This book does determine you to take action - is actually quite good at that - but, as I said, is just a help, a supplement, a guide, a reinforcement... it is definitely not a replacement for the mental work that needs to happen on a daily basis in order to truly succeed.Good luck!"},{"Title":"Concentration: A Guide to Mental Mastery","review":"This book isn't on any best seller this and still if you want to learn how to concentrate, this is it. I've had the book for a little over 2 yrs and have only finished half of the exercises. When you think you've performed exercises adequately you haven't, go back and do it again.

However, this book has some big weaknesses in terms of the writing. While there are passages and scenes that are very well-written, draw the reader in, and transition smoothly to other scenes, they are interrupted by passages that are poorly written and transitions that are sudden and unexplained. For instance, the beginning of the book is very weak. It's almost as though Seton was so anxious to get into the meat of the plot that she didn't want to take the time to \\"set up\\" the story. As an example, chapter one ends with Amy running way from Martin Stone, unwilling to commit to talking with him again and afraid that he would report her to a school counselor. Chapter two starts up two weeks later, with Amy and Martin meeting in his apartment. There is no explanation given for what changed Amy's mind. Such a lack of transition seems amateurish and isn't what one would expect from a seasoned writer like Seton. Also, as other reviews have stated, the ending of the book is flat. There was so much Seton could have done with the ending of a story like this, but it's almost as though one day she decided she was through writing the story and just ended it where she was. This should have been a longer book, with the weak parts better developed.I think the story line was creative and interesting and deserves a 4; however, the writing itself deserves a 2. So I am compromising at a 3. If you've read other Seton books then you'll understand she was not at her best here. This was her last book, and it feels like she had just lost the inspiration, the desire to write, or something. If this is your first Seton book, don't let this one turn you off. Her others are better!"},{"Title":"SMOULDERING FIRES","review":"I enjoyed the book, but the ending was rather flat.

So this is the real-life counterpart to the fictional Hollywood volume and if you do not recognize dozens of the examples that are arranged alphabetically from A (\\"The Accidental Cannibals\\") to Z (\\"The Zoo Section\\"), then you simply have not been swapping tale but supposedly true tales with your best buds.If you remember the point in your cognitive development where you discovered that a true tale and a tale that is not true sound pretty much the same, then you can understand the power of your standard urban legend. The one that goes farthest back in my own mental file cabinet would be \\"The Kentucky Fried Rat,\\" which was told with regards to a particular fast food restaurant in Albuquerque when I was in high school. Of course, some of these go way back, such as \\"The Bullet Baby,\\" the one set in the Civil War where a bullet goes through the scrotum of a Union soldier and lodges in the reproductive tract of a young woman who gives birth to a healthy baby nine months later. That hoax was first published in an 1874 medical journal. You can see the basic principle involved, in terms of taking things that \\"could\\" be true, even if it requires a hefty grain of salt, and spinning a tale. I can imagine somebody trying to come up with alternative methods of accomplishing a virgin birth and throwing out this whopper.Brunvand, a professor emeritus at the University of Utah, has written several books on the subject of urban legends, such as \\"Too Good to Be True,\\" \\"The Vanishing Hitchhiker,\\" and \\"Curses! Broiled Again!\\" In this collection he is interested in looking at these urban legends as examples of modern folk narrative. There are hundreds of individual urban legends included here, along with their variations, and most entries are cross-referenced and include bibliographical citations. Whenever possible he traces the evolution of particular legends and their connections to other fields including film, literature, comic books, music, etc. He also points out how the Internet has speeded up the dissemination of urban legends to an extent never before imagined.There are even some entries that explain how to collect, classify, and analyze texts and performances for those who want to research the subject further. Throughout the book what Brunvand calls \\"legend themes\\" are explored and he often touches on the scholarly approaches to the genre. But for most readers the fun is going to be finding out where some of the stories they have heard about or even believed in the past really came from. In my defense I want to point out that I really did not care if the story about the \\"Neiman Marcus Cookies\\" was true; I really liked the recipe because these are super rich cookies and you can only eat one at a time, which, for me, would be a good thing."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Urban Legends","review":"This is an authoritative reference, but it's a highly readable one.

The stories were always short, but interesting.Jim Rawls has placed that format into book form, very successfully.The stories are still short -- good for a quick bedtime story to a child or for that brief reading time in the quietest room in your house.Following each story, Rawls has a section called \\"Something More\\", where he encourages you to go somewhere to experience history for yourself.

You have the opportunity to read about the lives and families of each person from early on to when their lives intersected on that fateful September day.I couldn't put this book down, it is definitely a page turner. It is also an emotional roller coaster though, and particularly sensitive readers may have difficulty reading. This is a great book though, most of the focus lies on who these passengers and crew members were and what they meant to their loved ones. Reading along, it is easy to see how these men and women arrived at the brave decision to try and take back the plane. As I've said, this book is very emotional, it is also upsetting, but that is to be expected. The story itself is uplifting though and definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"Jere Longman took faces that we saw on television during montages of photos and made them living, breathing valuable people. They were mothers, fathers, sons and daughters... they represented the best of America and all of them more than met the challenge of the four men who hijacked that plane. After reading the book, I need not watch the endless tributes that TV will offer on the anniversary of 9/11. Mr. Longman has honored the memory of the passengers and crew of Flight 93 with a heartfelt tome."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This is a wonderful book. Don't be afraid to read it because you think it might be too sad...... Of course it's sad, but there is lots of detail here we haven't read before, and the author is almost reverent at times when writing about the people on Flight 93. He is tender throughout, and respectful. It is a story for the ages, one that probably won't be repeated in terms of heroism for a very long time. As the author states, this was not a group of everyday, ordinary people thrown together to deal with catastrophe, but rather these people were extraordinary, as well-qualified as anyone could hope to be to deal with a situation such as the terrible hijacking and ultimate destruction of Flight 93. They were all leaders who knew how to work as a team. They were all brave. They were all strong in spirit as well as physically. Bless them all for what they did and for what they have taught all of us!There are so many books being written about September 11, probably all of them well-intentioned. This one is going to prove to be the most personal, I believe, as it is based on recorded phone messages, recorded messages from the cockpit, and interviews with the families of the victims. Included are several pages about the hijackers and their backgrounds and the stories of the people on the ground in Pennsylvania and how they experienced and dealt with what they saw.Kudos to the author. This is journalism at its best, with a heart! Please read the book."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This book gives a succint picture of each person on board. I am shocked at the emotion it has engendered. For anyone who has become complacent since 9/11; read this book."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"The story of United 93 captivated my attention from page one. Terrorism is the backdrop, it lurks dangerously across every page but yet somehow I saw beyond that. I saw the people I read their stories and I was touched. Through meticulous research Jere Longman has reconstructed the hijacking of flight 93, he writes of bravery and heroism, of ordinary people taking a stand to save the lives of others. He focuses on the passengers and crew, describing each individual so that the reader develops a connection with those persons involved. The book is beautifully written, each word, each sentence grabbed at my heart so that I felt I was somehow privy to personal information. I will not forget Jere Longman's, Among the Heroes. It is a book that inspires, it is a book that evokes powerful emotions but mostly it is a book that conveys the courage of everyday citizens who fought back against terrorism."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This is the New York Times reporter's story who covered the crash of Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, and he tells the story of its passengers. Reporter Longman, who interviewed thousands of folks after the crash, has taken great pains to reconstruct the lives of the individuals prior to boarding the plane, and their actions once the terrorists took over, and he adds specific detail that brings their stories to life. Wonderful and brilliant!! Inspiring."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"There were times that I just had to stop and put the book down, because of the emotional impact of the individual histories and their collective fate. I had seen Mr. Longman on TV, and of course had heard of several of the participants, and still he captured the drama with a sense of suspense. I was particularly satisfied that:- the book mentions all passengers (except one family) and does not focus entirely on the well-known ones- the personal stories include some with a bit of \\"edge\\", so they did not just sound like air-brushed testimonials, and brought out the exceptional accomplishments among the whole set (this was by no means an average crowd, which makes the loss even sadder)- there was a photo of each passenger and crew member- the author declined to over-analyze exactly what happened at the end, and easily tackles rumors that the military had shot down the plane- there was some information about the primary hijacker.Finally, I believe Mr. Longman's reporting style was just right for the book, and any reader can't help but feel the emotion."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This book is a tear-jerker; but a real tear-jearker. This is about Americans who sacrificed and were sacrificed for others. It is about the lives of each individual on United Flight 93. I say a tear-jeaker because as a Dad I cried at the thought of the many children who would not have a Dad to be there for them. Or the Dads who would no longer see their children grow up. I marveled at the lives of many of the individuals, and how full they lived. This book is indeed a memorial for who they were, how they lived, and how they died. May it help us be better people."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This book was great. It was sad to read about how the people on that flight felt before they crashed. While I was reading the book there were some parts where I felt like I was a passenger on the plane. It was such a great book. It has given me a lot more respect for all those passengers on that plane. May they rest in peace for they sure will not be forgotton in my heart."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"As someone with a strong interest in the events of September 11, 2001, I wanted to learn more about the passengers and attacks. This book goes into great detail about the passengers on United Flight 93;their personal lives, interests, and their reasons for fighting back against the terrorists. I felt like I practically knew them after reading this book. There is one quote from passenger Deora Bodley that I felt like was well put and fitting for this type of novel:\\"People ask who, what, when, why, and how. I ask Peace.\\"I admired people like Todd Beamer and Tom Burnett Jr. for their decisive actions. You will learn more about the passengers, their families, and the after-effects of their heroic actions as well as the other events that horrible day. Make this one a must-read. A true winner."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 WAS A DAY TO FORGET BUT FOR THE HERO'S WHOGAVE UP THEIR LIVES BY FIGHTING BACK ON A DAY THAT BROUGHT SUCH DISPAIR TO OUR GREAT COUNTRY.

The detailed recollections of the telephone calls are heartbreaking (told by family and friends of the victim passengers). The resolve of the passengers is inspirational - no panic, no hysteria, complete selflessness. Truly, a Higher Power was with them all.Although, moved by the information, I found the writing utterly appalling. Longman's narrative might be good if one were reading a newspaper, MAYBE; however, the writer's poor grammatical phasing got in the way of the story.\\"Among the Heroes\\", a gift from my husband, is a quick read and, as I have said informative. The \\"Sources\\" section provides additional books, articles, and websites, which I have used extensively in my quest for information. Not knowing the price, I cannot say one way or another if this book is worth its cost. However, if it were more than ..., I would wait for it in paperback!"},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This is probably the definitive account thus far of the extraordinary men and women aboard Flight 93, to whom our nation will forever be indebted.However, large portions of the detailed descriptions of the passengers' lives I found distasteful, irrelevant and voyeuristic. There are many morbid facts that added nothing to the story and in my view invaded the privacy of the victims' families. Even so, I would have given the book a higher rating but for one thing: A two-page photo spread of the hijackers, incomprehensibly mingled in with heart-rending photos of the victims and their families. Time and time again as I referenced back to photographs of one of the courageous men and women aboard the ill-fated flight, I was forced to hasily page by their faces. Was it really necessary to include them? If so, was it necessary to put them right in with the photographs of the victims?"},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"Good book -- fascinating, intense, important -- but the Brooklyn reader who called his or her piece \\"HDWK -- How Do We Know?\\" should be ashamed. S/he claims to speak for all New Yorkers and claims to know what all Middle Americans think. (And how New York-centric that anywhere in the U.S. outside of New York is Middle America! I lived in New York and remember that snobbishness well.) S/he also claims that the plane might have been intercepted and shot down, implying that Beamer and his companions weren't heroes even if they were thwarting the hijackers as the missile was approaching. \\"Brooklyn\\" knows nothing about courage, heroism, or fairness.

The quote on the front cover, \\"A powerful reconstruction of the flight's final moments. . . . Made me thinks of John Hersey's Hiroshima.\\" from the New York Times is misleading. Hersey documented the events of the bombing of Hiroshima, while Longman just told us everyone's story, followed by what happened after the crash. Don't get me wrong, it was a great book - it just wasn't what I was expecting.Reading about every single passenger's life was fairly boring. I was hoping to find out what really happened on the flight, but I guess that would be pretty impossible considering there weren't any survivors to tell the tale, only phone conversations. It's not completely credible either. No one can prove that all of the phone conversations mentioned are credible. And because the FBI won't release the voice recordings from the cockpit, we (the American public) have no true evidence that anything stated in the book really and truly happened.The American people want to believe that someone out there was trying to defend us when everything else seemed hopeless. They want to believe that all Americans are superheroes. And this story gives off a strong picture of what Americans can be. But was everyone on that plane ready and willing to take down four armed hijackers? This book could just be our way of reviving the Big Stick policy of Teddy Roosevelt.And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe, all of this did happen. Maybe they are all real American heroes. But where's your proof?"},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"As I read \\"Among the Heroes\\", I was inspired by the lives of the passengers, their loved ones, and by the author, Jere Longman. Longman, a New York Times reporter, seamlessly integrates the story of United Flight 93 (preflight check to post-crash recovery effort) with the lives of the passengers and hijackers in a well-written book that I couldn't put down. \\"Among the Heroes\\" successfully achieves the author's 3 goals described in the preface: to recreate the actions aboard Flight 93 in as much detail as is known, to commemorate the crew members and 40 passengers, and to understand how hijacker pilot, Ziad Jarrah, became radicalized to the point of suicide terrorism. Longman does an excellent job reconstructing the story of Flight 93 from numerous interviews, flight records, recollections of family members who heard the data voice recording, taped phone calls of passengers, media reports, and eyewitness accounts of the crash. He also debunks speculation that the plane was shot down. Toward the end, we hear from some of the family members on how they're coping with their loss, and their thoughts on September 11th and the war on terrorism. Longman also does a very good job reconstructing the activities of and influences on Jarrah based on interviews of landlords, family members, flight school classmates, and even the instructor who taught him street-fighting at the gym.For me, what makes this book a 5 star, highly inspirational book are the lives of the passengers and crew. This was an amazing, incredibly talented, highly intelligent group of people. Old or young, married or single, every passenger and crew member appeared to live his or her life to their highest potential. The stories and achievements of these people are remarkable, showing achievements in every area of life: loving families, overcoming challenges, fulfilling careers, personal growth, physical fitness/sports, appreciating nature, spiritual growth, intellectual development, developing one's talents, travel and leisure, helping others, and giving back to the community. Among the passengers were environmental attorneys and environmental activists, a disability rights activist, writers, people successful in socially responsible business such as making airplanes safer and selling life-saving medical supplies, a teacher, emergency medical technicians, an ironworker who helped build the World Trade Center, and two pilots. But we see these people beyond their careers and athletic trophies. We see stories of them showing the kinds of people they were, accomplishments and imperfections alike. Even the youngest people on the plane were highly accomplished, for example, college student Deora Bodley, well-read and accomplished at academics and sports, tutored third and forth graders, educated people about AIDS, and volunteered at an animal shelter. And Deora's was just one of dozens of stories of impressive accomplishments, service to humanity, and love of family. Beyond their resumes, I was struck most by the love these passengers and crew members had for their families and the love their families have for them. There is story after story of passengers and crew members regularly taking time out of their busy lives to share in the lives of loved ones and help other people. For instance, Captain Jason Dahl would plan spectacular anniversary surprises for his wife, and several businessman dads designed their careers so they could spend more time with their children. Lauren Grandcolas, pregnant with her first child on the flight, not only had a successful career in marketing and advertising, she kept physically fit by a variety of activities and still found time to volunteer for 5 different causes including AIDS walks and food distribution centers, and to even give her husband Jack a facial. In their darkest hour, knowing they were likely to die, Lauren and many of her fellow passengers, called their loved ones seeking to comfort them and tell them they loved them one last time.Upon reading this book, I'm more inspired than ever to manage my time better, set and accomplish goals, live my life to the fullest, make time for loved ones, and as time management guru Stephen Covey says, \\"leave a legacy.\\""},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This enthralling book is a tribute to the heroic crew and passengers of United Airlines flight 93. Author Jere Longman has taken biographical sketches and family rememberances of each passenger along with specific details about the flight itself and created a testimony to the passengers that will endure for a long time.Each passenger has their own biographical sketch; from Todd Beamer's devout Christian background and his unforgettable \\"Let's Roll\\", which became a rallying cry much like \\"Remember Pearl Harbor\\" from a generation ago, to Jeremy Glick's undying love for his new baby girl, the true heroes of 9-11 are brought to life on the pages of this book. Using comments and testimonials from family members and intertwining actual events which occurred on the plane after the takeover, the reader gets a clear picture of what happened aboard United flight 93 on that fateful September day.By now, everyone knows the story of how the passengers and crew fought back and ultimately saved hundreds if not thousands of lives by forcing the terrorists to crash the plane, but let us never forget these heroic people who, in the face of certain death, made the ultimate sacrifice so that others might live.This is the first book I've read on the September 11 tragedy, and I recommend it. The biographies of the passengers are the main part of the book, and I felt like I got to know each person on an individual basis. The only part of the book that I found to be what I considered lacking was the actual events aboard the plane. I wish more attention could have been paid in this area. Overall, however, this is a good book and does a good job of explaining what the members of flight 93 faced and how they banded together as one so that others would not meet the same fate."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"I was on the 54th floor of World Trade Center Tower 1 when Flight 11 hit. The sound of the plane's engines continue to haunt me. Like the passengers and crew of Flight 93 I too was in the wrong place at the wrong time. And though I escaped the doomed tower by the narrowest of margins I had a way out whereas those on Flight 93 did not. The book brings to life most of the passengers and crew making it a tough read because all of them had so much to live for and their deaths seem so senseless. Like the \\"Potraits of Grief\\" in the New York Times this book connects you in an intimate way with some the people who were murdered on 9/11. I thank God that there were no children on board Flight 93. Though the passengers and crew were surely frightened and seemed to know their fate they found it within themseleves to summon their courage and to strike back in a completely selfless way. For that we should all be eternally greatful.I deduct a star because the author included a rather lengthy reflection by one of the passenger's relatives where the relative goes on about root causes and the disparity between rich and poor and the resentment that engenders. This is the worst kind of liberal pandering. The hijackers were from well- to-do affluent families, the terrorist pilot of Flight 93 owned a Mercedes Benz and was generously supported financially by his parents. There can never be a suggestion of moral equivalence, these horiffic acts were carried out because of hatred, pure and simple. We live in a free, open and pluralistic society and we must defend it, at all costs."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"Among the Heroes by Jere Longman tells the story of United 93 and its 911 highjacking. The writing itself is about as indepth as you would expect a sports writer to be, but this is an admirable effort for Longman to latch onto an important non-sports story. A portrait of practically every passenger is given via friends and family. Unfortunately it gives a 2 dimensional image of some of them along the lines of \\"He was a good man\\", \\"Very athletic, helpful, etc.\\"For me the most interesting passengers (i.e. the ones I felt I could relate to the most) were Jeremy Glick and Kristin Gould. Kristin was a writer/artist who lived among some icons of '60s literature (Thomas Pynchon) and music (Joan Baez, the Stones, Stevie Wonder, etc.)while Glick and a few others were into Eastern Philosophy.The book makes much of the coincidences from premonitions to the courage and strength of many passengers onboard, to the point where it's suggested this was fate, destiny. Only Joan Glick, Jeremy's mother sees that the \\"fate\\" idea takes responsibility from Airline security, the government, etc. Then again maybe it was inevitable for the negligence to exist that allowed 911. I mean OF COURSE airlines care more about money than security (pre-911). And another family member nails this idea in a comment about airline security singling her out: \\"too little, too late\\".And the father of one victim went to Afghanistan to meet with families who were innocent victims of the bombing there, which I feel is the ultimate in courage: to take such an unflinching stand for human rights while many Americans were reinforcing their rightwing anti-foreigner zealotry.And we even get a portrait of Ziad Jarrah, the suicide pilot who led the UA93 highjacking. Imagine how many people he fooled, including his own family as well as everyone he came in contact with in the US and Germany. We are given as much information about what went on during the flight as is known, from cell phone calls to the Flght Voice Recorder to Air Traffic Control.And of course the bottom line significance is that the passengers stopped the highjackers from hitting the Capital building (or the White House)."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"I just finished the book and obviously am overwhelmed as anyone would be. The heroism and courage of the passengers and crew go without saying. The story was inspiring and reflects the true depth of character of those aboard and their final sacrifice. That said, I could not help to feel in much of the book that I was invading the privacy of these courageous individuals and the manner in which some of the book is handled perhaps could have been handled differently. There were many, many details about the victims' lives, both years before September 11, the days leading up to it, and the day itself. At times I felt like there was almost too much detail that was really not necessary. I am not certain the details of some of them the day before and getting to the airport that day really have much relevance to the actual events aboard or the people they were. Is it really important to know who almost missed the flight but did not, who ended up getting on the flight by standby, or who had missed another missed flight only to end up on this one, and who had booked it for months? It almost plays to morbid curiosity that perhaps has little to no relevance about the actions on board. In a way, it became well, voyeuristic, in this regard. It made the theme almost too sensational or almost too commercialized. The various portions of the premonitions of some of the passengers and families I feel were handled poorly as well. As someone who is scared to fly, I have &quot;premonitions&quot; that my planes will crash almost every time before I get on one. I do not believe this is uncommon. Again, it bordered on the almost too sensational, the too voyeuristic. One passenger had such a premonition the night before but did not change the flight. Is it really pertinent to the actions taken on board and the sacrifice taken?This is the definitive book on Flight 93 for those interested and the theme of the book and what it reflects are extremely powerful and well done. Just be aware that the book contains a lot more information than you might really want to know or are comforable with knowing."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This book is a must read for all Americans. It made me realize how alive and well the spirit is in helping other people.All of the passengers and employees are heroes.This book tells how all of them worked together, it also helps us to know more about them.

You will be very glad that you bought this book."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"Among the Heroes, a documentary of United Flight 93, was a courageous and heartfelt book written about the fourth plane that went down on September 11, 2001, in Pennsylvania. Written by a reporter for the New York Times, Jere Longman, this book includes details of the 44 brave people who sacrificed everything to prevent the hijackers from succeeding in their mission. These men and women were true heroes in every sense of the word. Among the Heroes displays this message of hope beautifully through the interviews with the passengers' families and friends. It also includes bit and pieces of what was happening inside the plane athat fateful day. This book captured my attention because it was a whole new perspective. I have heard all about the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, but rarely heard of the plane crash in Pennsylvania. It is the plane that often gets overlooked. I gave this book four stars and would recommend it!"},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"As a friend of Mark Bingham, one of the men on board Flight 93 who helped bring that plane down, I have seen the focus in the media constantly revolving around the four men who stormed the cockpit. Those were the ones we kept hearing were the heroes. Jere Longman has done a wonderful job of showing how each person on board Flight 93 served the purpose of fighting the first fight in the war on terrorism.While some, like Mark, may have used their brawn and fearlessness to counterattack the terrorists, each individual on they plane served a vital role in this fight. Some were trained in dealing with people in trauma, while there were others who could make coffee, get sodas or items for passengers that needed things. Each person in their own way supported someone on that flight.Mr. Longman has brought insight to me, making me think about the other thirty-six passengers and flight crew besides the \\"Heroic Four.\\" I am grateful for his research and beautiful use of words to make what happened on that day to my friend and the others on board, a better rounded picture. I realize now that all forty of the passengers and flight crew were heroes.If you have any questions about what happened on Flight 93 and want to know more about the wonderful people who were lost on that plane, then I suggest you read this book. My hat goes off to you Mr. Longman."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"I can't even begin to imagine what went through the minds of the families and friends of those who died on United Flight 93 on Sept. 11. As I watched the news coverage, my heart went out to those people. We didn't know then what really happened on board Flight 93, what made the plane crash into a field in Shanksville, PA instead of the White House or the Capitol. After reading \`Among the Heroes,' I felt that I had a clearer picture of the course of events and the acts of bravery that the passengers exhibited. But even if we never know exactly what happened on board, we now feel we know these people, thanks to Longman.Through interviews with family and friends, Longman gives the reader a look into the lives of the passengers on Flight 93. In most cases, they were people just like you and me - people who had jobs, families, and friends. They had plans, dreams, and courage. They weren't perfect. Like all of us, they had their faults. But they weren't about to sit back and let the ends of their lives be dictated by terrorists.This is a gripping, honest, account of one part of the most terrible day in our history. Yet, it is also a tribute to the spirit of liberty that each of these bold Americans exhibited on that awful day. Forget movie celebrities, rock stars, and professional athletes. The passengers on Flight 93 redefine what the word hero means. There is no higher standard than the one they set. Let us honor them and never forget.280 pages"},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"I've read hundreds of books over the past few years, but none like \\"Among the Heroes: United Flight 93 and the Passengers and Crew Who Fought Back.\\" This, to say the least, is an incredibly phenomenal book which touches the deepest parts of the heart, mind and soul. There were countless times when I was brought to tears as I read this book - it is extremely moving.Jere Longman did an amazing job researching, interviewing, and writing this book. His way of showing us all that each of the individuals on United 93 were heroes is so elegantly done. Originally, four men - Todd Beamer, Mark Bingham, Tom Burnett and Jeremey Glick - were thought to have been the ones to fight back on United 93 on that dreadful day of September 11th, 2001, but we quickly learn, reading this book, that each and every one of the passengers were heroes in different ways. They all were put on that plane by the higher powers in this universe, for they each brought something which would help bring the terrorist down and reclaim our power.The mini-biographies of each of the crew members and passengers was extremely well-written and compiled in a manner which makes for an easy and enjoyable read. Of the countless books published on 9/11, I would have to say this is, by far, the best one. There is no other book which comes even remotely close to the caliber of this book."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"I liked how this book gave the reader a glimpse into the lives of each of the passengers and crew on board Flight 93.

It makes me sad that so many talented, caring individuals had to lose their lives the way they did."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"Without question, the most touching book I have ever read. Gives you a sense of who the passengers on this flight and their families were, and what they went through on that horrific day. The book doesn't sensationalize, and everything is presented very respectfully. There's a good deal of information on the events and on the hijackers that I hadn't previously read, which while tragic, I found very interesting. Be forewarned though, it is beyond sad - the conversations between the passengers and their loved ones in those last minutes are difficult to read. But without question, I would recommend the book to everyone..."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"I don't want to take anything away from every fireman and policeman that worked on Sept 11. Both the living and those that are gone, but, this book touched me much more that I thought that it would. What is fascinating to me is that among the souls on this flight, there was not one person who was going to sit meekly by and just let something happen. After reading about all of these amazing people, I just hope and pray that I would have half the courage that these real people had. I read this book in one sitting and I am suggesting that all of my friends and family read it as well. You cannot call these people average, there was not an average person on that plane, but they were put in an extraordinary situation and reacted with what one can only call extraordinary faith and hope."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"The book was very hard to read because everyone who is mentioned was killed. Reading about their families and life before getting on that plane brought tears to my eyes. Yet there were details in this book that I had not heard about such as, the plane being observed by other planes and reported to the air controller.It was the first time I had seen anything about any of the pilot's. As soon as I read about a person, I would move to the pictures and find that person.The people are brought to life while reading the book. The book brings back the horrific acts of 9-11 and the people that felt if they were going to die they would rather do it trying to gain control of the plane, than by flying into a building. They had the advantage of knowing what was going to happen gave them all an added drive to win."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This is a rather large biographical sketch of 40 people who were traveling on United flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco on 9/11/2001. As most people know, four Arab hijackers took control of the aircraft and turned it around aiming it in the direction of Washington D.C. The hijackers never made it to their intended target because probably 5-6 passengers decided they were going to take the aircraft back. The hijackers either lost control of the aircraft or plunged it into the ground.Almost all the passengers were detailed in this book. Many of them had made last minute phone calls to their loved ones to say good bye, and these were tear jerking moments to read. That is why I rated this book a four star. Most of the other material was rather pedestrian.The problem I have with this book is that the author leaves much of the material out about the probable struggle aboard the aircraft. Perhaps not much is known, but it would have been interesting knowing the possible scenarios. What we get is sweet memories from relatives of their lost ones on Flight 93.This should be known, but the struggle needs to more detailed in the book."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This was truly one of the best books i have ever read, the author does a fantastic job of describing each and every passenger, most to the point where you feel a very strongconnection to them.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book had all and more I was looking for. It takes the reader through a detailed account of every person on flight 93, what kind of person they were, and how they spent thier last minutes. This truly is a motivational book and makes you step back and realize how precious our own lives are. It made me appreciate more the people I see and love every day of my life. It helps you to never take for granted your life."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"I hardly know what to say about the events covered in this book for fear of trivializing a national tragedy. There is so much to say about the bravery and courage of the passengers and crew of Flight 93 and yet nothing that can be said to adequately honor them.Mr. Longman writes compelling prose but I suspect that the events he describes practically wrote themselves. To the bare facts of what we knew already about the passsengers and crew members, their names, etc., he has fleshed out each passenger, including the misquided murderers-- not that I care to know much about these bastards-- bringing them closer to us as real people. Some of the things you learn will break your heart. One passenger, for example, was flying to pick up the remains of a deceased family member. Another passenger collected refrigerator magnets wherever she travelled, something that was particularly poignant to me since I also collect magnets from places I've beenI bought this book after hearing the author interviewed on National Public Radio and read it straight through. Two things jumped out at me. First, several of the passengers and their families and friends had premonitions that they should not get on this flight. Secondly, other passengers changed flight plans at the last minute and boarded this flight because there were so many seats available.The flight contained all kinds of people: Caucasians, African Americans, a Puerto Rican-American, a gay man, a disabled person, a Japanese student, a Baptist married couple, old people young people, those folks on vacation, those on work assignments.Amid all this sorrow and carnage, the courage and bravery of these passengers shine through: the rushing of the highjackers, as we believe happened, the flight attendant heating water to pour on them, the strength those showed who made phone calls from the plane.I must say that the most horric thing I read was that had we not known better, it would seem that there were no passengers on the plane when it crashed into the field in Pennsylvania, that it was as if the plane had let all passengers off somewhere else, and, finally, that the official cause of death of these brave ones was listed as death by \\"fragmentation.\\" A chilling detail."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"Made a major heroic event into an uneventful tale of a hodgepodge of individuals and families whose identities get blurred and forgotten as the story/non-story evolves/devolves. Not nearly enough information about what the reader bought the book for in the first place, ie: the facts and nuts and bolts about what happened during that tragic/heroic/fateful day.The end was as anticlimactic as it possibly could be. Simply did not answer the questions I had and did not do the event justice."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This book had a tremendous impact and I read it almost without interruption. There are just so many connections here.Todd Beamer went to school at Wheaton with the son of a dear friend and his wife,Lisa was also an acquaintance. But, mostly, Don and Jean Peterson were good friends of ours. I cann't speak about the others, but it seems to me that those who were on that plane were exceptional people and it is only appropriate that their lives be remembered in a tribute such as this. Don and Jean were folks who spent their lives and resources helping others. Their lives were committed to serving their God and their fellow man in remarkable ways. I remember them fondly as do many, many others in their community.This book is the best one I have read about flight ninety three and it needs to be read often so that we who are alive may never forget that day"},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This book is a great story of the timeline of events that took place involving the passengers and crew aboard flight 93.

What I liked about the this book Longman, he does not try to a make one person efforts seems better than another, instead he tells the readers about the passangers and crew lives and these experences could make them able to deal with crisis. It is a great 9-11 book that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"I was across the street from the Pentagon on 9/11 when Flight 77 became another painful event in a very long morning. All during that week and ever since I have hoped that some writer or historian would make it their goal to document the lives of the innocent souls who were on each and every flight. Mr. Longman has done an excellent job in bringing all of us closer to the names listed on Flight 93. The information and pictures concerning the hijackers was disturbing, but it was also helpful in understanding the ease and access our country used to afford to foreign nationals. It is my hope that Mr. Longman takes the time to research and complete one more book that helps us all remember and honor the innocent passengers and crews of the other three flights."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This book was an excellant book to read. I enjoyed thoroughly. I received as a gift and finished reading within a week. I felt like i got to know the passengers, and their families.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mr. Longman took great care to paint an equal picture of all crew members and passengers on that plane, not just the 4 who supposedly stormed the cockpit (and after reading the book, were did we all come up with the notion that Todd Beamer led them and there were only 4?) If you find that you are tired of Lisa Beamer being held up by the media as the Poster Child of 9/11 Widows, Mr. Longman dedicated 2 or 3 pages of his book nobly trying to defend her.A great book. I was in tears and grateful to all 40 individuals on that plane who decided to fight against evil. We don't know what each one of them did, but I have no doubt they all did somethng, and each one earned the right to bear the title HERO."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"AMONG THE HEROES is the heart wrenching account of September 11, 2001 United Flight 93. It taps into that common bond we all share with each other. Jere Longman's chronicle of the flight's final moments evokes the natural question we ask of ourselves, \\"How would I have dealt with the few moments prior to my own immolation?\\" As readers we also naturally empathize with the survivors' emotional pain and may also ask ourselves how would we react if a loved one were on that doomed flight.Longman did a very creditable job of handling the question of heroism and the conjectured roles the passengers and crew played. Some people have wanted to elevate a few into a super-hero status thereby implying the other passengers and crew members were deficient in courage and honor. Longman was able to explain and defuse this sensitive issue by emphasizing everyone's courage in the face of certain death. The reader can see what these otherwise ordinary and common citizens thought by revealing the content of phone calls placed during the take-over and prior to the devastating crash. Longman describes the sense of teamwork and camaraderie that quickly developed among these strangers in the face of overwhelming danger and extreme urgency.AMONG THE HEROES is an inspiring tribute to a group of fellow Americans. We can only imagine how different our country and the world would be if this fourth suicidal terrorist mission had not been stopped. We owe them all are deepest gratitude."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"a tribute to heroes, indeed. this book exemplifies the courage shown by 40+ heroic americans on that fateful day in September.

It also puts you in their place on the plane that fateful day."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"Longman has done such a lovely job of celebrating the &quot;heroes&quot; of United Flight 93, that one wishes he (or someone) would do the same for the passengers of the other planes that went down that awful day. Perhaps their stories are less dramatic, but let's not forget them. They may not have fought back (and how are we to know that some of them did not?) but they deserve tribute. There is so much detail here about each person on the plane (perhaps at times too much info, a minor quibble) that I really felt I had gotten to know them. How much harder it was, then, to read about the inevitable outcome of the flight. A sad, but rewarding read."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"I heard the author interviewed on National Public Radio recently, bought the book immediately and read it straight through. I hardly know what to say about the book lest I trivialize such a horrible event in our nation's history. Mere words become cliches in the face of such courage and bravery of the passangers and crew of United Flight 93.Two things jumped out at me when I read this book. First, several of the passengers and/or friends or relatives had premonitions that they should not take this flight. Second, many of the passengers changed their flight plans at the last minute and got on this plane because there were so many empty seats.I was also taken by the diversity of those aboard. (After all, wasn't that one of the problems of the misguided monsters, that they did not believe in the diversity of the U. S.?) There were Caucasians, African Americans, a Puerto-Rican American, a Japanese student, a gay man, a married Baptist couple, Jewish folk, a disabled person, older people, young people, people on vacation, others on work assignments.The book is extremely well written although I suspect that it almost wrote itself. I do not mean to take anything away from Mr. Longman, but a writer would have to work hard to make such a tragic event uninteresting. He includes photographs of the crew and passengers and fleshes out their lives. One passenger is on his way to pick up the remains of a loved one. Another passenger we find out collects refrigerator magnets from cities she has visited, a fact that made we smile since I have the same quirk.Although these 40 people lost their lives, they did not go gentle. From the flight attendant who boiled water to throw on these devils to the other passengers who apparently stormed the cockpit, surely they are the best of our country's best citizens. There are goverment officials walking around Washington today who most assuredly owe their lives to these valiant passengers and crew.One final thing. The people who got to the plane after it crashed in that field in Pennsylvania said that had they not known better, they would have thought the plane was empty, that it was as if the plane had made a previous landing and let off all the passengers. And I learned a chilling new phrase. The official cause of death of these passengers and crew was \\"death by fragmentation.\\"It is fitting that someone in this book compared the resting place of these good people to Gettysburg.

Such were the men and women on Flight 93. In \\"Among the Heroes: United Flight 93 and the Passengers and Crew Who Fought Back\\" we read the details and facts of people who rose from being mere travellers to heroes to be reckoned with.Todd Beamer and the rest were not intending to die, nor did they expect to be heroes. Give a chance to think twice, who knows what they might've done. But they thought once, did what needed to be done, and showed us the spirit of Paul Revere is not lost in the late 1700s, but is awake in this generation. And that the valor of Bunker Hill, the courage of men who did not shoot until they saw the whites of their opponents' eyes... Beamer and company pressed through the odds against their success. Not just Beamer, though he is now the best known of the heroic team.In forcing a plane to crash, they raised the American flag higher into the sky than it had seen in many decades. And, in the case of Beamer, it showed that a man of deep Christian faith was willing to give his life that others may live, an example for all Christians worldwide.The details of the book bring reality to a story too easy to make into a myth. There was a real plane over a real field, and real people hijacked it, and real people were killed in the process.

He said he tried to focus more on the lives of the passengers of United Flight 93 - not as much on their deaths. So, I decided to give it a shot and ordered the book.Once I started reading, I literally could not put it down. It was wonderful to gain an understanding of who the people were that fate placed on that particular flight. I valued the author's effort to provide a glimpse into their lives through the lens of familiy members and friends. Although, it didn't feel like voyeurism at all. Instead, it felt like attending a memorial service - a celebration of life and of the American spirit.The personal memories were touching, but the book was balanced with factual information on the events leading up to the crash in Shanksville. It was difficult to read the specifics about phone calls that were made by the passengers and crew, their attempts to gather facts on the other hijacked planes, and the tender goodbyes to their loved ones. However, it is the type of book that helps you examine your priorities and reflect on relationships in your life."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"\\"Among the Heroes\\" by Jere Longman examines the ordinary lives of the passengers and crew onboard hijacked United Flight 93, and their extraordinary attempt to regain control of the plane once they learned from friends and family via cellphone and Airfone that commercial planes were being used as missiles against American cities.I normally would have read this book in one sitting. But it's hard to read while your eyes are filled with tears. \\"Among the Heroes\\" is a heartwarming yet heartbreaking tale of courage and grace."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"I recently read the book, &quot;Among the Heroes&quot;, by Jere Longman. Through multiple interviews and various news accounts the author attempts to create a chronological account of the horrific journey. His words enable me to feel as though I know the Passengers and Crew of Flight 93 personally. Stopping far short of crediting any particular person or persons, he paints a picture that forces the reader to realize each and every one of them was, indeed, heroic. Longman leaves many questions unanswered, admitting we will never know exactly what happened. Nonetheless, the book, or the [real-life] characters within, left me in awe. Within two days I had traveled to Shanksville, PA, the site of the crash. Read the book. You'll be lending it out to friends-- I nearly guarantee it."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"Throughout American history, otherwise ordinary people have displayed extraordinary courage when in life-threatening situations. The tragic events of September 11th offer a number of examples. The most publicized involves those aboard United flight 93 which crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. While huddled to the rear of the plane, several called loved ones; Todd Beamer spoke at length with an GTE-Verizon operator and, together, they recited the Lord's Prayer. She then heard Beamer ask \\"Are you guys ready? Let's roll!\\" By then, Beamer and his fellow passengers knew the fate of the other three skyjacked planes and rushed the cockpit. The plane crashed. Everyone aboard died.What we have here is a combination of transcriptions of cell phone calls and the \\"black box\\" tapes, mini-biographies, obituaries, reminiscences by the victims' relatives and friends, and Longman's own highly skillful analysis of what he learned during his extensive research. It is possible but unlikely that much more information about specific developments during the flight will be forthcoming. Lisa Beamer has already written one book and, over time, I think others among the victims' relatives and friends will also share their own thoughts and feelings about the impact on them following the crash of United flight 93.A chronicle such as this helps to give \\"human faces\\" to the victims' names. The same is true of a special section {\\"A Nation Challenged\\") which the New York Times published each day from September 15th until February 5th. A total of 1,800 \\"portraits of grief\\" were eventually featured. (This material is now available in a single volume, Portraits of 9/11/01: The Collected \\"Portraits of Grief\\" from the New York Times.) Obviously, heroism was demonstrated by so many people throughout and following the four skyjackings. The general public knows almost nothing about what happened aboard the first three flights and not much more about the fourth. For example, at what point did at least some of 93's passengers decide to rush the cockpit? Assuming Beamer was their leader, who else accompanied him? Then what happened? What aboiut the United flight crew? For me, such details are far less significant than the fact that people very much like those with whom I have traveled on numerous flights over the years became \\"citizen soldiers\\" and responded courageously to what must have been a terrifying crisis. Because of Longman's book and the \\"portraits of grief,\\" it is possible to appreciate what Stephen Ambrose has characterized as \\"uncommon valor.\\""},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"This extremely well-written and well-paced book should be an inspiration to all as we approach the first anniversary of that tragic day. Written with great care and with an eye to the families of the dead, Jere Longman has woven together the lives of these men and women with the minutes of the tragedy of their final flight. Not only do we get to know the passengers but Longman also gives us a full chapter about the hijackers....after all, they were part of the picture, too. And in graphic detail he minces no words when it comes to the plane crash and aftermath itself.The author's narrative spins back and forth between the passengers, their histories, their families and the actual time of flight......the final hijacking segment lasted a mere half hour. During that time numerous phone calls were made from the plane to loved ones....some saying good-bye, some expressing fear, some calmness.....all apprehensive. I'm a little uncomfortable about the author's discussion with regard to the word heroes, however. Certainly there were brave people on that flight who attempted to right the hijacker's wrong and in doing so gave up their lives and saved many other lives on the ground. But the word \\"hero\\" has become a little confusing these days. Would people who were certain their plane would go down in a thunderstorm as it raced toward a populated area be called heroes after their plane crashed? Was everyone on United flight 93 a hero? I understand the sensitivity of this particular flight and how it affected us as a nation, but I still wonder about that word and its usage.This book should be read by everyone. I highly recommend it and commend the author, Jere Longman, for his ability to tell this story in a way that is unnerving and comforting."},{"Title":"Among the Heroes","review":"As a dispatcher from Westmoreland County 911, I waited for this book. It was a worthwhile wait. Following Jere's details of the accounts I can personally verify, I am certain of the amount of time he has spent and the extra mile he has gone to get all the details. The heroes of Flight 93 deserve to have their story told by a caring author who is attentive to the details surrounding their efforts, and this has been accomplished. While everyone who was involved with or witnessed the incidents that occurred on September 11, 2001 certainly could not begin to believe what was unfolding, this book puts you up close to the individuals involved with Flight 93, those who witnessed the plane prior to the crash, those on the plane, and the families affected.

Every passenger and the hijackers. It's amazing how many people had premonitions before they took that flight. Some had changed from a 10:00 flight to the earlier 8:00 flight. Some were afraid to fly. The author brings each person to life, to appreciate the tremendous loss of so many that day. Almost every passenger was a type A personality. There was immense talent and courage onboard and after reading the accounts of their lives, it's clear to see why they went down fighting. Every person's story was compelling from Todd Beamer's to Nicole Miller's. Nicole had tried to get on another flight that morning with her boyfriend as she was apprehensive about flying. His flight was booked so he tried to get on her flight but it was too expensive. The what ifs could drive you crazy. Warning: You won't be able to put it down. We've heard that saying \\"It's a small world,\\" and the author proves it at the very beginning tying different passengers and their families together in unusual ways. The author has done a tremendous job of compiling facts and loved ones accounts to make this a book I will remember for a very long time."},{"Title":"The Long Way Home","review":"Upon first impression, Jaxton Anderson is a character you'll love to hate. His city-bred arrogance and selfishness gets under the skin of the reader as well as character, Ami Martin. In his eyes, Ami is just some attractive but obstinate country girl, quite unlike the more sophisticated girls he undoubtedly knows in the city. In fact, the sooner he fulfills the mission his father sent him on, the sooner he can leave hicksville and head back to the real action that he's missing out on. Were it not for the author's ability to allows us to know what he is feeling in honest and direct ways so that we can feel the nausea he feels when he is confronted by his own sin and depravity, we would continue to dislike him. However, his charms win over more than just Ami in this romance.Jaxton's best laid plans are waylaid when he meets his grandfather again after many years. Finding him in an old and decrepit house does much to convince him that there is no gold mine waiting here. But the \\"gold\\" is not in wealth or riches, but strength of character as Jaxton slowly learns. His grandfather stands for trust, compassion, and genuine love for his fellow neighbour. Will Jaxton stick around long enough to learn the wisdom his grandfather has to share? Will he learn that love and friendship can define a family more than blood and inheritance? That personal character is more valuable than earthly possessions? Will good old fashioned hard work alongside the lovely and determined Ami Martin break down the defenses of his heart so he can experience true love and a deep faith?Staci Stallings writes with a wit and humour possessed by few. Her characters are strong, likable and easy to relate to. They inspire the reader to strive for more in our own lives. The wisdom and noble compassion of the grandfather remind us of the desire we have for a wise grandfatherly figure like Mr. S. in our own lives. The dreams shared by Ami are ones which make the reader reconsider whether we are dreaming big enough for with God all things are possible.This author has many beautifully created phrases and descriptive images that remind one of a chocolate wafer you want to savor and taste over and over. For example:\\"Heaven wrapped around him for a moment as his gaze traveled through the trees right into the arms of God Himself, and an undeniable peace filled the room.\\" (The Long Way Home, pg. 234)I would have liked to have seen full reconciliation between Mr. Snyder (the grandfather) and his own children, but perhaps that would have crossed the line from believable into contrived. Clearly, this novel shows that sometimes the choices we make are wrong or too late and we can only hope to make things right on the other side in heaven.This delightful and spunky novel will have you reading from cover to cover. I had shivers of delight rolling up my spine several times as I devoured page after page. This novel leaves you sighing and reliving the love story in your mind. Surely Staci Stallings is one of the leading authors of inspirational romance today!"},{"Title":"The Long Way Home","review":"The beauty of the rolling hills of the Kansas Foot Hills is initially lost on Jaxton Anderson. He only wants to fulfill his task and be on his way. His grandfather's recent heart attack has led the family to inquire regarding his grandfather's will and related worth of his ranch. Jaxon's resolve to quickly return to his \\"real life\\" in Chicago soon gives way to something more, however, when a foolish decision forces self-examination and self-honesty. Further, seeing neighboring Ami Martin's need inspires him to growth beyond his wildest imagination. Now Jaxton finds himself torn between the father and the life he left behind, and a place and a woman that claims his heart.When her own grandfather died, it was Jaxon's grandfather who encouraged Ami Martin to fulfill her dream. Her grandfather's home is the only home she has ever known. Unfortunately, her father intends to sell it out from under her. Nevertheless, Ami dreams of transforming the property into a bed and breakfast -- a place of romance and beauty for the world-weary. Jaxton initially represents the city and the values Ami abhors. But when he insists upon making restitution, and then continues to help her to realize her dreams, they both learn to leave behind the bitterness and disillusionment that encumbers their lives.Author Staci Stallings creates an inspirational romance in THE LONG WAY HOME that proves that a romance need not contain graphic sex to provide a beautiful story. Jaxton is a flawed hero, guilty of tragic mistakes, who grows to someone extraordinary. Ami struggles issues with self-esteem, family, and economics to come to believe in hope and dreams. Ordinary struggles with pain of destructive family relationships, struggles with self-esteem, and financial challenges lend heart-rending yet realistic challenges. Further, themes of transformation and redemption provide a spiritual foundation without overwhelming the narrative. Indeed, the author gives the novel a heart of goodness amidst the flaws that make us human. THE LONG WAY HOME earns the WordWeaving Award for Excellence."},{"Title":"The concept of law","review":"One of the most important books written in the field of jurisprudence and legal philosophy. A must-read for anyone who wants to talk intelligently about the topic. Each of Dr. Hart's chapters has been the springboard for entire areas of discussion since its publication, such as law as a system of rules, the separation of law and morality, etc. After you finish this book, read Prof. Dworkin's critique in &quot;The Model of Rules,&quot; 35 Univ.Chi.L.Rev. 14 (1967) (excerpted in &quot;The Philosophy of Law&quot;) and Prof. Dworkin's &quot;Taking Rights Seriously&quot; to see how Hart's theories have affect jurisprudential scholarship since the publication of this text in 1961. Again, if one had to select the top thinkers in the field, it's Austin, Hart, and Dworkin."},{"Title":"The concept of law","review":"Hart takes apart the legal positivism of Austin and acknowledges some validity in natural law theory. But Hart fails to connect the \\"minimum content of natural law\\" with his analysis of a \\"rule of recongition\\" that allows a legal system to exist.Hart's critique of Austin's legal positivism is right on and rightly consigns it to the dust bin as a way of explaining all manifestations of the phenomenon of law. Law as a threat backed up by force simply cannot explain contracts, wills, and trusts. The law doesn't just threaten people, it also empowers them. Positivism also fails to acknowledge the \\"internal\\" aspect of legal rules as well as failing to give an account of how law is recognized, clarified, and changed. Hart posits a \\"rule of recongition\\" to take care of this. Hart acknowledges a \\"minimum content of natural law\\" that explains the purpose of law as responding to certain human needs (bodily vulnerability, limited altruism, etc.). This gave rise to the revival of natural law theory in Anglophone jurisprudence in the 20th century. But Hart just kind of sticks the natural law chapter in his book without saying how it connects to the rest of what he says about legal rules and systems. Look at Finnis' Natural Law and Natural Rights for the \\"extension\\" of Hart's project."},{"Title":"The concept of law","review":"I write this review from the view point of a lay reader generally interested in law, justice and political philosophy.I found this book very lucid, well organized and comprehensive. Hart presents concept of a law in a descriptive manner as it is generally practiced. He develops the concept with comparing and differentiating it from commands and orders. He then traces its development from simple primitive societies to the complex realities of our times. He proposes that laws are union of,i) rules which govern individual behaviour and: ii) rules for making such rules.He also discusses relationship of law with morals and cocerns of substantive versus formal justice in a legal system.The book acknowledges prevalence of various conceptions of law in different societies but does not make any value judgement about them.This edition contains a post script in which Hart has replied to his critics. I found this portion rather technical and think that it can be safely skipped by a general reader.I recommend this book to any one interested in understanding cotemporary concept of law and legal system."},{"Title":"The concept of law","review":"That this book is considered important is an indictment of the law school community. Labored writing, weak analysis, all combined with a fatuous tone."},{"Title":"The concept of law","review":"As abstruse as this book can be, it deals with a simple question. What is law? Conventionally, to speak of \`the law' is to refer to a particular genus of rules involving the exercise of political sovereignty for social control {as opposed to the \`laws' of natural physics, etiquette, or provincially defined systems of rules (e.g. sports, games)}. Still a more precise definition of law has largely eluded legal philosophers, who have -- akin to physicists' pursuit for a unified theory of reality (TOE), labored to deduce their own uniform definition of law. However HLA Hart, like legal realist Karl Llewellyn before him, embraces a different approach to jurisprudence. For Hart, law is a protean, multifarious system that both colloquially and operationally encompasses too many socio-political phenomena for one definition. Jurists can chase down the \`essence of law', but upon lassoing the concept within one's definition, the haul proves either incomplete or unfamiliar in conceptualizing it. As Hart notes, the legal landscape poses many grey areas and borderline aspects, which require legal philosophies to contort their theories to fit the phenomena rather than vice versa. The stretch marks that result expose an unsound theory. Karl Llewellyn summarizes well:\\"The difficulty in framing any concept of \\"law\\" is that there are so many things to be included, and the things to be included are so unbelievably different from each other. Perhaps it is possible to get them all under one verbal roof. But I do not see what you have accomplished if you do. For a concept, as I understand it, is built for a purpose. It is a thinking tool...\\"So while jurisprudence stumbles to place law \\"under one verbal roof\\", the point of the exercise is to not to define law, but understand it: and that which defines law confines it. Hart's tome focuses early and often in picking apart jurisprudential theories which fail to facilitate our understanding of law. Principal among these is the \\"imperative theory\\" of John Austin. In fact, to properly understand Hart's Concept of Law, it is advisable to read Austin's The Province of Jurisprudence Determined -- the object of many of Hart's animadversions to devising a \\"uniform definition\\" of law. But to summarize tersely, Austin conceived law as the commands from a political superior (sovereign) that threaten punitive sanctions should an actor not obey.Hart perceives a few problems with this imperative theory of law. Firstly, Hart contends that the imperative theory does not properly account for the private law of \\"power conferring rules\\" -- i.e. rules structuring contracts, wills, and the creation of other rights, instead focusing provincially on the public law of penal statutes. The private law does not pose \`punitive sanctions', in that failure to comply with contract simply results in nullification of the instrument, not punitive repercussions. Perhaps more importantly, Hart also notes that there are many laws which impose legal obligations upon the sovereign themselves (executive, legislator, and courts). This phenomenon is inconsistent with the imperative theory's definition of sovereign as the institution which has no legal obligation to follow the law. In response, Austin and others have contrived qualifications and alterations to the theory to explain these phenomena (See Chapter III). But once more, Hart calls these qualifications what they are --fictions to resuscitate an incomplete definition of law. What results is \\"distortion at the price of uniformity.\\"Legal philosophy suffers the complexities of any ontological pursuit. Struggling to ascertain the category of being for a complex phenomenon, to ask \\"what is law?\\" is akin to asking, \\"what is art?\\" or, \\"what is time?\\" These concepts may or may not have a discernable intrinsic property absent which they lose their essence. But to insist on identifying such a property simply for the sake of ontological neatness does more harm than good. Thus the \\"obscuring vice\\" of over-simple theories of law, Hart contends, is that in its designs to ferry the concept to a uniform definition, they jam all the occupants into one car to arrive there. The result is a crammed, uncomfortable trip for us the citizens -- who if given their choice, would never have undertaken the journey in this manner. This is the \\"distortion\\" that Hart references. Even if a theory successfully achieves a uniform conceptualization of law, its conceptual clarity satisfies itself and little else -- it still fails as an optimal, comprehensive understanding of what law actually is and how it actually operates.For example, the imperative theory of law would conceive the private law of contracts in terms of its sanction -- either to the party who breaches the contract or to the official who fails to enforce it. But that is not how the parties themselves, or the population generally, would describe the contractual arrangement. Any theory of law which only focuses parochially on the point of violation misses the point: \\"The principal functions of the law as a means of social control are not to be seen in private litigation or prosecutions, which represent vital but still ancillary provisions for the failures of the system. It is to be seen in the diverse ways in which the law is used to control, to guide, and to plan life out of court.\\"Instead, Hart offers a more humble jurisprudence, and as Llewellyn did before him, does not expound a definition but rather a conceptual polestar: a point of reference that provides \\"explanatory power\\" in our understanding of law, rather than a Webster's dictionary entry. This is \\"the fresh start\\" that Hart insists jurisprudence needs. Observing law as more complex than the state's technical form of coercion or a \`command and control' modality, Hart sets forth his own theory of law in Chapter V. In Hart's view, law consists of two interrelated forms of rules. The first species of rules (primary rules) consist of those that impose duties or obligations upon the physical behavior of the actor (e.g. regulatory statutes). The second species of rules consist of those that delineate who may produce, modify, or extinguish primary rules (e.g. governmental constitutions). Most traditional jurisprudence conflate both forms of rules as \`primary' directives bearing sanctions.For Hart, with the exception of primitive communities \\"closely knit by ties of kinship, common sentiment, and belief\\", secondary rules are essential for effectuation of primary rules. In the form of a \`rule of recognition', secondary rules delineate which political agent or instrumentality is to be accorded either the social approval of authority or, in modern societies, the appellation of law. Article I of the American Constitution as a secondary rule, for example, specifies that Congress is the authority which may issue laws. Secondary rules may also identify which political agent or instrumentality may amend, extinguish, enforce, or adjudicate laws. Primary rules are therefore derivative and dependent upon these secondary rules. Secondary rules do not bear sanctions, but instead require common social acceptance for their vibrancy. Rather than rush headlong into a definition, Hart states that it is the nexus between primary and secondary rules that offers optimal understanding of law: sufficiently accounting for all that which the \`uniform concepts of law' do not: \\"We shall not indeed claim that wherever the word \`law' is \`properly' used this combination of primary and secondary rules is to be found...we accord this union of elements a central place because of their explanatory power in elucidating the concepts that constitute the framework of legal thought.\\" So to summarize Hart's jurisprudence, it is the union of primary rules and secondary rules which provides the most fertile ground for understanding the nature of law.The latter half of Hart's treatise concerns the \`is vs. ought' controversy of legal philosophy that has spawned (approximately) two of its most famous doctrinal schools: natural law and legal positivism. While conceding that morality ubiquitously infuses the content of every legal system, Hart sides with the positivists in asserting that there is no inherent nexus between law and morality in the existence of a legal system. In other words, morality is an incidental rather than necessary component of legal systems. Natural Law asserts, however, that a legal system must contain a minimum degree of moral force without which the society upon which the legal system depends will eventually dissolve: \\"there are certain rules of conduct which any social organization must contain if it is to be viable.\\"Hart concedes that law must protect its constituent members in order to function, which he terms the \\"minimum content of natural law,\\" and which comprise \\"the minimum forms of protection for persons, property, and promises which are similarly indispensable features of municipal law.\\" But Hart claims that this minimum content of law is neither inherent to a legal system (e.g. international law - where such protections are often flaccid exhortations), nor a \`fact' about law. Instead, Hart claims that contingent upon the social conditions akin to a Hobbesean state of nature, only then is this minimum content \\"a natural necessity\\" of law. Lastly, Hart cautions that this natural necessity is not a normative one, in that it is still descriptive of what legal systems have for their self-preservation without entering the realm of \`ought'. To vindicate his positivist membership however, Hart spends a full chapter restating the club ethos: laws need not have a certain moral character in order to be legally valid. Men may obey laws for non-moral reasons, while sovereigns and officials alike will enforce laws which contravene settled moral principles. To state that law derives much of its content from greater social morality is to give up no ground - such an assertion refers to a historical reality rather than a necessary condition of legality.I didn't give this book five stars for two reasons. Firstly, both its content and style remain elusive to most readers. Legal theory is arcane enough -- but when verbalized in the pedantic prose of a legal philosopher, the readability is only exacerbated. Moreover, in the quest to rid every germane term of its conceptual baggage, these terms become loaded dirty words -- pregnant with nuance, stipulated definition, and their own conceptual baggage. Check your conventional understandings of what \`rule', \`law', \`command', \`punishment', \`moral', or \`sovereign' mean at the door, for books of this kind will take a scrub brush to your lexicon. So get ready for some semantic hair-splitting, which unfortunately, is necessary for the exercise. In addition to the recondite quality of the content and style of this book, I think modern legal theory has nothing but academic significance (and that is putting it nicely) -- particular in the post New Deal regulatory state where much sovereignty has been delegated to a hydra-headed regime of administrative agencies. Consequently, I would recommend this book only to people acutely interested in the matter.The second reason is that Hart's discussion of law and morality is far from convincing. Setting up a straw man argument for the Natural Law proponents, Hart does not adequately address the more sophisticated forms of Natural Law theory. Rebuffing classic teleological Natural Law is an easy task, as most concede that there is a qualitative difference between the invalidity of a law and its immorality. Few still adhere to the Thomist \\"Lex iniusta non est lex\\" conception of natural law, where a law is only the political integuments of an underlying moral precept. Nevertheless, many still contend that law bears an inherently \`evaluative' character as to the object of its regulation. This is really only to say that law serves some normative end, which is to say even less: one cannot understand law as written without recourse to -- (gasp!) extra-legal normative considerations. Remembering that Hart's principal objective is to facilitate understanding of law, I found his discussion of law and morals unsatisfying -- not as to the argument itself but rather its insufficient exposition of the positivist stance. That is why I consider Hart's curt postscript (towards the tail end of the book), which address Dworkin's criticism of positivism, my favorite part of the book. As the semantic squabbles between the 'is' and 'ought' camps of jurisprudence seems only a definitional gripe, which in contemporary legal philosophy appears all the more trivial as the sides have edged even closer on common ground, perhaps Hart's most important contribution remains toppling the imperative theory of law - not criticizing natural law."},{"Title":"The concept of law","review":"\\"The Concept of Law\\" has inspired a vast library of commentary. Ideas fly from every page. It uses a few simple concepts -- primary and secondary rules, internal and external points of view, etc. -- to build a sophisticated model of law as something different from morality or coercion. Bottomline: Modern analytical philosophy of law started with \\"The Concept of Law.\\" It's short and great. Anyone interested in law, ethics or political philosophy should read it."},{"Title":"The concept of law","review":"A must-read for any and all law students (along with Dworkin's \\"Law's Empire\\"). Both are pre-eminent jurisprudence scholars of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The concept of law","review":"This is a fairly intractable philosophical examination of the questions: what defines a legal system, what provides a legal system with legitimacy, and what are the origins of law.The author is inexcusably verbose and convoluted in discussing these otherwise interesting and important questions. If your professor has assigned this book, well, you have no choice. Otherwise, I'd recommend curling up with verbatim copies of the U.S. Constitution, The Declaration of Independence, The Federalist Papers and/or the Magna Carta, as more productive & fascinating ways to spend hours contemplating the history and meaning of the law."},{"Title":"The concept of law","review":"Hart insists that there are many differen kinds of rules - he only 'elucidetes social rules' -but he also accepts that not all legal rules are social rules.

I had no idea what the book looked like, or what exactly it contained, but I didn't care. Being a die hard Kiss fan for several years now, I figured I'd get my money's worth. I wound up getting that and then some. This book, cowritten by Curt Gooch and Jeff Suhs is absolutely incredible. This is a Kiss fans dream come true; I've never seen anything like it. Everything you could possibly ask for is here. Details of every Kiss tour and every individual concert are explained in great detail. Insightful comments are given from members of Kiss' management, and others close to the band, as well as an occasional comment from band members themselves. And don't get me started on the pictures....Some of these have never been printed before until now, for example a picture of Ace right after one of his infamous car accidents which left his face in bad shape. This picture has him in makeup, but only half of his face is painted due to the injury. Casual fans are saying \\"what's the big deal?\\" but ... hard Kiss fans know that this type of stuff is just plain cool. Every set list for every show is included, as are the name of the venues and opening and headlining acts that shared the bills with Kiss. 288 pages, 3 pounds, it's a monster! God knows how long it will take me to get through the whole thing, but one thing is for sure.... this is must have for any Kiss fan. Hear the REAL stories behind every concert, things that you may have never heard before and may shock you! All in all, this is a great pick up for any Kiss fan, especially fans who purchased the box set and enjoyed the book that came along with it. I would compare it to this in the fact that they are both extremely informative and chock full of great photos of the band. So, if you're a true member of the Kiss Army, stop reading this and go get the book NOW. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History","review":"Over the years, there have been various books written about KISS. Some by journalists, some by those close to the band, and some by the band themselves.This book is by far the best book yet about KISS. The amount of work and research put into this book is just mindblowing. They manage to track down and have stats on nearly every single KISS live show ever performed.If you're a fan and have never read a book about the band, start here. If you've ever considered getting a book about the band, this is the only book you'll ever need."},{"Title":"Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History","review":"What a missed opportunity the members of KISS must be feeling now. I am sure that they had a chance to make this an official KISS book - but chose to discount the efforts to two enthusiastic fans simply wanting to document a band that they hold in such high regard. All the while, thinking of course that they could do it better. Only time will tell to see if \\"KISS\\" can produce a more thorough and well-documented history. The book is absolutely the \\"best collective history\\" of the band that I have read. The time and effort it took to research, check facts, compile and finally write this book is evident in the accuracy of the facts. The mere thank you and credits to people who assisted the authors in compiling the data - speaks to the accuracy itself. True KISS connoisseurs will recognize the value of the book - don't wait to add this book to your collection."},{"Title":"Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History","review":"I simply recommend buying 2 copies of this book...one for 'keepsake' and one to keep next to your computer or nightstand as your day-to-day ultimate reference source. You've got questions, this book got THE answers. I found it highly amusing when Paul Stanley responded to this book by saying \\"No, I haven't read it but the \\"ultimate\\" KISS book? I think that the ultimate KISS book still needs to be written and that can only be done by us\\"......How about; \\"I am deeply honored that 2 loyal KISS fans dedicated 5 years of their life to do something that no one else has ever attempted to do, which is to precisely and accurately document every day of our life\\".....Anyway, this book doesn't need the praise or comments of KISS. It'll prove itself by becoming the best selling KISS book and deservedly so! The combination of FACTS, more than 100 credible testimonials and never before seen photos make this one of the most unique, sincere, \\"real\\" and valuable KISS products in the 30-year history of the band. Not owning this book is denying yourself the single best opportunity to 'finally' understand it all!"},{"Title":"Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History","review":"Let me first say that I loved KISSTORY. I bought mine in New Orleans during one of the Farewell Tours and it's autographed by all four band members. But this book is outstanding. Anyone will tell you that 'official' biographies never tell the whole story and I believe that these guys have really done their research. The sources are credible and the stories are sometimes outrageous, sometimes insightful, sometimes revealing. This book gives you more than just a run-down of Kiss mythology. It shows how much effort and dedication it took to make Kiss a great rock and roll band - and it puts the breakdown in greater clarity. These guys were on the road constantly. Stories are told by people who were there. It's all firsthand knowledge and it will appeal greatly to not only Kiss fans, but anyone with an interest in life on the road. It's just a good read. I like the format, there are some great photos and - best of all - it was done just beyond the reach of anyone who could edit away the 'warts.' This book proves something I've always suspected - The Kiss story is far more interesting than Simmons' ego will allow to be revealed. Buy this book today."},{"Title":"Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History","review":"It's obvious that an enormous amount of effort & research went into this book, and it will undoubtedly answer many questions KISS fans might have about the band's touring history (dates / setlists etc.). Tons of cool/rare pictures and quotes from the KISS crew make this book a wonderful read and great value for money. Get this and the authorized book &quot;KISS-Behind The Mask&quot; and you'll have the most detailed, comprehensive, accurate KISStory currently on the market. Don't pass this off as a book with just dates and setlists - it really is much more than that. I own just about every book ever released about the band, and &quot;KISS Alive Forever&quot; was one of the best additions to that collection. The authors are currently working on a follow up - &quot;KISS Out on the Streets 1973-1976&quot; and even if that one turns out only half as well as &quot;KISS Alive Forever&quot;, I'd still consider it a worthwile purchase. Since this book's content spans the entire history of the band (well, at least up until 2002) I'd highly recommended it to *all* KISS fans out there - this is one cool book."},{"Title":"Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History","review":"For anyone who has experienced the live performance of the phenomenon we know as KISS, whether in you were in Queens, NY in 1973, Lubbock, TX in 1990 or even Phoenix, AZ in 2000...this is a MUST HAVE.The book is well researched with detail about every show on every tour.

All to get the latest info on the more than 1800 concerts that Kiss has played to date. Written in very easy english, the book is more like a reference guide to all the concerts the band has played, but under most dates you will find little text add-ons that are delightful. The authors interviewed tour managers, roadies, pyro techs, wardrobe ladies, managers, producers, and muscicians who tell great stories from the early and not so early days. To top it up, there's more than 200 amazing shots of the band, some we have seen, some rather obscure.In all, a great book."},{"Title":"Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History","review":"I have been looking forward to this book since I first heard about it 6 or 7 years ago, and it has exceeded my high expectations. It is filled with great photos, facts, and stories spanning KISS' entire career. Once I pick it up, I can't put it down for hours at a time. Those who have complaints about claimed inaccuracies or things that they think are missing should contact the authors. This book was significantly based on fan contributions and they acknowledge that this is something of a &quot;work in progress.&quot; I have a sneaking suspicion that one day there will be a revised edition or a companion book."},{"Title":"Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History","review":"This book has all the facts and figures about Kiss concerts that I've never read anywhere else.It tells you the dates of each show, how much capacity the arena holds, what the attendance figures were, what songs were sung at most shows, in the order in which they were performed. It also has interviews with some touring personnel and their memories of the tour and/or show.I really appreciated the end of the book that has all the songs Kiss has ever performed, the first and last time they performed the song (Hard Luck Woman was ever only performed during an 11 day period in 1976 and NOT during the three Forum shows that were recorded for Alive II. Some songs were only ever performed once, others only in other countries).It breaks each tour down by album, tells you the biggest shows by attendance, all of their opening acts, who Kiss opened up for. It is packed with tons of information you never hear Gene and Paul talk about.A must for any Kiss fan or anyone who enjoys the behind the scenes happenings of a major rock act."},{"Title":"Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History","review":"I have read it and then re-read it again and again.

He's equaled Kiss to a religion, KISS-tianity. Finally, the believers, AKA The Kiss Army, have their \\"bible\\".Alive Forever - The Complete Touring History is the cliche-ed \\"must have\\" book for any Kiss fan. It serves both to perpetuate the Kiss legend and demystify the Kiss myth. Over six years of research went into making this book and it traces the Kiss story through every show and tour. Adding to the book's allure is that the story is told by Kiss' closest allies during those years (roadies, tour managers, accountants, friends, etc.). Gone is the Kiss image that Gene and Paul have invented over the years and in is a truer version of a band going from playing New York City sidewalks for loose change to a merchandising behemoth where music has become secondary if not tertiary. Through the years, we discover that even in the band's heyday it was always more about the hype than the music. Even in their prime KISS was not selling out or making millions.A favorite story in the book is told by Eddie Balandas (the band's 'security man') who had the pleasure of introducing the band (You Wanted The Best You Got The Best...) starting on the Destroyer tour. He was immortalized on Kiss Alive II album saying that now ubiquitous phrase with one exception -- he didn't actually say all of it. Displeased with his pronouncing of 'Kiss', Gene actually overdubbed it in the studio. In fact, as Chuck Ellias recounts, the entire album was re-recorded/overdubbed in the studio. The band had booked a week at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, New Jersey to ensure the album would be musically perfect. As a long time fan, it blows my mind and, of course, knowing what state Ace was in at the time, one can only wonder did he even play guitar on the overdubs? Is Ace at all on Alive II? (On a side note -- take a closer look at any and all pictures from Kiss in their 'infamous' Cadillac High PR stunt. Methinks, it wasn't Ace in Michigan.)This is just an example of the information contained in this book. Is it all accurate? Who knows? It is a great read... YES!! It is worth buying... YES! So, if you're a casual Kiss fan, a KISS freak or just like to read about Americana, this book is a must....***** (five stars)Mitch LafonThank you.....Mitch LafonSenior Writer -- Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles ...www.melodicrock.comWhat!

Interesting to see the actual attendence figures because they prove how much money KISS LOST in order to put on a good show. There are many dates that werent even close to selling out (mostly in the 80s), but it also shows that even in their hey day they usually only sold out places with apprx. 8 - 10,000 seats. Being compared to todays standards, that is pretty weak considering the sizeable show they toured with.The set lists are interesting as well. Though many are the same, now and then you see a song and wish you were there to hear them play it!

I myself have only seen KISS twice, in 1996 and 2000, having been too young to see them back in the 1970s, but even then, like many, I have my favorite periods of the band, and each period's tours are given equal coverage (although 1983-1989 tends to be kind of a blur, with very similar itineraries).

In addition, there's a short piece about the album relevant to every tour, and the evolution of the stage production is covered in detail.

A+"},{"Title":"Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History","review":"The 2 people that posted negative reviews of this book must be INSANE! First off, this is truly the holy grail of all KISS books for all KISS fans. Never before has such a complete look at the live history of KISS been done. You get rare set lists, incredibly rare and amazing photos and fantastic stories from the people that were there! Not the fake nonsense that Gene and Paul spout but REAL stories, good or bad! Its a wonderful read that takes you along for the ride in the KISS world. Its too bad KISS themselves couldnt put out a quality product like this.For the gentlemen that felt the book lacked info or was factually incorrect, please do a little research. The Australian/Police issue has been well documented in newspaper reports and even TV reports which are widely available among real KISS fans. As for the photo quality. If you look carefully, many of the photos are not there for quality but for the simple fact that they are RARE photos. Some good examples are Ace on the platform in 1977 and Gene in his RARE Dynasty costume. These are photos that prove or disprove KISS myths that have festered over the years. They also relate to a specific account or detail contained within the associated chapter. Any real KISS fan would realize that.If you are happy with incomplete and revisionist KISSTORY, then settle for the official publications and tell all rags that have been published in the recent past. If you want THE book on THE band, then pick this up. I promise you a better KISS book will not be found.

Traits that would arguably endure well into the twentieth century. Heere, Anzilotti concerns herself with that early era. She describes how women were able to carve out power in the planter elite. In part due to the higher death rate amongst the male planters. Their lifestyles, involving hunting, drinking and duelling, no doubt contributed to this shortened longevity.Invariably, some women would by default assume the senior role in a plantation. The irony was that many chauvinistic men had to accept this reality. That if their wives outlived them, the wives would need authority to run the estates. If only to ultimately pass these onto the sons.Anzilotti recaps this wretched society in detail. All the while being played out against the racial backdrop of slavery. This combination would form an inescapable part of Carolina's history."},{"Title":"Frommer's Germany's Best-Loved Driving Tours","review":"I've just returned from my first trip to Germany, and the Best-Loved Driving Tours was among the three books I toted along. This book was an excellent tool for planning our trip -- the photos are beautiful, and the tour layout helped us figure out where we should go and what might be worth seeing. Its short descriptions of each stop helped us grasp what a place was about, and as a result we budgeted about the right amount of time for each stop.As a tour book to take along, though, it's not nearly as helpful. On the plus side, it's the only book I encountered that imagines you might actually be *driving* through Germany (the rest of them start describing a city beginning with the train station, with no clue for car drivers on how to get downtown). Also, most of the other books don't quite grasp that you might explore outside the big cities; this one does just the opposite, which I appreciated. However, the directions from place to place are a bit sparse, and it provides almost no useful information about lodging or dining.This is a good guide book. But don't let it be the only one you carry."},{"Title":"Frommer's Germany's Best-Loved Driving Tours","review":"An extremely useful guide. We managed to followed most of the tours in the Bavaria region and picked up on some along the Romantic Road.

It's a pleasure to welcome Mara Gilgannon, a refreshingly unslick sleuth, to the lesbian detective literary scene. A Lambda Literary Award Finalist in two categories, Death by Discount is smart, funny, and entertaining. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Death by Discount: A Mara Gilgannon Mystery (Mara Gilgannon Mysteries)","review":"I enjoyed this mystery for many reasons: Mara Gilgannon is a protagonist I could really root for, a believable blend of neurosis and pluck; the other characters are also well-drawn and completely believable--their quirks make them lovable but never go over the top; the town of Aldoburg became quite real for me, a place I feel I'd recognize if I stumbled upon it; and the mystery is well-plotted--when the actual murderer is revealed, it is a surprise but also seems exactly right. Plus the WalMart premise is timely, especially with the recent release of the documentary \\"WalMart: The High Cost of Low Prices.\\" Although Vermillion's main characters are in the anti-WalMart column, she does a good job of showing the other side's reasons for wanting WalMart, so the novel never seems like a political tract.I'm looking forward to reading more mysteries by Mary Vermillion."},{"Title":"Death by Discount: A Mara Gilgannon Mystery (Mara Gilgannon Mysteries)","review":"At the highest level, this murder mystery follows one of the standard whodunit formulas. A woman (Glad) is murdered in a small Iowa town (Aldoburg) and there are many suspects, largely because there is no strong evidence against any particular person. A young man is arrested, but the evidence against him is so weak that it is clearly a case of a hapless small town cop feeling the need to do something. Few in the town really believe that the young man did it, so it is a case where the lack of evidence forces the heroine (Mara Gilgannon) to consider all possibilities.There are two other major plot lines in the book. Aldoburg is currently in the throes of a major debate over a plan for a new Wal-Mart being built on the edge of town. There are those who believe that the new store will be an economic savior and there are others convinced that it will destroy the local businesses that have operated for generations. Glad and her domestic partner Zee operated the local radio station, and have been forcefully arguing against the new store. The arguments are passionate on both sides, with many long-term friendships at risk, so it certainly could provide the motivation for the murder. Vermillion has certainly done a great deal of research into the issues concerning Wal-Mart. The arguments over the consequences of a new Wal-Mart and their business practices could have been taken from local news stories in many areas of the country. At no time does she exceed the realistic bounds of argument on either side in order to embellish her story.The second major theme is that of lesbian/gay personalities. Mara is a lesbian and her housemate (Vince) is a gay man. Glad and Zee are lesbian partners, a fact well known to the residents of Aldoburg. After Glad was killed, the murderer spray-painted \\"dyke\\" on the wall next to the body. This raises the possibility that the murder was a hate crime, and there are two young local men who recently beat up one of their gay classmates. Since the two beaters are the sons of prominent citizens, there is the potential for their fathers using their influence to protect them. The lesbian/gay theme recurs throughout the book. Mara's boss (Orchid) is also a lesbian and Mara's former partner moves in with Orchid. As she investigates the crime, Mara discovers a few other closet lesbian/gay people; one is a hot female cop that raises her sexual temperature. I found myself pondering something that I have never pondered before; \\"Will the girl get the girl?\\" It was also interesting and amusing to read the bits where a lesbian woman is sizing up another woman, noting her curves and rating her chances of getting to know her better. There is some lesbian/gay sex, but nothing one would rate as juicy.With one exception, the strong focus on lesbian/gay themes did not distract me from the trail leading to the killer(s). That exception was the seeming need of the author to describe the attire of all individuals in more detail than was necessary. The colors of the clothes always seem to be mentioned, even when it had no bearing on the story. For example, Mara visits Zee and we read \\". . . and her yellow T-shirt was wrinkled.\\" Since there is no further reference to the shirt, knowing the color was unnecessary. Even though Mara's lesbian lifestyle has led to some estrangement with her parents, that is wisely kept very low key.The climactic identification of the killer and the aftermath are well done. I certainly did not suspect the culprit and there are additional complicating factors due to some of the features of small town life. As a small town Iowa boy, I appreciated and understood many of the themes of Aldoburg life. My favorite small town situation in the entire book is when the heroine surreptitiously follows one of her prime suspects onto the darkened football practice field, hoping to witness a payoff. When she is breathless with excitement and exertion, she hears a steady stream and notes that there are \\"no bucolic creeks in the vicinity.\\" Every man who grew up in a small town can relate to that situation. The murder aspects of the book kept my interest, and the story moves along with no large sections of unnecessary filler."},{"Title":"Death by Discount: A Mara Gilgannon Mystery (Mara Gilgannon Mysteries)","review":"I am reviewing the purchased product...not the book.

It points out the common problem of many current content analysis studies being very descriptive (53% no hypothesis, 72% no research questions, quoting from the books) and without putting enough attentions to (both external and internal) reliability and validity.However, readers should be cautious about the fact that descriptive studies are not bad by nature, it very much depends on whether your research is exploratory or confirmatory. From my experience, exploratory studies can not be as structured as we would like it to be but that's a long story and involves too many epistemological issues.The main purpose of context analysis is to draw \\"inferences about its meaning and infer from the communication to its context, both of production and consumption.\\"Basically, if you are going to employ quantitative content analysis as your research method, you should follow the following steps (summarised from the book).1. Be familiar with the current literature on your research topic.2. Formulate hypotheses or research questions based on some theoretical underpinnings.3. Select your sources (newspapers, etc.) and sample sizes (based on reliability issues)4. Preparation of the analysis protocol (including background information of the study, coding procedures, and coding sheet), so that other people can follow your footsteps or critique your study.5. Data analysis, using statistical techniques (frequency, mean, correlation, regression, etc.) to make inferences.Being an introductory text, it serves its purposes. However, I think the authors could be more concise and reduced the pages by around 100. Then, it can become a pocket introduction to both undergraduate and post-graduate students.This book also quoted a lot from Krippendorff (1980).

Within this literary quilt of multiplicity, the whole color spectrum is illuminated in an everflowing hypertextual milieu of American English. Quibbling is a fabric of provocative narrative woven with threads of many hues, although one may sometimes feel compelled to push some of the dangling strands back through a needle and sew some more on...for the intriguing prose arouses curiosity, and one begins to desire an even larger quilt with which to curl up.The author offers contemporaneous links culled from the interval between her cartridge-pen days of parochial education through to the Internet days of hypertext literature. Hooking the colorful hypertext patchwork of Quibbling together are primary threads of art, relationships, and feminism interwoven with secondary colorations from quotes, letters, and phrases fastened by stitches of insightful lists and moving poetry. This mixture sometimes leads into some explicit tertiary commentary about such fascinating things as nuns and lovers &amp; sexual spankings &amp; awaking with orgasm...cleverly pushing our 'very amusing' button all the while. The expressive seams of this virtual quilt carefully loop and blend while performing their rhythmic storydance, with familial knots tossed in here and there and everywhere. These knots are clearly visible, and made to be so. Twisted little threads tied with love.Sewing into another Quibbling hypertext link will sometimes leave one restitching the same piece, but most will find a completely different color of thread artfully placed within the textually textural weave. Like a wavy line, you will follow each stitch deep into the words and repetitively arise buoyant again as you sew links throughout the story until the string runs out and it knots again. Then out of nowhere, the words suddenly refresh sentiments that may have been left stagnant in one's &quot;Don't Go There&quot; file...and new memories light. Also, there is some scrumptious reading...so juicy and flavorful that one hungers for infinite hyperlinks (or atleast a few more). Though relative within the hypertext story framework, the quick changes from link to link may feel as though you are rapidly chasing sentences in someone else's personal diary and skipping around too much for a thorough read. But, of course, that may only be one perception, since every reading road is different in Hypertextville. Still, the urgency to read another link is increasingly present throughout Quibbling. Whichever the hyper-direction taken and however swift the interstice, the result is penetrating and enjoyable. Did you like that 'interstice' word? I do, it's perfect and it's from Quibbling...If you think you have a large vocabulary and relatively unknown words make your nostrils flare, you'll be able to breathe well during the sometimes interruptive dictionary-checks while absorbing the entire Quibbling body of work. A note to the word-weary or those without several postgraduate degrees: every word that needs defined is well worth looking-up. The seemingly obscure words are not grandiloquently pretentious or even ornate--they simply work. You may never use the words or ever read them again in text, but if only you could think of a sentence to use them with one day (i.e., slype, pamba, breviary, penumbral), 'cuz they sound so good!Author Carolyn Guyer, a respected forerunner in the field of hypertext literature, is a gifted and educated intellectual, to be sure. So when she occasionally uses the f-word, it is appropriately descriptive, of course. There is a certain 'adjective dignity' involved. Moreover, it is an utter relief that she is really just one of us. Chronicling events and using anecdotes from the final denouement of the 2nd Millennium A.D., Guyer lets you into the study of her mind to peruse her selected thoughts. There, some letters are left wide-open on the desk and with a sideways glance or two, a slight glimpse of the adept-artist, serious-writer, sensitive-lover, progressive-feminist, devoted-mother, loving-daughter, enigmatic-sister, thoughtful-teacher, wannabe-extremist, latent-nun, and complex-woman can be seen and magnified. Multiplicity at its best. Quibbling is DDD.

And as the title says, it tells the other side of the story--the side you don't get from mainstream history books, most of which have been tainted by propaganda and thus offer only a very biased view of the facts.As the author points out, no book is unbiased. If you're looking for pure objectivity, you'd better stick to math and science; you sure won't find it in history. Maybury is admittedly biased, and he explains right up front what his bias is so that the reader won't be deceived.Some books may be more \\"patriotic\\" than this one, if your idea of patriotism is \\"my country, right or wrong.\\" But, to borrow a scene from the movie The Matrix, you can choose the red pill or the blue pill: keep your blinders firmly in place, or dare to open your eyes to what's really going on.For anyone who wants to take a sober look at the facts and make up his own mind, this book is a great place to start.So, why not 5 stars if I love it so much? Well, it's an \\"Uncle Eric\\" book, ostensibly targeted to the narrator's twelve-year-old nephew. That means that if you're much older than twelve, it may sound like the author is talking down to you.

We need to start teaching real history based on factual information and statistical data in our schools,not glorified Hollywood versions of history.

This is a skillful and useful presentation.Personally, I found the letter format -- (Who is Dear \\"Chris\\" anyway?) -- and the \\"Uncle Eric\\" stuff distractive. At times it reads like talking down to the reader. A straightforward factual narrative, with original sources cited, would be preferred.The author's conclusions about the many unConstitutional and unnecessary wars in U.S. history are correct and convincingly established.He is, however, drastically wrong on other claims: If you read (as the author should) General MacArthur's chronological description of events surrounding the final bombings of Japan, you will find that Japan had still not agreed to surrender even AFTER the second A-bomb was dropped! Japan's war leadership was still quibbling about terms -- (the cable is reprinted in Mac's memoirs) -- while the only answer acceptable was well known to be \\"unconditional surrender.\\" Since the Japanese were continuing the fight AFTER both A-bombs, Pres. Truman had to bluff that more A-bombs were available AND order SAC to resume (conventional) bombings after the units had been on stand-down! Yes, while some few Air Corps and Navy officers stated their opinion that Japan was \\"beaten anyway,\\" on its last legs, and could simply be blockaded into surrender, that is not a credible position for an opponent still resisting even after two A-bombs! Such a claim underestimates the \\"Bushido\\" mentality, which had already trained and prepared women and children to attack American troops with sticks!The author is absolutely wrong about Hitler and should read Irving's _Hitler's War_ to examine those actions and motivations, not \\"insane\\" or \\"crazy,\\" from the other side. Similarly, FDR's relentless motivation for getting into the war -- constantly baffling to the author -- becomes obvious when one acknowledges the 1933 declaration of war on Germans and Germany by the World Jewish Congress. Read _Germany Must Perish_, for example. Ambassador Joseph Kennedy and Charles Lindbergh knew exactly what FDR was up to, and were not shy in their public statements.

The brief prayers can easily and quietly be said in a public rosary setting while the first half of the Our Father or Hail Mary is being recited. These scriptural prayers are good meditation tools which combine a focus on the mystery of each decade in conjuction with the prayer for the Holy Souls. A great combination of prayers.

Great to use in private prayer or with the family."},{"Title":"The Rosary for the Holy Souls in Purgatory","review":"This book,\\"The Rosary for the Holy Souls in Purgatory\\", is a SPLENDID BOOK!!!Long ago, I used to find the Rosary very tiring, very time consuming. I used to sigh when I began to pray it, as I saw ALL THOSE FIFTY + beads to pray upon....But now that I have small passages to reflect upon, the number is nonexistant! In fact, the passages inspire me; they give me energy and make me feel hopeful, especially when I'm moody or ill and I need a boost from somewhere. The passages arn't long, either(Hump. I don't even know WHY they are called passages anyway, because they are just only one or two sentences long!)The Rosary is one of the best prayers to recite for The Holy Souls in purgatory, and for yourself in general. If you pray it everyday faithfully Our Lady will PROMPTLY deliver you from purgatory! Isn't that a good reason to pray it in simple form? Besides, what do you have to loose? You are pleasing God and Our Lady, You gain intercessors and new, ETERNAL friends, and you may gain virtues from the fruit of those mysteries you think of.The holy souls in purgatory are awaiting your prayers!!!!!!!How would you feel if you saw the face of Our Lord and were held back in burning flames and felt hopeless because you don't know when you would see him again?How would you feel if no one prayed for you?If the Holy Souls would pray for you untiredly for you once you helped them reach Heaven forever, dosen't it remind us of how GREAT their suffering WAS?In my book, that's got to be pretty intense. The pain, I mean.So do yourself a favor - and them a favor-, buy this book. It will be a great present both for yourself and for them. For when we remember the Holy Souls YEAR LONG, we give them Christmas early..This is a WONDERFUL prayer that is not included in this book that I would love to share with you. The following prayer below, once recited, will help to release 1,000 SOULS FROM PURGATORY EACH TIME IT IS SAID!!\\"Eternal Father, I offer thee the Most Precious Blood of Thy Divine Son, Jesus, In Union with The Massessaid throughout the world today,For All the Holy Souls in purgatory,For sinners everywhere,For sinners in the Universal Church,Those in my own home,And within my family.Amen."},{"Title":"The Rosary for the Holy Souls in Purgatory","review":"I really love this book.

I've enjoyed them all, and in fact just ordered three more copies before writing this. The reason I named this review as I did is because Tassone's books are a great size! They are not full paperback size, they are closer to pocket size. However, they're not so tiny that they're hard to handle. As another reviewer said, they fit well in one hand while holding the Rosary in the other. I have a Bible cover that has a pocket in the front, and I've found that any one of Tassone's books will fit well in there if I want to take one to Chapel with me. Plus, the writing on these is large enough for my middle-aged eyes with bifocals. I've given away a pile of these to people just learning the value of the Rosary, both Protestant and Roman Catholic.

The only thing I didn't like about the book was the binding (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5). It has a tightly glued binding which makes it difficult to hold open while I'm holding my Rosary with my other hand. Technically you don't need the beads as you can count your prayers by the verses, but I like to use the beads. The spine broke and pages came loose after only a few uses, so I ended up actually taking the book apart and I re-bound it using a spiral comb punch and binder.

Apparently, a place awaiting a believer after death but before entrance into Heaven.Each sin, we're told, must be atoned for. And each, whether venial or mortal sin, has a debt in suffering due.We're told entrance into Heaven will follow the completion of one's term of being 'purged'(years, decades?).Prior to death, though, there are opportunities to reduce the debt and time to be served through Plenary Indulgences (full remission of sufferings due) and Partial Indulgences (partial remission of sufferings due).Prayers (whether singular, novenas, rosaries, etc.) monies donated, good works, etc. are acceptable.Yet there are some questions which arise:What assurance does one have that what they are doing really makes any difference?Are those already in Purgatory being helped?How many sins are there to amend? How do we know if the debt's been fulfilled (or not)?How much and/or how often should one donate?How much has one already reduced their own future suffering?Which saints are there to pray to?The list can go on and on.Apart from this, look up the circumstances leading to how the Rosary (and the doctrine of Purgatory) was given to Blessed DominicThe Secret of the Rosary.Descriptions of self-flagellation, loss of blood, unconscious, visions, etc. are noted.What about the Cross and the Divine Sacrifice which took place at Calvary?A rule of thumb would be that when teachings appear contradictory to Biblical principles and exhortations it then becomes a subject qualified for further review or research.Peace."},{"Title":"Party politics in the age of Caesar","review":"I ordered this book because I was busy drafting my own novel set in 80BC -50BC and with my lead character being an ambitious fellow from a leading Roman political family I was getting awfully frustrated trying to get to grips with the complicated mechanical workings of late Republican politics. Then I found this work, set 70BC - 50BC and I had to pinch myself for it was as if it had been written personally for me, so well did it cover everything I wanted to know. I possess many books on politics in this period but none of them impart a fraction of the knowledge this work contains within 255 pages. Yes its an old work, 1949 first printed. But it stands the test of time.The late Lily Ross Taylor in splendid easy to read prose has beautifully articulated all the facets of political life at the time of Julius Caesar. The relations of nobles to clients, the manipulation of the state religion for political purpose (for religion and lawmaking were inseparable), how Romans voted + how to get the vote in your favour and the way the various institutions/magistracies worked (or rather - were supposed to work). Finally the concept that Roman politics was not so much about \\"party\\" systems (for none existed) but forming/aligning oneself with \\"a loose aggregation of like minded associates or friends\\" to get your way.All the great names of the era and their roles and interactions are covered in painstaking detail. So many gems are uncovered. An example being the chapter \\"Cato and the Populares\\":Caesars battle with Cato. Seeking to bring Caesar to justice for in 58 BC for perceived disregard for state protocols/and irregularities with Treasury monies during his time as Consul, Caesar manipulates the Tribunate to honor Cato with a posting to Cyprus to govern a newly aquired province following the nonsensical dismissal of a King whose only \\"crime\\" was failing to pay his bribes to the right people quick enough (the Triumvirs). Cato accepts due to his unbreakable commitment to do as the state wants (though he is livid at the ruse) and Caesar staves off another threat. The book is just full of such accounts among protagonists and makes for page turning fare if you are a true Romanofile.By the time you have combed your way through this fascinating work, you will be in awe as to how anyone ever got anything worthwhile done or legislated. Anarchy, bi-partisan politics, violence, abuse of office, petty jealousy, murder, bribing, backstabbing, frontstabbing, use of marriage and divorce to improve career prospects - its all covered. By the end of the book you are left in no doubt as to why two civil wars followed and Emperor rule was established and the old Republic deserved the thumbs down. The worst modern democracy on a bad day was tame compared to this."},{"Title":"Party politics in the age of Caesar","review":"For those looking for a tight, readable introduction on political life in Republican Rome there is no better place to start than Lily Ross Taylor's 1949 classic, \\"Party Politics in the Age of Caesar.\\" She reviews a wide range of institutions and practices -- from religion and the law courts to voting assemblies and political campaigning -- and does so in a way made especially easy to grasp for contemporary readers, often comparing and contrasting how modern notions of political parties and religion differ from those of ancient Rome.Taylor stresses that we cannot think of modern political parties when studying the fall of the Republic. The parties were not between the patricians and the plebeians as in the early Republic, she says. Nor was it a struggle between conservative and liberal forces in the polity, although the contest often took on that form for personal reasons. The author argues that the struggles that brought about the parties were over competition between the nobles for political advancement. The resulting \\"parties\\" were in actuality alliances based on friendship and family obligations. Taylor emphasizes how personal the entire system was. She compares gaining office in the late Republic to winning an American major political party nomination at a convention (note: Taylor was writing in the 1940s when Democrats and Republicans still picked their presidential candidates in back room wheeling-and-dealing). The world of nineteenth and twentieth century American political \\"bosses\\" and \\"machines\\" would thus be very familiar to Cicero and his colleagues. As the hunt for securing the spoils of empire intensified, Taylor writes, these alliances of friendship began to harden and take on a semi-permanent nature.Taylor blames nineteenth century historian Theodor Mommsen with promoting the myth that the struggle between optimates and populares was one pitting a senatorial party against a popular democratic party. She argues that the optimates/populares conflict was an internal struggle in the noble class aimed at their own personal gain and was not at all about any notions of democracy. She maintains that the populares were, on the whole, frustrated lower level nobles who were cut out of the major spoils of empire by the older, more prestigious families. It was at the people's expense that the populares manipulated the masses to circumvent the powerful grip of a faction of high noble families in command of the powerful Senate. In theory, their differences were based on policy, but in reality, Taylor argues, is was only a difference in political means at achieving identical ends.The Roman nobility has often been compared to the British ruling class in the way they dominated government. Taylor, however, suggests that by comparison the British were much more open to new blood outside the traditional families than the Romans. Indeed, in the last 150 years of the Republic only 10 \\"new men\\" (i.e. men without Senatorial lineage in their family) rose to the consulship, and only one man did it in the last half century (93-48 BC) -- and that was Cicero. She writes that the closed political system of Republican Rome is more analogous to the ossified patriarchate of the Republic of Venice than any modern system.Perhaps the most fascinating and illuminating section of this book, at least for me, is Taylor's detailed accounting of the step ladder political game that Roman aristocrats competed in. The path to power and success was clear and to a certain extent regimented: early education consisted of history and especially public speaking; then military service began at age 17, often as a military tribune; around 20 years-old he would begin to appear in the Forum to make small speeches for his family; at 30 he would be elected quaestor, which assured membership in the Senate; after the one year term as quaestor, there was a mandatory 9 year break before he could run for praetor, during which time he would likely serve as a legate of a governor in command of some province to gain further military experience and might also run for the optional office aedlie as a way to curry favor with the masses by throwing lavish public festivals and games at personal expense; by age 39 or 40, if all had been going smoothly, he would secure one of the 8 praetorships; after that it was back to the field in a headlong rush for military glory and riches all so that he could achieve the dream of all young nobles, to be elected consul in \\"his year\\" (i.e. age 43, the minimum age for holding that office). The stakes were high and the competition intense, especially as there were only two consulships elected every year, one each reserved for noble families from the patricians and plebeians. This political cycle consumed nearly all the energy of the leading families, as they were either in the race themselves or looking to secure advancement for a son or son-in-law. It was literally what life revolved around for the several dozen families that ruled the Republic.Both sides in the ensuing civil war claimed to be fighting to preserve the old Republic. Caesar was striving to save it from the tyranny of the oligarchy; Cato from the tyranny of the demagogic despot. Despite the high flown rhetoric, Taylor says, both sides were drawn by personal loyalty and interest, not ideology. All would agree that austerity, justice and honor were the guiding principles of the Republic, but no one represented that ideal better than Cato who, both in life and in death, exemplified what all nobles held to be truly Roman.After the civil war and Caesar's murder, Augustus ascended to absolute power, instituting a Nazi-like regime, according to Taylor, but carefully cloaked in the spirit and words of his uncle's archenemy, Cato. The great Republican's legacy flourished while Caesar's wilted. He came to represent liberty and virtue, the highest ideals of the Republic. There was never a party of Cato, the author says, but rather a cult of Cato, and it had no opposition."},{"Title":"Party politics in the age of Caesar","review":"If you want a level of detail greater than \\"Caesar vs Senate, Caesar=tyranny, Senate=democracy,\\" then you should read this book.Taylor explains how Roman society was set up, how the various classes and groups of Roman society manifested themselves in politics, how the election cycle/balance of power sorted things out, and how politicians kept busy Monday-Friday, 8-5.Taylor offers the same level of detail on Roman Republican politics that you would get on American politics following major news outlets in an election season. He explains how Roman electoral districts were arranged and how that set up affected nominating processes and political strategies. He also walks through a typical campaign for an elected office.Taylor discusses how social and economic trends affected politics, too. For example, Rome's 34 electoral districts (similar to America's US House districts) were originally full of small-land-owning citizens in the vicinity of Rome. But, over the centuries, the farm land around Rome consolidated into large plantations, so the land-owning citizens registered in the 34 districts shrank in number and were mostly the rich nobility. Towards the end of the Roman Republic, the urban district with a gazillion people carried as much weight as the rural district with one giant plantation.If you're looking for that level of detail, I recommend this book. If you're looking for even more detail, like analysis of a particular issue in a particular election, I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Party politics in the age of Caesar","review":"I've read a lot of history and a lot of historical fiction on Rome. If you're not the bookish type who likes to really dig into the details of a historical era, or if you're not fairly familiar with the people and events of Caesar's time, this would have to be one of the most colossally dull books you've ever read.

(I certainly can not.)The only other mystery writer to approach this feat is Reginald Hill, who tells who the villain is in the first sentence of one of his books."},{"Title":"A Blunt Instrument","review":"I love Georgette Heyer. Her Regency romances set the standard that every other author falls short of and her mysteries are absorbing and entertaining. A Blunt Instrument didn't quite measure up to other Heyer mysteries I've read, though. It has a light and frothy feel--as airy as a 1930s drawing-room comedy from MGM at times--and some truly comical moments. But for me, an improbable romance and the strange solution to the mystery detracted from the overall effect. I still enjoyed it--and even mediocre Georgette Heyer is better than most authors ever achieve--but I've read better from her."},{"Title":"A Blunt Instrument","review":"There are plenty of clues in this wonderful mystery.

She always uses her words in a clever and breezy way. She has truly humorous characters that are highly memorable. I highly recommend her mysteries! Having said that though, anyone reading her mysteries MUST remember the time in which she wrote. In our modern 21st century era readers expect a certain level of sophistication in their mysteries. But since Heyer wrote most of her mysteries in the 1930's you should expect them to read differently that a modern mystery. Her mysteries ARE NOT fast paced reads like the Jason Bourne novels, but more a leisurely stroll into the time and place of which she wrote. Many of her choices in words and situations reflect a time that is much different than our modern day.I look upon her writings as a microcosm of a time and place that I did not know personally. Since I am an American, my knowledge of life in 1930's Britain is almost nonexistant, but I find it a fascinating era. One thing I have always loved about Heyer is her use of the English language. I have read this book many times in book form and just recently finished the Kindle Edition, which allows me to instantly look up a reference or word definition. Wow! I was amazed at her ability to find the perfect word to fit the circumstances. I have a reasonably good vocabulary and understanding of words, but looking up some of her references really expanded my knowledge. Looking up words such a tout, panegyric, vieux jeu, atavism, \\"blood and thunder\\" or ha'p'orth (and many more) really helped me to THINK about what she was writing. Her ability to use an obscure word that perfectly fits the situation has really intrigued me and more than once brought a smile to my face. Some of her historical references to Havelock Ellis or the White Rose League or even the laxative Bile Beans gave me hours of pleasure.While I read for pleasure (as I suspect most of us do), I'm not interested in just getting through a book like a train running down the track. I like to think I can grow in my knowledge and understanding of the world - even with a light fluffy mystery novel. Heyer writes for the \\"thinking\\" reader. She doesn't rely on sex, foul language or brutality to engage her readers, but an exquisite understanding of the English language. And while, as some have stated, they were able to \\"spot\\" the villian, that doesn't take away from the humor and deftness with which she handles her subject. I view it the same as I might view a rerun of Seinfeld - I may know the plot, I may guess how the characters will react in a certain sitution, BUT it doesn't affect my appreciation for the humouous way they handle the subject.So, as you can see - I am a big fan of Georgette Heyer."},{"Title":"A Blunt Instrument","review":"I was able to guess the murderer from the start and I spent the rest of the book hoping I was wrong. Should I be proud of myself or disappointed because it was too obvious? I still enjoyed the book, but the mystery wasn't really a mystery to me. The characters of Neville Fletcher and Sally Drew were amusing but I actually enjoyed Sergeant Hemingway and his slight bitterness the most. I've read enough of Heyer's detective novels now to where I know there is a romance in each of them so it doesn't surprise me anymore. This one did feel a bit tacked on, but still cute nonetheless."},{"Title":"A Blunt Instrument","review":"Heyer must have had enormous fun writing this one: she flings her clues at the reader with incredible audacity. This book needs a second reading to appreciate her sense of humor -- much as mischievous as her character Neville Fletcher.I really enjoy light-fiction writers who understand that what they are doing is entertainment, and enter into a tacit complicity with the reader, assuming intelligence on the part of same. To this end, Georgette Heyer creates some fairly realistic characters and scenes, and some rather fanciful ones. Her fanciful characters, however, are frequently acting that role deliberately. As to her realistic characters and scenes, there is in this book a scene between an estranged husband and wife that is so touching and rings so true that one wonders if Heyer had seen or participated in something of the sort.If you enjoy Blunt Instrument -- even mildly -- put it away for a year (or a decade) and read it again, with full knowledge of who the killer is and how he committed the murders.

This is my (accidental) second reading of Blunt Instrument, and I laughed aloud continually at Heyer's skill and wicked sense of humor."},{"Title":"A Blunt Instrument","review":"I am one of those who has been a GH Regency fan for years but never really read the mysteries until now, not being a fan of the genre. My first was Death in the Stocks which I disliked so much ( or rather I disliked the characters so much ) that I didn't think I'd ever read another , but was persuaded to do so. Envious Casca was next - better , but with the same sort of horrible people . It's not that I mind reading about horrible people -they can be fun-but these are all awful because of their pathological snobbishness and sense of entitlement . And that is neither amusing nor edifying.So, third time lucky, A Blunt Instrument. Hmm, better again, though I do agree with another reviewer who said they really got a bit tired of waiting for a development.I didn't pick the culprit as I had easily done in the other two, so that was good. And I liked the 'romance', nice for the refreshingly unusual woman. Pity though, that it is still pervaded with appalling sneering at anyone remotely like a working class person, all of whom are routinely portrayed as idiots, fools, incapable of telling a coherent story or indeed the simple truth , being too stupid or histrionic to be able to manage it, particularly if female. The way the police are also constantly lied to and misled and insulted and held in utter contempt by these upper class twits I also find hard to take. It makes me cross, like the way in which people being questioned in serious cases on CSI or SVU or whatever are always shown at work, too far too busy to even stand still to answer a a police question .I'll probably read more . I don't know why, but I will."},{"Title":"A Blunt Instrument","review":"This is not a new read but an old friend that I can now carry with me when I travel.

I have read all of Agatha Christie's 79 mysteries and for the most part have read contemporary mysteries since then. Excepting Sherlock Holmes books and mysteries by Dorothy Sayers, I haven't been able to find mysteries set in historical England. Hooray! I'm so pleased to have stumbled onto the fact that one of my favorite romance writers wrote a few mysteries!I did not love this book, but I did enjoy it very much. I was able to guess whodunit, which is unusual for me. I don't THINK it was obvious, but it's so difficult to be subjective! I thought the book was very interesting.

As a foster mother, Deborah is desperate to contact the owner of her home to persuade him to let her keep her home and her foster children.Cord finds himself attracted to the tiny whirlwind who is so emphatic to save her kids.Devising a plan so they can both win, Cord keeping his grandmother's home and Deborah a roof over her head, which would mean keeping her kids, Cord suggests marriage.It will take a lot to convince Deborah, who is determined to never marry again. With Cord and Deborah, their foster children, and a fond of disaster bunny, their search for happiness is marred by crisis at every turn. How do you achieve your goal when each triumph is marred by a test of love, patience and trust?What a wonderful book! This is a must read. A true delight. The words flowed, and I found that I could not put the book down. The characters come to life, they are so well written, with the perfect touch of how life is not always fair, but with love, patience and trust, the worst things in life can be overcome. Cord and Deborah are characters that seem to leap off the page, but it is the foster children that really moved me, and tug at your heartstrings. How can you love a child that has so much anger and frustration built up? Room for Love is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. This is a GREAT Holiday read, just in time to remind us what is important in life."},{"Title":"Room for Love","review":"Courtesy of Love RomancesDeborah Olstrom is a foster parent to 4 children and is known as the best foster mom in Forest Heights. She needs an affordable house immediately within an approved neighborhood, to keep her family together. She makes a mistake in confronting the wrong man, Cord Delafied, who she thinks is the landlord of her rental house, but it was Cord's father, Marshall, who sent her the eviction.It is out of the question for Cord to help Deborah as he has a strained relationship with his father. Father and son have been fighting over a house which has been left by Cord's grandmother since she died. According to her will, Cord must get married to inherit the house.Cord thinks that a marriage of convenience would be the perfect solution to his problem as well as Deborah's, if only she agrees to marry him. How so? So that Cord can get the house and Deborah can have a house to live in. Cord suggests his outrageous proposal to Deborah, but she thinks he is out of his mind.Then, Deborah's rebellious foster son gets into trouble and no one but Cord comes to his resuce. She agrees to Cord's proposal, and Cord promises her not to take advantage during their temporary marriage. However, Cord finds it hard to keep his promise as Deborah seems to be the only woman who can give his chest a warm pulse and bring laughter to his life.ROOM FOR LOVE is not just a modern tale of a marriage of convenience. It also points out several problems concerning foster families, disease as well as child abusement. Readers would take up with Deborah's character right from the beginning and hope that she will stay married to Cord till the end. Although the romance between Deborah and Cord seems to be a fairy tale but that's what romance is about! Anything could happen with the magic pen of the writer."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"To this day, the Bermuda Triangle is regarded by many as a mysterious zone of influence within which an unusual number of ships and planes disappear without a trace. At the very least, its reputation as a region associated with some unspecified danger remains. Why this is so, after the first publication of Mr. Kusche's book more than twenty years ago, is perhaps a more interesting question than whether or not the Bermuda Triangle's reputation is deserved. Regardless, it is this latter question that Kusche attempts to answer. His approach is simply to do the necessary research--whenever and wherever he encounters an account or tale of tragedy in the Bermuda Triangle, he looks up the relevant accounts and finds the facts. If the facts leave the fate of the ship or plane(s) ambiguous, he says so. If his research turns up a likely explanation, he is forthright and direct in proposing it.What Kusche finds, in sum, is that the Bermuda Triangle is essentially a myth. Many of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances are not nearly as mysterious as has been suggested; some ships that were lost in supposedly calm seas were in fact sailing into fierce storms, while others were lost nowhere near the Triangle area itself. Several of the tragedies said to have occurred there are associated with no records at all--leaving one to wonder how popularizers of this &quot;mystery&quot; can be certain that there was anything to disappear. Before Mr. Kusche's research the Bermuda Triangle &quot;mystery&quot; melts away, leaving nothing more substantial than an urban legend. Writers such as Charles Berlitz are revealed as writers of fiction in thin disguise [Berlitz was co-author of the first published book on the alleged crash of a UFO at Roswell, New Mexico, which should do much to illuminate the reliability of that story as well]. This book is reasonably well written and easy to get through. If you want to read about the Bermuda Triangle, this is the only book I would recommend."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"Author virtually goes case by case and gives the reader a pausible reason behind each &quot;disappearance.&quot; The five aircraft of Flight 19, arguably the most famous Bermuda Triangle case, didn't &quot;disappear.&quot; The five planes are probably rusting in a thousand feet of water southeast of Jacksonville, Florida. The case of the &quot;disappearance&quot; of the MARINE SULPHUR QUEEN is indicative. It didn't &quot;disappear&quot;; it blew up. Debris was recovered. Author's research is impeccable. It is a joy to read a researcher like Mr. Kusche prove his case with facts. His book is the only book worth reading in the whole Bermuda Triangle genre."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"This book is &quot;just the facts&quot; without the hyperbole and sermonizing that so many &quot;debunking&quot; authors relish indulging in. Kusche was the first to systematically and methodically study many of the &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; mysteries and his hard work is often cited in many publications and televised programs with no credit going to Kusche. If more Paranormal investigators took this much time and effort to substantiate their facts I suspect many more &quot;mysteries&quot; would be solved."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"I was given this book as a young teenager by my father when I was interested in the Bermuda Triangle. I am very lucky he did. The book carefully goes through dozens of \\"cases\\" of missing craft and convincingly shows them to be either the victims of storms, mechanical failure and in several instances, simply made up. By far the profoundest impact of this book was the exposition of the lies and mendacity of the writers of such books - a young person needs to hear and be shown in a non-condesending way that just because something appears on TV or in book form doesn't mean its true. Larry Kusche's book started me on the road to critical thinking, to ask \\"What does this mean?\\" to any given statement. I went on to read a book or two more debunking UFOs and other peudoscience, but Kusche's book did the main trick by getting across to me the importance of checking sources, asking if other motives are involved (like making money out of decent but unsuspecting people). I also recommend the *VHS tape of Nova's show, The Bermuda Triangle,* which is a debunking tape and promoter of critical thinking. I also recommend Carl Sagan's book *The Demon-Haunted World* which goes into incredible detail (in a non-condescending way) about why some people need to believe in such things as alien-abduction (or in an earlier era, demonic possession), false memories, the techniques of frauds like Uri Geller, and considers how we can encourage critical thinking in our society."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"Many years ago, this marvelous book served as my introduction to skeptical literature, along with Ronald Story's &quot;The Space-Gods Revealed.&quot; Truth may not always be stranger than fiction, but it's a lot more fun. And the truth, ultimately, is that factual omissions, outright lies, and lazy scholarship are the real stuff of legends like that of the Bermuda Triangle. Of course, television specials narrated by Rod Serling help, too--not to mention the endless hyping of the paranormal on various cable channels.Larry Kusche may have saved me from a lifetime of belief in idiotic, media-generated poplore, and how can I thank him enough? Possibly the most enjoyable piece of skeptical detective work in print."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"Until I moved to the Bay Area of California in 1972, I had never heard of the Bermuda Triangle. This is significant because for the ten years previous I had lived in Indialantic, Florida, fished regularly in the Gulf Stream and had made a few passages to the Bahamas. What those of us who actually lived in the area and sailed the waters did not know was that some creative people had been generating a sensation, and a good bit of revenue, by spinning a wild myth out of misinformation and a few isolated disappearances. And let's face it, in the age before geolocators and satellite systems, there were several disappearances at sea every year. Actually, there still are. The ocean is a big, deadly pace.Flight 19 is a classic example. On a training flight, the trainer's instrument panel went out. Not unheard of. He turns navigational duties over to a trainee; again not unheard of and understandable under the circumstances. The trainee has trouble with his readings, so the flight eyeballs the surface to see were they are. They see the Bahamas, but think they're looking at the Florida Keys. Going above the clouds, they sight by the sky and head for Florida. Tragically, that course carries them over the open Atlantic. Throughout all of this, ground control can hear their radio chatter, but the planes can not hear base. In those days this was a fairly common occurrence with the primitive radio systems available. A plane was dispatched to intercept and rescue the wayward pilots. What happened aboard that plane really is a mystery. According to witnesses, it exploded in midair over the ocean within sight of land. However, by the time it was verified the first plane was lost (remember, this was before or modern instant communications and flight transponders) and another could be dispatched it was too late. Though three position due east of New Smyrna had been calculated by those on shore, Flight 19 had gone down in the swiftly flowing currents of the Atlantic. Rescuers literally had no idea where to look.Charlatans used this tragic story to manufacture a myth. The failed instrument panel became wildly spinning compasses, the instructor telling the other trainees to follow the one he designated navigator instead of him became a desperate warning to rescuers not to try and follow. A mysterious message about the sky and sea seeming \\"wrong\\" was manufactured. (Often quoted, by charlatans and true believers alike, but still false.)Other examples include the Revnoc, which went down in 40-foot seas during one of the worst hurricanes of the decade. In legend, it disappeared in front of witnesses in bright sunlight while sailing on a calm sea. A sulfur ship which sank in the Gulf and a freighter that disappeared off the coast of Africa are also included in the chronicle.Some disappearances are not explained. The ocean is very big, very secretive, and very unforgiving. The nature of the environment -- not any mysterious forces -- means there will always be questions we can never answer. This book does a lot to seperate the genuine mysteries from the hype."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"I read this book years ago and remember thinking at the time that I wished there were more book like this written on other topics. The book is simple, straightforward, and written in such a way that if you have access to a good library with good research facilities you can retrace many of the authors research steps yourself. I was in graduate school at the time and would take breaks in the library from my real course work to look up some of his claims in the book, and I didn't find even one that was remotely incorrect. Since then that's an approach I take when trying to decide which side of an issue I'm going to agree with when I don't have the time or inclination to do a lot of research on my own. What I do is take a random sample of the claims being made by both sides of an issue, then first I decide if any of the claims by either side don't make much logical sense. If one side or another makes a lot of claims that don't make logical sense and the other side doesn't, then I don't really go any farther in my own research. Why should I waste my time researching somebody's point of view if they can't even construct logical arguments? Then I look up the easy to verify factual claims. If one side makes a lot of factual claims that turn out to be incorrect and the other side doesn't once again I don't go any farther. Why should I waste my time with what somebody has to say when they can't even get their simple fact straight? If somebody comes up with a new book about the Bermuda Triangle that gets rid of ALL the nonsense that Kusche's book exposes, but I'm not wasting my time on any book that has the usual nonsense in it."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"Mr Kusche finally puts to rest the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. He takes all the stories and legends on a case-by-case basis and explains and proves 90% of them. The other 10% simply don't have enough information available to draw any conclusion. His chapter on Flight 19 is excellent and compelling and leaves no question to what happend to the legendary &quot;Lost Patroll&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"There are always going to be some folks who cling to fiction rather than accept fact. You'll see reviews that quote the supposed Flight 19 radio report that \\"even the ocean doesn't look right\\". If you do you own research you'll know that this is pure bunkum - and that's precisely what Larry Kusche did: his own research, and found the vast majority of reports to be pure bunkum.In the search for truth, some people go so far and no further. Thankfully for us, Kusche went all the way as often as he could, and his work here is a confirmation of the principle of Occam's Razor: all other things being equal, the simplest explanation tends to be the right one.I recommend this book as a reality check, especially in an age where the Internet has spawned an avalanche of conspiracy theories and misinformation, and educational systems have failed for years to give students the basic skills to investigate, analyse and draw sensible conclusions. Kusche shows you how."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"An excellent book which cuts thru the hype and hysteria surrounding the Bermuda Triangle. Kusche found facts which were indiscovered or ignored by other 'researchers', revealing forgotten storms, important information omitted by other writers, or the simple fact that some of these cases were simple figments of someone's imagination. Bravo! Debunks the popular notion of so-called messages from Flight 19 (In response to an earlier review, people who were monitoring the search in the towers that night have made repeated statements that messages allegedly sent by Flight 19- the 'strange water', et.al.- were in fact never made.

The result: Most of the widely held beliefs about the Bermuda Triangle are without factual basis; most of the &quot;classic&quot; cases cited in connection with the region have clear, commonplace explanations (and often didn't happen near the Triangle anyway.)

Mr. Kusche's was refreshingly different. Mr. Kusche gave me the idea to use interlibrary loan to do research and obtain books, which is how he did his research. Also, his book made me wonder about other cases that he had not examined. I decided to investigate one and with nothing more than one letter found out that was described as a mysterious plane disappearence was nothing more than a tragic crash in the mountains of South America (stretching the boundary of the Triangle to the south). In his earliest edition Mr. Kusche did not do justice to the Flight 19 disappearence. However, his sequeal, The Disappearence of Flight 19, restored my confidence. Hopefully this latest edition made improvements in his coverage of the topic."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"Kusche does a fairly well-detailed book, chronicling the best-known of the &quot;mysteries&quot; dealing with the Bermuda Triangle. It's a decent list, and it is essentially a debunker's textbook.He offers a lot of information conveniently left out about a lot of the disappearances in other books, and puts a good deal of detail into why a lot of these disappearances occurred.It really makes these all seem rather mundane. For example, the loss of the British training ship &quot;Atalanta&quot; is a disaster waiting to happen, i.e., bad handling, a bad storm, too few real sailors and a lot of seasick, scared cadets.Good stuff if you're interested, and are willing to read with an open, unjaundiced eye."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Kusche's book in that it is full of factual information surrounding not just the disappearance of the Avengers, but clarifies a great, many things about flying itself. I enjoyed the chronicles about Lt. Taylor, his men, and several relevant stories about naval flying and the compications involved, as well as many &quot;errors&quot; Lt. Taylor may have made which added to the problems they encountered. However, it must be stated that many expeditions have searched the sea for these airplanes, and a great many TBM's have been found, including entire squadrons of them. But Flight 19 still remains inexplicably absent from the registry of discovered aircraft. Therefore, and forgive me Mr. Kusche, the mystery is NOT solved regarding the Lost Patrol."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"The other reader\`s comments speak for themselves. The only reason I just gave 4 stars, is that there are sometimes significant verbal conclusions missing at the end of every researched part: The flight 19 did go down somewhere out of the range in which the rescue took place, they probably tried to land on the sea,when they were running out of fuel. Even if they made it into the lifeboats.......I have to admit that there are someparts that are highly mysterious, and I would not doubt, that at certain points of our planets compasses have their trouble guiding their user properly, but this has nothing to do with some extraterrestial influence.....In a word: Kusche is singing the last lullaby to the never-ending Bermuda-Triangle -Story!"},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"Mister Kusche had done the public a great service in resolving this conundrum. By tracing the strange activity in the Bermuda Triangle to leprechauns, he has finally nailed the most plausible theory to date. His work will be greatly celebrated and inspire further discussions in academic circles."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"The success of this book seems to be based on its title rather than its content. Aside from being incredibly obsolete (first published in 1974 and never updated), the author was very selective in what cases to include for his \\"solution.\\" Kusche is also without any real authoritative source material. Out of the 57 cases, he obtained only 6 accident reports. Most of his work is a debunk on popular claims on the Triangle. This led him in one case to \\"solve\\" a nonexistent flight (The B-29 in 1947 which was really a C-54 hundreds of miles away).Only about 7 or 8 incidents out of the 57 he lists are exposed as inacurately listed as missing or being in the Triangle. Many of the most famous cases he cannot solve, and others are the victim of his shallow guesses.Most of his deductions are based on old newspaper accounts. Even these he agrees with in a pick and chose manner. In the case of the Cyclops, he even went to far as to write: \\"I confidently decided that the newspapers, the Navy, and all the ships at sea had been wrong, and that there had been a storm near Norfolk that day strong enough to sink the ship.\\"His storm turns out to be fictional, as Gian Quasar was able to prove by referring his web site readers (URL) to the large amounts of documents on this ship kept in boxes 1068 to 1070 of the Modern Military Branch of the National Archives.The recent increased sales of the book are no doubt due from the unprecedented interest documentary TV has displayed in Quasar's 12 years of research on the topic, as well as the high volume his web site receives(all major channels: History; Discovery; Travel; and TLC have done 1 or more 1 hour long shows based on Quasar's research). With his book coming out within a year, Kusche's old debunk will probably hit all time highs for a 30 year old book in reprint, but the reader will walk away disastified with Kusche's mediocre approach and bombastic claim to have solved it.Besides Quasar's upcoming book which is estimated to be adding more than 150 cases to the Triangle, there seems to be others in the works, like by Bruce Gernon and Rob MacGregor (Indiana Jones fame). Triangle interest is going to be hot again, and there will probably be no room for long for a very 1974 debunk on the subject by an author who refused to travel there."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved","review":"This is one of the classic \\"debunking\\" books of all time.

I agree it's a good beginner/intermediate book presenting an introduction to the varied flamenco styles, but the pieces are not really performance caliber outside of a student recital setting. Paco Pena does state in the introduction that was his intention, but if you're like me you don't like putting a lot of time and effort learning music you can't use professionally.

It opened my eyes to a whole new world of biblical studies that I had no idea existed.Set up like any survey of the gospels and Acts, it delves deeper as it interacts with current scholarly debates and introduces you to the major players and important terminology used by scholars. After reading this book, you feel as if something has been hidden from you your whole life. As if they thought you were too dumb to be able to handle serious research into the historical Jesus and the early church.This book isn't like that as it brings you into the conversation. I now have a voracious appetite for biblical scholarship and have read some of the greatest books of my life since reading this one.

Maybe Free Press was being told to publish conservative authors. Maybe Berlinski had a contract to write a book in record time. Whatever the reason, there's no reason for the average reader to bother with it.As popular science history, it fails miserably. The science is too math-dense to be understandable by the average numerophobic reader. Even worse, the book doesn't provide enough cultural/intellectual context for readers to appreciate Newton's huge scientific achievements. Even as Vanity Fair-style biography, the book barely gets a passing grade. We do learn tidbits about Newton: He may have been gay! He had a mania for Biblical esoterica! He had an authoritarian streak! Unfortunately, the writing is too rushed and the narrative too lacking in texture and detail to communicate a feel for the life of a great man and the age he lived in.Bottomline: \\"Newton's Gift\\" has too much math to be read at the beach yet too little substance to be worthy of serious study.

This is my third course of his writings and Berlinski never fails to catch my attention in his way of describing his understanding of the world and its people. I get the impression that Berlinski is a fan of Newton. No, not just fan, but fan-atic as in the classic derivation of the term. Berlinski writes about Newton's achievements in a way that I would expect a fan of the Beatles or Bieber would write about their subjects. If I'm right, and this is actually the case, then don't be surprised when you read this book and find Berlinski's thoughts about Newton flit in a form in kind as moth around flame. I was most satisfied by Berlinksi's final chapter \\"The Quest\\" which put focus on the future for the \\"why's\\" of the output of mathematical physicists. Here Berlinski successfully (IMHO) provides a tragectory of what to make of math endeavors in a post-Carl Sagan couched world, by gently but firmly affirming that the laws of physics are trancendent and are not arbitrary. Just as Berlinski breathlessly and lovingly demures to Newton's achievements of mind to task, so too, the rest of us look at the world around us, and through the eyes of Berlinski and Newton ponder breathlessly and lovingly to the Creator of it all."},{"Title":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World","review":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World, written by David Berlinski, is a very informative novel that seems to let you see views of the world through Newton's eyes.

While talking about one topic, he will go off on a tangent for quite a while, before going back to his original topic. The author tries to be funny, but often assumes what was taking place at certain times in Newton's life. He might mention what the weather was probably like or pointless details about how Newton was probably sitting in his bed reading with the window closed to keep out the cold air.Berlinski does cover important aspects of Newton's life and discoveries. He mentions his influences and inspirations, ranging from being struck on the held by an apple, to Euclid and Descartes, whose works spurred his imagination. Also, Berlinski covers what was going on in the world of science during the time period that Newton was making his famous discoveries and working diligently on new ideas. The author also explores challenges that Newton faced, as well as adversaries that tried to stand in his way or beat him to his goal.

In his note to the reader Berlinski explains that the goal of his retelling of Newton's story is to give the reader a sense of Newton without becoming tedious and getting caught up in the mundane. This book sheds light onto influential factors in Newton's career and the adversity that he had to overcome within the scientific community. The math explaining Newton's concepts and conclusions about science is relatively simple and easy to understand for people who don't have a doctorate in physics, which is quite welcome to the average person. Berlinski also endeavors into Newton's personal life as well as his close friendships and bitter rivals. These personal interactions shed some light as to Newton's temperament and personality quirks that succeed in Berlinski's goal to inform the reader about Newton, not just Newton's ideas and discoveries. All in all a good read."},{"Title":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World","review":"Berlinski attempts to cover up his lack of writing effort and his lack of anything to really say with flowery prose.

In trying to add intuitive meaning to the mathematical aspects of simple physics it utterly misses the mark while boring the reader to death. I can only assume that a lay person would be thoroughly confused by the meandering, 'poetic' and intangible descriptions used to pad these chapters.

The author here does that throughout this book. Here's one example- \\"the halter of specificity has been imposed on heretofore disorderly concepts.\\"My other strong objection to this book is how the author takes an active voice asserting his own (incorrect, in my opinion) philosophy. He does this in numerous ways in numerous places throughout the book. For example, he indicates Aristotle's philosophy as something that Newton needed to overcome, instead of recognizing Aristotle's role as the originator of the scientific method. As another example, the author states that Newton's religion, Arianism is \\"heresy.\\" He says this despite the fact he admits that Newton kept his religious views to himself. How did the author determine Newton's religion? For that matter how did the author determine anything? The book has no bibliography, much less footnotes.Finally even Newton's scientific work is undercut by the author's poor views on this subject. For example, the author sees an arbitrariness in the fact that Newton's laws \\"favor\\" a straight line. The author asks \\"why a straight line?\\" and claims Newton had no answer."},{"Title":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World","review":"Before Newton, things which we take for granted such as the motion of the planets about the sun, the motion of a tossed object as it moves in a parabolic arc, and the motion of an apple falling from a tree were, at best, partially understood and taken as disparate fields of study. After Newton, these three phenomenon were understood to be the result of gravity which applied on earth, in the air, in the heavens above.Along with universal gravitation, Newton discovered and brought together all particle motion and quantified that motion into three simple laws. (F=MA, inertia, forces acting in pairs). Nearly four centuries later, Apollo 11 rode these three laws to the moon.That Newton integrated these things was accomplishment enough, but while doing so, he invented an entirely new field of mathematics (calculus) which gave us the mathematical tools to quantify both the affects of gravity and nearly every other motion in the universe.This was accomplished by a man who worked alone and by candlelight within chilly stone walls. He had no particle accelerators, he had no computers, but he had a mind which was unique in history, and it was enough to make him a legend who will exist forever. This book tells the story."},{"Title":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World","review":"Berlinski's gift is getting inside the genius that was Newton and explaining (in a narrative readable by non-mathematicians) the beauty of Newton's logical theory of the universe. Not intended as a thorough survey, the text nevertheless covers the highlights of the development of Newton's thought as well as a straightforward exposition of the critical aspects of the Principia. Berlinski is erudite, literate and witty in what could be dry material, though he occasionally puts himself in mind of his protagonist more than his research supports. On balance, though, this is a readable, fascinating and enlightening little volume about a character who most of us haven't thought about since high school physics class, yet who arguably has had more influence on our world than any other scientist/philosopher in history."},{"Title":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World","review":"David Berlinski has created a marvelous intellectual history focusing on the progression of Newton's epic breakthrough thinking.

It is also not an exhaustive biography, or a detailed treatment of Newton's ideas. This info is easy to find. Much rarer is a good synthesis view aimed at a popular audience.For those who never studied math or science beyond college survey courses, this book is a gem. Berlinski provides a rich sense of Newton's personality and times. More importantly, he explains some of the questions Newton asked, how he answered them, and the implications of some of those answers. Berlinski does this in a manner that is engaging without seeming weighty or tedious.I am a lifelong learner who never finished college. I found math difficult and impenetrable because my central question, \\"How do I use it\\" was never answered. With age and experience, I found that I needed math, particularly calculus, to answer many of the practical questions I pondered. I've read a number of books that dealt with what calculus does, but never found a useful explanation of what it IS.Berlinski shows us how calculus was made possible by Descartes' coordinate system, explores the fundamental questions that led Newton to calculus, and show us how Newton tied it all together. The real gift is that Berlinski does this in a comprehensible way,with concise illustrations and a clear, logical progression. The math is in the Appendix, for those who wish to delve deeper.I wish the author had recommended some further reading, but he does comment on several editions of \\"Principia\\" in footnotes.I find myself re-reading sections as I ponder the concepts.

Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. There were three main problems.The first was that the writing was far too cute for my taste. This was true for both the history and the math sections. The author seemed to be straining to find clever and erudite ways to say things. I assume the intention was to add color and interest to the text, but I found it cumbersome and irritating.The second problem was that the author frequently flicked off allusions to the inner thoughts and motivations of Newton and other partipants in the story. I couldn't tell if there were any historical bases for his interpretations, or if they were just Berlinski's flights of fancy. It came across to me as gossipy and catty.The third problem was that with all the cute writing, the book actually contained very little information. I thought it could have been tightened up to about 50 pages, and been much more readable.The good news is that the book is a very fast read."},{"Title":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World","review":"Isaac Newton is the largest figure in the history of science, the author asserts. His PRINCIPIA brought mathematical physics into existence. Newton was born in 1642 and died in 1727. A posthumous child, he was born the year Galileo died. He had frightening mental powers and mechanical gifts. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1661. The curriculum was Aristotelian and Newton ignored it. He was self-taught in mathematics and natural history. He was excited by Descartes, analytic geometry. After four year at Cambridge, Newton was exiled to the countryside at Woolsthorpe for sixteen months at the time of the plague. He continued his solitary studies. The year spent in isolation was fruitful. Newton used both Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Galileo's laws of freely falling objects. Both Leibnitz and Newton discovered the leading ideas of calculus independently, but the discoveries were not quite comparable.In 1667 Newton returned to Cambridge, spending twenty-seven year there. His passion for mathematics had exhausted itself. Newton discovered that gravity could be extended to the orb of the moon. At age twenty-seven Newton became the Lucasian professor of mathematics. In the 1670's Newton lectured on white light, (the particle theory of light). In 1670 he designed and made a small reflecting telescope. He was made a member of the Royal Society.Hooke wrangled with Newton over his theory of color. In 1684 Newton produced ON THE MOTION OF BODIES IN AN ORBIT. Newton spent the next two years composing the PRINCIPIA. He delivered the manuscript to the Royal Society in 1687. It covers Newton's law of inertia, law of acceleration, law of action and reaction, law of absolute time, and law of absolute space. The treatise is both mathematical and physical. It explains change in the universe. Newton succeeded Hooke to the presidency of the Royal Society. THE OPTICS was published in 1704.At the end of his life, Newton reinvented himself as a civil servant, Master of the English Mint. He sought to break the wheel of counterfeiting. The Appendix is termed a descent into detail by the author. There is also a Newton chronology and an index at the close of this engaging book."},{"Title":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World","review":"The title &quot;Newton's Gift&quot; has, of course, a dual meaning. The book is about Newton's personal gift - his intellectual powers - and his gift to all mankind through his work in Mathematics (the Calculus), Physics (working out gravitation and motion), and Optics. When I walk into Borders and see the tens of thousands of books on the shelves and realize that this still represents a small portion of the books written I think about the works that will still be in print in 300 years. Probably you could pile them up in a small stack in the middle of a small room. Newton's &quot;Principia&quot; and his &quot;Optics&quot; will certainly still be among them. I believe these are among the immortal works of humanity.Berlinski has a wonderful knack for making the arcane both accessible and lively. He has a style that seems breezy, but is more sophisticated than that and even has a bit of a shimmer to it. There are a few careless mistakes, but they won't get in the way of the story he is telling. For example, on page 33 the circumference of the circle is labeled as time, but it is the AREA of the shaded wedges that is time. The circle is distance. The point of the diagram, I believe, is that when an orbit is closer to the center it moves faster over distance, but the area between the end points of the orbit and center is that same as the area when the orbit is further away from the center and the orbiting body is moving more slowly. But anyone paying attention, I think, would see this pretty quickly.I call this an Ideaography because the biographical portions are both helpful and concise, but by no means comprehensive. And the book is not technical enough to be considered an explication of Newton's thought. But it is quite successful as a Cook's Tour of Newton's life and thought. It is ideal for intellectually awakening high school students or a quick introduction for college students. It is a most helpful way to get the door open for further study and investigation. There is a most wonderful &quot;Chrestomathy&quot; of the fundamental concepts discussed in the book and the key dates of Newton's life.However, the book could certainly have used a reading list for further study. Yes, other important works are mentioned throughout the text, but it would have been nice to have a good source for additional reading.But these quibbles aside, I recommend the book as a nice to read introduction to Newton and his work."},{"Title":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World","review":"This is not a detailed biography of Newton, nor is it a \\"pure\\" technical text dealing with Newton's great accomplishments. Rather, the author takes a quick bite at the overall accomplishments of Newton- which is inventing Calculus, propounding the laws of gravitation and the particle theory of light, with Newton's life story as the frame of reference. The result is a book which is a useful source for a quick introduction to the Life, time and accomplishments of Newton, even for the average reader without any background in physics or maths. My quibbles are the author should have put effort in explaining the science of Newton, rather than getting self-involved in writing charming prose. The author's intention was to give a \\"sense of Newton\\" to the reader, at which he succeeds. But, it doesn't give a feeling a satisfaction. It is an cross between reading a story , where some physics concepts are thrown in in a broad manner and punctuated by ornate writing. Obviously, i need to read other books on Newton to know more.Some of the \\"superficial\\" knowledge i gleaned from the book, which i quote at random are:Newton's enlargement of the binomial theorem made use of mathematical expressions known as Infinite series, which is a series of numbers that goes on forever.He invented Calculus (Leibiniz also has claim to this honour).He extended the forces of gravity to the orbit of the moon.. i.e established a connection of sameness between the gravity on earth which brings a apple down to the mystery force which keeps the moon orbiting around the earth without falling into earth.He advanced the particle theory of light, which said that light was a stream of particles moving in a straight line through space.He elucidiated his grand ideas on the nature of gravitational forces in his masterpiece \\"Principia\\". The universe revealed by principia containts particles, forces and mathematical structures. It has three specific laws of motion, two general principles of time and space. The three laws are familiar to any high school student- the law of inertia, law of acceleration and the law of action and reaction. The second law is the mysterious one which needs further explanation.; The principles of time and space wre absolute time and absolute space i.e time and space are measurable.Why doesn't moon crash into the earth, instead of orbiting around it?? - Newton's analysis begins with the law of inertia. The moon's natural trajectory in the sky is a straight line. It travels in a fixed velocity, because no forces are inducing acceleration in it. But, since the moon is orbiting circularly around the earth, there is a force on it which is continuously deforming it's path. Since the resulting path is circular, the force must be centripetal whose origin is at the centre of the earth. (eg: carousel). Based on the second law, the force makes the moon accelerate continuously towards the centre of the earth. It does not fall into the earth because it's natural trajectory (straight line) and the centripetal force of the gravity from the earth balance out, due to which the moon falls forever without falling into the earth. (rotates).Newton's universal gravity law states every material object attracts every other material object, with a force that is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of distance between them.Note, gravity is explained for what it does, what it affects, but there is no explanation for what gravity actually is. It remains a mystery.Regarding Newton's personal life- his spars with Robert Hookes, Leibiniz shows him in poor light - as somebody vindictive, vain and secretive. His successful stint as the Master of Mint, in a bureacractic role of crushing counterfieting which was profuse at that time, is an achievement unique in the sense that we do not often find a great scientist and Govt official in the same person! Also, another curious aspect of Newton's life was he never married and is widely considered to have lead a celibate life; and yes, the apple boink on his head is apocryphal."},{"Title":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World","review":"Don't be frightened. David Berlinski is a gifted writer. In \\"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World,\\" Mr. Berlinski is warm, enveloping, and rhetorically at the top of his game. He writes beautifully.Mr. Berlinski does not call himself a mathematician. His Curriculum Vitae does not list numerous and continual treatises of interest primarily to mathematicians. He knows the field, at least through three dimensional vector calculus. His mastery lets him control the level at which he presents Newton's accomplishments to the reader. Berlinski mentions that Newton himself was less a mathematician than a physicist, which in no way diminishes Newton's supreme accomplishments. Berlinski compares the approaches of Newton and Leibniz, Leibniz being superior in simple and straightforward mathematical notation -- as the scientific world has clearly followed for the last three centuries. If your aim is to advance or refresh your learning of math, you will need to proceed through additional books, some of which, by the way, could be Berlinski's own.Nor is Berlinski's intent to be a definitive biographer of Sir Isaac. If that is what you want, Berlinski gives a standard reference. Berlinski's focus is narrower. He presents Newton himself, his personality, peculiarities, personal relationships, and limitations. Are you going to like Newton as you read this book? Perhaps you will, but that is not the point. Perhaps he is not \\"likeable\\" as such. You will understand him more, and more importantly you will be introduced to his significance in the scientific world. You will find him as one of the most antisocial of men, most markedly during the so-called \\"miracle year\\" of his discoveries. Soon after becoming an eminent member of the scientific world, he loses interest in those studies and leaves it to others to advance them, turning instead to the rather mundane work of a sinecure he is given -- Warden of the Mint -- and waging a highly successful personal war against counterfeiting.In closing, let me point out the Appendix to \\"Newton's Gift.\\" Berlinski calls it \\"Descent into Detail.\\" A nice touch, since as we all know, the devil is in the details, and you can guess what the descent is into. The appendix is a rapid and overall view of the math and physical concepts in the book. The first subheading is called \\"A Brief Mathematical Chrestomathy.\\" An excellent word choice, for the reader's entry into Newton's world of advanced mathematics and the physical relationships of material bodies, benefits from the aid given by selected terms and figures to help understand the language spoken by the brilliant natives you will find there."},{"Title":"Newton's Gift: How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World","review":"In his book Newton's Gift - How Sir Isaac Newton Unlocked the System of the World David Berlinski presents us with an engaging biography of Newton.

The Rollow Sisters (Mabel, not her real name; and Lily) don't have \\"phantom limbs\\" except in some metaphorical sense that's left to the reader to puzzle out. Abandoned by every member of their family (one of them a suicide) the two young women live in a house crammed with mostly worthless junk for sale, which clutters the story itself in fascinating detail.Meanwhile, their heads are filled with another kind of clutter - attitudes, poses, bits of storylines from movies, magazines, tabloids, and a dozen other forms of popular culture. The two of them inhabit a world of imagination in a suspended state of arrested development. One of them suddenly leaves with a boyfriend in search of their mother. The other becomes strangely involved with a grieving family of brothers. Recommended for readers who like out of the ordinary and not so obvious fiction that keeps you guessing how all the pieces will eventually fit together."},{"Title":"The Phantom Limbs of the Rollow Sisters","review":"Warmhearted and assured, this debut novel sparkles.

I was aware that some animal rights advocates had made superficial, misleading comparisons between the treatment of animals on factory farms and the treatment of Jews and others in the Holocaust, and I knew that this had hurt the vegetarian/animal rights cause by giving people an excuse to avoid considering the many negative effects of animal-based diets. However, I was an early endorser of Patterson's project because I felt that we needed new, creative ways to alert people to the horrors of modern intensive livestock agriculture, and my knowledge of his character, sensitivity, and background convinced me that he would be an ideal person for this project.My confidence in his ability to sensitively carry out this project was well placed. The book is very well researched (with almost 700 end notes), and it is written with great sensitivity and compassion. Eternal Treblinka does not equate animals and people. Rather, it shows how the frequent vilification of people as rats, vermin, pigs, insects, beasts, monkeys, etc., dehumanizes people and makes it easier to oppress, enslave, and murder them. He documents many examples of this process, relating it to the treatment of slaves, native American Indians, Japanese people during World War II, Vietnamese people during the Vietnam War, and other examples.The book carefully shows how the enslavement (\\"domestication\\") of animals became the model and inspiration for all the oppressions that followed. In particular. he documents a trail from slaughterhouse production lines to Henry Ford's assembly lines for the mass production of automobiles to Hitler's methods in the extermination of Jews during the Holocaust. He also discusses the myth of Hitler's \\"vegetarianism\\"--his diet of little or no meat he often followed to reduce his chronic health problems.Throughout the book, Patterson is sensitive to the views of Holocaust survivors. Lucy Kaplan, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, has contributed an eloquent Foreword. An entire chapter profiles animal advocates who are Holocaust survivors, children or grandchildren of survivors, people who lost relatives in the Holocaust, and those who have given thought to the lessonsof the Holocaust. Another chapter, \\"The Other Side of the Holocaust,\\" discusses German and German-American animal advocates who began their lives in Nazi Germany.There is also a chapter on the exploitation and slaughter of animals as a major theme in the writings of Yiddish writer and Nobel laureate, Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904-91), many of whose characters were Holocaust survivors. The title of the book comes from a statement by one of Singer1s characters: \\"...for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka.\\"The connections between the mentality and methods behind theoppression of animals and the oppression of human beings that aredocumented in this important and timely book have great potential to stir Jews (and others) to start to apply Jewish teachings about the proper treatment of animals, and thereby to help shift the world from its present perilous, inhumane path. I hope that Eternal Treblinka will be widely read, that its message will be extensively applied for the benefit of both humans and animals, and that it will help lead to that day when, in the words of Isaiah (11:6), \\"no one shall hurt nor destroy in all of God's Holy mountain.\\""},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"Robert Cohen writes, \\"One year ago I read an author's manuscript. Today, that book is in print, and you shouldadd this one to your summer reading list: ETERNAL TREBLINKA by Charles Patterson. I have just been informed by Mr. Patterson that his Eternal Treblinka has been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. After reading Eternal Treblinka, I wrote this:The flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Portland Oregon lasted six hours. On the plane, I read the rough draft version of \\"Eternal Treblinka,\\" an extraordinary book written by Charles Patterson that equates the real life and death experiences of ten billion farm animals raised each year for human consumption to the same Nazi atrocities suffered by six million Jews who became Hitler's \\"Final Solution.\\"This is one of the best written, best researched animal rights books that I've ever had the pleasure to preview. Fresh from the memory of having read about Jews stuffed into cattle cars as they were being transported to the slaughterhouses of Aushwitz and Dachau, I myself became witness to the twenty-first century's foremost example of man's inhumanity to other living creatures. Our tortured kin. The animal holocaust.Last Thursday morning, I drove from Portland to Mount St. Helens in Washington State. I had been attending the Raw Foods Festival in Portland, and found a few hours in between my talks to visit the scene of America's greatest natural volcanic disaster. On this hot summer day, I drove across a bridge spanning the cascading Columbia River, separating Portland from Vancouver. There next to my car was a 40-foot long silver van with holes large enough to see through.Inside of the truck were dairy cows. They were packed tightly together-with no room to lie down. The cows had served man's purpose. Each individual lived her short lifetime of stress, first birthing a child who would be immediately taken fromher, then injected with hormones that would painfully stretch her udder, depleting calcium from her own bones so that she would generate enough milk to fill 100 half-pint containers for school children to drink each day. Her ancestors naturally produced enough milk to have filled just four of those same containers.The cow whose eyes I look into for just one moment would be made to suffer through hours or days of driving hundreds or thousands of miles to what was to become a dairyman's final solution.Yesterday she died a violent death shared by 10,000 of her sisters.Today she will share that same fate with 10,000 other Guernsey and Holstein cows on Route 80 or Route 66 or I-95, in Kansas, New Jersey, or Florida, on highways and neighborhoods where your children and mine sleep comfortably unaware of the predestined doom for living beings who have done nothing to merit such treatment.Tomorrow the same, and the day after that. Eternal death. Eternal slaughter. Eternal Treblinka.A holocaust occurs while meat eaters turn the other way, denying that such horrors could possibly exist. Were the German and Polish people who knew the fate of those trucked to Buchenwald and Treblinka any less moral or guilty than those who comprehend the truth about what really happens to farm animals?I followed the truck for a bit until it veered off to the left, and I continued my drive in another direction. I took the high road, and she took the low road, and her look will forever haunt me. Her body will produce 2,000 quarter-pounders for one of many fast food franchises.Her anus and cheeks, arms and legs, back and udder will be served so that others can have it their way. Today's slaughter will feed 20,000,000 people, and the year's tally of Elsie and her sisters will add up to seven billion kids meals served.I feel the slaughterhouse. I hear the screams and know their fear. I smell the sweat and blood and suffer their pain. I internalize the agony and distress of transported animals. I envision the once green fields in which these animals grazed and the cold metallic ramp and smell of warm sticky blood that flows on the slaughterhouse floor and stains the psyche of us all.I imagine the stun gun bolt to the head. The upside-down hoisting and the sliced neck artery. The animal who chokes on her blood, and the man who slices off her legs as she kicks in fear from the ensuing pain of butchery. The last fifteen seconds of a death that no creature deserves. The arrogance of a man who eats the flesh and dares not consider the origin of each bite.Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer once wrote about a man's love for his departed pet mouse:\\"What do they know-all these scholars, all these philosophers, all the leaders of the world - about such as you? They have convinced themselves that man, the worst transgressor of all the species, is the crown of creation. All other creatures were created merely to provide him with food, pelts, to be tormented, exterminated. In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka.\\"I ceased eating meat four years ago. I now look at my pet dog, whom my daughters rescued from a shelter one day before she was due to be injected with man's final solution. I have come to love her.Her name is Tykee, the goddess of fortune. Is she unlike the baby lamb or calf who is separated from her mother and shipped to the exterminator? I reflect on the Amazon parrot who recognizes me and sings \\"hello\\" when I visit my parents. Does the bird with green feathers differ significantly from the chicken with white plumage?Do they not feel pain and deserve the right to live? I cannot eat them. I can no longer be then cause for their pain, although I once was a part of their genocide. I once denied responsibility for the acts of terror that occurred outside of my vision...outside of my consciousness. Their bodies were cut into smaller pieces and were broiled, baked, and fried.Oh, that same crime of arrogance to which I now plead guilty! My penitence? Community service. I explain the act to meat eaters, and some turn their backs on me. Close their eyes. Shut theirears. Who wishes to deal with the truth and reality of death?Arriving at Mount St. Helens, I carefully read one plaque after another, taking note of performances both heroic and ironic. I consider the day that once silenced the birds and boiled to death fish in the streams. A blink in the eye of geologicaltime that stripped the landscape of the color green, divested pine trees of their needles and scattered whole trees like matchsticks across barren mountain tops.I examined the original seismographs and warnings from hundreds of scientists to the residents to evacuate their homes and come to terms with an absolute truth. I became dumfounded by the arrogance of one man, Harry R. Truman, who lived alone in a cabin aside the lake below a mountain that would soon explode with the magnitude and power equivalent to 27,000Hiroshima-type blasts.A man who declined to leave that mountain. A man who denied a truth shared by others. An arrogant man who looked death in the face and refused to respect man's destiny. I try to imagine his final moment of sensibility. At the same time, in my own mind's eye I call upon the face of a cow in a truck on a bridge.\\""},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"When I first picked up Eternal Treblinka I must admit it was with some degree of skepticism. My reservations were not about the quality of the writing or research in the book; I had high expectations in that regard and the book in fact surpassed my expectations. I was concerned that the book might be too esoteric to have any general appeal. After all, people concerned about animals in our society are a relatively small group. People with a strong interest in the Holocaust are also a small and probably shrinking group. A book that combines the two topics, I reasoned, might appeal to very few people.I was very wrong in my thinking here. This is a book with a very broad appeal. The book is not just about a single event in history (horrific as that event may have been) nor is it about the views of some \\"fringe\\" animal rights activists. This book drives at an issue central to all of human history; a problem that arguably has caused most of the preventable suffering since the dawn of civilization.Patterson adeptly demonstrates how throughout human history mankind has created a division between both their own group and their \\"inferiors\\"-both human and animal. And how that division has led to horrific abuse of both humans and animals.This is a wonderfully enlightening book, filled with overlooked and fascinating historical tidbits. Although history has never been a topic particularly interesting to me, I found myself frequently feeling compelled to stop and tell whoever was in the room, \\"Hey, did you know that..\\"Eternal Treblinka is surprising for its readability as well as its broad appeal. Somehow, Patterson managed to turn this educational work of non-fiction into something of a page-turner.This book is recommended for readers from a wide range of perspectives. Knowledgeable animal activists will find plenty of new information here. People who have some affection for animals but are on the fence regarding societal animal mistreatment will quite likely have a change in perspective after reading Patterson's unemotional and clearly well-researched historical account. This book may have a particularly powerful effect on readers who have ties to the Holocaust but who may not have given much consideration to the plight of animals. For my friends in this category, I know what their next gift will be."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"ETERNAL TREBLINKA; OUR TREATMENT OF ANIMALS AND THE HOLOCAUSTBy Charles PattersonThe title Eternal Treblinka refers to the ongoing holocaust of animals. The blindfold covering your eyes will drop while reading each chapter. Even vegans who advocate for a cruelty free lifestyle will find their eyes opening wide to the assembly line atrocities that are inflicted daily upon animals. This book is for each person who says, \\"Don't tell me. I don't want to know.\\" The time to know is now. The time to act is now. The time to become the voice of the innocent and vulnerable is now.The first five chapters of Eternal Treblinka give a historical background of humans and their treatment of animals. Humans have displayed a propensity to mistreat and degrade both animals and themselves. Usually the first step in vilifying another group or sub-group within the human species is to attribute animal-like qualities to them. This precedes the domination, enslavement, and slaughter of that group.Stewart David, who is profiled in chapter six, states, \\"If the public is allowed to remain detached from the suffering of the factory farms, animal laboratories, fur farms, steel-jaw leg hold traps, rodeos, circuses, and other atrocities, these atrocities will continue. We must make them feel the pain of the creatures whose screams are hidden behind the locked doors, out of sight, out of mind. Their language may not be understandable to others, but we know what they are saying.\\"In one chapter Mr. Patterson discusses a worker who explains that on pig farms sows are forced to live on concrete and develop such painful conditions that they can't walk. \\"On the farm where I work\\", she states, \\"they drag the live ones who can't stand up anymore out of the crate. They put a metal snare around her ear or foot and drag her the full length of the building. These animals are just screaming in pain. They're dragging them across the concrete, it's ripping their skin, the metal snares are tearing up their ears.\\" Mr. Patterson goes on to explain how worn-out sows are dumped on a pile, where they stay for up to two weeks until the cull truck picks them up and takes them to renderers who grind them up to make them into something profitable.The mistreatment of people and the mistreatment of animals are connected.The last three chapters parallel the treatment of animals and the holocaust. The slaughterhouse appears to hold the very same atrocities as the Nazi death camps. Eternal Treblinka forces the reader to face the horror of present day factory farming; it also awakens a soul to the plight of the voiceless.While the screams of these creatures are kept comfortably hidden behind locked doors, they cannot be comfortably hidden from our collective consciousness.Review by Patricia Rodriguez"},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"This book does only one thing. It makes us confront reality. The reality of animal slaughter: in all of its gruesomeness and obsceneness.The problem is that when people eat meat, they think it's just that: meat. They do not realize that what they are eating was once the flesh of an animal; they only see it as their dinner or lunch. Similarly, Nazi's did not see Jews as people; they only saw them as things that needed to be killed for a good cause.This extraordinary book parallels our treatment of animals with holocaust. Not only the slaughtering of animals, but also the exploitation of animals.The book starts off by showing us how Humans came to acquire the belief that we are supreme; above all other being on the earth. The book goes on to describe the industrialized slaughter of animals (and humans in genocide), and finally it gives profiles of holocaust survivors. These holocaust survivors can be seen as the voices of the animals; they were the animals at one point.Every few years a book comes out that completely shocks the world. A book that forces people to change their ways, forces them to question what they have believed their whole lives, forces them to ACT, to DO SOMETHING. This is one such book. For those who have been eating meat their whole lives, this book will be a rude awakening. I know, because before this book I was only considering being a vegetarian. Now I am one.I MORE than urge everyone to read this book. Living in ignorance is NOT a choice. We must expose ourselves to certain realities, this being one: animal cruelty is unjustified and wrong."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"Eternal Treblinka is a book to be loved by those who believe pursuit of the truth is the way to the most valuable things in life. It naturally will be deplored by those who wish to maintain blind faith in social fictions to the effect that all is well as long as external enemies can be smited and the markets kept operating.After defeating the Nazi Holocaust, our society expanded its own. Its holocaust against animals, nourished by 10,000 years of animal domestication, fed on the technological opportunities for managing and slaughtering animals that the Nazi Holocaust had used for managing and slaughtering human beings. The breeding for preferred traits, the exploitation and killing of \\"life unworthy of life,\\" the killing in a depersonalized fashion as a matter of daily business with machinery designed for the purpose, the talk of \\"humane killing\\"--these are defining features of both holocausts. Eternal Treblinka argues that the long-ago enslavement of nonhuman animals informed the Nazi Holocaust. One of the key technological developments along the way was the animal dis-assembly line -- the slaughterhouse -- admired and imitated for manufacture by Henry Ford, who had a relationship with Hitler based on mutual admiration, Ford's antisemitism holding special appeal for his German penpal.For some, reading Eternal Treblinka will pose problems because it reveals evil running through countless human lives that we are encouraged to consider good. For others, it will raise the difficulty that ignorance of its contents will be a sign of extreme naivete. We are each a part of the solution or the problem with regard to the animal holocaust, depending on what we choose to know and to do. Eternal Treblinka helps show us how to choose for the better."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"\\"Eternal Treblinka\\" is a very sobering read. It should be required reading in all high schools and available in all libraries. Charles Patterson's excellent book offers a riveting comparison between our historical and continuing insensitive treatment of animals and the horrific treatment of Jews in the Holocaust.Part I succinctly lays out important historical information about the influence that the domestication of animals has had on our society and the subsequent devastating impact which that has had, and continues to have, on all concerned: the animals themselves, the humans who feed upon the animals and, last but certainly not least, the entire planet itself.Part II points out the frightening parallels in the practices and rationalizations utilized in the daily slaughtering of millions of animals in the United States and the slaughtering of millions of Jews and other innocents at the hands of the Germans in the Holocaust. I lack the words to describe the effectiveness of that comparison.Part III then introduces us to people both Jewish and German whose experiences relating to the Holocaust led them to become advocates on behalf of the animals with the goal of bringing a cessation of animal exploitation in all its many forms. This leaves the reader with a glimmer of hope. But time is running out rapidly and unless our continuing support of this culture of violence against helpless, sentient animals ceases, we as a society, and, indeed, the planet itself are on a crash course with irreversible disaster.Please read this book and then pass it on. The urgency of its message cannot be over-stressed."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"I approached reading Eternal Treblinka with some trepidation. There was something confusing to me about the idea of connecting the cruelty and horror of the Holocaust, to the treatment of animals in our society. The word offensive crossed my mind briefly. How could one remotely compare the unspeakable torture the Holocaust victims endured with the suffering of barnyard animals and wild creatures?Once I began reading the book however, I was introduced to the spiritual connection Jews have always had with animals. Isaac Bashevis Singer is a strong presence in this volume and through his quoted writings and ideas, the parallels become abundantly clear.Reading Eternal Treblinka was a very disturbing experience. I found the book enormously informative and thought provoking and it stirred up realizations about myself I prefer not to face. I am a reasonably sensitive and compassionate person and I would certainly never wish to harm any living being intentionally. Yet, I now realize that my stated values and my day-to-day behaviour often contradict each other.I am an animal lover from way back. Among the cards I carry in my wallet is a membership to the Fur Bearers, a well-known animal advocacy association located in Canada. My partner and I adopted the very first dog through Montreal Greyhound Rescue the day this organization opened its doors. We treat the pets in our home with kindness, love and respect. I cringe at news stories about animal abuse of any kind. I sit down to dinner and enjoy a juicy, thick, luscious rare sirloin steak; catch the contradiction?An old expression goes, \\"what you don't see can't hurt you.\\" I don't see the suffering the cow goes through in order to make my meal possible. I don't hear the frightened mooing while she is being pulled down the conveyer belt. I don't witness the cold-hearted cruelty while the cow is being handled on the way to the butcher's knife. To me, this piece of steak came from the meat shelf in my local supermarket, all neatly wrapped in transparent plastic in the right size, ready for my consumption and enjoyment. This cow has no face. I can eat this cow because there is no personal connection between us; at least no conscious connection.We treat animals as if we were superior beings entitled to control and exploit them. Even those of us who profess to love and respect animals unconsciously debase them. We will say such things as \\"He eats like a pig\\", \\"She's as fat as a cow\\", \\"That guy is a dirty dog\\" and other such examples when making insulting comments about other humans. To demean human beings we compare them to animals.This brings us to one of the main points of Eternal Treblinka. To convince it's citizens that it was necessary to rid the world of Jews, Hitler and his Nazis referred to Jews as lowly animals not worthy of human consideration or treatment. If Hitler could manipulate his followers into thinking of Jews, and the other poor souls on his extermination list, as being in the same class as common barnyard animals; then slaughtering them is no longer a matter of conscience. Only those beings we think of as in our total control and domination could be marked for death without a second thought.There are portions in this book that are hard to read and imagine. Once or twice, I was tempted to close it altogether rather than think about the images described. I am not ashamed to admit that tears flowed down my face more than once while reading certain passages. The bottom line is the pain I felt in reading this book is nothing compared to the pain we as human beings are capable of inflicting on ourselves and other animals when we forget the connection all living beings share.Eternal Treblinka is an eye opening, thought provoking book that I highly recommend as way of gaining additional insight into the psychology of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"Book Review: Gestapo of the Human SpiritEternal Treblinka:Our Treatment of Animals and the HolocaustBy Dr. Charles Patterson1-800-758-3756 * www.lanternbooks.comISBN: 1-930051-99-9Reviewed by Karen Davis, PhD, President of United Poultry ConcernsIn memory of the Cypress hens in Florida and Georgia, who were caged, starved, and gassed to death. \\"This is best for the chickens.\\"-Leroy Coffman, Florida state veterinarian. March 10, 2002Auschwitz begins whenever someone looks at a slaughterhouse and thinks: they're only animals. -Theodor AdornoParallels between our treatment of nonhuman animals and humans considered to be less than human is what this harrowing book is about. To view such parallels as an insult to humankind merely illustrates its thesis. In her Forward, attorney Lucy Rosen Kaplan says that Eternal Treblinka should be read by all who are not afraid to understand that the suffering that humans have so relentlessly inflicted on animals over the course of our species' history is one and the same with the suffering we so often inflict on each other. Eternal Treblinka should also be read by those who shy away from this thesis.One of the values of Eternal Treblinka is that it places the Nazi Holocaust within a larger psychological and historical context. It isn't only modern capitalist society that commits the atrocities it depicts, although our society could hardly be topped. As Animal Liberation Front founder, Ron Lee, says in the book, \\"We have been at war with the other creatures of this earth ever since the first human hunter set forth with spear into the primeval forest. . . . Speciesism is more deeply entrenched within us even than sexism, and that is deep enough.\\"Treblinka was a Nazi death camp in Poland that began operating in 1942. The title, Eternal Treblinka, is taken from the meditations of Herman Gombiner, the main character in the Nobel Prizewinning author Isaac Bashevis Singer's story, \\"The Letter Writer.\\" Herman, who lost his entire family to the Nazis, is thinking about a mouse he befriended whose death he believes he caused, and his sadness leads to a larger thought: \\"What do they know-all these scholars, all these philosophers, all the leaders of the world-about such as you? They have convinced themselves that man, the worst transgressor of all the species, is the crown of creation. All other creatures were created merely to provide him with food, pelts, to be tormented, exterminated. In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka.\\"Eternal Treblinka presents theories from various thinkers including Freud, Montaigne, Carl Sagan, Judy Chicago, and Barbara Ehrenreich on the human penchant for war, violence, and the subjugation of other forms of existence. It looks at traditional methods of subduing animals in pastoral cultures, noting that \\"[c]astration continues to be the centerpiece of animal husbandry.\\" And like the infamous 20th-century psychologist Harry Harlow, who devised experiments to induce terror in young monkeys and pathologic aggression in their mothers, herders around the world separate mother cows from their young by cruel and painful means: \\"The Nuer tie a ring with thorns around the calf's muzzle, which pricks the mother's udder. . . . Lapps smear excrement on the udders of reindeer does in order to keep their fawns from sucking them.\\" The Tuareg \\"pierce the nasal septum of the calves with a forked stick that makes sucking painful.\\" They \\"cut the noses of camel and cattle calves to keep them from sucking their mothers.\\"Eternal Treblinka looks at how we use language to vilify nonhuman animals, who in turn are invoked to justify our vilification of other human beings. According to Patterson, the \\"designation of the people of Africa, Asia, and the Americas as \`beasts,' \`brutes,' and \`savages' raised the level of murderousness\\" towards them. In the 16th century, the English denounced the Hottentots in Africa as traveling in \\"\`heardes' like their animals\\" and seeming to \\"cackle like hens or turkeis,\\" which made it right and \\"necessary\\" to torture, kill, and enslave them.The voluminous record of hatred expressed by the Europeans for the nonEuropeans they encountered in the 16th through the 19th centuries, America's obsession with brain size as the measure of intelligence in the 19th and 20th centuries, the ubiquitous and iniquitous concept of \\"lower animals\\"-all this fits neatly into packages of ideas like that of the American psychologist and educator Granville Stanley Hall, who declared at the turn of the 20th century: \\"We are summoned to rise above morals and clear the world's stage for the survival of those who are fittest because strongest.\\" (Lest we think such talk is out of date, radio talk show hosts frequently ask me on the air why \\"the survival of the fittest\\" shouldn't determine how we treat other creatures; a modern code phrase is \\"top of the food chain.\\")Readers may be surprised to learn that the author of The Wizard of Oz, L. Frank Baum, wrote in the late 19th century that \\"[t]he Whites, by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are Masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians.\\" Or that Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes's father, a Harvard professor, wrote that Native Americans were the \\"red-crayon sketch\\" of manhood on a canvas \\"ready for a picture of manhood a little more like God's own image.\\" Or that the assembly-line idea came from the Chicago Stockyards so admired by Henry Ford, who adapted the stockyard principle to the manufacture of cars. Or that Ford published anti-Semitic tracts that fueled pogroms against Jewish communities in Russia and inspired Hitler, who kept a life-sized portrait of Ford in his office and praised Ford in Mein Kampf.Eternal Treblinka documents America's support for Nazi (and global) eugenics-\\"the science of the improvement of the human race by breeding,\\" in the words of poultry researcher and human eugenicist Charles B. Davenport. Foundations like Rockefeller provided extensive financial support. \\"Learned\\" American men, whom Patterson represents in short fascinating portraits, and from whose writings he quotes significant excerpts, visited German racial hygiene institutes and wrote fulsomely about the \\"clean, virile, genius-bearing [Nordic] blood, streaming down the ages through the unerring action of heredity\\" sweeping us on to \\"higher and nobler destinies.\\" In America, compulsory sterilization and castration were used to punish criminals, prevent further crime, and conquer imbecility. In the words of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1927, the principle that sustains compulsory vaccination and serving in the armed forces \\"is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.\\"American and German eugenics is an offshoot of farmed animal science. Charles B. Davenport, a chicken researcher and member of the American Breeders' Association, was the director of the Eugenics Record Office established in 1910 on Long Island; his colleague, Harry H. Laughlin, was also a chicken breeding experimenter, as was Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS. Other high-ranking Nazis translated the language and procedures of farm animal experiments into human improvement and annihilation programs designed to \\"eliminate inferior blood,\\" \\"free people from the burden of the mentally ill,\\" \\"lure victims into gas chambers, kill them on an assembly line, and process their corpses.\\"Patterson shows how human concentration and killing centers are virtually identical to farmed animal concentration and killing centers. Tubes into which cows and pigs are driven single-file to their deaths are no different from the tubes at Treblinka and elsewhere that led from the disrobing rooms to the gas chambers, down which naked people were driven by guards using their fists, whips, and rifle butts-which is how we treat millions of farmed animals everyday. The SS called its tube leading to the death center the \\"Road to Heaven,\\" but, Patterson asks, how does their mockery differ from meat industry scientist, Temple Grandin, who calls the tube she designed for driving cattle to their death the \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"?Some will say that treating creatures badly in order to eat them is a far cry from treating creatures badly simply because you hate them, but a key point of Eternal Treblinka is that the psychology of contempt for \\"inferior life\\" links the Nazi mentality to that which allows us to torture and kill billions of nonhuman animals and human beings with no more concern for them and their suffering than Hannibal Lecter and Jame Gumb feel for their victims apart from the pleasure they derive from the taste of their victims' pain in The Silence of the Lambs. That book says that the plight of the lambs screaming in the slaughterhouses--the whole human enterprise of degradation, cruelty, and murder-\\"will not end, ever.\\"Eternal Treblinka reminds us of all those other slaughterhouses that were running alongside the human ones-the \\"[a]round-the-clock killing and butchering\\" conducted at Treblinka, Auschwitz, in Dresden, and elsewhere. In their diaries and letters, Nazi officials dwell on their meals. One writes to his wife: \\"The sight of the dead-including women and children-is not very cheering. Once the cold weather sets in you'll be getting a goose now and again. There are over 200 chattering around here, as well as cows, calves, pigs, hens and turkeys. We live like princes. Today, Sunday, we had roast goose (1/4 each). This evening we are having pigeon.\\"It's been said that if most people had direct contact with the animals they consume, vegetarianism would soar, but history has yet to support this hope. It isn't just the Nazis who could see birds in the yard, slaughter them and eat them without a qualm, and in fact with euphoria. In this respect, the persecuted Jewish communities were no different from their persecutors. In the chapter entitled \\"This Boundless Slaughterhouse,\\" we see the Jewish communities of Poland through the eyes of Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904-1991), who grew up in a Polish village, where his father was a Hasidic rabbi, before emigrating to America in 1935. In story after story, Singer describes the slaughtering of animals he witnessed in the village courtyards. In Warsaw, people brought chickens, ducks, and geese to be slaughtered. \\"The butchers began to pluck their feathers even while those creatures were still alive and wallowing in their own blood. . . Women push forward each with her fowl to be killed. Porters load baskets with dead birds and carry them off to the pluckers. This hell made mockery of all blather about humanism.\\"Growing up, Singer sought to understand the endless bloodbaths that others took in stride, and worse. He writes: \\"I had studied in the book of Leviticus about the sacrifices the priests used to burn on the altar: the sheep, the rams, the goats, and the doves whose heads they wrung off and whose blood they sprung as a sweet savor unto the Lord. And again and again I asked myself why should God, the Creator of all men and all creatures, enjoy such horrors?\\" In New York City, Singer decided-\\"A combination of a slaughterhouse, a bordello, and an insane asylum-that's what the world really is.\\"In Eternal Treblinka chickens and pigs shriek as they are being cursed and butchered. Nazis bear their souls in their letters and diaries. We read the opposing testimony of Holocaust survivors and their descendants. The artist Sue Coe's descriptions of the slaughterhouses she visited are excruciating: if people can read her account and continue to eat animals and drink their babies' milk, what hope is there? A question that is raised over and over by those who became vegetarians rather than perpetuate the legacy of butchery in their own lives, is \\"How can \`we' do to \`them' what was done to \`us' and not even recognize it?\\" Because this book shows, in the words of Albert Kaplan, that so far \\"we have learned nothing from the Holocaust.\\"Christa Blanke, a former Lutheran pastor in Germany and founder of the organization Animals' Angels, cites a link between how we treat animals and Nazism. First we strip the animals of their dignity-- \\"The degradation of the victim always precedes a murder.\\" But, we want to know, why do humans want to degrade and kill? According to Blanke, \\"because cruelty and greed always seem to get the upper hand.\\" But why? Serial killer Ted Bundy said it wasn't that he had no feelings of remorse towards his victims but that those feelings were weak and ephemeral compared to his rapacious emotions and drives. Naturalist John Muir wrote that the people he knew enjoyed seeing the passenger pigeons fill the sky, but they liked shooting and eating them more-\\"every gun was aimed at them.\\"Eternal Treblinka thus raises questions, and we long for answers. Why, in the words of Albert Kaplan, are the majority of Holocaust survivors \\"no more concerned about animals' suffering than were the Germans concerned about Jews' suffering?\\" Isaac Bashevis Singer says we pretend animals don't feel in order to justify our cruelty, but why do we want to be cruel to animals? Is comfort with cruelty, taking pleasure in cruelty, a trait that we carry from our past as part of our genetic survival kit? Why, when we have the technology to duplicate animal products with textured vegetable protein, do people continue to insist they have to have \\"meat\\"? Why do we praise technology for developing substitutes for cruder practices in other areas of life while balking at its use to eliminate slaughterhouses, which technology can do? Has Isaac Bashevis Singer's philosophic vegetarianism had any effect on modern mainstream Jewish ideas and lifestyle? And if not, why not? This is not to suggest that the Jewish community should be expected to rise above the rest of humankind, but that the Jewish response raises questions about our species no less than does Nazism.Eternal Treblinka traces an attitude, the work of a base will, that the Hitler era epitomized. It is the attitude that we can do whatever we please, however vicious, if we can get away with it, because \\"we\\" are superior, and \\"they,\\" whoever they are, are, so to speak, \\"just chickens.\\" Isaac Bashevis Singer rejected this attitude and the behavior that goes with it. The New York Times Book Review wrote of him when he died, \\"He shied from chicken soup and became a devoted vegetarian. From childhood on he had seen that might makes right, that man is stronger than chicken-man eats chicken, not vice versa. That bothered him, for there was no evidence that people were more important than chickens. When he lectured on life and literature there were often dinners in his honor, and sympathetic hosts served vegetarian meals. \`So, in a very small way, I do a favor for the chickens,' Singer said. \`If I will ever get a monument, chickens will do it for me.'\\"Like Singer's collected works, Eternal Treblinka is what Singer called \\"a deep protest against the killing and torturing of the helpless.\\" It says No to blaming God, Nature, and Original Sin for the atrocities we choose to commit against our fellow creatures, forcing humans and hens together into gas chambers and calling it a humane solution. In conclusion, Patterson writes that \\"the sooner we put an end to our cruel and violent way of life, the better it will be for all of us-perpetrators, bystanders, and victims.\\" Who but the Nazi within us disagrees? If we're going to mass murder someone, let it be him.-----------------[...]"},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment Of Animals And The Holocaust is a grim, compelling examination of the emergence of industrialized slaughter of animals and a comparison of that technology, psychology, and philosophical rationale with the genocidal, methodical, industrialized slaughter of human beings in the holocausts of the 20th century. Controversial, iconoclastic, Eternal Treblinka concludes with poignant and inspiring personal stories drawn from animal advocates of Jewish descent whose lives and families were directly affected by the Holocaust. Eternal Treblinka is strongly recommended reading for animal rights activists and a unique contribution to Holocaust Studies reference collections."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"\\"Think occasionally of the suffering of which you spare yourself the sight.\\" -- Dr. Albert SchweitzerI believe we owe it, not only to the uncountable billions of innocent animals suffering just out of sight, but we owe it to ourselves to open our minds and hearts to their plight.

I believe that this book should be read by as many readers as possible. The information can definitely impact lifestyle and raise awareness regarding the human conditon. It cohesively defines the foundation of suffering. This book certainly summarizes how the treatment of animals and nature will rightly cause the beginning of the end of our own existence. It's an absolute must read!Maria B."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"I'm trying to convince my World Studies and U.S. History teachers to use this book as a part of the curriculum. Eternal Treblinka compares the disgustingly similar Holocausts of the Jewish during World War II and of the animals throughout history. The book also gives very important background information on the history of animal abuse and who was responsible for the genocide of the Jewish. It's surprisingly easy to read and it's amazing where he gets all this information. The book is divided into three parts: A Fundamental Debacle (I), Master Species, Master Race (II), and Holocaust Echoes (III). Each part is introduced by a quote(s) relating to the topics of the chapters.\\"A Fundamental Debacle\\" talks about when animal abuse began and discusses the controversial subject of whether or not animals were put on earth for humans' needs. \\"Master Species, Master Race\\" describes what caused the Holocaust and every person responsible for carrying out the Final Solution (the scientists, slaughterhouse employees, Henry Ford, and Hitler himself) and the story of how slaughterhouses were established. Chapter three, \\"The Industrialization of Slaughter\\" includes quotes and paragraphs about the classic novel The Jungle by Upton Sinclair. And finally, \\"Holocaust Echoes\\" is comprised of the stories of animal rights activists who have been affected by the Holocaust, including Peter Singer and the Nobel Prize winner and Yiddish writer Isaac Bashevis Singer.Also, this book isn't only about the Holocaust of the Jewish; it also talks about the mass murders of the Chinese during World War II, the infamous genocide of the Native Americans, the conquest of Africa and the Philippines, the dehumanization of the Vietnamese and what happened to the Japanese during the bombing of Pearl Harbor. This is a wonderful book and anybody who's interested in history should own a copy. I learned more history from reading this book than in my history classes. I knew more about the Holocaust than my teachers did, which was handy when I argue with them. --Reviewed by Angie Lau"},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"Charles Patterson has written a remarkable book in \\"Eternal Treblinka\\" - a book in which he not only equates the suffering and killing of animals with the Holocaust but he also produces cogent historical examples of how animal suffering and slaughter over the centuries and millennia have often coinceded with the prejudices of peoples towards each other - the American colonies treatment of Native Americans, the German Nazi treatment of Jews and \\"undesirables\\" - i.e., Gypsies, Gays, Slavs and the mental retarded, and the American attitude towards Japanese during World War II.However his main examples are the comparisons between the Nazi enslavement, torture and slaughter of Jews - even their domestic animals during the Holocaust and the enslavement, slaughter and treatment of animals today. In fact the title of his book was borrowed from Isaac Bashevis' comment that \\"for animals, it is an eternal Treblinka\\", and Singer's own tales of his horror at the slaughter of animals and what happened to the Jews resonates throughout the book. It is not an easy read.Patterson also points out something that was not known to this reviewer, that Adolf Hitler was not a total vegetarian and that stuffed squab and other game birds had been included in his dinners.Patterson also cites the inspiring example of numerous Holocaust survivors and their sons and daughters who have given their own voices to the call for Animal Rights. He also warns that unless mankind stops killing animals, mankind will also be prone to murder each other.Having said that, and having given the book four stars, I must also say that I am not sure if I totally agree that the Holocaust comparison should be a centerpiece of this work, and perhaps it isn't - yet that is how it initially comes across. For any kind of comparisons dilute the total horror of the Holocaust - which without discounting the sufferings and murders of Slavs and Gypsys was in history was a singular Jewish experience.Also - being an non-vegan myself I am not totally convinced that living a total vegan lifestyle would sooth the savage beast within us. Can we treat animals better - You Bet! Can we educate those who kill deliberately or who use animals for fiendish acts, hmmmm, I'm not so sure about that. For example PETA's Ingrid Newkirk's comparison of Palestinians being treated like animals raises serious doubts about the validity of her organization, especially when the Palestinians themselves have tortured or killed donkeys and pigeons in acts of vicious animal cruelty - and have used innocent donkeys as explosive carriers to kill both animal and Israeli women and children.Still Dr. Patterson has produced a remarkable book - and one worthy of being read - if only for the historical analysis and for cogent debate."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"The book is interesting. Not much in it was new as far as factory farms etc. I was I admit a bit put off with the suggestion that all killing of animals for food is wrong, since my family has hunted for centuries in the United States and as a hunter I know what a clean kill is.Personally I would like to see the mass market feed lots and slaughter houses done away with. Even the kosher ones. Since I detest waste and believe that if someone is going to eat meat they better raise and cull it themselves and use every part of the animal from hide, to bone.Completely ignored were issues like native Americans in Artic areas where eating animals has often been the only means of survival. Or even my own Passamaquoody family from eastern Maine in times past.My challenge to anyone who believes that eating animals is always wrong is stop using any and all products, including life saving medicines derived from animals of any kind. Be consistent and risk dying for your beliefs.And how ironic that on pages 160-161 we have Professor Peter Singer who is an animals rights person, as well as a 'human' who believes disabled or sick babies up to 30 days old should be killed or allowed to die. Seems odd that he would be in a book about Nazis who did that to Jews and other humans.Why 5 stars? Because overall the book has some valuable information and I tend to take what I want from good books and ignore the rest."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"This is a very good book. My only problem with it involved a general demeaning of Christianity. The author forgets that Christians bless their food before eating it. Further, that they are called to be stewards of creation....though they have failed with Western Christianity's industrialization and glorification of scientism and produc tivity. Most ominous is the slandering of St. John Chrysostom, a giant in the Eastern, read \\"Asian\\", Orthodox Church (which, by the way, eats a vegan diet about 50% of the days of a year!) If one types \\"John Chrysostom anti-semitism\\" into one's browser there will appear a good number of sites dealing with the mistranslation that Patterson has so eagerly adopted in order to grind his anti-Christian blade. A little deeper research would have made for an even better book."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"Eternal Treblinka is inarguably a masterfully written piece of literature, not to mention a fascinating read.Charles Patterson provides us with all of components necessary for a noteworthy book, offering a well-researched, thought-provoking volume that is truly the work of a skilled author.But a paradox lies within the message that Eternal Treblinka attempts to bring, and that contradiction ultimately causes the book to fall short of its potential.Eternal Treblinka suggests that the degrading treatment of animals by humans over the course of history led to the mistreatment of humans, beginning with the brutality of ancient civilizations and culminating with the Holocaust.The book makes a strong case for changing the way humans view animals, suggesting that today's slaughterhouse mentality could easily pave the way for future genocide.But therein lies the contradiction, beginning with the deadly assumption that man is simply another animal.In reality, man's intelligence and awareness is unmatched by any other member of the animal kingdom, making him by animal law itself superior.Carnivorousness is natural. Other high-ranking members of the animal kingdom, such as the lion, kill other animals for food, and their status in the food chain is based solely on their superiority in strength and intelligence. Yet lions do not engage in acts of mass genocide against their own kind. If man is simply an animal, why should we assume that unlike any other animal, his feeding habits have an effect on his social behavior?The alternative idea, of course, is that man is not an animal in the true sense of the word, but something far beyond animal, which we refer to as human.The very mentality behind the Holocaust was the German idea that some races of people were simply animals and therefore should be treated as such. This dehumanization of entire cultures and ethnicities ultimately led to the vile crimes against humanity committed by Hitler, Stalin, and the others whose atrocities are outlined in careful detail in this book.And by helping to propogate this idea that man is simply another animal instead of the superior, some would say more highly-evolved, being that he is, Eternal Treblinka accidentally works against itself, promoting the mentality that led to the events the book hopes to prevent from reoccuring.When the threads of Eternal Treblinka's paradigm unravel, the book is more easily seen for what it truly is: a beautifully-written plea for animal rights, using the heart-wrenching details of the Holocaust to call readers into action for a completely unrelated cause."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"ETERNAL TREBLINKA has been a life-changing read. Patterson's choice of material is superb. Life changing is such an over-used term but I find TREBLINKA permeating areas of my life as small as do I myself kill the lizard the cat has wounded, or do I let it die its own death outside beneath a green leaf?

This brilliant book exposes the hypocrisies of being a meat-eater in this day and age and challenges us to admit the truth and to change for the better.

Ordinarily I'd bypass non-fiction regarding the suffering endured by an entire race as well as the suffering of animals. But isn't that what so many others have done?With the deftness of a bona fide artist, Charles Patterson delves into Hitler's fury even before it was unleashed. Step-by-step, he takes your hand and holds it long enough to capture your heart. And then he lets you breathe.His comparison of Holocaust survivors to our mistreatment of animals is extraordinarily interesting. He backs up his words with what I can only imagine took thousands of hours of endless and exhausting research. With new vision, we see the slaughterhouses of animals and the slaughterhouses of Jews as remarkably alike. We see where Hitler got his inspiration for assembly-line killing. And in order for man to commit mass-murder, man must first mentally demote his victims. With clearer vision, we see that devaluation process unfold.No matter what position you take, this book is well worth the read. For in \\"Eternal Treblinka,\\" Charles Patterson transforms the unutterable into a readable life lesson in humanity. There are some lessons that can't be taught to the mind, but which the heart receives fully. This book made a profound impact on both my heart and mind."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"I read a lot of reviews about Charles Patterson's book, \\"Eternal Treblinka\\" before I actually read the book, so I was expecting something thought-provoking and controversial, to be sure. I was not disappointed. I know there have been many who have been offended by the comparison of mankind's treatment of animals to the Nazi's treatment of the Jews, and I can understand why. But on the other hand, the parallels that Mr. Patterson draw in this book are compelling, and seen from an objective, not emotional, point of view do make sense.I've also heard of the protests where meat-eaters object to being likened to Nazis, and I'd like to point out right now that no such correlation is made in this book. It seems that many of the critics of \\"Eternal Treblinka\\" have not bothered to read the book.There are many other sociological parallels that can be drawn in regard to our treatment of animals and their systematic slaughter from mere existence, but given Mr. Patterson's background, this is the one that makes sense to write about. What emerges from the pages of horrifying stories (both of animal abuse and human abuse) is a compelling argument for an open and critical discussion of our role, as humans, in the world and how far our dominion over other creatures really stretches.I was surprised to learn that so many animal rights activists are either survivors of the Holocaust, or family members of survivors (or, in many cases, German citizens who were on the \\"safe\\" side during the war). These personal stories are moving, and the fact that these people can extend their sanctity for life beyond humans is truly inspiring.This is a wonderful book. Hard to read in the way it's hard to face any tragedy and stare it down. Well worth it though. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"Charles Patterson is relentless in his pursuit of the truth about man's treatment of animals. It takes a lot of integrity to write a book like this, to be so relentless. It made me cry to read it. But this is more than a book about man's treatment of animals. It is really about the values and morality of our society. This book/author deserves a Nobel prize."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"A vegan roomie lent me this book, and I was reluctant to read it, but decided I would, just so that I could have the pleasure of finding the fallacies in it and have something to argue with her about.Contrary to what another reviewer has written, this book does not EQUATE the suffering of animals with the Holocaust. It COMPARES them. Man is not a mere animal, and there is no \\"equality\\" there to speak of, and anyone who insists there is, or that there SHOULD be is just not someone that you can respect for their intelligence or ability to differentiate. But then the whole concept OF \\"equality\\" has been so hacked to death by politicization and greedy agendas over the years, it really is devoid of any meaning now.What make this book amazing are the historical and anthropological aspects of the arguments it makes. The proposition that man has learned the qualities that are necessary to brutalize man using the necessary subjugation of animals as a model, over time, and as man transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agrarian societies is one that must not be dismissed, and should be taught to children. It had never occurred to me, and a big light went on when I realized the implications of this, from a sociological and psychological perspective.I was VERY skeptical, but this IS a rational and compelling book, it makes sense, it isn't a whacky leftist tree-hugging PC work at all. If that's all people get out of it, well, that betrays their own childish and narrow polarizations. This book is so much more. It gives key insights into what we are as human beings, and what it is that we are actually DOING to ourselves. Really, it shows you how things are hooked together in the human psyche, what we have been, where we've gone, and where it is we may end-up.It's disturbing too. Very. But not gratuitously so in any way. The author is morally and rationally compelled to inform and educate, and he does this with surprising clarity and tact, never coming off as preachy or judgmental, just very passionate and urgent and calm. I found myself respecting his more radical choices and frankly, forever changed. It changed me. To the core.Give it a try, it's extremely interesting and informative at the least; at the most it is a call to change and question and transcend the past into a better, more HUMANE future."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"There is no doubt in my mind that Charles Patterson has written a great book. It is seldom that such acomprehensive work of scholarship springs from a heart of compassion in the service of a nobleand necessary idea. All of the ingredients of his thesis&#65533;that the oppression of animals serves asthe model for all other forms of oppression&#65533;have been available to thinking people forgenerations, but it remained for Patterson to pull them together into a case for animal rights that weas a species cannot afford to ignore.We live in a very sick world. Many alternative therapies work backwards, treating the mostrecent disorder before uncovering the older ones, like peeling the layers of an onion. It is myhope that in peeling away the layers of oppression in our society&#65533;the oppression of blacks, ofwomen, of gays&#65533;we have finally reached bedrock: the oppression of animals, and that this, thefinal civil rights movement, is at last on the agenda. May this book help to make it so!"},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"Reading Charles Patterson's THE ETERNAL TREBLINKA: OUR TREATMENT OF ANILMALS AND THE HOLOCAUST is a shattering experience. If Patterson's postulates are true, and he has carefully researched and documented with copious footnotes the facts he so bravely reveals here, then we as a global society need to take responsibility for the horrors against fellow man we so willingly assign to 'others', never ourselves. The parallel of man's treatment of animals from Genesis to the present and the recurring genocides of humans is stated early on in this wise book: \\"Not only did the domestication of animals provide the model and inspiration for human slavery and tyrannical government, but it laid the groundwork for western hierarchical thinking and European and American radical theories that called for the conquest and exploitation of 'lower races,' while at the same time vilifying them as animals so as to encourage and justify their subjugation.\\" And later, \\"Throughout the history of our ascent to dominance as the master species, our victimization of animals has served as the model and foundation for our victimization of each other. The study of human history reveals the pattern: first, humans exploit and slaughter animals; then, they treat other people like animals and so the same to them.\\"Patterson traces our carnivorous society to the Ice Age when plants were no longer available for food and animals became the source of staving off hunger. From this beginning he traces the gradual herding, forced breeding, selective trashing of the weak and infirm, sterilization techniques, American Indian genocide and slavery practices throughout the world as well as in America, slaughterhouse productions lines (suggesting that Henry Ford who made assembly line production popular and who was one of Hitler's few heroes forged the way for models for the extermination camps of the Nazis) - all steps from the abuse of animals to the extermination of peoples in such a way that we as readers are forced to reflect on what we have always considered as atrocities that shamed other countries and societies are actually rooted in our own history.Good books make us think. Patterson writes so well that despite his historical didactic approach to this uncomfortable subject, it is difficult to put this book down. Many may not wish to finish reading his tome, but everyone should be made aware of its postulates. In the midst of his documentation of his theory he places an utterly poetic tribute of a chapter to Isaac Bashivus Singer, the Nobel Prize laureate for literature in 1978. Singer was a vegetarian and a poet of kindness and Patterson seeks to imbue hope in his readers by emulating Singer's visions.THE ETERNAL TREBLINKA is an important book and if we are to learn from history to prevent repetition of past sins then this surely stands as one source of instruction.

I found it incredibly enlightening with respect to human nature. Up until recently, I have held the belief that people are essentially good and will do right when given proper information and opportunity. But Patterson's book reveals a more base and far less noble side to humanity by delving into our history of brutality against other animals and one another.Through the history of the Holocaust and our relationship with animals, Patterson addresses issues of dominance, our unwillingness to speak out against evil, and reveals our skill for \\"ignoring\\" and \\"rationalizing\\" atrocities which occur all around us. I found this quote particularly poignant:\\"I was revolted and saddened at the savagery of our species. I came to realize that humankind has a very thin veneer of civility on top of millions of years of evolution that evidently genetically predisposes us to brutality and senseless savagery.\\" - Peter MullerI can only hope that humankind will continue to evolve and that this \\"thin veneer\\" of civility will grow into a thick, strong, compassionate, non-violent way of life as more people open their eyes and take responsibility for what we are doing to animals.One of the people interviewed for the book expressed disillusionment because her church showed no interest in animal abuse issues. She says \\"I think how 130 years ago the church remained silent about the slave trade because they were only black people. Fifty years ago the church remained silent because they were only Jews. Today the church remains silent because they are only animals.\\"Today, we think, \\"how could ANYONE have stood by and said nothing during the Holocaust, or the Slave trade?\\" but we are ALL doing it RIGHT NOW! Just standing by, thinking: oh, well it's the food chain, or oh God gave the animals for our use, or oh, I only buy \\"humanely\\" slaughtered animals (as if there is such a thing!) or worse...we whine, \\"But I LIKE cheese or meat\\" - as though our desire for a particular flavor trumps the right of billions of animals to a life free from torture, enslavement and murder.Someday we will hopefully see that it is all connected.

This extremely well-written and researched book is eminently readable and Charlie's passion for the subject matter shines through on each page."},{"Title":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust","review":"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust is an extensively documented book in which Charles Patterson looks at the similarities between our species' treatment of nonhuman animals and the Nazi holocaust.Patterson shows how humans, by thinking of themselves as superior to the other species, distance themselves from other animals resulting in the exploitation of nonhuman animals, who are domesticated, enslaved and used for various purposes.Humans have looked upon (and still look upon) nonhuman animals as inferior beings that don't possess souls, speech, reasoning and therefore feelings or sensation. This view has made it easy for some to cruelly treat, kill and eat them. Patterson describes how slaves were treated similarly to domestic animals.By designating some people as animals during the Nazi holocaust, humans were able to persecute, exploit and violently deal with their own species. Patterson states that referring to humans as animals \\"...is always an ominous sign because it sets them up for humiliation, exploitation, and murder,\\" and he cites numerous examples of races referred to as animals during times when they were exploited, treated brutally, killed and even exterminated.Patterson then turns his attention to large scale violence against both nonhuman and human animals in both the United States and Germany. Some of this violence was due to the American eugenics movement, which, according to Patterson, was in part inspired by the breeding of domesticated, nonhuman animals, and the creation of assembly-line slaughter in America which later \\"...crossed the Atlantic Ocean and found fertile soil in Nazi Germany.\\"In 1939 the eugenics movement in Germany included killing mentally challenged people and those with emotional and physical disabilities. Many of the people instrumental in these mass murders came from a background in animal agriculture. According to Patterson, the eugenics movement, sterilization and murders combined with the mass industrialized slaughter of nonhuman animals led to the Nazi \\"Final Solution.\\"Patterson points out that the Nazis treated their victims like animals before murdering them.. Dehumanizing the victims made it easier to murder them.By looking at how humans have treated nonhuman animals and other humans seen as inferior, Patterson effectively illustrates how the Holocaust occurred and how similar atrocities occur every day in slaughterhouses and factory farms.The final part of the book looks at Jewish and German people whose advocacy on behalf of nonhuman animals was influenced by the Nazi Holocaust. In order to create a kinder, more compassionate world, our species must make peace with the nonhuman animals with whom we share the earth and give them the respect that they deserve.Every so often a book is written that has the potential to make an incredible difference.
