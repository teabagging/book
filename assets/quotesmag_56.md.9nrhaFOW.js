I just wanted to get it over with. The book just seems to be preaching about all of our human pitfalls. Yeah, no kidding - we see that that every single day on the news and on every so-called reality TV show. I won't be reading any more from this author."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is the best book ever written. What else needs to be said? Lewis artfully mixes Platonism, Orthodoxy, and Imagination to the benefit of the reader. A tale full of deep Christian metaphors. Lay mysticism at its best."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Very disappointed in the audio book, it's like trying to listen to a Theatrical Movie with a British accent that was hard to understand. I feel like it was 10% good and the rest of that 90% just filler."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"On an artistic level I would personally rate this work by C.S. Lewis very poor. Characters are two-dimensional. Plot is developed from the perspective that Christianity is the only truth, Heaven and Hell exist for a certainty, and that there is justification for eternal damnation for those who won't see the light. Due to the heavy moralizing, this is more like a religious pamphlet than a work of fiction. Then, why four stars? Despite what I perceive to be flaws in this book,there are some extremely penetrating representations of rationalizing, manipulative behavior. These little vignettes of lost souls willfully denying joy to themselves and trying to deprive others of it also, leaves a haunting impression that Lewis has truthfully revealed the modus operandi of much of mankind. We are allowed to eavesdrop on some conversations between the saved and the damned in which it is obvious the lost souls actually prefer remaining in the Hell they have created for themselves rather than give up their obsessive behavior. Whether or not we agree this is grounds for eternal damnation, I think there is a good lesson here, illustrated quite effectively, to work toward honest relationships free of game-playing. On further reflection, I think this title more worthy of three stars due to the dreary blend of moralizing and fiction."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Not only does \\"The Great Divorce\\" contain too many abstract allegories, but what makes it worse is these allegories are also inaccurate and in some cases false considering this book is written by a Christian author, who seems to believe in hell as being equivalent to annihilation, as alluded near the end of the book. This book talks about C.S Lewis trying to describe the characteristics of people who are supposedly in heaven and hell, much too-humanized ones to the point that they sound bland and dull; those in hell represented by the characters called \\"the Ghosts\\"; and those in heaven represented by \\"the Spirits\\" by contrasting their joy and misery; happiness and sorrow; love and hatred; charity and malice, respectively. He is trying to put together the secular and biblical views into these characters and the result is ugliness and awkwardness. Even for readers with a great imaginative power to interpret what the true meaning behind the conversations and events surrounding these Ghosts and Spirits is, I still doubt they would be able to resolve the ambiguity. Heaven and hell are the subjects that require more careful and studious efforts to illustrate than what Lewis has done here. For those who are interested in them, I have not read any good fictions about them, but I would suggest Jonathan Edwards' \\"Heaven: A World of Love\\", and \\"The Justice of God in the Damnation of Sinners\\" or his famous \\"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,\\" that readers could access online free of charge. Among many other books that Lewis wrote, some of which are excellent ones, but this one is to be avoided."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I find C.S. Lewis to be a mixed bag. Sometimes he is incredibly insightful, especially on the foibles and depth of human nature and sin (see Screwtape Letters). However, he has some serious difficultly presenting certain doctrines of Christianity well, esp. Predestination/Free Will, simply because he works very hard to make sure it is above all *reasonable*. Many Christians believe in a higher standard above reason (the Scriptures), and some have found that it makes statements that just cannot be made reasonable to the critic without screwing up their meaning.The Great Divorce is an example of this. His presentation at the end of Free Will and Predestination is utterly unhelpful, having people choose and yet having the people be little more than chessmen on a chessboard shows forth the meanderings of a human trying to grope something God did not fully reveal to us. If you are looking for an answer drawn from the Bible on the subject of Free Will and Predestination, I would encourage studying Romans 9 and Chemnitz' presentation in The Book of Concord, Formula of Concord Solid Declaration, Article XI.However, he does do an excellent job portraying humans sinfulness and rejection of eternal life in a very artful way. For this, I give the book 2 stars. I deeply regret having read this as my first dive into Lewis (I loved Screwtape Letters, give that two thumbs up)... I found the Bible's answers far more mysterious and satisfying."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I tried to get into this literary classic and just couldn't quite understand it. It came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine because he knew I had just read and enjoyed Rob Bell's, \\"Love Wins\\". Apparently Lewis and Bell think similarly on issues relating to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife. But, there was just too much use of allegory and symbolism in \\"The Great Divorce\\" that I couldn't bring myself to finish it simply for a lack of understanding on my part. If I can't understand a book then I don't see the sense in continuing to read it. And, so I reluctantly stopped reading this one about halfway through. If you have no problem understanding allegory, then I recommend this book. But, if you are like me and find it difficult to understand allegory, then save yourself the time and read Love Wins instead."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Having read Mere Christianity and Miracles by C.S. Lewis and having loved both, perhaps I was unprepared for the fantasy, The Great Divorce. The two former works were 5-star hallmarks of lucidity which I found deeply influential, but this book introduced unneccessary things which discount the seriousness of the subject matter. Describing a bus trip from Hell to Heaven, C.S. Lewis' primary goal is to inform the reader of the various ways our imperfect beings embrace the former and reject the latter. All well and good. But, why C.S. Lewis (unless in a nod to Narnia) decides to include unicorns and earthly hauntings I know not. To put it simply, a man who so cogently argued in favor of God and the existence of miracles abrubtly decides to provide an utterly fantastic rendition of Heaven populated with the frivolous imagery of horses with horns! I was left wondering why not a jack-a-lope? And why not a flying saucer in which we might reach it?My disappointment lies not with the book itself for, taken alone, it provides useful insight, but in it's departure from a cherished framework. I have come to see Lewis as a provider (or at least a seeker) of truth. That we in The Great Divorce then descend into whimsy is somewhat surprising. I am not saying that the book has no merit. To the contrary, it is a fine portrayal of the hidebound pettiness of which we are all capable. Indeed, were one to read The Chronicles of Narnia first, one might find little to carp about. However, if one reads The Great Divorce as presented, in series with Lewis' works of Christian apology, then it is of no amazement should one be taken at least slightly aback.The Hereafter is, by definition, beyond the reach of temporal description (Lewis himself declines factuality in his preface). But, mythology need not be the place holder for fact. Perhaps (and just perhaps) our conceptions of Heaven and Hell are better served without unicorns and other fanciful fluff. They present, after all, a bit more of a leap than may be required. Let us stick to the meat of the matter. 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Okay, I admit that I probably shouldn't even be reviewing this book, I'm not in the target audience. For those who are in the book's target audience, I'm sure it is a wonderful book. If the description \\"enjoys Christian allegory\\" fits you, ignore my bad review and read the other reviews. All I'm saying is that for me, it was so boring I couldn't hardly finish it. I only read it because a Christian friend gave it to me.Just a few other small comments. In his introduction, Lewis finds it necessary to remind the reader that it is allegory, and he is not trying in any way to factually describe the afterlife. In fact he says, \\"encouraging factual curiosity of the afterlife is the last thing I want to do\\". Well, um, then what's the point? Though I maintain being agnostic, but I have to admit I lean more towards atheism. One of the reasons being that no one has presented, to my mind anyway, a plausible scenerio for what the afterlife is really like. An infinite life where there is presumably no pain or evil, would have to be inherently very different from our mortal existence. So different if such does exist, then it seems difficult to imagine any purpose to this very limited existence we have here. After all, a billion years from now, are you going to be sitting around heaven talking about the time your aunt died or something? I'm wondering if the reason Lewis doesn't want to \\"encourage factual curiosity\\" about the afterlife is because that when one tries to ponder it factually, it seems rather implausible.I think that a Christian would say that a quote late in the book more or less sums up what Lewis is trying to say. Lewis says that \\"there are two kinds of people, those that say to God 'thy will be done' and those that God says to them, 'thy will be done.'\\" Well, don't take the following statement as \\"bashing\\" Christians, I am fully aware that by and large, Christians are fine people. But of course there are those that claim to be Christians that don't seem like such fine people. My only point in this is that I basically reject that there is some intrinsic difference between those that choose to be Christians and those that don't. The point of the book is to try to show this supposed intrinsic difference, an intrisic difference would would last for eternity, which I reject exists. I reject Lewis' premise. I'm just in general not a big fan of allegory. And even Lewis himself says it says nothing about the real form of heaven and hell. So for me, it was a boring, useless waste of time. But if you are a Christian and like allegory, well, ignore me, I'm sure you'll like the book.NOTE: At the time of this edit of my review, I've got 0 out of 4 helpful votes. I guess I shouldn't be surprised as I'm giving a negative review of a popular book. But the point is - is my review actually helpful? And I think it is. I freely admit that those in the target audience will like it and I explain why I don't like it. That's what's called a GOOD review folks - don't say it is a bad review just because you don't like my opinion!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Once again, CS Lewis captivates the reader with an excursion into an imagined hell and an imagined gateway to heaven.

It's an incredible book - one that inspired deep discussion. It really makes you focus on your own short-comings and how those might back up on you in the after life. CS Lewis was masterful at writing characters - you know who these people are, you know what motivates them. The narrator's perspective is so interesting. I honestly learned a lot about myself and about my view of heaven - it's a choice we make. Do we want to live there? Or do our weaknesses - desire for acclaim, desires for substances, desires of superiority - disqualify us for that existence? Compelling, yet easy read. When he mentions that notable people in heaven are not who were notable on earth - it was thought provoking.

I can't even begin to describe the insight and wisdom Mr. Lewis displays in this little book.

The story of one soul's experiences is told first hand by a ghost making its way from Hell onto this plane. There, it and those that came with the ghost encounter more radiant beings that have obtained a closeness with God and come from a place beyond the mountains. These spirits converse with the ghostly entities. For the most part, each chapter focuses on a conversation between one ghost and one spirit where the actions of the ghost's earthly life that have kept it from heaven are examined. The points Lewis makes are sharp and intriguing. The work itself is short and can be quickly read. I found this book to be both very interesting and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Perhaps you've read the Great Divorce and never really considered what a great way it is to introduce folks to your faith. For those in your life who consider themselves above your faith, offer them a time tested and revered author.The name certainly doesn't give away your motive. C.S. Lewis is considered a great author in almost all circles, and the book is just unclear enough to keep them holding on through the entire reading. Lewis' writing style and use of the King's English are also seemingly sophisticated and offers another reason for your unsaved friends to read the book.If you've never read the book, jump in. It's short and somewhat whimsical. It conveys a serious message of understanding your relationship with the eternal life given to each person.

In this book, CS Lewis gives you a glimpse of hell, and a glimpse within your own soul in ways that will have you relating completely to the characters. CS Lewis does a magnificent job of illustrating the denials and rationalizations that are faced by society, and even though this book was written decades ago, one can see the timelessness of his message. One must be ever vigilant! It is an insightful commentary on our human nature and often our obsession with being self-centered. Without you knowing it, CS Lewis touches on some basic theological issues, but without what some would consider his usual &quot;headiness&quot;. This book, along with The Screwtape Letters can serve as a good introduction to the writings of C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This seems to be the question that powers the engine of this classic novella from C.S. Lewis. Of course the answer is, why should it? Creation is not ours to control, something Lewis seems to hint at with the impenetrable nature of the garden the bus passengers visit at the tale's opening. Inspired by a science fiction story, Lewis crafted a fantasy of his own that explores the rather petty nature of humanity that keeps our eyes (or souls) closed from the beauty of creation. The book features some splendid yet amusing passages (Unicorns in Heaven? Cool!) but it does not skip over the meatier issues of faith, free will, and the traps that they are capable of creating in our oft times bitter hearts. One thing I found ironic is that the one star reviews put forth some of the very same arguments made by some of the rebellious ghosts in this allegory. I think that is the very point Lewis hoped his fantasy would make. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis makes it clear in both the introduction and in the narrative itself that he is not trying to convey a literal protrait of heaven and hell. But the imagery he uses - hell as a dreary, gray town where nothing is worth doing, heaven resonating with natural beauty and awesome fantasy - has the feel of something as close to the reality as we can probably imagine while still here on earth. An incredible book!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I think this is one of Lewis' very best. He attempts in this work to paint a picture of heaven and hell based on his understanding on Christian theology; and what a picture it turns out to be! I found myself captivated from the beginning with the author's depiction of the confines of hell and its inhabitants, which then become a perfect foil for the soul-lifting glory of heaven that he goes on to describe. What makes the work so powerful is the believability of the picture that is painted, despite its speculative nature and imaginative leaps.The book has something to offer to everyone. Heaven and hell become platforms from which to probe the depths of human morals and motivations. Every reader will find himself/herself identifying with one or more of the caricatures compelling constructed by the author. The picture of heaven itself and what it represents (read and find out for yourself!) is enough to provoke thoughts about purpose of the earthly life. The fictional nature of the book allows Lewis to convey a Christian message about heaven and hell without coming across as preachy or high-handed.A masterful combination of Christian theology, vivid imagination and excellent prose. I cannot recommend this book more."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis himself says in his preface, &quot;The last thing I wish is to arouse factual curiosity about the details of the after-world.&quot; This book kept me wondering just what he WAS trying to say--whether he thought there were choices after death, or whether he was just trying to get us to think about life and the terrible seriousness but potentially glorious finality of our choices. If you are the kind of person who believes common 90s philosophies like, &quot;That's YOUR reality but not mine,&quot; you should let Lewis tell you a little story. Aside from being very entertaining, it cuts right through a lot of &quot;intellectual&quot; nonsense, and makes you really THINK, maybe for the first time &quot;outside the box&quot; you didn't know you were in.In the end, I believe he makes it clear that there are no choices after death. His characters are simply acting out the choices we make within the boundaries of time here on earth, with the element of time removed from the story as it plays out in &quot;heaven&quot; and &quot;hell.&quot; While you are caught up in the story, you will be in another whole &quot;world&quot; of Lewis's creation, and will be surprised to find yourself back on earth at the end--but you'll now see it (for a while at least) through different eyes. Reality is absolute, and what is seen is the least real of all."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"William Blake wrote of the marriage of heaven and hell and in this splendid fantasy novel Lewis becomes judicator of the divorce. The narrator joins a bus queue in a perpetual sunset kafkaesque town and takes a trip to heaven where any can stay and go to the mountains if they repent and trust. Lewis hits the mark at describing our fallen psychology. As Dante had Virgil as guide so our narrator has Scottish author George MacDonald along on the tour. MacDonald trying to explain the choice of the lost says: \\"Milton was right,\\"... \\"The choice of every lost soul can be expressed in the words, 'Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.' ..... There is always something they prefer to joy --- that is, to reality.\\" The people from hell are shades as they all quickly discover on leaving the bus. The grass, trees, and even the water are solid and the shades from hell leave no impression. Conversely the new environment does effect them, one example being that rain drops would blast holes in them like machine gun bullets. The heavenly region they visit is much larger than hell although they don't realize it. \\"All Hell is smaller than one pebble of your earthly world: but it is smaller than one atom of this world, the Real World.\\" The reason hell is so small is that it is so full of mostly nothing. The insistence on self will leads eventually to the person becoming more and more unreal. The narrator, who is really Lewis of course, asks MacDonald about his being a Universalist, that he talked in his books as if all men would be saved. Paraphrased MacDonald says something like: Doctrines such as universalism or even predestination may be true in eternity from God's perspective and paradoxically not true in time where freedom operates and the choice of ways is before you. In eternity it may be as our Lord told Lady Julian of Norwich \\"that all will be well, and all will be well, and all manner of things will be well.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of those books I have made notes from and will probably quote in the future. Reading it, I kept wishing I had read it a long time ago. Even if you don't usually have patience to sit and read books of theology, this book and Lewis' \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" will grab your attention and make you think without realizing what's going on. C.S. Lewis wrote like no one else in our modern times."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This amazing little book explores the difficult subjects of heaven and hell and salvation and damnation with a depth that will enlarge your vision, shrink your ego, and strip away all your excuses for living lives of pretense. While accomplishing these feats, the book may just help you grow in maturity. Do not read this book if you are frightened of challenge. Do not bypass it if you are eager to stretch. I rarely come across a work with such potential to change lives. This book is worth purchasing to give out as gifts. With the recent popularity of his \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" this might be the next Lewis classic for you to read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"It begins with a character who takes a mystical bus ride to a mid-point of Heaven and Hell. (Lewis' Catholic views protrude in the area of purgatory but that should stop one from reading it.) Each proceeding chapter tells of a story of a person in Hell that has the ability to go to Heaven but chooses not to because each one is too indulged in something else. Lewis' creates a different view of Hell than the original stereotype. This book may help others realize the necessity for selflessness. One should look past the fact that there is a purgatory if one disagrees (as I do). This is not the theme of the book. Any Christian can learn a valuable lesson and new perspective."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"First I have to admit that I have not read much CS Lewis. Given his reputation as one of the premiere Christian writers of the last century I recently purchased a small stack of his signature series books. The Great Divorce is the first one I have read, and I was truly amazed by its simple, yet complex message.This book is powerful fiction with enough theology to put the gears of your mind into overdrive. In my opinion Lewis addresses two key questions in The Great Divorce - Is there a difference between heaven and hell? And, does God truly give us the freewill to decide our own eternal destination? Lewis really makes the reader ponder these two &quot;deep&quot; topics, and think about why certain &quot;types&quot; of people may have more difficulty choosing heaven over hell.I won't give away Lewis' conclusions, but instead I will highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a short, but powerful book. If you are a Christian you should definitely add this to your reading list. Lastly, if you are not a Christian, don't be afraid to read it. Lewis was a great writer by anyone's standards, and his &quot;theology&quot; is subtle enough to be enjoyed by anyone."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book was one of the launch pads into the realm of Lewis. The book, fiction though it is, requires one to follow the point of Lewis--those who do not go to heaven would not enjoy it there anyway.This book has caused unnecessary fire from people who have a terrible habit of reading \\"fiction\\" literally. This book is not canonical Scripture. Please do not think that Lewis proposes that one can travel from heaven to hell, and vice-versa. Lewis is merely trying to make a point.I would encourage readers to enjoy the book, apply the message to their lives, and not to dampen the impact with wooden literalism."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If you haven't yet read any theology or Christian apologetics, this novella is a fine place to start. If you already read such, then you know that you just HAVE to read this classic.C.S. Lewis uses a dream device, ala not only Dante and Bunyan, but also echoing of Isaiah and John, to give us a keyhole glimpse of the afterlife, albeit in more modern terms.Hell is an endless, shabby, grey city in the rain, where the quarrelsome and disputatious residents are given a chance for a bus ride to Heaven. There they must confront their sins and foibles and make the ultimate choice. Even faced with the reality of God, many are still unable to free themselves from the shackles of vanity, uncertainty, and pride!Lewis clearly is intending The Great Divorce as a metaphor, for the notion of the damned being given \\"another chance\\" and a bit of a day-excursion to Heaven is, of course, not in accord with any Christian doctrine. However, he uses the metaphor to illustrate many telling points of Christian theology, starting with God being the Great \`I AM.' The bus ride itself, and the relative sizes of things are also evocative of the extra-spatial nature of the Godhead.In summary, Divorce is a short, brilliantly-written tract and a wake-up call for many: A thought-provoking read for anyone and worth multiple readings! Get it."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book is unforgettable -- both comforting and disconcerting. The narrator, together with a busload of damned souls, takes an allegorical trip into Heaven (or at least, into the Shadow of its Valley). Here he discovers that Heaven is for all souls who truly want it, but at the price of giving up all there is of Hell within them. This price proves too high for many of the damned, who prefer to return to Hell. The thing is, many of these pitiful and lost souls who choose damnation are very much like all of us.A wonderful cautionary tale. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The book was a great price. The used books I have purchased look like new.

Lewis knows how to convey serious reflections on human behavior in a humorous way which doesn't reduce their solemn significance. He weaves out of fiction an ultra-insightful analysis of the silly reasons why we are often hell-bent on NOT going to heaven. Recognizing those reasons and concentrating on overcoming some of them changed my life for the better. &Uuml;ber-recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"With each and every book I read by C.S. Lewis, I become an ever more admiring fan. While I cannot say this is my favorite of his works (for that spot, I reserve \\"Mere Christianity,\\" followed by \\"A Grief Observed\\"), it is as fascinating and insightful a ride as any of his. C. S. Lewis is exceptional in his ability to take the most complicated human issues and make them understandable.Blending into a queu awaiting a bus ride without fully understanding to where or why (how many of us blend sheepishly with the masses this way?), the narrator, George, takes a fantastical ride through heaven and hell. Just two possible end points on this trip, and with that, Lewis makes it clear: as much as we try to rationalize and wiggle, there is no gray area in life, or, in this case, the after life. You choose. Black or white, good or evil.With a cast of colorful characters, ghostly figures and helpful angels who only wish to give the undecided one final chance to decide, we ride along with those who, we soon realize, resemble everyone we know. Including you and me. The whiner and the complainer, the cheater and the liar, the rationalizer, the egotist, the shortchanger. Even the overly devoted mother, who, upon closer examination, clings to her son more to serve her own selfish needs than to let him go in a loving manner for his wellbeing is not the marytr she believes herself to be.It is not in the big falls that we lose our way to heaven. It is, more often than not, in the petty details of our lives, all those grand intentions come to nothing, all those shortcomings and shortcuts taken, all those more challenging routes avoided, where we take wrong turns that will land us only in hell. A stern Father reminds us, \\"Your will be done,\\" rather than His. And so, for all who did not trust in Him, but stubbornly held to their own willful ways, the bus has only one last stop.As amusing as this little tale (novella) is to read, the message is heavy duty. If you don't recognize yourself in at least a few of these lost souls, look harder. And then give your future bus stop some careful thought..."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"CS Lewis great theologian or great Christian apologist as some would say was one heck of a writer.The Great Divorce C.S Lewis good as a stand alone story or as a more deeper spiritual book.

I read some of the reviews on this site, and I think that the people writing the negative ones are not in a place where they can read the book with some imagination.

Give this book a shot. I don't believe that you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"IMHO, this is Lewis' 2nd greatest book (behind Mere Christianity). Every Christian or aspiring Christian should read/listen to this book!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"&quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is the first work of Lewis involving Christian theology that I have delved into. Needless to say, while the story is put forth much the same way as Lewis's space trilogy, it does carry a large amount of theological speculations on heaven and hell. I believe the best way for an author to communicate his feelings with the reader is this way, by presenting a fictitious reality and injected into that reality the truths of our own reality. In this respect C.S. Lewis has certainly hit a home run.The story involves a man, presumably and through my thought Lewis himself, traveling on a bus ride into heaven. While there, he experiences events beyond human comprehension, coming across many instances of people rejecting the grace and goodwill of God, and instead choosing to live their live down below in the town which the narrator first departed in the bus from. Obviously, this town is hell. Milton was indeed right with his statement from Lucifer just before he was throw into the pit, &quot;It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven&quot;. This is the ideology of many of Lewis's characters in this book.While in the wonderful land, the narrator meets with George Macdonald (a hero of Lewis's throughout his life, both before his conversion and after.) McDonald takes the narrator on many trips around the land, witnessing discussions between humans and angels.Every writer has at least one great work: C.S. Lewis was blessed with the ability to produce many. &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is perhaps one of his most insightful works of fantasy/fact ever conceived. It reminded me very much of the book of Revelation, in which the Apostle John records his experiences on a deserted island. By the end of Lewis's tale, we find out that the whole thing had been a dream injected into his mind by God. We finish the tale with the promise of the narrator to George McDonalds to tell no one of his events. Classic Lewis style.This is a definite read for Lewis scholars and fans alike, and is suredly one of C.S.L.'s finest pieces of literature."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"One of my all-time favorite books. Lewis, like many didn't like the idea of hell, this book shows how he reconciled the tension between love, justice and freewill from an eternal perspective. My own novel, Hike To Heaven, written about the journey into the Kingdom of Heaven was inspired in part by this story. I also like the subtle humor and sly 'digs' in C.S. Lewis's writing.The journey begins in hell - a grey, shadowy town where people grumble, debate theology and live futile lives in the darkness. They are given an opportunity to take a trip out of town and to see the life available to those who live lives touched by grace. One notable point of this story is that heaven is a place grounded in reality. The people, mountains and even the grass are solid, tangible [the grass hurts the feet of those content to live in darkness].Some people question the theology of this book, but it's not a lecture, it's a story written to provoke thought and give insight. The message this book gives me is that we are the product of our choices. We can choose life, or live dark, unbelieving and bitter lives where we refuse to give up our lies, fears and pride.In hell selfishness leads to isolation, disgrace and deception. It is as one scholar noted, God saying, 'your will be done.\\"Heaven is glorious...the woman surrounded by the throng of animals [cats] as the walking embodiment of redeemed humanity is one of my all-time favorite images of the grace of God in action."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"\\"And those who heard it said, 'Who then can be saved?'\\" -- Luke 18:26 (NKJV)Journeys have a way of capturing our imaginations in ways that other kinds of metaphors don't accomplish nearly as well. If you've ever read The Divine Comedy, Pilgrim's Progress, Gulliver's Travels, or Robinson Crusoe, I'm sure you can easily step back into the stories and feel their effects of your perspective and motivations. C.S. Lewis accomplishes a similar result with far fewer words in The Great Divorce as he describes a bus trip from Hell to Heaven.While not theologically correct in terms of describing the two destinations (or transport between the two), the metaphor is cleverly designed to help nonbelievers and believers alike see how their attachment to what they know and to their desires to \\"call all the shots\\" get in the way of gaining something much better, a relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus.I decided to read the book after our church had a discussion of another C.S. Lewis book, and the moderator expressed concern that I hadn't read any other C.S. Lewis works. A friend in the discussion strongly recommended The Great Divorce, telling me that he frequently rereads it. I'm glad I did. This is an important book that anyone who has ever had any interest in learning more about Jesus should read. I think it will lead you onto a path of wanting to know more. What could be better than that?I suggest reading (or rereading) the book of John in the New Testament after reading The Great Divorce."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I have always considered The Screwtape Letters as my favorite of C. S. Lewis's writings, but now I think that book might have to make way for The Great Divorce. I have just finished reading in and have found it to be even more insightful that Screwtape, though with none of the humor. The Great Divorce is a story about Heaven and Hell, perhaps similar in theme and intent to Dante's Divine Comedy and others, though the Heaven and Hell that Lewis portrays is not much like the conventional pictures of Heaven and Hell.The Great Divorce begins with the narrator, presumably Lewis himself, in a gray, dismal, rainy city of empty streets. This is Hell. There are no flames, devils, or torments. These things might make Hell interesting and Lewis makes subtly makes the point that while evil may be hurtful, it is also, in the end, boring. The streets of Hell are empty, not because Hell itself is empty, but because the inhabitants cannot stand each other. As soon as anyone arrives in Hell, he invariably quarrels with everyone around him and moves as far away as he can. So, there are miles, even light years between neighbors.There is a bus for those who want to travel to Heaven to see what it is like. The narrator, along with a group of quarreling travelers boards the bus to Heaven. Most of the people from Hell don't much like it there. In Heaven, they are revealed to be ghosts, while Heaven is real and solid, more real and solid than Earth. The ghosts in Heaven cannot lift a single leaf. Grass does not bend beneath their feet. The people of Heaven are bright, shining spirits.The bulk of the book consists of the narrator overhearing conversations between the ghosts and relatives or acquaintances from Heaven, and the narrator's own conversation with Lewis's favorite writer, George MacDonald. The spirits of Heaven plead with the ghosts to stay but the ghosts all have one reason or another why they cannot or will not. As MacDonald explains, the one thing that the people from Hell need to do is to forget about their preoccupation with themselves and learn to love God. Once they have ceased to trouble about themselves, they will become more truly the individuals they were meant to be. But, they simply will not do it.Lewis is careful to be sure that the reader knows that this book is only a work of fiction and most emphatically does not claim to be any sort of prophet or to have any real knowledge of the afterlife. In fact, the story ends with the narrator waking from a dream. Still, I think The Great Divorce shows a great deal of insight into the nature of Heaven and Hell, and of good and evil."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is hands down my favorite book ever written by CS Lewis, and I treasure them all dearly.I reread The Great Divorce often, it's just that good.It lead me to the works of George McDonald as a bonus."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I'm not a big fiction reader, so Lewis's \\"The Great Divorce\\" was somewhat outside my comfort zone. I decided to jump into this book as I've watched the intense conversation percolating around Rob Bell's recent \\"Love Wins\\" take on heaven and hell, thinking that Lewis might have some helpful thoughts to challenge my assumptions, as he always does. And though I found some of his figurative, poetic language in \\"The Great Divorce\\" to be a bit dense for me to decipher, I was ultimately fully engaged and significantly challenged by the vivid images and captivating ideas that he portrayed in this imaginative depiction of the afterlife.As Lewis acknowledged in the preface, \\"The Great Divorce\\" is not intended to be a specific depiction of what the afterlife will necessarily be. But Lewis offers some fascinating ideas of what things might be like, in some sense, after we depart from this earth. More importantly than the actual images of heaven and hell, though, I thought that his insights into the foibles and flaws of humanity are brilliantly demonstrated through the various exchanges between those already in heaven and the loved ones who are deciding where they want to be. The mother whose supposed love for her son is really all about herself, the pitiful man who can no longer manipulate his wife, and the man who allows his sin to be killed and only then rides into glory are such poignant and vivid images. But the images depict scenarios and realities that we all encounter around us and too often experience ourselves.Allegory still isn't my favorite style of writing, but if I'm going to read it, I'd rather it be Lewis than anyone else. He doesn't answer all of our questions about eternity, nor does he attempt to do so. But through some fascinating word-pictures, he manages to clearly demonstrate a number of vital truths about our lives on earth and destinies beyond this life in ways that a hundred sermons couldn't begin to capture. I expect that this is a book that I'll revisit, with anticipation that I'll uncover even more layers of Lewis's unrivaled wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is a man's dream journey from hell to heaven. His journey reveals a hell and heaven very different from the common conception and at times uncomfortably familiar. C.S. Lewis shows us on every page the earthly, transient things that we cling to that keep us from fully entering heaven. Our weaknesses can either be a parasitic lizard on our shoulder or a large stallion that can carry us to our full potential. It is a dynamic and life changing read. It makes you think deeply and evaluate yourself.This book would be good to read with someone else and discuss. Lewis can be confusing at times and it is helpful to discuss his ideas with others. Plus you get the added insight of another individual which gives you a deeper understanding of the book.In the end, the book, illustrates what C.S. Lewis stated in the preface to The Great Divorce: \\"Earth, I think, will not be found by anyone to be in the end a very distinct place. I think earth, if chosen instead of Heaven, will turn out to have been, all along, only a region of Hell...\\""},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is a very curious book. When I first picked it up, I had no clue that it would be an excursion into death; more specifically, into what might happen to the soul after death; and even more specifically, into how souls might achieve Heaven or choose Hell.For starters, The Great Divorce is not a dry, philosophical book. It is a cleverly written first-person narrative that begins on a bus ride from a dreary town and ends in a lush garden full of creatures both magnificent and wretched. For the passengers on the bus, the garden is so unbearably real and solid that they can hardly stand it at first. Most will find an excuse to get back on the bus. But a scant few will be persuaded to cast off their attachments to life in the town and head off toward the mountains where an inexpressible joy awaits them.It is against this backdrop that Lewis sets up the core of the work--a sequence of vignettes that perceptively describe some of the major reasons why people turn away from the salvation offered by God through His Son, Jesus. These are, in the main, so beautifully drawn and so frighteningly true to life that every reader must find himself in the crosshairs in one or another of them.Lewis is a brilliant writer and thus this book is littered with wonderful little aphorisms. Two of my favorite are:\\"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says in the end, 'Thy will be done.' All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell.\\"\\"Every young man or boy that met her [an anonymous saint] became her son -- even if it was only the boy that brought meat to her back door....There are those that steal other people's children. But her motherhood was of a different kind. Those on whom it fell went back to their natural parents loving them more.\\"In short, The Great Divorce is brilliant and enlightening. Great food for thought for those traveling through the earthly existence."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce by C. S. Lewis, is available in many editions, either alone or in collections of Lewis' Christian novellas and essays such as The Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity, and The Problem of Pain. Like his Narnia stories for children and his Out of the Silent Planet trilogy, this is a collage of science fiction, fantasy, and theology. Even more than some of his other works I've read, it is really quite a pastiche of different ideas, some of which seem to have been thrown at the text as Jackson Pollock may have thrown paint at his canvases. For example, here and there are brief but very familiar quotes from the Bible which seem to pop up to fill in some space in a paragraph. But Lewis' charm and easy assurance in handling the underlying theology always seems to keep things together and keep you interested.The title is a take-off on The Marriage of Heaven and Hell by that \`so great a genius', William Blake. In spite of Lewis' reverence for fellow Christian, Blake, Lewis thinks the great poet / engraver got it wrong. Lewis thinks that good and evil follow fundamentally irreconcilable paths, and for one to reform from evil to good requires backtracking all the way to where the first wrong turn was taken. For his efforts and his novel notion, Lewis presents us with an image of heaven and hell which would look quite unfamiliar to his distinguished predecessors, Dante and Milton. But that doesn't mean he doesn't borrow liberally from both.Aside from all the usual classics, Lewis primary influence is the writings of George MacDonald, who is virtually unknown today. One is touched not by him today, but we are still touched by the many writers he influenced such as J.R.R. Tolkien, W. H. Auden, G. K. Chesterton, and even Mark Twain.Lewis \`borrows' one big idea from Dante when he introduces George MacDonald as the principle character's guide around heaven, taking the role of Dante's Virgil in The Divine Comedy. He also freely admits that he 'borrowed' one central concept about heaven from an unnamed American science fiction author, whose name he forgot. I suspect that Lewis even went so far as to borrow from Plato's theory of ideas in identifying some of the differences between heaven and hell.Lewis does not hide the fact that the whole story is a dream, as that is the subtitle of the work, but one is inclined to forget that little detail very quickly, as the opening of the book seems very undreamlike. We are not in Dante's forest, but \`...standing in a busy queue by the side of a long, mean street...it was raining...And just as the evening never advanced to night, so my walking had never brought me to the better parts of town.' As in \`The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe', Lewis demonstrates that he is really good at opening a story and setting an evocative tone from the outset. Now from the preface, we know the book is to be about heaven and hell, and it is a fair guess that this dim view of a London neighborhood is not Lewis' conception of heaven. Suddenly, that eerie Twilight Zone theme song goes off in your head, when you realize things are not as they seem. Our suspicions are confirmed when we seem to find almost everyone landing in some kind of quarrel with their neighbor. Not enough to overdo it, just a bit of a parody of a crabby (I imagine NYC) crowd queuing up in the rain for the bus after a day at dismal jobs. But they aren't going home. This is an excursion bus to heaven. As the bus, Harry Potter style, takes off for its divine destination, we get a better look at hell as one vast grey, twilit bedroom / light industry district of a major city.In heaven, we encounter Lewis' borrowing from a novel about time travel. Just as one can't change the past, the visitors from hell can't change heaven on iota, so even the blades of grass and the butterflies are as hard as diamonds. The narrator meets George MacDonald about halfway through the story. The MacDonald spirit, from that point on, serves as the narrator's guide and crutch (since walking on that diamond-hard grass was hard on the feet). Soon after arriving at heaven, Lewis' originality tends to dry up and the story is less fresh; however, that may be because we primarily deal with the ghosts, the expatriates from hell who, regardless of how often they are given a chance to stay in heaven, they find the task too great, in keeping with Lewis' theory that one needs to unravel your whole life, back to the point where you made the wrong turn.I am not sure how closely Lewis' theology is to Anglican thinking, but I'm fairly sure it is not a very comfortable fit with either Lutheran or Calvinist theology. I am also just a bit skeptical of his distinction between God's love and earthly or \`natural' love. I suspect that from the perspective of how we feel things, the two are remarkably similar and not different in kind. But we don't read C.S. Lewis to understand Anglican theology. We read C.S. Lewis because he gives us entertaining takes on serious ideas which makes us want to understand theology better. Lewis himself is like Dante's Virgil, who can take us to the gates of heaven, but who does not enter them himself, because once we do get a better understanding of serious words such as redemption, atonement, and grace, we discover that Lewis didn't get it quite right. But he certainly made the journey entertaining. He cannot carry a suspension of disbelief nearly as well as his friend Tolkien, but he can be read, understood, and appreciated without needing a truckload of preparation in either theology or ancient Norse legends."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis' very short book is a fictional work that follows the journey of a group of people in Hell who take a trip to Heaven. Like his \\"Screwtape Letters,\\" this book provides some excellent insights into the psychology of humankind.During this trip to Heaven, the inhabitants of Hell are given a chance to repent and enter the kingdom of God. Each person upon arrival is eventually greeted by a person from Heaven who tries to convince the unrepentant to receive salvation. It is almost painful to read as these inhabitants of Hell steadfastly refuse to repent. It is painful to see the characters accept Hell and reject Heaven, but it is even more painful because it is easy for us to see our own flaws represented by these unrepentant people.Lewis' construction of Hell as a place where the unrepentant wander around and never achieve satisfaction or fulfillment is conspicuously lacking searing flames and torturing demons. And although Lewis may not have meant for \\"The Great Divorce\\" to be a systematic description of the nature of Heaven and Hell, I think that he is certainly on to something. The vision of Hell found in this book is, I think, closer to the reality of Hell than the traditional Dante-esque version of torture and pain. But the primary accomplishment of \\"The Great Divorce\\" is that it shows us the psychology of unbelief, even when manifested in ourselves."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"A general look at American history between 1910 and 1920 will mostly focus on America's involvement in World War I. In Erdrich's work that is placed in this time period, the focus is on another American event: the displacement of Indians from their land. The tale is carefully crafted and the magical realism allows the reader to feel like a part of the story - like he or she is taking part in it. If you want a quick read, or a really thoughtful read, this book provides both."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is such a complicated novel that it is difficult to briefly describe. Like most other Native American Stories there is the main conflict of the Indians versus the white man and Christianity. However, Erdrich's story goes beyond that. Her novel seems to mystify everything. The characters are so complex: throughout the story you wonder if Fleur actually has magic, if Nanapush tells the truth, or if Pauline the masochist is actually inflicting all of these punishments. There are several motifs/ themes in the novel: Christianity versus traditions, elusive money, family pride, and the supernatural. Lastly, the point of view alternates between Nanapush telling his story to Lulu and Pauline telling her story as a confessional. The book is not easy to read, I would definitely not call it a page turner. However, it is interesting and Erdrich has a way of pulling you into the story."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks jumped out at me in a bookstore in Northampton, Massachusetts 12 years ago. I was just browsing the shelves and I randomly picked up and bought this book. I have read it several times since then and keep reading Louise Erdrich's other books following the same characters trough generations.I fell in love with Nanapush, Fleur and their way of life. I feel uneasy about Pauline and everything she represents. Louise Erdrich has a way of weaving together dreams, smells, present time and past time. She has a way of writing poetry I can understand in the form of Nanapush and how he sees the world around him.This book is one of my most treasured books and I keep discovering new things in this and following books as I grow older and change perspective on things. It is not just a book about Native Americans but about life."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I first read this book for a high school multi cultural lit class. I was fascinated by the story then and almost 10 years later this is still one great read (at least to me).

Waves of varying emotions swept over me with each different short story, which were contrasted in an effective way through the narratives of Pauline and Nanapush. Nanapush's desire to retain traditional Native American culture is juxtaposed by Pauline's inherent need to be white and her great determination to spread the Christian faith through the reservation. Through these and other characters, Erdrich takes the reader on a journey through 12 years of Native American pain, hardship, and cultural struggle."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I was assigned the task of reading Tracks for a college English class. Though I was weary of what the novel would resemble, for I had not previously read Erdrich, I was pleasantly surprised by the ever-changing story line.This story is told in an alternating point of view by two characters, Nanapush and Pauline. The changing narrators made the novel that much more interesting to me, for I was able to see two different story lines and thought processes because of this. Another reason I recommend this novel is because of the action packed plot. Each chapter brings a new, exciting event to life. Erdrich constantly provides new twists and turns in the story for readers to contemplate. She definitely leaves her readers fully satisfied. Because I had never read a Native American novel of this sort, I felt Tracks provided a wonderful example of authentic Native American culture. I was able to enter a world besides my own, observing a lifestyle completely different than that of which I am used to. This was an honor to be able to do.Though I have given much praise to the novel, I will say that this is not a book I will read again. However, that is simply because it is not my favorite style of reading material. While I feel it is an extremely intelligent, well-written novel, it is not something that I found great pleasure in reading. It is a heavy, sometimes hard to read novel. However, if you're looking to get an insight into the true life of a Native American while reading a legendary piece of work, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is another one of Erdrich's amazing novels.

The setting is North Dakota and the timing of the story is early 20th century. People in the story are mostly Indians living on reservations. The main characters are Nanapush - an elderly wise man, Fleur - an odd character who was supposed to be a witch and Pauline - a mixed bred woman undergoing penance in a nunnery. The story is told from multiple first person points of view, alternated by Nanapush and Pauline. There are other characters like Kashpaw, Morriseys, Margaret (Kashpaw's mother).Fleur is supposed to have an influence on the water monster living in the lake Machimmanito. This book depicts the struggle of people to make a living in harsh winter, trying to pay taxes to keep their land, Indian folklore, politics and cultural clashes, internal feud between two clans - Pillagers and Morriseys.The narrative voice for both Nanapush and Pauline is different but in some chapters Nanapush is telling the story to someone and I couldn't figure out until few pages later on that Nannnapush is telling the story to Lulu. Erdrich has succeeded in building interesting characters. I don't recall I had come for a long time such a masterly prose. Almost every sentence is a gem. How does Erdrich do it?But if you read this book and I strongly recommend you do, you need to keep the dictionary nearby. I had problem understanding the meaning of some of the words she used.I am sure to read her next book \`Love Medicine.'"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"When I used Love Medicine in a university level English Literature course I thought I'd hit gold for getting my students to open up to literature with Erdrich's book.

The incredible transportating of a successful hunt with the meat tied to the hero's body struck a cord of awe at having been given a view of survival that took them beyond their trips to their local grocery stores. Erdrich opens windows to another culture, different values, and to history in ways that made my students begin to &quot;see&quot; the world beyond their dormrooms. What other author writing today can do the same with such poetry?"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks was a very interesting novel. The author Louise Erdrich has a style about her writing. The book is written from two different points of view. A young woman and an old man tell a tail that kept me reading on. The story starts with the introduction of one of the main characters Fleur. Fleur is found almost frozen to death but is nursed back to health by Nanapush on of the narrators. Flue grows up surrounded with rumors and bad luck. Fleur has a few accidents involving water and after that she changes forever. A few males that try and court her wind up drowned. People start to wonder about her and she is thought of as surrounded by dark magic and dangerous. This is just a demonstrating of how complex the plot is.The novel is very action packed and full of surprises. The novel has a lot of talk about magic and superstition. The way that the book is narrated is the most impressive thing. The two different personalities of Nanapush and Pauline the two narrators are what make this novel great. You hear what Nanapush thinks and sees and then hear the same for Pauline. The two different personalities make me think about which one is right and I find my self thinking along with one of the narrators.This book is not for any quiet reading; it jumps out and shows you a side of Native Americans that you don't hear about. You also see the difference between the Native American culture and the white American culture. The plot is well developed and makes for some complicated reading. I liked Tracks and would like to read one of Louise Erdrich other novels. Tracks is a dark book with all the magic and superstition but it had moments of passion, anger and surprises. I would recommend this book to almost any one who posses the reading ability."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"My husband had to read this book for a history course on Native Americans several years ago. When his eyes were too tired to read, I often read sections out loud to him. Those small glimpses of the book were intriguing and I have long intended to read it fully.It is the story of a people on the edge of cultural and physical extinction. The characters are so alive and the story, told in first person by two alternative narrators, is vivid, mystical and entrancing."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Louise Erdrich writes with an articulate, to-the-point beauty. She creates a compelling and heart-wrenching story in TRACKS by following the daily tribulations and struggle of four Native American women. This story is divided into several smaller tales. Each woman's story reveals her adventure and strife. Erdrich brilliantly meshes points of contact between the characters to create a powerful novel centering on the search for identity and the struggle of the Native American woman to survive in an unforgiving world."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I found this to be a wonderful book. I read it for a women's novels class in college and could not put it down. Erdrich has really shown the importance of Ojibwe culture. Nanapush is the respected elderly member, Fleur is the free spirit and Pauline is trapped between white society and the culture she grew up in. This was a truly enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"What an inspiring story. Once you read one of Erdrich's books, you have to read the others. They are so accurate and respectful of Native culture."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I first read a short story by Louise Erdrich in an American Literature class. Her writing immediately captured my interest. Since then, I've read several of her books (all excellent) and &#34;Tracks&#34; did not fail to live up to my high expectations of this author.Erdrich continues to focus this story mainly on the Kashpaw and Nanapush families of Ojibwa people. Her beautiful writing drops you right in the middle of the ancient tales of tribal elders, sometimes making you wonder if this is really a work of fiction or a compilation of the oral history handed down through the tribes."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"This made me want to seek out Louise Erdrich's other books. She has an excellent style that blends humorous, sad, and political."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is an a very good book. It gives you in site of the Native American culture. Pauline was a favorite character of mines because she is crazy and has an imagination of her own. I really love how Fleur was such a mystery throughout this book which captures the reader's attention. Sometimes, the book can be a bit confusing to read, and you may have to re-read some parts to get a better understanding of what is actually taken place during the story line. I think this book is a pretty good book to read, and it is very interesting."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I made two mistakes in reading this book. First, I read it very quickly, and I think that's why I tended to get the relationships of the characters confused. Second, this book is one of a series, and, although its events occur first, it was written later. Therefore, perhaps the author intended for the reader to be already familiar with the characters. The book has alternating narrators. One is Nanapush, a Chippewa elder, who is telling Lulu her mother's story. Lulu's mother is Fleur, the central character in the book, a beguiling woman whose parents died from a white man's disease. The other narrator is Pauline, half-white, vengeful and somewhat crazy, who becomes a nun bent on self-flagellation, perhaps attempting to assuage guilt from having lured Fleur's lover toward a young, beautiful girl. I was somewhat puzzled that Nanapush seemingly so easily forgives a huge betrayal by his lover, Margaret, and I was amused by Fleur's wily act of trickery at the end."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Great book-- I don't see why a couple of other respondents said this book is lifeless, etc. The plot is excellent, and the dual narration adds to suspense. Certainly worth reading, and a must if you are into Native American literature."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"After reading several different Native American authors, I finally had the privilege of reading Louise Erdrich. TRACKS captured my imagination as I listened to Nanapush and Pauline tell their stories. Erdrich brilliantly has the two narrators cast doubt upon each other's tales- a tactic which makes the book all the more enthralling to read. Pauline's zealous quest for sainthood, filled with sacrifices that border on ridiculousness, contrasts with Fleur's relationship to nature, embodied in the forest and the lake creature, Misshepeshu. Erdrich's characters endear themselves to the readers with their first-person revelations, their bawdy senses of humor, and their uncanny strength. The sexual banter between Margaret and Nanapush brings the characters to thriving, realistic life. TRACKS presents these characters against the backdrop of a dwindling forest, which government agents consume piece by piece, selling to American logging companies. As Fleur and Nanapush's homeland disappears, their struggle to control their own future becomes present and touching. Each of the characters reaches out in a different way to attempt to determine their future in some way. TRACKS deserves several reads, and Louise Erdrichs deserves high praise for an incredible and entertaining work."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"\\"Tracks\\" of Fleur and through her the end of a way of life for a Native American tribe in the early 20th century. Her story and the tribes story is told through the eyes of two people, Nanapush an elder who is sympathetic to Fleur and the Native American lifestyle and through Pauline a woman twisted with a sort of love/hate obsession with Fleur and a repulsion of her own heritage.Nanapush tells the story to his \`granddaughter' Lilly, Fleur's child. He does this to explain her incomprehensible mother who seems to have abandoned her for no reason as well as a way to explain the politics of the tribe. He wants to save Lily from what he sees as an unsuitable marriage and reunite her with her mother and fully with her Native American heritage.Pauline, narrates to who knows what or who or for what purpose. Her madness is captivating and is a manifestation of the sickness, literally and figuratively, that the alien (white) culture brings to the Native American people.At the same time this is a story about women. Fleur, is an incomprehensible woman who breaks the rules of what it is to be an Indian woman and is feared and respected as a consequence of her actions. Her beauty and fierceness make her a force of nature. Pauline is a woman who is treated without worth as a woman. It is this, and her soul sickening envy, I believe, that drives her madness. Margaret, Lily's grandmother represents the traditional strong Native American woman I believe, and while her methods for survival are of the Mac tuck variety she ends up surviving and living the best of all three of the woman.The book covers 12 years and is a lyrical look at a culture's struggle to survive."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"In keeping with the development of Erdrich's rich, fictional Native American saga, &quot;Tracks&quot; takes her characters one step closer to reality. Contrary to initial impression, the novel does not limit itself by cultural lines. Erdrich's work provides an insightful and engrossing tale, which highlights the struggles of a frayed culture. However, spoilers abound and surprises go unappreciated for those who haven't read her previous works first. Erdrich makes brilliant use of alternating narrators. One speaker is a highly spiritual grandfather named Nanapush, and the other a crazed and confused Indian woman called Pauline, retelling the life of protagonist Fleur. Both offer differing slants when shedding light on Fleur's troubles, including passage through a suicidal youth and falling in love with shy Indian boy Eli. Rich imagery, and the short-and-sweet figurative way of Native American storytelling may be a bit much for some. However, the manner of speech fits the novel beautifully for those so inclined to a book of this type. Interesting, not mind-blowing, it is an honest and sufficient work in the representation and preservation of a culture."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I read this book in a Native American Literature course about 12 years ago. My father is full blooded Native American and my teacher was white and I thought he couldn't teach me anything. I had a chip on my shoulder and my teacher knocked it off of me with this book. He told me he wanted ME to teach this book to the class so I had to read this book like I had never read any book before. Perhaps my unique connection to the book made me enjoy the book more than these other reviewers, but I think that it would still be one of my favorite books even if had not read it for class. I teach high school English and have read A LOT of books - all kinds of books, not just classics. Even if you read this and find that you can't fully understand it, that's OKAY. Part of the problem with my students is they are always looking for the AUTHOR\\"S interpretation or the TEACHER'S interpretation - just enjoy your own interpretation. The book is not that hard to understand, but the imagery and symbolism is deep. This is an important book, as pretty soon there will be no Native Americans left to tell our stories. Less than 1% of this nation is Native American and it's important to read these stories. The mixing of Christianity with Native traditions is particularly significant in this story. In fact, I based my Master's thesis on the themes in this work. I met Louise Erdrich a couple of years ago at a book signing and I wanted to tell her this book changed my life, but how cheesy would that be?"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"In all of her work, Louise Erdrich writes with rich visual language, and always from the heart. Until I read Tracks, I held up Love Medicine as Erdrich's best, and one of my all-time favorite novels. Tracks surpasses Love Medicine in scope, personality, and drama. The early lives of Erdrich's legends - Fleur and Moses Pillager, Eli and Nector, Lulu Nanapush,the Morrisseys, and even Sister Leopolda unfold in the despair and heartache of the early part of this century, when the Chippewas were just begining to lose their land and their lives to alcohol, disease, and other pressures from the ever-encroaching whites. What I love about both Love Medicine and Tracks, more than, say, The Beet Queen is the amazing number of characters Erdrich can master, and the way she interweaves their lives. Tracks does Love Medicine one better by making the circle of voices a bit smaller, and the stories more intensely personal. This book made me cry at work and laugh out loud on the subway. If you love the way Erdrich creates many varried personalities to tell a story, you will love this book. If you've never read any of her work, this is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Louise Erdrich has written I don't know how many novels featuring Fleur Pillager and her still-increasing North Dakota Chippewa clan. Tracks remains my favorite, mostly because of Nanapush, surely one of the most wonderful characters ever to inhabit the pages of a novel. \\"Talk is an old man's last vice,\\" Nanapush says. When he gets ill, he says \\"I got well by talking. Death could not get a word in edgewise, grew discouraged, and traveled on.\\" You won't, you'll sit at Nanapush's feet and never want to get up, not while he's still talking. My only complaint about Tracks is it's too short.The Beet Queen: A Novel (P.S.)andLove Medicine: A Novel (P.S.)are about the same characters, not really sequels or prequels, just more stories about the same great folks. You'll be happy you get more than one visit."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Erdrich is an amazing weaver of words. There are two narrators in this book, each chapter alternates between Nanapush an older very traditional Ojibwe man and Pauline a contemporary of our main character Fleur, who is shunning the traditional ways.I had a hard time with this book because I really enjoyed Nanapush's narration, he is funny and wise and insightful. But then I would get to the next chapter that was narrated by Pauline--who in a way reminds me of Elphalba from \\"Wicked\\" she is determined to be always right, essentially destroying herself and those around her. She is a selfish and mentally deluded character.The twin narration follows the life of one character, Fleur. She is like and adoptive daughter to Nanapush and a sort of sister/rival to Pauline. While Pauline is rather homley Fleur is beautiful and other worldly. Her tribes people suspect her of a liason with the monster that lives in the lake.Its the story of people being pushed off their land by the government and some of their own people. Ultimately the story is a tragedy with some mythic elements and great dashes of humour (courtesy of Nanapush--he is a brilliant character, I'd almost reccomend reading this book on the strength of him alone)."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"A story of an elusive woman(Fleur Pillager) entangled in the larger event of the Native American peoples' loss of their homeland. Erdrich is masterful in her ability to express both Fleur's human and mystical qualities through the voices of two narrators, each revealing complex lives and relationships of their own. A perspective is presented so that the new white order, who wield &quot;this method of leading others with a pen and piece of paper&quot;, becomes a foreign way of thought(though it is of course our modern Western way), which consumes the Native American culture as fast as it wipes the trees from its landscape."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"This is a beautiful novel that captures the mystic qualities of the lives that Native Americans lived. Yes, I too read this in college, but count it as one of the best books I read during that time. It is a book for discerning readers who have learned to appreciate the skill it takes for an author to re-create the ethereal nature of the characters she has dreamed."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Erdrich's Tracks offers a new and intriguing perspective on Native American life. Rather than following conventional writing techniques, Erdrich offers a short story cycle narrative in which two characters, Nanapush and Pauline, tell a story from two very different perspectives. I will have to admit though, the story is confusing due to this feature, but it also adds a personal touch that sets it apart from other novels. As unique as the novel may be, the tale is clouded with imagery that often leaves readers confused as well as frustrated at certain points. Moreover, the descriptions of Native American life and the events that unfold in the novel seem almost mythical and very unrealistic. This seems to suggest that Erdrich has a certain reverence towards Native American culture and views it with awe and vivid imagination."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I most likely would not have read this book if it wasn't required for and English Literature class, yet it wasn't the worst novel I have been required to read.One thing is for sure, it is very confusing at first. This is partially because it switches narration often, and it is difficult to grasp what exactly is happening because time doesn't flow in a consistent rate. However if you can get past this, it reads pretty well.The novel is an allegory for the plight of the Ojibwe people as they amalgamate into, or resist the urge to conform to modern society, through the eyes of a few key characters representing different aspects of the culture.That being said, it's not the most entertaining story. I found that I was only interested in the half of the novel focusing and narrated by the character Pauline, whereas the half from the point of view of Nanapush drug on tediously.While my Professor simply adored this novel (as well as the rest of Louise Erdrich's work), I guess it just didn't do much for me."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I did not receive the other book that I also ordered by the same author, Louise Erdrich. I did pay for it on my credit card. It has a long title, something like \\"The Last Miracles at ...\\" Please let me know when or if it is coming. I really want that book. thanks, Sr. Mary Rogers"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I appreciate an author's attempt at using creative narratives and vivid imagery, but only in small doses and when it serves to enhance the story. The problem with Tracks is that the narrative and imagery don't enhance the story. Instead, they confuse it and drag it down, slowing down the pace and making me wonder if it isn't just an attempt to flesh out what should really be a short story. Sometimes, more is just more, not better. I kept wishing Erdrich would stop playing with words and just tell the stupid story and get it over with. Just another great example of how Fiction has lost sight of storytelling in favor of novels that are so bogged down under the weight of their prose that they fail to engage readers."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I very seldom not finish reading a book but I could not take more than half of this book. It rambled on - jumped all around - very confusing. Maybe it was me or the mood I was in - my apologies to those of you who liked it."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"With few exceptions this book was plodding and lifeless.

Worse yet, I had to write a paper on it. Toughest paper I ever wrote because I could not stay awake. I don't even remember the book that well (4 years).

It started off hard to follow, and then as it progressed, it became more and more difficult to comprehend. There is a lot of old people sex and sexual inuendos. The plot is slow and to be honest, i am really not interested in reading any more books about indians. I'm not racist, just sick of all the indian books! I do think that the book was written well and it was interesting how Erdrich switched narrators. Overall I wouldn't have picked to read this book on my own, but if you like nature stories about the troubles that Indians had to go through, then go ahead read this book."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I was required to read this book for a literature class at my university. This was quiet possibly the most wretched book I have ever had the misfortune to lay my hands on, since I am an avid reader it took alot to earn that position with me. The story line moves horribly slow. The narration flips back and forth with each chapter between a wise old man, and an illogical, mentaly ill future nun who engages in strange practices of self torture. The parts narrarated by the nun do not make sense, do not enrich the plot and break the flow of the book since it is mostly nonsense taking place in her head. To much nonsense and unneccesary sex. Don't waste your time on this book, your time would be better spent watching grass grow."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a piece of \\"literature\\" before. I really couldn't believe the fact that I had no connection with these bizarre series of events or any of the characters. Not only that, but I didn't just start counting pages, I started counting paragraphs, and then sentences and then words. If I didn't have to read this book for an English class I think I would've ripped all the pages out and then burned it, okay, maybe not something so dramatic.I guess now that I've given my initial review of the book, I'd like to explain myself.First of all, I went into reading this book expecting something great. Perhaps this is one of the reasons as to why I was so dissatisfied with its content.For the first time, in a long time, I was given something besides African American and Hispanic/Latino literature for a multi-ethnic literature class. Going into this book I was all excited that we were going to discuss something different in class. I was happy to be learning something about a culture that I haven't been that exposed to.Unfortunately, this book was not the book I was looking for.The book had two narrators and they would switch off with every other chapter. The first narrator was this older gentleman who had lived a long time and experienced a lot, but may have been slightly senile. His name was Nanapush. The second was a slightly insane, self-hating, hypocritically religious, crazy woman (because I don't think bad words can be said on amazon.com) named Pauline. These two, were able to put together the most deranged story ever, leaving you with a skewed series of events in your mind that really left you with nothing but confused.One thing that I would say I liked a little bit about the book was that in Nanapush's sections Erdrich was able to slip in some important information about the compromising situations that the Native American people were put through. The book actually starts out with Nanapush describing the \\"spotted sickness\\" and the way it was killing off so many of his people. Being one of the stronger men on the reservation he saved a girl named Fleur from the disease. Fleur was this mystical character that had some strange connection with the water, because she was so beautiful that the water monster wanted her. Basically the story was about Fleur. She was beautiful, she was strong, and in some ways powerful.Pauline would explain her perspective on the way she saw Fleur, but she loved fleur and hated her at the same time. Pauline was jealous of Fleur and angry that the men loved her, but at the same time she loved Fleur because that's what she wanted to be.Nanapush had kind of turned into an uncle to Fleur ever since he saved her from the sickness and they became part of each other's lives.All this may seem a bit vague, but it's only because this is what the book leaves you with, bits and pieces of vague stories that are hard to make sense out of."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"we had to read this book for english class, and it is awful.

The man forms a kind of grandfatherly relationship to the little girl who lost her family. The locals believe that this girl has supernatural powers. Underlying all this is the struggle of Indian tribes in the early 1900's to keep their land.The story is told in a Falknerian way. It switches between the narratives of two people, who tell the story in their oral tradition of telling a story, so vividly, so profoundly that as a reader I kept catching myself wanting to share the story orally."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"The book is set on a small Indian reservation in Wyoming, where the winters are deadly, and the summers are looked forward to.

The Native American culture is threatened as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Ancient rituals that consisted of a sacrifice now consist of drinking and gambling. New religions are introduced onto the reservation, and many Natives lose their faith that the chieftains have tried so hard to preserve.What I loved about this book is that the main character always changes. I found it very confusing to decipher whom was talking, but I liked re-reading what I didn&#8217;t understand. Although there were many main characters the most important one was an old man named Manitou-geezis. The story is told from every character view, but it only makes since when it is explained by Manitou-geezis, then it is fun to look back and with knowledge of what has happened see it from the view of every character. The main dilemma of the book is that a young man named Eli falls in love with a wild woman named Fleur. Since Manitou-geezis comforted and befriend Fleur when her family died as a result of the measles, Eli goes to him for advice on how to &#8220;tame&#8221; her and get her to love him.

In this play, the repudiation of social morality in the name of higher things is put to the question: what if devotion to such &quot;higher things&quot; also leads to, or becomes a mask for, moral isolation, the cauterization of social feeling? Uncompromising and yet compromised, Brand is a caution, and _Brand_ a cautionary tale..."},{"Title":"Brand: A Version for the Stage","review":"This book captures the essence of humanity. I recommend to anyone who wants to find themself."},{"Title":"Brand: A Version for the Stage","review":"Brand is the flip side of Peer Gynt. Ibsen may well have intended to write heroism into Brand, a charismatic dissenting priest, but could not breathe any life into his protagonist at all. Brand is cold, righteous, merciless, uncompromising. The play is dated, dull, static, but of historical interest to Ibsen scholars, since he may have learned plenty by writing Brand. The rather rigid Norwegian state/church of his time loved it, granted Henrik a permanent poet stipend for Brand. Modern gentle readers may roll their eyes."},{"Title":"Public Speaking Is Not for Wimps","review":"There are many strong tips here on how to deal with fear and nerves before speaking.

If you don't, than make your own choice.

There are no earth-shattering revelations and your not going to find any truisms here (which is the case with most fantasy novels).The characters are constructed fairly well. The villians are truly the most developed characters. I found myself anticipating what would happen to the villians more than I did the heroes. In fact, if this weren't a Harpers book this could have made a nice starting point for a villians series.To me the story reads like a good translation of a D&amp;D module (unlike &quot;Against the Giants&quot;). The characters are vibrant and colorful.I enjoyed this book and I most people would also enjoy it."},{"Title":"Red Magic (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers, Book 3)","review":"Definitely one of the BEST in the Harpers Series and one of my personal favorites, RED MAGIC sheds light and provides a great insight into the magical world of Thay and the evil Red Wizards that inhabit it! The book is so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense. Jean Rabe, has truly outdone himself and has presented us with a wonderful piece of literature the likes of which could be compared with JRR Tolkien's work, RA Salvatore's The Dark Elf and Icewind Dale trilogies, and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies. Magic, Heroes, and Villains are all about. In conclusion, it?s what Fantasy reading SHOULD be. A GREAT book indeed and a must read if you love Fantasy and especially if you love the Forgotten Realms! DON'T MISS IT!!!"},{"Title":"Red Magic (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers, Book 3)","review":"I thought the strongest point of this book was the villains and the treatment of magic.

The story was good and suited very well to the harpers. Although Jean Rabe could have made this a two book trilogy. That way she could have been able to make more about the characters and the story itself. The story didn't settle in one book. It would have required more.... But in whole the book was good. I recomend other Harper fans read it too."},{"Title":"Red Magic (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers, Book 3)","review":"I have read the book three times.

I know I do, but it's not because of this novel (Sorry Ms. Rabe). I'm sorry to say, but it was a very dry read and...flat, for lack of a better word. To bring this novel up from a 3 star rating it needed 1.) Less &quot;down time&quot;-the travel time seemed wanting for action, or a deepening and rounding of the characters. 2.) Passion! We see these two characters fall in love, but there's no passion, this isn't Junior High boyfriends and girlfriends, these were grown adults brought together under the impending wrath of the Thayvian Zulkirs! The passion also was severly lacking in the villains I thought. Both Maligor and Sazz Tam were hollow, and flat. Sazz Tam, arguably one of the most powerful sorcerers on all Toril was a bore! Even stuffy old Alophondar-Sage Most Learned of Cormyr has more spunk! The ending also left me blah, it felt rushed. If you love the realms and have the coin to spare, read it, it's a neat look at Thay, a look we haven't since been given (outside game material). But in all honesty, I'd pass. Hopefully the powers that be will assign someone like Greenwood, Cunningham or Denning (oh here comes the heat!) to bring us back to the feared lands of the Red Wizards, as soon as they're finished in Halruaa of course (crossing fingers over &quot;The Mage Hound&quot;)."},{"Title":"Red Magic (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers, Book 3)","review":"After reading through what I thought was going to be a good book, the ending was very disappointing, like when the author got near the ending she just gave up or ran out of detail and ideas.

I had the misfortune to read it way back in 1995 or so when it came out. I was quite the AD&D; fanatic back then, but this book was still crappy. What can I say -- the writing was wooden, the characters were lifted out of the Players Handbook --- need I go on?I agree with the other reviews, Red Magic was like the 4th or 5th book in the Harper series, so some excuses may be made. But Elfshadow was a GOOD book. Well worth reading. I'm amazed that, ten years after I had the misfortune of reading Red Magic, Jean Rabe has chalked up a whole lot of books since then.

THE HERBERT HOOVER DRAG \\"stayed with me\\" for years, to the extent that I expect to perforate a Pianola roll of this music, using the soundtrack of the out-of-print Embassy VHS tape for the source.Few reviewers have probably seen the original 1928 book, which I have, in my player roll Studio, here in Maine. Thus, I can compare the 1999 revival version with what was sold (quietly, or under the table) in the late 'Twenties.The illustrations destroy my images of the narrative, since they remind me of a 'Forties \\"noir\\" film and not a 'Twenties apartment, which the author vividly describes, in his engaging minimalist poetic epic (or whatever this prose is called). The few pen-and-ink illustrations show Burrs as a James Coco type, physically ... and the text for Black (the Perry King character, in the film: Dale Sword) sounds not unlike a thumbnail bio for him, as well. Far better to have drawn from images of old MacFadden magazines (the sleazy publications of that day) or stills from silent movies, for the modern illustrations.The 1928 book has only a few drawings, and - perhaps - for good reason. As with radio, in the days of drama (before television), the theater of the mind conveys the major impressions.Sans serif type and the lack of \\"word clusters\\", plus spaces, which pepper the original volume, are also a downer, for me. The power of the raw story is heightened by the dignity of the Garamond (or whatever) typeface, in the 1928 book.Having said the above, this book is better than none, so I would recommend it. Only 750 copies were printed, of the first edition, by Pascal Convici (mine being #459). As with the other reviewers, I kept being drawn back to the narrative, repeatedly. No pictures were necessary!Regards, Douglas HendersonARTCRAFT Music Rolls..."},{"Title":"The Wild Party: The Lost Classic by Joseph Moncure March","review":"&quot;The Wild Party&quot; is one of my all time favorite reads.

To this day I have read it over 20 times and it never loses it's power. As soon as I heard word, I rushed out to see the Broadway Musical Version and was really dissappointed.

In 1994, nearly 70 years after the publication of The Wild Party, Spiegelman published this illustrated version.March's short, taut thriller beautifully captures the grim determination of a group of down-but-not-out actors, dancers and vaudeville performers as they use drink and sex to mask the depression of their everyday lives. Spiegelman's woodblock-style illustrations add the perfect touch of dark sensuality that at times turn to stale, harshly lit reality. The poem builds to an inevitable climax of violence that nevertheless leaves the reader sitting up straight and waiting for the end.William S. Burroughs said of The Wild Party: \\"It's the book that made me want to become a writer.\\"Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Wild Party: The Lost Classic by Joseph Moncure March","review":"An interest in film noir led to my discovery of Joseph Moncure March (he was the author of \\"The Set-Up,\\" a narrative poem from which the movie of the same name was derived) and what a discovery. I am sure I would have been blown away by \\"The Wild Party\\" even without the illustrations, but the Art Spiegelman work was wonderful and I ended up at an art supply store getting scratch boards so I could take a crack at it myself (not showing much aptitude yet).I'd like to know more about March. I'm tempted to say that he didn't live up to the early promise shown by his two famous narrative poems, but maybe he lost interest in the style and went on to lead a very satisfactory (and rather long) life doing other things."},{"Title":"The Wild Party: The Lost Classic by Joseph Moncure March","review":"Dark, seductive and brilliantly written, Joseph Moncure March's The Wild Party offers up a cautionary tale in the key of jazz and debauchery.

Even though it was written six decades ago, it is fantastically modern. With a pulsuating, driving style that includes violence, humour and excitement, The Wild Party grips the reader from beginning to end. Spielgelman's illustrations, although nice and evocative, do not match the pure intensity of the writing. Well done to Spielgelman for finding this 'lost classic' and re-publishing it (although on the spine his name gets top billing which seem a little self-centred seeing as the books power lies entirely in the words, not the pictures. Indeed the writing is so bitingly vivid that the pictures are unneeded). I have read this book over a hundred times and it never fails to quicken my pulse and ressurect my love for poetry."},{"Title":"The Wild Party: The Lost Classic by Joseph Moncure March","review":"Like many people, I picked up this book after seeing one of the two musicals in New York based on it last year (the LaChiusa one on Broadway, in my case). I thought both shows were highly enjoyable, and was pleased to learn that a good deal of their success could be attributed directly to the source material. March's poem (if it can indeed be called that) itself provides a brief but memorable glimpse into the darkest corners of a dangerous era.The story, such as it is, concerns the unhealthy relationship between two vaudeville performers, Queenie and Burrs, which comes to a head when they throw the party of the title. Among the guests are a number of people who have lived the high life for so long that they are no longer able to put their emotions in perspective -- they hurt each other and are hurt, but appear unable to learn from their mistakes. Naturally, the party ends with a mistake that is completely irrevocable and devastating.The piece would be compelling even without Art Spiegelman's perfect illustrations. With them, this is a book that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"The Wild Party: The Lost Classic by Joseph Moncure March","review":"This was a brilliant work from days gone past. Oddly, the story could happen as easily today as it did when written, the only difference being that the censored content of yesterday would be praiseworthy subtlty today.As the backcover quotation reads, it made William S.

It should be noted that the illustrations by Art Spielgelman clearly add to the aura of the consuming experiece.I highly recommend this book that can be read in under an hour.

They can access the work thouugh the tough sexy voice and may enjoy poetry as might have been impossible before."},{"Title":"The Wild Party: The Lost Classic by Joseph Moncure March","review":"A brilliant piece of writing. I truly enjoyed this book.March has created a vivid world with a minimal amount of words and a very interesting style of poetry. I don't know that I've ever read an extended poem (for lack of a better word, it doesn't really qualify as an epic) that had me so involved and so interested in the story being told. The illustrations are amazing in this edition of the book as well. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Wild Party: The Lost Classic by Joseph Moncure March","review":"The menacing illustrations are good in and of themselves... the sometimes doggerlic, pulpy, but horribly compelling poem of fast living and decadence is good in and of itself... but when you encounter them together they produce a reading experience that transcends the sum of its parts.

It is written in a style that lends itself to being read aloud, as the dramatic content is high. Art Speigelman's illustrations make this night one book to remember, and add to the collection.

Certainly the brief description of the book made it even easier to buy.But now having read it in one sitting, I was blown away at how brilliant it was! The poetic style is very easy to get into, and its use to tell this gripping tale was amazing. It never seems forced in the least, but flows well and succeed's in pulling the reader into the party itself.The characters are great, the kind that one wishes to know of some more. Queenie remains the center of the story, and rightfully so, she is the most developed and most fascinating.Apparently this book was banned in Boston, and I guess it is understandable given the times. Still, even today the story maintains a kind of rawness and edge that stays with the reader.I have not seen the move or the Broadway plays, and chances are won't, the original poem is more than satisfying enough for me.Very very hghly recommended."},{"Title":"The Wild Party: The Lost Classic by Joseph Moncure March","review":"I bought this book in Prague and read it in one sitting in a refurbished pre-War coffee shop. What an experience! The syncopation will stick with you long after reading. The telegraphic style punches hard with some raw belly-laugh humor.

This time, the children desert the lake and take instead to the High Topps, prospecting for gold.While adult readers will be unable to do other than admire the children's enthusiasm (sufficiently infectious to draw most young readers into it wholesale), they will probably have a feeling of impending disaster from quite early on, in this book. The Amazons' impetuous natures, combined with the others' general inexperience and limited knowledge of mining and its chemistry, lead them all (except, perhaps, the more sensible Susan!) into more scrapes, as well as rather more dangerous situations, than usual.This leads to a different (but no less absorbing) desire to keep reading this tale than that likely to affect the more nave younger reader. Both young and old are, nevertheless, likely to spend much of the time on tenterhooks during this book, as the young prospectors explore old mine workings, try their hand at charcoal burning and build and operate a blast furnace in their camp, out on the tinder-dry fells! For once, one can only feel something of a sense of relief that times have changed since 1936, when this was written! One can't help feeling - and being grateful for the fact - that modern children would not be terribly interested in repeating some of the activities undertaken here.In summary, then, &quot;Pigeon Post&quot; is every bit as exciting (and at times far more nerve-wracking) and educational as the other books in this series: another winner from Arthur Ransome."},{"Title":"Pigeon Post","review":"This was the first of Ransome's \\"Swallows & Amazons\\" series that I ever read, and it's still my favorite. We find the Swallows (the four Walkers), the Amazons (Captain Nancy Blackett and sister-Mate Peggy), and the D's (Dick and Dorothea Callum) headquartering at Beckfoot, the old Blackett house, while impatiently waiting for Captain Flint (the Amazons' Uncle Jim) to return from South America. \\"His mine wasn't any good,\\" says Nancy, and she decides to fill in the time by searching for gold up on the high fells above the lake, following hints given by Slater Bob, a local miner. Complicating the program is the distance from Beckfoot to the target area and the fact that the Lake Country is seeing its driest summer in memory--and the presence of the mysterious lanky man the explorers call \\"Squashy Hat,\\" who seems to be looking for the same thing they are. The book takes its title from the three homing pigeons the Blacketts own and resolve to use to keep Mrs. Blackett informed of their adventures while they camp nearer to the moors. The countryside is splendidly drawn, the children are unique individuals well sketched, their adventures and inventions are so thoroughly described that an American child could probably duplicate them, and there are thrills galore when the fells catch fire. What's more, the eight actually find...but that would be telling! Read it for yourself and find out.Like most children's books of its period, this one is equally enjoyable by adults and would make a splendid family read-aloud. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pigeon Post","review":"The summer after the snowy adventures in WINTER HOLIDAY and the D's learning to sail in COOT CLUB, the three sets of children (the Swallows, the Amazons, and the D's) converge on the lake again for their vacation. (By the chronology of the series, it's summer of 1932.)However, there's complications. Only one boat, so they can't all sail. Camping is difficult because Mrs. Blackett is distracted with redecorating, and also because it's an especially dry summer there and the locals are paranoid of fires.Making the best of it, they hear rumors of gold in them thar hills from a local miner, and decide to prospect themselves while Uncle Jim is on his way back from a failed mining expedition in South America. They soon find a lanky stranger, dubbed \\"Squashy Hat,\\" seems to be prospecting himself, and they view him as a dangerous competitor.The kids face all sorts of challenges, from camping near a farm whose owner won't let them cook for themselves and insists they sleep near the house....to dealing with the pigeons of the title that keep them in touch with the Amazon's mum....to finding the possible gold mine....to very real dangers, including a cave-in in an abandoned mine to a runaway brush fire.All the usual delights of the S&A; series are here...the joys of camping and exploring, added to the information about pigeons (and Dick's invention of an alarm) and information about prospecting and mining (which few kids are likely to try today, but you never know if there's a junior metallurgist lurking in your brood). Also some environmental content in the snarky view of tourists who carelessly start a fire that nearly kills the heroes.Good fun, might inspire your younguns. Heck, it's inspired this adult to investigate a gold mine said to be nearby....Next in the series: WE DIDN'T MEAN TO GO TO SEA."},{"Title":"Pigeon Post","review":"Undoubtedly the best of Arthur Ransome's 10 book Swallows and Amazons series. Suspense, intruige and natural disasters keep children and adults alike on their toes throughout. The plausibility of the story adds an exciting dimension to the plot. Ransome's superb ability to develop distinct personalities for his characters is one of the most enjoyable aspects of his writing, and Pigeon Post is perhaps his best example of this."},{"Title":"Pigeon Post","review":"Ransome, well known in England but less so in America, wrote a series of books of children vacationing in England. I have yet to meet a reader of about 10 and up who doesn't fall in love with John, Roger, Titty, Susan, Nancy (true name ruth, but pirates are ruthless and she is an Amazon pirate, so had to find a ruthless name), Peggy, and their friends. These are wholesome books for children without suffering the lack of interest of many wholesome books, and are also highly enjoyable for adults. My children have read them many times, and I myself, starting at about age 12, have read the whole series more times than I can count. The whole series is highly recommended; start with Swallows and Amazons if you can, but start anywhere, and enjoy.11"},{"Title":"Pigeon Post","review":"Would make a great movie.

He does not mention who Timothy is, and so they somehow assume that he is an animal. Then, they decide to mine for gold.

Anyway, I was initially quite disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Joshua's Masai Mask","review":"While the story may seem lacking in certain parts (like the only thing African about the book is the instrument and some clothing) anyone could use the book in a lesson, for example. As a future teacher I used the book with 2nd graders along with Annie's Gifts by Angela Shelf Greene. Both books are about talents that people have, or want to have. Anyways, I use Joshua's Masai Mask as an introduction to Africa. I read the book to the class and on following days, I focused on a variety of instruments, clothing, animals, and much much more that is all about Africa. :)"},{"Title":"Carousel Carving: Miniature to Full-Size -- Classics & Originals","review":"Although this magnificent book is being marketed as a strictly how-to book, as a lover of carousels I attest to the fact that this book includes more history and delightful anecdotes about carousels, horses, designs and designers than any other book ever. Bruce encourages you to set your imagination free. Also, there is a step by step structure showing Bruce's one of a kind process. Even if you don't carve or don't want to start, it is still enlightening to see how this present day master carver makes lovely masterpieces for carousels and living rooms."},{"Title":"Carousel Carving: Miniature to Full-Size -- Classics & Originals","review":"If you have no other book about carousels, this is the one to have. Not only does the book illuminate the history of carousels, dispelling some common myths along the way, but the step-by-step, well illustrated process of carving a carousel is clearly explained in easy to understand terms. As Bruce's identical twin brother I can attest to the heart, mind and artistry that goes into every one of Bruce's creations. Many years ago I received a call from Bruce and he pleaded for my help. I replied that I had no knowledge or skill. Bruce persisted and taught me how to carve carousels using the same steps and techniques described in this book - several of the carousels I have carved are pictured in this book. Perhaps one of your creations will be in his next book!"},{"Title":"Carousel Carving: Miniature to Full-Size -- Classics & Originals","review":"If you enjoyed this book and appreciate wood carving and carousel horses, you will also love this new book coming out in October 2010 by The Connecticut Press called \\"Flying Horses: The Golden Age of American Carousel Art, 1870 - 1930.\\".

Many pictures are included as well as folk stories, local legends and songs, and even a swamp vocabulary section. This book is a must for those researching this area."},{"Title":"Okefinokee Album (A Brown Thrasher Book)","review":"This is a magnificent book. It tells the story of a special place and the people who live there. Southern Crackers are often maligned for ignorance and bigotry, but the people observed and recorded here deserve great credit for understanding the natural beauty of their surroundings and for creating a lifestyle that used what nature offered without abusing it. Fortunately, Francis Harper, the naturalist and the author, took a lifelong interest in the Okefenokee. Thanks to him, the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge is protected and available for all of us to appreciate, and thanks to this book, we can appreciate the people who lived in and around the swamp back in the days before strip malls, chain stores, communication gadgets and other intrusions. You do not have to be a naturalist to enjoy this beautiful book.

Apparently, one must write cliched scenes about virgins to intrigue high schoolers? Adults in these \\"SAT vocabulary novels\\" also \\"need a beer\\" from time to time. I'm not a prude, but I think the books should disclose their content accurately so I could choose what to present as educational material to my kids.That all being said, the books do use a lot of good vocab words.

It is about a teenage girl facing many problems. Her parents just recently divorced and shes switching back and forth between them, her friends dont understand her and she gets to the point where she becomes pretty depressed. She also has this nasty teacher that gets her into trouble as well. I felt like this story wove the words in better than other SAT books i've read. It was interesting and kept me engaged. I read the second half of the book straight through. Although this book is interesting and helpful, I didnt feel like I could connect with her issues. Yes, I know, this book is meant for vocab but I think that it may not appeal to some people who don't like hearing about other people's problem.I agree with the fact that sometimes we don't need to know about what's going on in the bedroom, but its a minor part of the book and not a very big deal. 12 year olds should not be reading this but high schoolers are just fine."},{"Title":"Sun-Kissed (Smart Novels: An SAT Vocabulary Novel: The Painless Way to Learn SAT Vocabulary)","review":"I read this book in september '04 to help prepare for the last SAT year that was scored up to 1600. One problem with reading these books to strenghten vocabulary is that they can be boring, but this one was quite good. I probably remembered the storyline more than any of the words though. I don't think any of the vocab words were on the actual SATs I took. You would probably need to read several of these books to make you significantly score better on the SAT, but atleast they can be read in about a day, especially if the story line is good. Sun-Kissed is adventurous and a book a teenager, even a guy like me would identify with and enjoy. The vocab words flowed nicely, not awkward like some other books."},{"Title":"Sun-Kissed (Smart Novels: An SAT Vocabulary Novel: The Painless Way to Learn SAT Vocabulary)","review":"i loved this book.

But this is definely a book you can read numerous times. Maybe next time I'll use the vocab:)SPOILER ALERT!!!The novel is about Kristen Carmichael. She's popular, but really doesnt like to hang out with her friends. She prefers surfing because its like the only place where all her problems go away.

The issues are always important. The author does a great job presenting a non bias view of the tragedy of a father killing a son because he can't cope with the son's drug use. The problem is here years later I want to know how the survivors have moved on with their lives and generally what has happened to them."},{"Title":"Richie: The ultimate tragedy between one decent man and the son he loved","review":"I remember reading excerpt of this book in Reader's Digest back when I was a kid and being very disturbed by it. Reading the book today, 37 years after the events, the book is rather stilted and dated insofar as it talks about drug use in general, the treatment for it, etc. Societal attitudes have certainly changed since the late 1960s, early 1970s when the events in this book take place.The book virtually slams on the brakes every time it digresses into a sociological study of drugs and American society in general. It is much better when it deals with the relationship between Richie and his father George and as it deteriorates.As a parent myself, I can only grieve for the terrible predictament the Diener family found itself in and the rather ineffectual way the Dieners, Richie's school administrators and the authorities dealt with Richie's burgeoning drug problem. In the end he was so out of control that, given the way he was threatening his parents, George's decision to shoot Richie, in self-defense, is understandable but so preventable had the Dieners acted more aggressively and determinedly earlier. George Diener died in the 1990s and I can only imagine how haunted he must've been over what had happened.\\"Richie\\" was probably a rather shocking book when it came out. Unfortunately, today, it seems rather ordinary. We've heard too many stories since then about self-destructive drug addicts."},{"Title":"Richie: The ultimate tragedy between one decent man and the son he loved","review":"long long ago,a kid had a bad time and got hooked on pills.actually thousands of kids did as did housewives and farmers daughters.one difference though..this book tells the story about a kid who began his early life loving nature and then when he was vunerably alone and lonely,got snapped up by kids who were into heavy drugs.and his life changed.he began to hate his father.his father began to hate him.its atragic book but i advise ANY parent to read it and have thier kids read it too.i have personally done research into this situation and talked to many involved and it still goes round and round in my head..what if?what if he never got high?what if???it leave no conclusions.it leaves unaswered questions.but it is a chilling story.one thing..AVOID THE MOVIE!do not watch robbie benson kill a great kids memory.sad but a must for every family."},{"Title":"Schaum's Easy Outline Applied Physics","review":"My school made us buy what is possibly the WORST textbook I have ever read (Physics by James S.

Previously, if you wanted supplemental books for your child that were predictable, had rhyming or repetitive text and real picture cues, you had to wade through the lists made available, title by title. There are hundreds of books that fit this description, but it takes hours to search for individual books. Green Light Readers promises to publish strictly this type of book. And the few I've seen are still current, use popular authors and are lively and interesting. I hope the publisher takes this idea even past the first two levels."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"Yet another *splendid* cookbook from Lynne Rossetto Kasper! Bravo, Lynne"},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"This is a book for people who love to eat - cooking is not really necessary for its enjoyment! Ms. Kasper is a wonderful writer who paints with words as beautifully as she cooks. Recipes are forthright - simple ingredients simply prepared. (For those who want a more complicated cuisine I'd recommend her first book (&quot;The Splendid Table&quot;). Here she tells tales and recites the folklore of the Italian countryside; she explains the heartland of the country and and the heart(s) of it's people. Since we can't all travel with Ms. Kasper as she makes her rounds, this is as close to heaven as we can get without a plane ticket! FIVE STARS!"},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"GOOD READ, GREAT RECIPESHow I adore this cookbook. I have a lot of cookbooks, and I always reach for this one first. First of all, you can read it like a novel. LRK's stories are wonderful, and hearing the origins -- anthropological, agricultural, familial, anecdotal --is really fun for a literary foodie type (like me).THE SIMPLE-TO-COMPLEX CONTINUUMBut my appreciation of this book goes way beyond its bedside appeal. It's my first, best resource in the kitchen, too. I've noticed a few of the other reviewers found the recipes a little complex, and I'd like to address that. It's true that some are multi-step and use a lot of dishes. It's true that, say, the Tyrolean Pot Roast (*drool*) might take a couple tries before it comes out letter-perfect. But let me balance that by saying that:SIMPLE(1) there are plenty of recipes so simple you'll find yourself using them every night. Like string beans with olive oil, salt and pepper (optional raw garlic halved and rubbed on the sides of the bowl). It's one of those foundational recipes accessible enough for a novice cook, and the technique may be applied to many vegetables.CLEAR(2) Even in Rossetto Kasper's more complicated recipes are not tricky because she explains them so well. It's really hard to take traditional recipes passed down through generations without measurements, cooking by feel, and in another language, no less -- and translate them into a coherent step-by-step set of instructions. That's exactly what Rossetto Kasper has done, though -- she takes recipes a la nonna (grandma recipes) and converts them into accessible text that any home cook can achieve if they really try.IDIOT-PROOF (SORT OF)(3) Most of Rosetto Kasper's recipes are really forgiving. She'll point out where you can make substitutions. For example, if you have run out of rosemary, but your basil plant is temptingly available in sun-drenched glory, chances are good that Rossetto Kasper will point out that you can switch them just fine, and that traditional Italian home cooks often do, according to the seasons, regional differences, and the whim of the cook. I've screwed up so many of her recipes the first time, and all my mistakes have been not just edible, but good. Good enough that I was more than interested in trying a second time, for even better result. Example: The Polenta Chocolate Cake. I defy anyone to make that cake not taste incredibly good -- you'd have to do something really drastic, like omit the chocolate or pour ketchup over it. The first time I made it, it was for a giant family dinner. I was stressed and goofed up the cooking time (probably three or four other things). My family moaned like they were having a giant collective foodgasm. It's just really that good. Sure, I made it correctly after that, but it's good to know if you don't always manage to color in the lines, all is not lost.AUTHENTICITYMore thoughts: her authentic recipes are really authentic. I made her ring-shaped currant/anise seed bread (forget the name) a few years ago for the first time and happened to bring it when I took my grandmother to visit one of her friends. This tiny, very old Italian woman flipped out when she saw it because it reminded her so much of something her own mother made, with a recipe \\"from the old country.\\" (I know it's a clich&eacute;, okay, but that's what she said! She meant it!) The she tasted it and just about cried because it was JUST like her (long dead) mother used to make. Since she never knew the recipe, she hadn't had it since the last time the last (long dead) old woman in her family made it. That's the kind of food you get from this book. Making old ladies that happy is really, really special.MORE AUTHETICITYI had a similar experience with the Pane Dolce di Zucca (Pumpkin Bread -- nothing like American pumpkin bread, and actually, I generally use butternut squash, per Rossetto Kasper's suggestion). My husband had colleagues from Italy here in the United States for a month or so. They were kind of homesick. I sent some of this bread in to work with my husband one day and they went wild when they tasted it -- apparently it's a country recipe that they'd all had from their families, but wasn't available commercially, and that they hadn't had in a very long time since they lived in the city now for work. They were absolutely mystified as to how this American (me) managed to figure it out. Not until they met me and heard my lousy Italian grammar did they believe my husband wasn't secretly married to a little old Italian grandmother, heh. The book is like one giant Italian Proust Madeleine.NUTRTITIONThis book really emphasizes fresh, organic, whole foods.FOR ALL LEVELS OF COOKSI think this book would be excellent for a novice cook or a very experienced cook (or anyone in between). I loved it for the authentic recipes I've never come across in other texts, for the stories, and for the clarity of the directions. I would have loved it as a beginner cook because there's plenty to make that's not intimidatingly complex, and there are pictures. The sections on tomato sauce, broth, and sourcing/selecting ingredients would be extremely useful for a cook who was just starting out, or perhaps just moving from survivial cooking to loftier, more ambitious cooking.RECIPES I LOVECrackly Apply Meringue Cake, Rosemary Pear Tart, Chicken Balsamico, Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes, Pork with Peppers, Marinated Trout, Melting Cavolo Nero (Kale), Chickpea All Souls Soup (a basic recipe that can be used for many different beans), different things with Farro (wheat berries) -- and my goodness, I can't remember what all else. Suffice to say, the spine is cracked, the pages are wrinkled and stained, and it's just the best."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"Lynn's books combine history with recipes. You have the feeling you are sharing the Italian tradition, a link to great food. Anyone who enjoyed the extra food histories in her &quot;The Splendid Table&quot; must sample this great new Italian cookbook. Her researching is painstaking and exhaustive.I know because I first met her in 1984; I prepared a dinner for her that year, using a new recipe for butterflied leg of lamb on the grill, and only later did I discover it was her recipe from an issue of &quot;Bon Appetit&quot;. That meal was a highlight of my amateur career, shared only with the pleasure of being a part of her pre-publication surprise party for submission of the manuscript of &quot;The Splendid Table&quot;.Lynn's recipes live - - they talk to you.

Grazie molto Lynne."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"This is so much more than just a cookbook; it is a fascinating look at all aspects of Italian &quot;country&quot; cooking. Lynn Rossetto Kasper's deep love for her Italian heritage seeps out of every page of this book, and you can't help but share her enthusiasm. She takes you through the basics of Italian cooking in a whole new light. For example, not only does she teach you how to make pasta, but she also unravels the mystery of how to pair pasta and sauce. Even better, she tells you which brands of dried pasta are best and exactly how to cook them. The section on tomato sauces is amazing. She doesn't just give you a few recipes - she explains the four basic varieties of tomato sauces and when to use each. Reading this book teaches you how to think about food like an Italian home cook. Once you can do that, you don't need a recipe to plan a meal, just the right ingredients and a love for great food."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"I've been a great fan of Lynne Rossetto Kaspar's &quot;The Splendid Table&quot; for several years now, having prepared and enjoyed many great meals from that award winning book. Although &quot;The Italian Country Table&quot; is less comprehensive and detailed than &quot;The Splendid Table,&quot; it offers an irresistable selection of recipes from the Italian countryside. The fabulous food of Apulia is one of Italy's greatest culinary secrets, and Kasper gives us a delicious sampling of wonderful Apulian dishes like Pizza Rustica, Fava Beans, and Pasta Puttenesca. My copy is already stained and soiled, the sign of a cookbook that gets a lot of use. These are recipes you'll make again and again. And Kasper is a wonderful writer as well. The book is filled with lore and stories from Italian families throughout the countryside."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"Lynne Kasper writes like a dream, knows how to record a recipe, and has one of the finest palates in America. Her earlier book, The Splendid Table, was a classic that captured the heights of Italian cooking. The Italian Country Table is different: the recipes are much more approachable and suited for everyday cooking. But is it ever! I have over 100 cookbooks, and this one finds its way into my hands basically every week. What else do you need to know?"},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"Lynne Rosetto Kasper firmly established herself in the Italian culinary pantheon with &quot;The Splendid Table,&quot; and this book is a worthy successor. Rather than focusing on the food of one region, in her latest volume she has narrowed the range of the recipes to cover the simple, rustic fare made in homes throughout the Italian countryside. This does not mean, however, that the food is unsophisticated! Perhaps more than any other cuisine, the food of the Italian farmhouse manages to be both robust and elegant -- perfectly suited to modern palates and sensibilities -- and Lynne captures these flavors triumphantly in clear, easy to follow recipes. Her historical and personal asides place this cuisine in a context that makes you feel as though you are a legitimate heir, bringing these dishes to your own table and families. These are perhaps not the tour de force dishes that you might present at an important dinner, but the food that will become a regular part of your life. To me, there is no higher compliment to a cookbook author than that transmission of living tradition. Brava, Lynne!"},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"This engagingly written book captures the vibrant spirit and traditions of the Italian countryside in an enticing blend of evocative text and authentic family recipes. The hearty, down-to-earth dishes described by Lynne Rossetto Kasper range from appetizers to desserts, and nearly all of the ingredients called for in the recipes are not difficult to find. A helpful discussion of ingredients, a list of shopping sources, and appealing menus add to the book's usefulness.Another book I recommend wholeheartedly is &quot;Recipes and Remembrances from an Eastern Mediterranean Kitchen,&quot; by Sonia Uvezian. This culinary gem belongs in every cookbook collector's library."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"Recreate an Italian countryside vacation with this book. The recipes are mainly simple and inspired by the cooking of Italian people (as opposed to restaurants or famous chefs). They capture the simplified essence of country Italian cooking that so many American &quot;Italian&quot; restaurants and cookbooks miss. A few fresh ingredients create compositions that are not overpowering or rich. It is the anti Olive Garden cookbook. The emphasis is on subtle combinations of flavors supplied by fresh ingredients - many of the recipes (gasp!) dont include garlic. It is a fun cookbook to have if you are a gardener because fresh herbs and vegetables are a must to pull off many of the recipes. I have made about 10 of the recipes and all have been fantastic. I guarantee that the hobbyist chef will learn a great deal through her informative vignettes."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"I purchased this book after reading (yes, reading it - cover to cover) at a friends vacation house.

Even though, for health reasons, I don't eat the starches and desserts, I consider myself to have gotten a bargain. In fact, many of the recipes can be adapted to the &quot;lower carbohydrate&quot; way of eating for weight loss and cardiovascular health. For example, last night I made the Balsamico Roast Chicken without the potatoes. I served it with my own Saute of Roasted Fennel and Tomatoes with Smoked Peppers from &quot;The Gourmet Prescription&quot;. A great protein/carbohydrate pairing.

Neither is true.I have well over 200 cookbooks, 20 - 30 of which fall into the 'Italian cookbook' category.This book was given to me as a Christmas gift in 2000 (Pre-Amazon, I'm sure). I have made many of the recipes, and it's my 'go-to' cookbook when I'm searching for dinner ideas.In addition to numerous recipes in all categories (Salads, pasta, soups, meats, rice/grains/beans, vegetables, pizza, desserts), there are stories/anecdotes interspersed, which make you feel as if you're in Italy on a Saturday afternnon.While some of the recipes are familiar--and can therefore be found in many cookbooks--the author translates the cooking process into something special and unique. Thus, you don't just walk away with a recipe for chicken, fish, or sauce. Rather, the recipes are magical. I have made the RISOTTO IN THE STYLE OF MILAN so many times that the pages are falling out of the book. Guests RAVE (!!) about this dish, and if I could cook for the President or Julia Child, this is one of the dishes I would make.Other favorites of mine include:* Tagliarini with Fresh Artichokes, Parmigiano, and Lemon (can you stand it?);* Sausage, Peppers and Shells (cut back on the wine, as it makes a lot of sauce);* Nonna's Home-Style Lasagna (add a dash of nutmeg);* Risotto in the Style of Milan (shoot me now; I have had a peak life experience);* Wine-Glazed Chicken (Add a few satueed mushrooms);* Ninth-Night Lamb (It takes a while to cook, but it's good);* Spicy Spinach and Tomoatoes (enough said).Anyhow, if you don't love this book, contact me and I'll buy it back from you. It is not a 'stand-alone' cookbook, so you will need others, but my word, this one is incredible."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I love listening to The Splendid Table and I think Ms. Kasper is fantastic.

I enjoy reading the little vignettes which accompany so many of the recipes and all of her recipes sound delicious (at least by looking at the ingredient list).That being said, I unfortunately found The Italian Country Table to be overly complicated and fussy at times. Sometimes her techniques are legitimate (for example, her technique for polenta -- long but worth it). Many times, however, they are not (in my humble opinion). Every time I want to cook something from this book, I am discouraged by something starting with, \\"Mince together 1 onion, 1/2 cup of parsley, 4 sages leaves and a slice of pancetta.\\" Even to me, an avid cook, this is too much trouble. I agree that rolling your own pasta is the gold standard but for working stiffs such as myself, how about some reasonable alternatives such as buying fresh pasta and putting it through the machine a few times?Disclaimers: I have been spoiled by \\"Red, White and Greens\\" by Faith Willinger, which was my first primer to Italian food. All of her recipes are easy and almost all of them are delicious. Also - I am vegetarian so I can only comment on the vegetable and grain dishes in this book, which perhaps are not its strong point.Again, I still want to like this book -- In fact, I am trying the Tuscan Mountain Supper tonight!"},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"Love the \\"look inside\\" feature of the book. The narrative looks interesting butI choose cookbooks based on how a recipe is written. There were no examples of recipes shown...just one or two in different catagories would be enough to makea purchasing decision. Can't rate the book as I did not purchase it."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"This book was recommended to me by an Italian friend when I asked for a cookbook recommendation that could serve as sort of an Italian cuisine bible. Over the last 4 years, every recipe I've tried as seemed to be time consuming to make and slightly disappointing to eat.I'm planning to buy 1 or 2 Biba books to replace this one."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"I added a star after I found myself using the book again for ideas on what to do with my box of veggies from the farm.I rarely measure, and like farm house books.Like the chapter explanations and I may try making pasta again!Came back from Italy last week, and realize how much cooking has drifted, sometimes for the better inthe NW.If you want a cookbook that shows how to make more of the common things you see in the resturants in central Italy, buy a copy of Great Italian Food (Maxi Series) (Paperback)by Australian Women's Weekly. The dessert section alone is worth the price of the book.You will happy if you have your own parsley, sage, rosemary and bucket of fresh basil, hard to make this with out that."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"I bought this title after looking and looking at many reviews for Italian cookbooks. I have made 5-6 recipes and cannot rave about even one."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to find a book like Lynne Rossetto Kasper's &quot;The Italian Country Table&quot;.I collect cook books and books that even mention cooking. This one is a gem. It is the type where you can quickly find a particular recipe and/or the type to leisurely read in your favorite chair, underling and referencing all the while. *sigh* This is truly a work of delicious art. Thank you Ms. Kasper, thank you, thank you, and thank you."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"This cookbook won the James Beard and Julia Child Awards for a reason. I originally bought this book for the chocolate polenta cake recipe and that alone was worth it. But to my surprise, there is a history of the Italian country side along with many great recipes. This is a very good Italian cookbook or a good travelogue or a great combo."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"As others have said, a delightful cookbook. Delicious recipes, and engaging views of the author's Italian heritage and travels. My only problem - and it's a significant one - is the poor quality of the binding. My copy is held together by a rubber band, as the middle 1/4\\" has fallen completely free of the binding. I expect better in a hardcopy cookbook. Printers should remember that cookbooks are often laid flat when they're used. My copy broke apart within weeks of receipt."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"I bought this cookbook for my recently retired father who has discovered a love for cooking (after 30 years of preparing the same 3 dishes). Just days after he recieved the book, he called me raving that he and my mother loved it, that the first dish he made (chicken balsamico) was an 11 or 12 on a scale of 10. Since then he has tried many more recipes and they've all been sucessful and delicioso."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"Besides the wonderful narrative of the origins of this countryside cuisine, these recipes are bold, basic and sumptuous. This is food that sticks to your ribs, and romances your tastebuds.I've grown especially fond of several recipes, unemcumbered in their ingredients and prep, but so flavorful and magnificent to share with dining guests: e.g. Braised Pork with Three Peppers and Linguine with Pistachio-Almond Pesto.Sidebar discussions are unique and teach us much, e.g. How to Spice up your minestrone, or &quot;buying cornmeal for polenta.&quot;This is one of those cookbooks to wear out in reading and cooking and sharing and loving."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"\`The Italian Country Table' is Lynne Rossetto Kasper's second book, a follow-up to the \`won every award in the book' title, \`The Splendid Table', which is also the name of Ms. Kasper's National Public Radio show which I have not yet had the pleasure of hearing.It is a great pleasure to see a book this good in such a crowded field. Ms. Kasper has narrowed the field a bit by focusing on \`country' recipes. By doing this, she is outflanking the Hazan / Bastianich / Batali / Bugialli / Scicolone crowd and even sidestepping the footprints of the great Elizabeth David's \`Italian Food'. Instead, her primary competition is from Susan Herrmann Loomis, who has made a business out of \`farmhouse cooking', Vincent Schiavelli, who concentrates on Sicily (and to whom Ms. Kasper gives an acknowledgment), and Elizabeth Romer of \`The Tuscan Year'. As Ms. Romer and Senor Schiavelli spend more time on memoir material than they do on culinary content, the real comparison is with Ms. Loomis, who is at a disadvantage in that her home base is in France rather than in Italy.As Ms. David discovered in 1954, Italian cooking in the hinterlands can be both utterly simple or it can be incredibly complex, especially for dishes designed for major celebrations. The star of this book may very well be its vegetarian timbale made for weddings. In Italian, it is even named as a wedding dish, \`Timballo Matrimoniale'. The joker behind this recipe is that it is not a genuine rural Italian dish. It is the invention of the author based on the famous dish that typically contains three or four different varieties of meat. I have seen a timbale made twice. The first was on Mario Batali's show of three years ago, \`Mario Eats Italy'. The second, and much more accessible version was in Stanley Tucci's movie, \`Big Night', where the chef, played by \`Adrian Monk' himself, Tony Shaloub, makes two of these monster pies or \`molds'. Ms. Kasper's version is true to the heritage of this dish, as it involves six subassemblies, a page and a half of ingredients, and two pages of procedure.This complicated dish is not a singularity in this book. There are genuinely rustic \`enhanced' versions of many other Italian specialities, such as a very jazzed up version of the Caprese salad.While \`The Splendid Table' limited itself to Emilia-Romagna, the current book includes recipes from the Alps to Sicily, although the larger number seem to come from Lazio (Rome) and north of Rome. I am especially happy to find both simple and complicated recipes here, as it reassures me that the author is not limiting herself to just simple recipes. Although, she does offer some genuinely simple methods for some tasks which may appear difficult at first, such as making homemade soft pasta.Ms. Kasper's method, almost identical to the one I have seen Sr. Batali do on numerous occasions, is the classic eggs in the well, with the added recommendation that we eschew the mechanical pasta roller and do everything by hand.I am really hard pressed to find any general, substantive difference between the book by Ms. Loomis and the book by Ms. Kasper. I will give a small edge to Ms. Kasper for the wider range of recipe complexity, more genuinely personal connection to the material, and for the better digressions into the history of some Italian culinary traditions. Ms. Kasper also opens a window to a true taste of \`Italian Kitsch' when she digresses on local museums of recently antiquated farm tools and homemade toys.Both books cover the full range of subjects, although Ms. Kasper seems to be a bit more focused on important recipes. Ms. Kasper includes all the typical subjects in her chapters, which are:Antipasti / Light MealsPasta (sauces without tomatoes)Pasta Meets the TomatoRice, Grains, and BeansSoupPoultry, Meats, and FishVegetables and SaladsFocaccia, Pizza and Breads of IngenuityDessertsMenusIngredientsBoth books also give very good press to the Italian practice of boarding tourists in farmhouses as a method to provide income to local farmers in the face of the new European Union agricultural regulations.Ms. Kasper has excellent appendices on mail order sources for foods and seeds, plus the contacts for a wide selection of restaurants and farm boarding establishments in Italy. She also has a carefully identified \`Partial Bibliography' which concentrates on personal and regional writings on Italian food. The \`big' books from Elizabeth David, Marcella Hazan, and Giuliano Bugialli are not here.If I were to be copy editing this book, the only suggestion I would make regarding it's layout is that it include a map of Italy's principle provinces and cites and indicate more clearly, with each recipe, from where in Italy the recipe comes.I do give extra points for the great personal black and white snaps that decorate the sidebars on personal experiences in Italy. I also give extra credit for revealing something about broth making which is new to my understanding of both broth making in general and Italian brodo's in particular. I am not fond of the longish cooking time for this broth, but I take Ms. Kasper at her word that this is how they actually make \`Brodo di Mamma' in Imola.If you are already a big fan of Ms. Loomis' other books, get her \`Italian Farmhouse Cookbook'. Otherwise, Ms. Kasper's book seems to be just a little deeper and more authentic, from a spiritual native of Italy."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"My copy of this book, battered from much use, is one of the best cookbooks I've ever found.

He loved it so much I bought him his very own. Every recipe he has made has been great. He enjoys cookbooks that share the history of the area where the recipes originated, and told me that this book is worth at least 10 books+ by other cookbook authors. We now have about two to three Italian meals a week. I consider my husband a gourmet cook, and this book enhances both his ability and creativity in cooking. After spending three weeks in Italy several years ago, we have yearned for authentic Italian cooking, and we have found it in this cookbook."},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"The Italian Country Table has been one of my all time favorite cookbooks. I love the tender stories and information she included about Italian food, ingredients, food history, and Italian culture. The recipes are not always easy or quick to prepare. But as one who truly enjoys her time in the kitchen, I am not at all intimidated. However, the results are always knock out delicious. Having travelled several times in various regions of Italy, I find Ms. Kasper's knowledge of the very real distinctiveness of the foods peculiar to each region quite interesting.

We have tried so many of the recipes already and find them delicious - the surprising thing is that they please our whole family. Also, the book is a joy to read, even when not searching for a recipe. The descriptions of the Italian countryside, people, and way of life are delightful. We thoroughly enjoy the wine recommendations also, and have discovered that substituting less costly brands of Italian meats works just as well as the expensive ones recommended. Being on a budget, we have also substituted regular Parmesan cheese for the more expensive type used in these recipes, with very satisfying results. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Italian Country Table: Home Cooking from Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens","review":"This is an excellent starter book for the ordinary cook who wants the inside scoop on the kitchen habits of generations of Italian women.

I'm so glad I did because it was absolutely amazing. food is as close to authentic as you can get, the book is a great read, the recipes aren't overly complicated and they actually work most of the time (unlike some of the competition.) I'm looking at you Jamie Oliver.Overall the pasta chapters were glorious, risottos were delicious and I would recommend this book for those things alone.Of course there were a few head scratching moments: \\"Sausage Peppers and Shells\\" was simply disgusting. \\"Stufato\\" apparently means that the ingredients don't fit in the suggested pot and when you do get them in it's half burnt and half raw. Her foodie side means that you end up spending a small fortune on olive oil although most of the recipes are inexpensive on their own.Of course you can't get it right all the time and Lynn delivers enough of the time to make it well worth your while.

The entire text is written in the present and the compound past so it is a great beginning reader useful to motivate inexperienced readers of French.

The boy has no name, only going by the name of his sword, the &quot;Onikirimaru,&quot; the Ogre Slayer. His quest, which ultimately is for acceptance, is to become human. At once sad, because of the seeming impossibility of his quest, but also profoundly hopeful, Ogre Slayer is the story of a boy and his dream of being human. A must read for anyone who enjoys good story-telling."},{"Title":"Ogre Slayer","review":"This book contains five short stories of horror with a mythological base. The fantastic elements are very well woven into realistic frames of everyday life, which makes it all even more spine chilling.The ogres here are not evil things that lurk on innocent people, but they come from the people themselves. This can happen if a person is so overcome by anger and bitterness that she turns into an ogre, herself, like, for example, a constantly bullied high school student, a girl who is raped, or a mother whose child is killed. The stories are in no way black and white, and the complexity makes it all very interesting.The artwork is excellent, with dramatic page layouts and contrasting blacks and whites (almost frank-milleresque at times, but much smoother). I've heard some people complain about Kusunoki's way of drawing noses, though.After Akira and Domu, this book has been my main source of inspiration for blood splatter and speed lines.

In this book he says he is a prophet and apostle who has direct visions from heaven. He compares himself and one of his visions with the apostle Paul.He also has a specific method of interpreting Scritpure that is different from the main line expressions of the Christian faith. I believe he is connected to what is known as the holiness movement.His view of gayness is thus filtered through his particular view of the Christian experience.While the title of the book implies that he is going to show great compassion on those who are gay it is a certain kind of compassion that shows no real understanding of gayness.This book and the author shows absolutely no sensitivity or true understanding of why people are gay. I bought this book based upon the two reviews which gives it highmarks and by the compassionate title. I found little true compassion, a lot of personal grandizing by the writer and much ignorance about the subject.While pastor Williams certainly has every right to his understanding of the Christian faith and of his understanding of gayness, I do not think most readers will learn very much that will be helpful in this book.

Brian Bendis just keeps webbing out in strands of silk great work on ol' spidey taking him to places he has never before or imagined impossible. This new Venom has a greater impact on him who is more closer and personal,to him than ever before and this new modern day interpretation is brilliant adaption as ever of the orignal story arc.And therefore venom has always been one of Spider-man's most intriguing and formidably puzzling villanious foes and he's no different here in this new age adaptation of the classic wall crawler.Who is well and truly back, with a new look and costume now to go with it.And this story of course take place in meeting with his childhood friend Eddie Brock, who then starts hanging around him for it.In which eddie then unwittingly tells his secret to Parker about his parents who worked their whole lives to find a cure for cancer,as biosuit enigneers for in which Parker tries to finish the work off for him but unfortunetly instead gets a whole lot more than he bargained for sadly because he is now attached to and controlled by this seething alien sentient black liquid being for in which he tries to get rid of it as a new costume and then of course gets reacquainted with his old previous friend Eddie who tries to steal the suit off from him and becomes his new sworn arch enemy Venom.And this is where the more personal aspect of Venom comes in for Parker but for not Venom of course. The artwork in the end is fantastic and the quality of Mark Bagley's work just keeps getting better visually, for in which it is truly a shame that he will no longer be illustrating top notch graphic novels. The characterization in this graphic novel is exceptional and we see aspects of Mary Jane, Eddie and Gwen that are new that are new that we haven't seen before for in which again as we start to get and up close feel of Parker and Nick Fury. There is no doubt that this is one of the Ultimates books by far and the best of them and venom is undoubtedly the perfect match for Spider-man. The dialogue is realistically believable, even amusing at times for in which Parker is well known for his smart witty wise crack one liners that is to say it is for anyone wanting to get into this comic book lore there's no better place to start here with this new graphic novel series called:Venom which is not the last of the series and just grabbing this and any of Mark Millar's incredibly published and Ultimate books in the end is of course a great start to this new series for reading in readers who already familar with the wall crawler himself spiderman.Great reading great art work in the end all in all a incredible book to behold and read as a graphic novel saga!"},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"This continues the story of the Ultimate wall crawler as he meets his greatest enemy.Now I will admit Venom isn't really used to the fullest.But It is basically a way to bring him into the story and show how much of a threat he can be and will be in the future stories.A must have for all fans of the series."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"Origin of Venom and new black Spidey suit. Looks cool in new suit but doesn't really last for too long. Nick Fury gives Spidey some encouragement to being a superhero."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"I picked up Ultimate Spider-man at my local library (who happens to be gracious to enough to have all the TPB volumes currently available). Even though I'm a fairly avid Marvel fan I had no idea what the premise of the book was. Needless to say, I was presently surprised.I began reading at the 6th volume here and I think this modern day reinterpretation of Venom is brilliant. Venom has always been one of Spider-man's most intriguing and polarizing villians and he's no different in this new age adaptation. The dialogue is realistic and believable, not to mention also laugh-out-loud funny. Peter Parker's modus operandi of one-liners is at full strength here. The art is also phenomenal, when I heard Bagley had recently left the title after the issue 111 I was thoroughly disappointed. The art is perfect, I cannot imagine it being drawn by anyone else. Praise also to the inkers and colorists, they do a great job as well.I'm a long-time Marvel fan. I've followed to company for the better part of a decade and I must say, the Ultimate Universe is well....Ultimate. If you've been comtemplating jumping into comics, yet are intimidated by the convoluted history of much of the Marvel U, then pick these books up. While you're at it, grab some of Mark Millar's incredible \\"Ultimates\\" books. This stuff is comic book gold."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"I specifically bought this volume, as I have always liked reading the conflict between Venom and Spidey. The origins of Venom are different in this reboot series, but make more sense. Esessentially, Peter Parker and Eddie Brock start out as friends and the goo that attaches itself to Peter and then Eddie was actually created by their fathers as a cure for cancer. It is a really good twist, I think, rather than the outer space plot used in the original Spiderman. Venom is evil as always and his battle with Spiderman makes for great reading. Definately recommended!"},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"This is the best Ultimate Spider-Man story yet! Venom is reinvented Ultimate style and he's never been better.

Spidey doesn't keep it long as he almost kills someone.Eddie, who he finds out via Gwen is really a 'dirtbag' as she put it, is not quite so picky."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"Having grown up reading the adventures of Spider-Man and his villainous arch-enemy Venom in the regular Marvel universe, I wasn't sure what to expect from this re-vamping of the character. I guess that this incarnation of Venom is not as evil or dangerous as the original, but it was inevitable that an \\"ultimatized\\" Venom would be brought in at some point, so there's nothing to be done about it. I still like the original Venom better, but this one is still OK and has potential to become better. This version of the popular villain has origins in a \\"miracle-cure\\" scientific experiment that Peter Parker's genius father had been working on. Peter, who comes across some of the data and documentaion about the Venom project, wants to check it out. This is, after all, part of his father's legacy. Things do not go as planned, however, and the project develops a mind of its own. I had better not give any more away than that, though. Overall, this book was still good, but is probably the weakest storyline of the bunch, when compared to the previous five TPB-collected story arcs."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"That was flippin' awesome! Venom is AMAZING!So what if he's a failed cure for cancer? They did a FANTASTIC job with the story! The only downside is: If you want all your questions answered, you gotta play the Ultimate Spider-Man video game."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"Most of my \\"comic experience\\" is from the Ultimate series. However, from what I know about the original Venom, this guy doesn't hold a candle to him. To many avid Venom fans, the twist the authors pull here was a disapointment. I found it interesting, but I think, had this been the original story, Venom would not be as popular a villian as he is today. I also feel that the story arcs in prior graphic novels are much more fufilling then this one, and while I enjoy it, it is not my favorite."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"Vol 6 was one of the ones that went mssing from my collection. I finally got a new copy and read it again. Just as good as ever!"},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"In the ultimate spiderman graphic novels venom stars in a three volume series (volume 7, 11, and 21). There are a lot of negative things about this book. First of all the art. A lot of the characters in this book look realy distorted and Peter Parker looks nothing like how he should look like. Second is the story line. In this versian of Venom's origin Eddie Brock was a long lost friend of Peter parker. The black suit was actually something their Fathers created as a cure for cancer. I like Venom's origin a lot better in the Spiderman 3 movie. There is also a lot of stupid little details in this book that only I would pick up, in the begining Aunt May was talking about Jimi Hendrix and later she was wearing a Led Zepplin shirt. She is way to old to be from the 60's rock generation. Thats just silly! If you are a die hard Venom fan purchase this book but if your not don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"Okay folks I admit this is a Good Story. Venom is introduced in a less confusing simplified Origin. I like the the idea that Pete and Eddie were friends at one point. Although somewhere in the first or second year of Ultimate Spidey...a Reporter named Eddie Brock is mentioned...Could be a distant realitive but, not likely. Also his death at the end? Why does He have to DI (Yeah I know according to the Ultimate Spider-man game, he didnt but as far as I'm concerned that doesnt apply...). And Venom seems to be reduced to some slobbering idiot (much Like the Goblin...notice a Trend here?) Good Story. Could be Better though."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"This review refers to Ultimate Spider-Man vol. 6 paperback edition: VenomAfter other Spider-Man villains, finally fans are treated to the coming of Ultimate Venom! My personal favorite out of Spidey's rogue's gallery, Eddie Brock is given a background and origin very different from the main stream character. Also, Spider-Man's black suit origin is much different. No longer is the grand space-opera of the Secret War mentioned. Now it is a life saving experiment gone wrong.Not only does Bendis do a flawless job of presenting Venom, he further complicates Peter and MJ's relationship, and the hints of tension with Gwen grow.My only gripe about Ultimate Spider-Man is a small one, but does EVERYONE know Peter Parker is Spider-Man? Whatever happened to a secret identity being secret, anyway? Yet another character learns Peter's secret in this volume, making me wonder who's next?Bendis's scripting is very good, and I think this is Bagley's best art yet.This volume reprints Ultimate Spider-Man #33-39, and can be enjoyed by all ages, by newcomers and established fans.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"This book was pretty good, and was actually the reason why I started collecting Ultimate Spider-man comics. It introduced the Ultimate Universe to Eddie Brock, and old friend to Peter. When they learn of a suit that could cure cancer, Peter Parker (Spider-man) accidently put it on. His strength and attitude was increased. He got rid of the costume before it permantly changed him. Eddie Brock figured out that Peter was Spider-man and put the suit on himself. He became Venom, a very crazy, strong, and strange-looking monster. If your looking for a book that has Venom at his best, this is not it. This Venom is very different from the regular Marvel Universe's Venom. This story is basically a shortened version of a story that marvel did in more than 100 or so issues! Its still a good story, plus it has Ultimate Shocker and Ultimate Nick Fury! I hope this helped you in making your decision on getting this book."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"The grand conceit of the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; comics is that they go back to the beginning of the story when the bite of an irradiated spider granted high school student Peter Parker amazing arachnid-like powers. For those who remember the first 100 issues or so of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man,&quot; writer Brian Michael Bendis, penciler Mark Bagley, and inkers Art Thibert and Rodney Ramos have been providing a high intensity retelling of the tale. This time around Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy are fellow high school students of Peter Parker and the fateful encounter with the Green Goblin comes early on. In this sixth collection of the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man,&quot; which brings together issues #33-39, there is a quantum leap beyond the Stan Lee days of the original comic to retell the story of Venom.At this point in the tale Captain Stacy is killed while in pursuit of a burglar who had gone on a crime spree posing as Spider-Man, leaving Aunt May to offer his orphaned daughter Gwen a place to live. Meanwhile, after defeating the burglar who has been posing as Spider-Man, Peter is stunned to find out that Mary Jane, who has not only been his girlfriend but the one person he trusts who knows he is Spider-Man, can no longer stand the pressure and breaks up with him. In the wake of that shock Peter connects with Eddie Brock, now a student at Empire State University. It seems Peter and Eddie's dad worked together at the lab and Peter thinks Eddie would like a copy of a videotape of their families enjoying a picnic. Eddie is touched, and has something to show Peter as well, something he calls their &quot;inheritance.&quot;Of course, this is the &quot;black costume,&quot; now no longer and alien parasite but a genetic bodysuit. While experimenting with it, the suit leaps onto Peter who discovers it has one big advantage over his regular Spidey suit: it repairs the damage done to him by bullets. But when Spider-Man catches up with the burglar who killed Uncle Ben, his new suit literally goes in for the kill. Eventually Peter will go to Eddie for help, and then it will be time for the suit to find a new person with whom to play and Venom, Spider-Man's evil twin, is truly born.One of the improvements Bendis and Bagley came up with for their revisionist version of Spider-Man was the idea that it was Peter's father who was the scientific genius who came up with the webbing formula. They build on that foundation again by working in both Eddie Brock and the Venom costume into the fabric of the Parker family saga, not to mention Curt Connors. Knowing Eddie gives the conflict with Venom more depth and Peter gets to be a smart kid without being a genius on the level of Tom Swift. The subplot of Nick Fury being something of a quasi-guardian angel and part-time mentor for Spider-Man is continued, and watching Aunt May and Gwen bond is also going to make things interesting down the road.The &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; comics lend themselves to being collected as trade paperbacks because the Ultimate titles focus on multi-issue story arcs. This allows for stories of greater depth that play upon the &quot;original&quot; stories on which they are based, and also helps avoid the problem when Spider-Man has to fight a different villain each month. I am curious as to what readers who missed out on the first decade of the original &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; think about this retelling of the web-slingers saga think about these comics, given they missed everything the first time around. But I find them to be a thoughtful and rather ambitious reconceptualization."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"When I first heard that the Symbiote was going to be a cure for cancer, I was dissapointed.

Peter decides to try the 'suit' and chaos ensues.Writer Brian Michael Bendis once again showcases his superb writing style with realistic dialogue and fantastic characterization (this book has an equal balance of dialogue and action; as many consider Bendis' work to have too much dialogue). Also Mark Bagley's pencils are as good as ever, accurately displaying the characters' emotions as well as clearly showing action scenes. Transparency Digital's colors are also quite good, showing a wide array of colors throughout the story.Fans looking for more superb writing from Bendis and great artwork from Bagley will not be disappointed.This book shows why Ultimate Spider-Man is the best book in Marvel's Ultimate line and also one of the best comics on the market."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"The Ultimate Venom TPB is awesome, and a worthy read, however, once you get to the end, there are too many questions left unanswered.

It's been confirmed by Marvel, Activision, and Bendis that the videogame is canon to the comicbook, so those who aren't gamers just lost 1/2 of the story."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 6: Venom","review":"Here's a good introduction to Eddie Brock with a strong continuation of the series.

I would gladly order from here again."},{"Title":"Candlelight Spells: The Modern Witch's Book of Spellcasting, Feasting, and Healing","review":"This was one of the first books I ever got on the subject, and I loved it at the time. Today I came across an old copy and re-read it, and remembered WHY it made such an impression on me. It's great! Written from a refreshingly non-goofy standpoint, it's much more of a hands-on, real world guide to Wicca and Witchcraft than a lot of the hokey, New Agey things you come across today. Yes, some of the spells might be scary to the \\"nothing but love and light!\\" crowd, but grown-ups know that the Witches of old used LOTS of less-than-positive spells when the situation called for it. This isn't that \\"other\\" religion, and that \\"turn the other cheek\\" nonsense has no place in a Pagan worldview. Some circumstances require defensive and even aggressive magic, and cowering in fear of some theoretical \\"threefold law\\" isn't going to do you much good.This book really has everything. Information on the Sabbats, basics of spellcasting, recipes for incense.....you name it. Better still, as I mentioned before it's really pretty down-to-earth and hands-on; the \\"good stuff\\" isn't buried under 20 tons of filler. The only drawbacks I can see are her less-than-enchanting recipes (will the average person REALLY eat baked squirrels? Is that even safe? And don't even THINK about trying to make her Mandrake wine!) and she could perhaps spend a little more time going in to the \\"how magic works\\" stuff. However, it's still a great resource and looking through it today, I was reminded of why I wanted to be a Witch in the first place, and how amazing Wicca (the religion) and Witchcraft (the practice of magic) can be when you're not trying to bury it under made up, fluffy bunny (a term I can't stand, but really the best way I can think of to describe what I'm getting at) let's-all-hold-hands-and-hug-a-tree New Age BS."},{"Title":"Candlelight Spells: The Modern Witch's Book of Spellcasting, Feasting, and Healing","review":"I have to disagree witch what the woman from Chicago said.

I thought most of it was good and it goes hand in hand with the rede. But some doesn't,But-hey nothin' is perfect. Some GREAT healing spells, good recipes. and many good spells.

Anyone who practices magick knows that your intent and will is the most effective tools of magick. If you must buy this book, read it with a HUGE grain of salt."},{"Title":"Candlelight Spells: The Modern Witch's Book of Spellcasting, Feasting, and Healing","review":"Filled with many spells, recipes, a lexicon, an herbal section, and more, this book is interesting, fun to read, and not as bad as many of the fanatical Wiccan reviewers condemn it to be. Sub-titled &quot;The Modern Witch's Book of Spellcasting, Feasting and Natural Healing&quot; this should tell you that it is not a book about Wicca. It is basically a book about Witchcraft, which is much older and varied than Wicca. True, there are a few naughty spells in this book, but so what? The author, who mentions the Rede/Law of Three in the start of the book, is not forcing you to operate them. She gives you the facts and warnings, and then lets you decide for yourself what is right and wrong, unlike so many other Wiccan authors (and others) who try to censor anything that they feel comes close to &quot;violating&quot; the Wiccan Rede, and who preach unendingly about karma, karma, karma, the way Christians scream about hellfire, sin and eternal damnation. Why does Wicca seem lately like a repackaged version of Catholicism with a feminist twist? Lighten up Wiccans! Realize that the Wiccan Rede and 3-fold karmic retribution are concepts that were developed in the 20th century by English author Gerald Gardener and prior to that was totally unheard of (let alone followed) by Witches in any culture. I'm not saying you should work black magick, but do not live in fear that everything you do is going to be judged and punished by the Gods of Karma, the way the Christians believe that you will be judged and punished by God. But even Christians believe in &quot;an eye for an eye.&quot; Sometimes bad people need to be punished, whether by the law or by a spell. To let someone get away with causing harm to others is, in my opinion, just as bad. Wiccans may not hex or use magick to cast love spells on particular individuals, but many Witches do when they feel the time is appropriate. Even famous English Witch Sybil Leek was known to take this stand. Besides, anyone who knows enough about the laws of magick should know that magick, which is energy, does not always rebound upon the sender. Alot can happen to magickal energy from the time it is sent to the time it reaches its destination. Energy is very transformational and unpredictable. Furthermore, magick knows no good or bad, black or white. It is pure energy. We decide what is good or bad, mainly based on what society teaches us. Good and bad are subjective terms. Anyway, I've ranted long enough. Getting back to Ms. Dunwich's book, I recommend it more as a Witchcraft book; not so much as a Wiccan book. (And I may be wrong, but I sense that Gerina Dunwich is more of a Witch than a Wiccan at heart, even though most of her book titles contain the word Wicca) The recipes are interesting and are traditional in a Pagan sense. And yes Virginia, Pagans of old did feast on roasted squirrels, as well as rabbits, snakes, wild boars and just about anything else they could hunt with a bow and arrow or a spear."},{"Title":"Candlelight Spells: The Modern Witch's Book of Spellcasting, Feasting, and Healing","review":"I must disagree with the reader from Massachusetts who said &quot;The spells in this book are useless to anyone who practices the Rede of Harm None.&quot; Granted, there are a few spells in this book which violate the Rede, however, it is unfair to put all of its spells into this category. I've read this book and while I don't agree with everything its author says, I've found that it does contains some wonderful healing spells and love spells, and much that can be used even by those who live according to the Wiccan Rede. There are also a number of spells to protect one against evil and psychic attack, and there certainly isn't any negative magick to be found in the Amulets and Talismans section of the Spellcasting Chapter. This book also has some very good (and interesting) Pagan recipes and directions for making sachets, incense, and candles. There is also an entire section on how to use herbs to heal various ailments. This may not be the best book on the market to accurately reflect the beliefs and practices of the average Wiccan, but in all fairness, it is far from being the worst."},{"Title":"Candlelight Spells: The Modern Witch's Book of Spellcasting, Feasting, and Healing","review":"I started out with this book years ago and it is just as wonderful now as it was then.

Is is very heplful in many different ways and I recommend it to anyone interested or practicing witchcraft.Always, ~Tara~"},{"Title":"Candlelight Spells: The Modern Witch's Book of Spellcasting, Feasting, and Healing","review":"This book, like _WiccaCraft_ is also an indispensible reference tool. I have a really old copy, so well-used and worn it is held together entirely by luck, magick and duct tape. The pages are dog-eared, stained with cake batter or spilled herb tea, highlighted, underlined and scrawled with notes, with mugwort or basil pressed between chapters, or torn bits of notebook paper or cash register recipts used as improptu pagemarkers here and there. My copy of this book is a mess, and there is a reason for this. It is in constant use. At least until it falls apart and I have to get a new copy.As a reference tool it is unsurpassed. Her recipes are delicious, although some of the wild ingredients might be hard to find if you're living in an urban environment. They are easily adapted for those who like to improvise on a given theme, or for those who prefer to use whole-grain or vegetarian ingredients, although for the most part they're already healthy. Her cake recipes may be successfully baked with whole grain _pastry_ flour, and/or using honey in place of sugar; I've done much experimenting with her &quot;Esbat Cake&quot;, which I actually use for Sabbats and children's birthday parties. It is a big hit with children and adults alike, and made with whole grain pastry flour, honey, and yogurt, it is a light, moist, and richly flavored cake, perfect with either a whipped cream or light cream cheese frosting, or a simple dusting of powdered sugar over a lace doily.Back in the days when I was a Bright-Eyed Little Apprentice Witchling, my first teacher introduced me to this book. Since then, I've heard other new students complain that it doesn't give &quot;enough&quot; information on certain topics; yet I believe it was one of the most valuable learning tools I had. It is not, nor does it claim to be, a Complete Book of Everything You Need to Know to Become a Witch. Expecting that from _any_ book would be unwise on the part of any student or teacher. What it _is_ is one of the most excellent _supplemental_ texts I encountered during my own early training.The glossary in the back is a useful tool for any student, of course, as are the various reference lists for herbs and candle colors. Ample space is provided at the ends of recipes, spells and chapters for the student's questions, notes or their own spells and rituals. The resources in the back may be a little outdated (at least they are in my copy, which is older than dirt anyway) but nonetheless may prove useful to the student with the patience to shuffle through them, and take the time to write letters.The spells and rituals themselves provide excellent examples for the student to analyze. Ms. Dunwich does covers the Rede, but leaves it up to the student to interpret the rede and make responsible decisions in regard to ethics and spellcraft. Invocations and words of power are written in caps, making it easy for the student to study them independently should they choose. Her spells and rituals themselves provide an excellent learning opportunity for the student; my first teacher had me break them down and analyze them, then rewrite my own interpretations. The instructions for the spells provide plenty of room for improvisation, yet are clear and concise and complete as they are. She gives examples of a wide variety of spells, from simple folk-charms to elaborate ceremonies, to older rites no longer in popular use, and all provide a wealth of information to the truly interested and motivated student. In short, unlike so many mass-marketed spellbooks and texts, _Candlelight Spells_ is writen with the assumption that the reader has a brain and knows how to use it. This book makes an excellent supplemental text for students taking correspondence or online courses, workshop leaders, Wicca 101 or 201 teachers, or experienced Witches considering taking on an apprentice.Beyond study, this is a book that will get _used_. Some of the contacts and resources _are_ still around, the glossary is always helpful as are the correspondence listings, and, as mentioned before, the recipes are delicious. This isn't a one-time read-through book, this is a book that will become a companion and guide for the long haul. Pity it isn't available in a more durable hardcover. Thank the Gods for duct tape."},{"Title":"Candlelight Spells: The Modern Witch's Book of Spellcasting, Feasting, and Healing","review":"Some of the reviewers have had a field day with this book and have said some pretty nasty things about it (and the author). But I read this book a few years ago and I thought it was totally cool. It has some really awesome spells. I tried a few of them myself and I had really good results. Yeah, there are white, black, and grey spells in this book, just as there are white, black, and grey witches in the craft. Choose what is right for you, not for me!"},{"Title":"Candlelight Spells: The Modern Witch's Book of Spellcasting, Feasting, and Healing","review":"Overall there are six sections or chapters in this book. The first two provide Sabbat and Esbat recipes, including some recipes for incenses and other such things. As someone who doesn't equate witchcraft to any kind of religion those two chapters were pretty useless to me, and since I prefer to buy my incense instead of make it myself, the last few recipes weren't much of use to me either. Chapter three is about making candles. I didn't really get much out of this chapter, although I did buy the book thinking that its focus is candle magic (which, I'm sorry to say, it is not.) This chapter is pretty short. There's a recipe for a candle anointing oil, color symbolism is briefly discussed, and then there is a list of herbs and what their magical properties are (used when making your candles). Chapter four is about herbs. It starts off with a few \\"cures\\" for common ailments like headache and toothache that might have been used by village people. Then there's more herbs listed just to take up space. Chapter five is titled \\"Spellcasting\\" and is my favorite part of the book. There are a few spells that caught my eye, like \\"Spell to Acquire Wealth\\" on page 123. While I wouldn't mind trying it, the spell requires that one wear a talisman of seven gold rings on a gold chain around one's neck. If I had seven gold rings laying around, I wouldn't need a money spell, now would I? (Unless she's talking about a talisman that has seven rings drawn on it, which I personally haven't seen anywhere). I still like how the spell is written, so I might try it. Chapter seven \\"Lexicon of Witchcraft\\" is just a glossary of words and their meaning.Even though the author equated witchcraft to Wicca in the introduction and stated that all witches should follow the Wiccan Rede, she did not have a problem including spells that use drops of blood and even a \\"hex your enemies\\" spell. I personally don't have a problem with those kinds of spells and actually think that they should be in every book that says it's about witchcraft, but it seemed kind of hypocritical by what was said in the introduction of the book. It should be noted that a large number of the pages in this book are more than half-way empty. Some sections have one short spell per page...This, in my opinion, is a waste of trees, but I guess it makes the book appear longer.Overall, I was pretty disappointed, except for the spellcasting chapter (which is not worth the price of the book by itself). If the whole book was more like that chapter, instead of just listing herbs to take up space, I would have given it more stars.It wasn't what I was looking for personally, but I guess it might be useful to other people.

One of the first things I ever learned from my teachers was that it is wrong, wrong, WRONG to send negative energy at anyone, no matter how much you think they may deserve it. In doing so, you are only hurting yourself, for what ever kind of energy you send out, you get back three fold. Send out negativity get back negativity galore.I implore anyone that reads this book to review other texts and consider some of the author's suggestion's carefully before acting them out.

The writing process is not made clear in the book itself (whether it was dictated or co-authored, and the extent of changes by editors or translators). New editions could stand to have a forward that provides a little more context.There are better books around for a beginner to understand relativity, but this is certainly not the worst. There is always something to be said for reading primary sources, and the book is fairly short and can be read quickly. Students may want to stick to Part I (Special Relativity) and consult more contemporary books for General Relativity.The language is understandable for the most part. It is not as clean and simple a writing style as is common today -- in some places it is fairly elegant but in a few it is pointlessly baroque and awkward (perhaps a problem in the translation from German). Chapter 8 is an especially bad example: it could easily be written more clearly with about half the verbiage. In the older editions the translation is credited to Robert Lawson (apparently British) but this credit disappears in other versions.For people already familiar with the history of science, there are a lot of interesting little details, such as seeing how Einstein originally presents the description of the moving train, and seeing all the people that Einstein credits as having made an important impression on him and contributions to the theory and experiments. (I find guys like Stephen Wolfram interesting as well, but it sure is a refreshing contrast to read the modesty of someone like Einstein and all the people he generously and conscientiously credits.)"},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"This book has been reprinted by a whole variety of publishers, and I bought this to replace a copy I lost to loaning it out.It looks like it was copied from a fax printout.

It suffers from numerous spelling and typographical errors, but more importantly, the equations and diagrams are atrocious! I believe they scanned all tables, equations, and images, and then enlarged them. The images are all blurry and poorly printed. Some of the equations are unreadable because the parenthesis or square root signs are so blurred.Unfortunately (as other reviewers have pointed out), Amazon lumps all reviews for a work together, even for different printings. I'm convinced that the 5 stars for this book wouldn't be showing up for this specific printing.

These were the theories that changed the view of the universe and should be known by a wider base of people."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"In this book, Einstein appears to be explaining things to those people who have a hard-time digesting the ideas of relativity. I do not consider it to be a means to learn relativity. However, it can very well be used in parallel with some other book -- you read some other book, and if you find it hard to agree to the ideas mentioned, revert to this book. In my opinion, that is also what Einstein would have had in mind when he wrote that book.If you are serious about relavity, read his original papers. They are not as difficult as they say they are. In fact, since Einstein mentions everything in full detail, he sounds much more convincing and clearer than all those authors who hide intricate details of the subject."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Who's the best person to write a book on relativity if not Prof. Einstein himself? If you do not have a physics background don't be ashamed! The author presents a otherwise difficult theory in a very clear and manageable way. A person with any technical background can enjoy its reading and believe me, understand it as a whole.

I'm not exaggerating when I say special relativity is a difficult topic. Einstein's presentation is clearer than I would ever have thought possible, concise but never rushed.Some pages may require many readings.

When the special and general theorys of relativity were concieved of by Einstein, they revolutionized our perception of space and time. This revolution was so complete that many of the most significant physicists of the time believed that it was nonsense. When Einstein won the Nobel prize for his work on the photoelectric effect, his certificate unequivocally stated that the award was NOT given for his theory of relativity. For much of his life, even Einstein was unwilling to accept some of the predictions of his own work such as black holes.This is all very good, interesting science and history which should be read and understood by everyone. The problem is, though, that Einstein was not a particularly good writer. Einstein is too brilliant for his own good and it shows through frequently in this attempt to stoop to our level. His explanations are usually hard to follow and unintuitive(and I study physics even!). This book exists on an uncomfortable middle ground between rigor and easy reading.If you would like to read this book simply because of its (and its author's) historical significance then I couldn't discourage that. If you know little physics and want to try to understand relativity, however, read Kip Thorne's Black Holes and Time Warps or the first few chapters of Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"I have rated this book four stars, not because I feel that it is well above average but not spectacular, as that would normally indicate, but because I do not feel qualified to rate it and wish to have as little effect on its average rating as possible. I am a reasonably intelligent, reasonably well-educated individual with a good facility for numbers. Still, this book was well over my head. If you're planning a career in Mathematics or Physics, this book is probably necessary to your education, but unless you're truly brilliant, don't be surprised if you need qualified instruction to understand it. But if you're simply an intelligent, curious individual with a desire to comprehend Einstein's theories, don't be surprised if you can't make hash of this book."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Even though this book is marketed (and meant) as an accessible exposition of relativity theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not as easy to read as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than high-school knowledge of the relevant subjects. Maybe this was true in his time, but nowadays the book demands way more than that. I'm myself a grad student in the field of literature and I simply couldn't follow the presumably basic mathematical demonstrations Einstein relies upon to make his points. Some concepts are also less than obvious for the non-specialist ('galilean coordinates'?). This is not to say that the book itself is not good, but that it is targeted at a readership which is not necessarily trained enough to benefit from it."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Long on my list of must-reads, I finally got this for myself. After hearing a lifetime of comments and reviews about these theories, it is a good thing to go straight to the source.

It is also enjoyable to try to decipher Einstein's personality a bit by reading between the lines."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Though the book maybe was not a linguistically correct, the theory is.

As an example, please pay attention to his demonstration of relativity of simultaneity. He mixed up [seeing by the observer] with [occurrence at the origin]. Therefore Einstein had no right to say that the two events did not occur simultaneously when the observer did not [see] them simultaneously. Let us say, we saw an explosion(A) of a star in 1998, and it was recorded that there was another explosion (B) many years ealier. An observer on earth could only say that he saw B earlier and A later; he could not say B exploded earlier and A later; nor could he say B and A did not explode simultaneously. Einstein's demonstration of his relativity of simultaneity was therefore neither convincing nor fundimentally sound. Einstein's language problem could also be seen in his free switch between the words [clock] and [time]. A clock may and can slow down, but can time slow down? Unless we get this language problem cleared up I believe Einstein's theory will remain controversial."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"His friend Bertrand Russell was too!"},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"This objection comes, not from challenging any of Einstein's assumptions, but rather, from the history of mathematics, which has undergone a renaissance during the past twenty years.Among the most interesting studies are those which have examined the history of Cantorian set theory and the response to it. The response is what is relevant here.\\"Natural\\" mathematics developed in response to the supposed \\"paradoxes\\" of set theory. Regardless of whether those are paradoxes or not (see A. Garciadiego, BERTRAND RUSSELL AND THE ORIGINS OF THE SET-THEORETIC 'PARADOXES'), \\"natural\\" mathematics claimed that, in response, a new doctrine had to be developed. The new doctrine (best explained in P. Maddy, NATURALISM IN MATHEMATICS) said that mathematics inherently generated paradoxes, which could only be avoided or solved by the insertion into arguments the idea that mathematics is inherent in human beings, even though the idea does not play any internally consistent role in the arguments into which it is inserted.Poincare was an ardent advocate of \\"natural\\" mathematics (along with Hilbert and Russell) and he set it out in SCIENCE AND HYPOTHESIS. Einstein was an ardent advocate of this position, based on his reading of the Poincare book (see Stachel and Howard, EINSTEIN THE FORMATIVE YEARS).Since it does not play an internally consistent role in any argument in which it is inserted, if \\"natural\\" mathematics is found in relativity, it will constitute a contradiction in the argument.Here is the \\"train\\" experiment as given by Einstein in RELATIVITY:Are two events (e.g. the two strokes of lightning A and B) which are simultaneous with reference to the railway embankment also simultaneous relatively to the train? We shall show directly that the answer must be in the negative. When we say that the lightning strokes A and B are simultaneous with respect to be embankment, we mean: the rays of light emitted at the places A and B, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the mid-point M of the length AB of the embankment. But the events A and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. Let M1 be the mid-point of the distance AB on the traveling train. Just when the flashes (as judged from the embankment) of lightning occur, this point M1 naturally coincides with the point M but it moves...with the velocity...of the train.The objection is \\"naturally coincides\\" (fallt zwar...zusammen). This is a pure expression of \\"natural\\" mathematics. Poincare said that \\"the mind has a direct intuition of this power [\\"proof by recurrence\\" or \\"mathematical induction\\"], and experiment can only be for [the mind] an opportunity of using it, and thereby of becoming conscious of it.\\" In geometry \\"we are brought to [the concept of space] solely by studying the laws by which...[muscular] sensations succeed one another.\\" \\"Natural\\" coincidence \\"allows\\" one point to \\"succeed\\" another, in conformity with the demands of \\"natural\\" mathematics.Einstein never justifies the term. Neither can it be dispensed with. If it is eliminated, the geometrical contradiction emerges automatically. If two Cartesian parallel coordinate systems coincide at one point, they coincide at all points and are one such system. This contradicts the assumption of two such systems.This is the objection--from WITHIN the relativity of simultaneity and NOT by challenging or changing any of Einstein's assumptions--which brings relativity to an end. This is because we cannot get to special or general relativity or QED if there is a flaw in the relativity of simultaneity.This is not the first occasion on which Einstein incorporated \\"natural\\" mathematics in his arguments, and in which \\"natural\\" mathematics caused problems for the argument. He used it in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. As S. Sarkar of the University of Texas says in the Stachel and Howard book: \\"Einstein begins with an assumption whose status is still problematic and troubled his contemporaries: that there exists \`a time interval , which shall be very small compared with observable time intervals but still so large that all motions performed by a particle during two consecutive time intervals may be considered as mutually independent events....This is essentially a very strong Markov postulate. Einstein makes no attempt to justify it....[W]here mathematics ends and physics begins is far from clear....\\"It is, I think, sobering to realize that this objection existed for 100 years without ever being noticed--sobering because it shows how pervasive a prejudice can be. It is doubly interesting that even critics of relativity shared the prejudice--they too bought into \\"natural\\" mathematics. But I didn't.That's the end of relativity. Where to next:1. \\"Natural\\" mathematics provided very facile arguments. It was immediately taken up in all the disciplines. It was used by Godel, Sraffa, Kimura--everywhere. Where do the flaws appear in arguments in other disciplines?2. It is likely that \\"natural\\" mathematics was only given its name in the twentieth century, when there was an intense interest in paradoxes. However, supposed \\"paradoxes,\\" such as Zeno's, have been around for a long time. It is likely that \\"natural\\" mathematics is the immemorial effort to \\"avoid\\" or \\"solve\\" these paradoxes. For example, where does Darwin use \\"natural\\" mathematics?3. The status of the Pythagorean theorem is in question again. Under general relativity it is invalid. However, \\"natural\\" coincidence does not permit us to reach general relativity. So the question arises once again: is the Pythagorean theorem internally consistent? If not, why not?So research goes beyond and before relativity. But relativity itself is over.The discussion in this post was first published as follows:Ryskamp, John Henry, \\"Paradox, Natural Mathematics and Twentieth-Century Ideas\\" (April 14, 2006).[...]"},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"The book was in perfect condition when it arrived.

Both topics can be quite esoteric, and the mathematical explanation for the relativistic deformation of the time-space due to speed uses Fourier's transforms, so most people will have to just have faith in what Einstein is trying to explain. However, he does simplify the subject enough, so anyone with a basis of physics could grasp some of the most important ideas behind his theory.Furthermore, this book is important in the fact that by proving that relativity was a real fact in physics, the shape of the world in the twentieth century took a great change.

More often than not, I get completely lost before the end of the sentence. Another problem is the fact that the language is somewhat flowery. (**Imagine for a second, trying to understand the topic of relativity with the indirect, flowery language that Shakespeare used---this book is not that poetic, but it's just as indirect. Physics, in general is simply not the place to be indirect, especially when attempting to explain a complicated subject in a way that's comprehensible.) He doesn't seem to make even remotely simple statements. Instead, the meanings of the sentences are watered down, and because of their excessive length (*I read a single sentence that was 6 lines in length), I get lost.

Einstein might be the greatest scientist of the 20th century, but he is not the greatest writer.Forgive me, Einstein, but your book is boring. I had to force myself to finish reading it. It does not begin to convey the excitement and strangeness of the discovery. It only gives a few brief examples of thought experiments illustrating the point of relativity. Also, beware that this is a translation of Einstein's German. The translation could stand to be updated into less cumbersome prose.In his wonderful biography, Isaacson writes, \\"To make sure that the average person would fathom [his book Relativity], he read every page out loud to Elsa's daughter Margot, pausing frequently to ask whether she indeed got it. \`Yes, Albert,' she invariably replied, even though (as she confided to others) she found the whole thing totally baffling.\\" (p. 232)The book's main selling point is reading about the thought experiments from the horse's mouth --- the train thought experiment illustrating the impossibility of simultaneity (Ch 9), the chest in space thought experiment demonstrating the equivalence between gravity and acceleration (Ch 10), and the disc thought experiment illustrating that accelerated motion takes place in a non-Euclidean warped space (Ch 23). He also says he is trying to write about the concepts \\"in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated,\\" so there is some value in that.There are a couple really good quotes:\\"...we entirely shun the vague word \`space,' of which, we must honestly acknowledge, we cannot form the slightest conception....\\" - Einstein p. 9\\"Every reference body (co-ordinate system) has its own particular time; unless we are told the reference-body to which the statement of time refers, there is no meaning in a statement of the time of an event.\\" - Einstein p. 26If you want to see how Einstein explained relativity, then read this book. But if you want to understand relativity, look elsewhere.For the layperson interested in a good non-mathematical introduction to relativity, I recommendRelativity Simply Explainedby Martin Gardner. Chapters 2 and 3 ofThe Elegant Universeby Brian Greene also present a brief, lucid explanation; and Chapters 2 and 3 ofThe Fabric of the Cosmosgo more in-depth into general relativity and the spacetime. For more historical information as well as a lucid explanation, I recommend Chapter 6 (Special) and Chapter 9 (General) of Isaacson'sEinstein.If you want to read Einstein's book on relativity, you might as well buyA Stubbornly Persistent Illusion: The Essential Scientific Works of Albert Einstein, which includes the entire text of Relativity in addition to numerous other books and original papers.Enjoy studying this fascinating subject!cheers:)"},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"I had some difficulty understanding this book but finished it in awe of the man.

(This exact edition is also available in paperback.) Definitely get this one (or another 15th edition) because it is the 1952, fifteenth edition, which is the last one that Einstein prepared and is the one that contains all five of his appendices. My local bookstore has several editions put out by different publishers. Side by side were two, one was a 1916, third edition, that contained only three appendices and the other was the complete 1952, fifteenth edition, which actually cost a dollar LESS than the incomplete version. The 1916 version is in public domain, so the publisher does not have to pay anything to the Einstein estate. Thus, the publisher makes more money from purchasers who are not savvy enough to realize that they are getting an inferior edition for the same or even a higher price than a complete one. Caveat emptor.The four stars do not in any way refer to my view of Einstein or his work. Were they the basis of the review I would have given it five stars. I am qualifying my recommendation because I believe that only some readers will find the book to be suitable for their needs. Thus, I am giving it only four stars because this book is too elementary for someone studying relativity in a graduate course but too complex for someone with little or no physics background. Thus, the readership is somewhat limited.Pros:1) This book is Einstein's classic presentation of his special and general theories of relativity, prepared for a general audience. As such, it has interesting historical value as well as being illuminating for some readers. The fifteenth edition contains all of Einstein's corrections and all of his appendices.2) A reasonably good presentation of the special theory.3) Good for someone with a physics background (engineers, physicists at the BS or MS level, chemists, etc.) It is, however, too elementary for someone studying relativity at a graduate level. For them, it is primarily useful as a historical document. They would probably get more from Einstein's papers than from this book, which was written for the general public.Cons:1) The bulk of this book was written in 1916, in German, and then translated into English. As such, it is somewhat convoluted in places and generally has the typical flavor of 19th century prose.2) I feel that while the special theory is presented in a reasonably straightforward manner the general theory is not. Einstein uses a little math here, but it is insufficient for a physicist and is probably incomprehensible for someone with little or no math or physics background. I believe that Martin Gardner's book \\"Relativity Simply Explained\\" is a better choice for someone with little or no science background. It does a very much better job of explaining the general theory for a general audience.3) While Einstein explains how the basic assumptions of his theories differ from those of classical physics, these differences are not, in my opinion, highlighted sufficiently. I recommend Isaacson's recent biography of Einstein for those who want these differences more clearly delineated. Isaacson clearly shows why Einstein's theories were so radical a departure from those of Newton.All in all, this is a good book for the right audience."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"There is no doubt that Albert Einstein has been one of the most brilliant minds of the past century. His major contribution to science was the special and the general theory of relativity, which gave a new dimension to that we call today \\"Modern Physics\\". Many people feel frustrated because when they try to understand relativity, they find some authors that expound in their books a complex arrangement of equations referring to the mathematical part of the theory, namely, the books are accessible for people with certain levels of knowledge (that is the case of engineers, physicists, mathematicians, among others). Nevertheless, perceiving and anticipating this situation, Albert Einstein wrote this book (more than fifty years ago) whit the purpose of exposing the special and the general theory of relativity in such a way that anyone can understand it. I this sense, I think, Einstein succeeded because despite the shortness of the book, the same covers the most important aspects of relativity in a clear and concise form. Moreover, the book has appendixes where the author makes reference to some interesting subjects like the problem of space and relativity, the experimental confirmation of the theory, to name a few. If you have decided to learn something about relativity, and you do not have vast knowledge in physics and mathematics, I sincerely recommend you this book. On the other hand, if you were a reader looking for more technical information (mathematical foundation of general relativity), I would choose the book \\"Gravitation\\" written by Misner, Wheeler y Thorne. This text represents an encyclopedia about general relativity."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"This is the introduction to relativity written by Einstein. It is NOT the book which contains the original works, which is a very difficult book (just think that Planck had to ask for several clarifications before he understood Einstein's breakthrough paper). Here the great scientist set to himself the goal of explaining to the educated, but not specialized, man.Einstein was, of course, very deep. When he talked about any topic in physics, chances are that he went deeper than anyone else who thought about the same theme, for a comparable time span. Now, imagine relativity. When he wrote this book he had thought about this matter for several decades. Nobody reached this depth, then and afterwards. The fruits of his thought, like black-holes, are being proved true now, after so much time!So, the difference between this book and all other introductory books on relativity is proportional to the difference between Einstein himself and the other authors. You don't have to believe me: just read the excerpts! You'll not remain indifferent to the majesty of his ideas. Put yourself in the right mood: Einstein was a very simple man who was, in writing this book, sincerely interested in explaining his creation to you. Follow his path, read attentively, and, above all, think!The reward will be great."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Before buying have read reviews.

Maybe fair enough. It was written when Einstein had achieved youthful fame, though, not in his dotage, if he had such a thing. It may be a little more difficult for the translation, but not much. Contrary to some reviewers, it is not that easy to follow, and if it seems like an easy read, you probably haven't understood it. There are many books written since where it is probably easier to learn about special relativity, to say nothing of the basic ideas of general relativity. But once you have started to get the hang of things, this book is a masterpiece of exposition! It allows one to follow Einstein's actual thought process in arriving at these theories -- pretty much by a process of pure thought -- more or less in the steps he probably took himself. There is not a word in the exposition that was not carefully thought out. So, learn the theory somewhere else and then read this book -- you'll understand the theory better for reading Einstein's book -- or read this book first, keep going back to it 'til it starts to make sense, and maybe consult some other, more &quot;user-friendly&quot; textbook at the same time. Einstein claims his book allows a lay reader with only high school math to understand relativity. To which a friend of mine replied &quot;Yeah, if you have an IQ of 800&quot;.

I haven't encountered another one as good as this.Contrary to widespread misconception, Albert Einstein was not an exceptionally expert mathematician. His justly deserved fame rests on the fact that he had an incredible intuition for physics, and a willingness to think the unthinkable whenever that seemed to be where the physics led. So it's not surprising that he could explain both the concepts of special relativity and those of general relativity in clear, simple language suitable for the non-technical reader. The result is a masterpiece, especially the discussion of general relativity.The mathematics of general relativity in its applications is esoteric, to say the least; any reader who wishes to glimpse this can take a look at Robert M. Wald's book &quot;General Relativity.&quot; But the underlying ideas are very simple, simple enough to be easily grasped by any 11th or 12th grade student in an &quot;academic&quot; curriculum. The problem with them is that for most people the ideas are counterintuitive. The other books for laypeople that I've looked at go through all sorts of contortions to make the ideas plausible. Einstein doesn't. He proceeds steadily, simply and logically to show how special relativity follows from direct observation. Then he points out that special relativity is only useful in certain exceptional cases, and asks himself (and us) what properties a more general physical theory must have to be consistent both with observation and with special relativity. General relativity just lands in our laps as a result of this simple train of thought.I treasure this book."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Do not buy the copy of this book with ISBN 978-1452841212 !!!

The other copies are ok from what I have seen on the preview pages."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"This is a superb introduction to Special Relativity, which this writer, who is certainly no genius, was able to work through at age 18 (not without effort). The material on General Relativity (GR) is no harder, but much less detailed, so that one cannot hope to get a realistic idea of what GR is really about from this book alone. In fact, one needs considerable preparation in Physics and Math to even begin to understand the nature of GR.Unfortunately, the quality of American education has deteriorated enormously over the past three decades, so that even the typical senior Physics major at all but a dozen or so American universities can no longer be expected to cope with this book. This book is a serious introduction and not meant for the present American high school graduate with A's in English but typically eighth-grade reading skills, and whose Math skills consist only of a few faint memories. Nor does the American university, which has responded to the lowering of standards in the high schools by continually lowering its own standards, prepare the student for books like this. Customers who whine that this book shows that Einstein couldn't write English betray not only their own very low reading level and poor preparation (the book requires nothing more than non-AP high-school Math and Physics), but also their foolishness in believing that Einstein, rather than a native speaker of English, prepared the translation into English.For the dedicated reader, for whom learning is a mission, and who has learned his high school Math and Physics, this is an excellent book. It gives the dedicated and prepared reader the chance to interact with one of the greatest minds of all time. Einstein himself believed that any high-school student would be able to read this book with understanding, a belief was shown to be wrong even in 1917. (A reporter in Berlin asked Einstein's niece, then a high-school student if she had read and understood the book. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; she replied happily, &quot;everything but the part about coordinate systems!&quot;)That this book has endured so long (more than eight decades) in popularity is a testament to the genius of its author and his ability to explain Physics clearly.

But make no mistake--this book is not easy.The concepts behind relativity are difficult to understand and require some patience on the part of the reader. At times, this difficulty is exasperated by Einstein's desire to keep his explanations succinct.I would start with Einstein's &quot;The Evolution of Physics&quot; in order to get a feeling for the general concepts behind relativity and behind physics in general before attacking this excellent but challenging book.That having been said, I LOVED every minute I spent reading this book and happily recommend it to anyone interested in twisting their brain around some wild problems with wilder solutions."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"While reading the reviews I noticed something. The special case was considered well written, while the general theory was considered difficult to follow. There is a simple explanation to this, Leopold Infeld (protege of Einstein's) helped in the rewriting of the Special Case, his English was much more fluent than that of Einstein. Infeld was also a superb teacher, as such he had a fluency and a rhythm with words that is easy to follow. I highly recommend any of Einstein's writings but also caution you as to his readability... On the other hand Einstein recognized this and coauthored with Infeld, (or rewrote with him previous writings), as such I highly recommend that you get those books coauthored or written by Leopold Infeld."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Great for the young student of Physics!This is an excellent book, written in the \\"Master's\\" own style and faithfully translated from the German by Robert Lawson. The translation dates to 1920 and new readers may find the English a little quaint, but for all that, it is a great effort at presenting in \\"plain speak\\", the concepts of Relativity.The book starts with a lucid explanation of the Train and Platform example of Galelian Relativity and then proceeds to highlight the incompatibility between the principle of relativity and the constancy of the speed of light. Without encumbering the reader with the Maths (found in the appendices) the ideas of time dilation and length contraction are discussed. The General Theory is developed via a fine example: that of an observer on a rotating disk.This is a good complement to the overtly scientific/mathmatical books on the subject. Unfortunately,, despite its many qualities, just like many of the alternatives of this genre, Einstein's book does not fully succeed in explaining the complex concepts to the lay reader.

There might have been a plain English explanation that is slightly more crisp, however, would you not want to read it from the master himself?

The section on general relativity is rather brief, and gives you the sense that it is just a flavor, not the full story. Yet it gives you enough to be very interested. The English translation from German could be better, but it really does not make it inexplicable.

This book was written in 1916, in German and then translated into English. The book being reviewed here uses a 1920 edition, but it is far from being the newest one that Einstein wrote. The newest, the 15th edition, was written in 1952, and it is the most complete, as it contains several appendices that are not in earlier editions, as well as some corrections of errors that appeared in earlier editions. I have read both the 15th edition and this one, and if you want the best version of Einstein's text I would definitely get the 15th edition, as opposed to the one being reviewed here. However, the edition being reviewed here has been augmented with new material, and I think that this makes it a better choice than the 15th edition.This book contains an interesting introduction by Roger Penrose, which provides some insights concerning Relativity Theory and the cosmological advances that have grown out of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. The book contains lengthy commentaries by Robert Geroch that clarify many of Einstein's chapters. Finally, there is an essay by David Cassidy on the \\"Cultural Legacy of Relativity Theory\\". In my opinion these additions more than make up for the appendices that are provided in the more complete 15th edition of Einstein's book.I liked this book and recommend it over the 15th edition, but I cannot give it 5 stars. I found Einstein's prose to be typical of 19th century scientific prose, that is to say somewhat tedious and less than clear. This is especially true of the latter half of the book, which is devoted to the General Theory. To make matters worse, it was originally written in German and may have lost some clarity in the translation. There is a final chapter on cosmology that because of the rapid advances in this field make this section largely only of historical interest.I recommend this book if you really want to read Einstein, albeit in translation, but there are better choices if you want an introduction to Relativity Theory. If you want a better introductory treatment of Relativity, I highly recommend Martin Gardners \\"Relativity Simply Explained\\" and if you want an introductory treatment with a little more scientific detail (but still without any math) I recommend Richard Wolfson's \\"Simply Einstein - Relativity Demystified\\"."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"This edition of Einstein's wonderful book was, according to the publisher, \\"...recreated from the original using Optical Character Recognition software to keep the cost of the book as low as possible.

The vitally important (1956) fifth appendix is missing, as is the earlier 4th appendix. The reason for this is obvious. Penguin have merely re-published that part of the real thing which is now already more than 70 years old, and, therefore, out of copyright.Even the quality of the employed paper is at, or below, newspaper standard.

While the reader does need a good collage level math background to get the most out of this book, the book does not focus on the math. The book has three parts:1) In the first section using logical arguments Einstein takes the reader from Newtonian mechanics to Special Relativity.2) In the second section Einstein takes the reader to the next step: General Relativity. I don't think this section went into enough dept.3)The last section explores the greater impact of Relativity on our understanding of the universe.4) There are a set of appendices that provide interesting details.In my opinion this book is great start for someone who wants to get a basic understanding of Relativity. However the material is not at all complete or rigorous. Therefore anyone with serious interest in this topic should first read this, then proceed to more in-depth material. Many advanced texts are available however the reader must first obtain the proper math background.On the whole this is a great book.

I explained the theory in layman's terms. I highly recommend it for students and adults alike."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"I am far from being an expert in physics (philosophy is my field) but I have a layman's interest in developments in modern science and have done a little light reading on relativity on my own. I still found this book to be quite accessible as long as you are not afraid of a few algebraic equations. The section on general relativity is a little challenging in places but I actually thought Einstein's discussion of Gaussian coordinates (to take one example) was clearer than other presentations I have tried to read.What I truly appreciated about this book was the logical order of Einstein's presentation. Einstein begins by laying out two principles: a restricted principle of relativity and the law of the propagation of light in vacuo and then shows how the two principles seem to contradict each other. Rather than discarding either principle, however, Einstein explains that we need to rethink our conceptions of time and space in a way that makes them compatible. Einstein then goes on to explain precisely how our notions of time and space need to be modified according to the special theory of relativity (basically space and time measurements will not be equal for bodies of reference moving relatively to each other but will be related through the Lorenz transformations).Einstein then goes onto explain why the special theory of relativity needs to be replaced with a general theory which will take into account reference bodies that are accelerating in relation to each other. He explains how acceleration can be considered equivalent to being at rest in a gravitational field, and why the general theory cannot be based on a Euclidean continuum, as well as how to conceive a Non-Euclidean continuum using Gaussian coordinates all in a very logical manner. In other words, Einstein does not simply explain the theory but he explains why the theory needs to be formulated (why previous theories are inadequate) and why the theory needs to be formulated in the form it is actually formulated in.The book is terse so you probably should not begin with this book if you have not read anything else on relativity theory. If you are looking for a good first book I would recommendInside Relativityby Delo Mook and Thomas Vargish.ADDENDUM: I noticed when browsing through reviews today that certain editions of this book have received negative reviews from a lot of customers. Unfortunately, amazon continues to lump all the editions together on a single page. The edition I read, and reviewed, was the edition published by Broadway (with the black and white horizontal stripes on the lower half). I definitely recommend anyone interested in the book pick up the Broadway edition. The print is clear, the equations are clear, and it is very reasonably priced."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Professor Einstein wrote this book for the general audience who had an education \\"comparable to that of a university matriculation examination\\", as he felt there was a great need of introducing the idea to the public; however, the original papers were too technical. He did warn that reading the book would require the reader to exert some effort, and I certainly did. However, I derived some solace from the fact that out of all the books on relativity in the (university) library, this book is one of the few that is comprehensible to me!He first sets out conventional thinking of the day on relative motion and invites us to consider the \\"truth\\" carefully. He reviewed the concept of reference frame (i.e. coordinate system) and the use of Euclidean geometry to describe relative motion, including the 'intuitive' addition of velocity. Then he reveals that this line of thought is problematic.At this point it is worth digressing into the means which he presents the theory of relativity. His presentation is elegant - not in the linguistic sense, but in the structure of his argument. Normally, one can start with a set of empirical data and try to work out a pattern, from there on, a theory. One can also formulate questions, let imagination and reasoning suggest a hypothesis, then find experimental data to test the hypothesis.Einstein did it another way still, at least in this book. His general pattern is to explore some thought experiments and to see their implications. From there, he formulates the postulates and work out a coherent theory from the postulates. Experiments only come much later in his style of presentation. In particular, he postulates that (i) the speed of light is constant for all observers and (ii) physical laws are the same for observers in all reference frames. He then conducts a thought experiment, the now-famous train/lightning experiment. The two lightning bolts appear to reach the stationary observer \\"at the same time\\", but not so for the observer on the train - the notion of \\"simultaneity\\" is in doubt.He gives credit to Lorentz - for his work of Lorentz Transformation - and incorporates it into his Special Theory of Relativity. Relative motion is no longer a simple additive relation but a more complicated one - though still manageable.Only then he mentions the Michelson-Morley experiment but in a way that makes it appear to be peripheral to the development of his theory. He also introduces Minkowski's (his teacher) spacetime quite late, in spite of the fact that the idea is central to Special Theory of Relativity from a physics and mathematics point of view. To put it simply, it is the Pythagorean Theorem with an additional dimension of time (albeit with a form much more complicated than the 3D theorem).He introduces the General Theory of Relativity by highlighting that the conditions which the Special Theory is valid - i.e. constant velocities - severely restrict its descriptive power. Mathematically, Euclidean geometry does not work when a given region of space is not \\"equally dense,\\" as in the case above. He introduces Gaussian Coordinates, which is the generalization of geometrical continua, with Euclidean geometry being a special case.Special Relativity and General Relativity are different because spacetime is \\"equally dense\\" (i.e. flat) in Special Relativity, since only constant velocity cases are considered; but this is not so in General Relativity. The Gaussian coordinate system is necessary to describe them. GR can then be formulated as \\"All Gaussian coordinate systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of the general laws of nature.\\" He concluded by considering the application of GR in cosmology, with such implications as perihelion of Mercury and unbounded yet finite universe.By this point (that is, if you had patiently read this far), you might question my addition of the precis of the book here. \\"Couldn't I just google it?\\" But chances are that introductions to Special and General Relativity are similar elsewhere, and this is how Professor Einstein did it. If you had read Walter Issacson'sEinstein: His Life and Universeor Abraham Pais'sSubtle Is the Lord: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein(the latter is even more technical), this book should also demonstrate how Einstein thinks - idea first, mathematics second!True, the theories are not something simple to grasp; but I am doing economics yet enjoy reading it - not to mention I am able to get the idea! The style of English is admittedly a little archaic but that is a relatively (no pun intended) small impediment of appreciating this great work. I would recommend that you set apart some moments in a quiet surrounding so that you could concentrate on following his arguments - that's the best way of reading the book IMHO!"},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"The first edition of this book was published just after the original paper on the general theory of relativity. In the ensuing ninety years, no one has produced a better layman's introduction to the special and general theories.The alert reader will achieve not only a clear intuitive understanding of the important physics but will learn much about the awesome intellect that produced it.In the centenary of Einstein's annus mirabilis, a number of reprints of this classic have appeared, some adorned with introductions by such luminaries as Roger Penrose or with additional appendices added in later editions. I have a personal preference for the Dover version because it reproduces the type face of the orginal 1916 translation that was the first science text I read at age seven. And the cover phtograph alone is worth the price of the book.Enthusiastically recommended."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Albert Einstein is the eidos of the Smart Guy. I chose to read Robert W. Lawson's authorized translation of Einstein's popular exposition of the topic of Relativity because I didn't think I knew anything about it. Well, that isn't true. That was why I chose to buy it; I have a whole special collection of uncracked literature in my library relating to my personal ignorance. I chose to read it because of both the above stated reason and because it was small enough to tote with me on the train to and from work. I enjoyed it thoroughly.Although I got a big fat B in my undergraduate physics course, all I understood about Relativity was 1) it has something to do with Energy being equal to the product of Mass and the speed of light squared, and 2) there is something wrong with Newtonian mechanics when one is trying to explain the orbit of Mercury. Relativity turns out to be a good chunk more interesting than that. By spelling it out using simple examples like trains, Euclidian geometry and math no fancier than algebra, Einstein seemed to make a pretty good case for the over-simplicity of the good old laws of inertia and momentum. Sure, my clock is at rest with respect to me and will remain so until something moves it, but observed from a distant star, it is accelerating through four-dimensional space-time quite rapidly. Moreover, the perception of my clock (and time) from that remote reference point is influenced by the finite yet constant speed of light. That guy was really thinking.In summation, spending 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the evening with this book made me feel like I had the gist of Relativity. Now back to my stack of ignorance."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"No, Einstein's Relativity IS amazingly brilliant and eloquent, I assure you of this. My review, although, is a buyer beware scenario. I ordered this exact copy of the text and the one that arrived had all sorts of horrendous typos. One? Two? No, more like...a ton. In an example of this, the 'aether' where the character 'ae' is a single one, somehow in the process of printing it, the character got repaced by a space and question mark! So when Einstein talks about the 'process by which the? ther happens...' or some such example, I translate it as 'bad' and not 'aether'.By all means, buy Einstein's copy of Relativity, but please be cautious when ordering from this particular publisher. I'm unaware of whether or not this problem is widespread, but to those who get the one with the maddening typos riddled all over it, just bear through it and appreciate Einstein's eloquence and not the translator or publisher's, in my own personal opinion, bad spellchecking."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"This book, written by Albert Einstein, is about the concept that changed our approach to physics and to the universe.

That's what Einstein brilliantly helps you to do here."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"This is an update of the review below, posted anonymously June 20, 1999. People seem to have found it useful and I thought I would add what I consider to be important information about different editions of this book.Various editions of this book differ in an important respect. Some of them are more complete than others! The reason is that Einstein wrote the first edition over 80 years ago, and it is in the public domain; I believe later additions to the book are still under copyright, which is under the control of Einstein's heirs and whomever the heirs have given publishing rights. In the 2005 celebration of Einstein's \\"miracle year\\", lots of publishers cashed in, but not all of the editions, including some of the more expensive ones, have the complete deal.The very critical thing to look for in the various editions is the Appendices, in particular the piece \\"Relativity and the Problem of Space\\" which Einstein wrote near the end of his life. This is an extremely serious and profound meditation on the subject matter, whether written for a \\"popular\\" audience or not. Part of the essay is a brief discussion of something whose significance is still very actively debated, usually under the rubrics of \\"background independence\\" and \\"diffeomorphism invariance\\". You will not find these words in Einstein's essay, but these notions are at the heart of the sometimes bitter disagreements about various approaches to quantum gravity, e.g. loop quantum gravity (which takes an Einsteinian view) and string theory (which takes a view based on particle physics and quantum field theory). Einstein did not enter into these contemporary debates about quantum gravity, but his meditations in the essay in this book are very much at the source of the current controversies.A leading quantum gravity person of the Einsteinian-based persuasion told me several years ago that he had been a professional practitioner in relativity and quantum gravity for years before he really appreciated what Einstein was getting at here.Another person, of the string persuasion, told me that he was \\"deeply shaken\\" from reading a Scientific American critique of the string theory program by a person of the loop quantum gravity school, who stressed the lack of \\"background independence\\" in the string program.So, by all means, check the table of contents of different editions to make sure the appendices are all there, make sure the \\"Relativity and the Problem of Space\\" essay is there. You will find much to ponder and mystify you there, and much that can be related to contemporary debates at the frontiers of quantum theories of space and time!mastermind at work, June 20, 1999Reviewer: A readerThe reviewer of April 13 from Moscow, Idaho says this is not the book to read unless you already understand the theory. Maybe fair enough. It was written when Einstein had achieved youthful fame, though, not in his dotage, if he had such a thing. It may be a little more difficult for the translation, but not much. Contrary to some reviewers, it is not that easy to follow, and if it seems like an easy read, you probably haven't understood it. There are many books written since where it is probably easier to learn about special relativity, to say nothing of the basic ideas of general relativity. But once you have started to get the hang of things, this book is a masterpiece of exposition! It allows one to follow Einstein's actual thought process in arriving at these theories -- pretty much by a process of pure thought -- more or less in the steps he probably took himself. There is not a word in the exposition that was not carefully thought out. So, learn the theory somewhere else and then read this book -- you'll understand the theory better for reading Einstein's book -- or read this book first, keep going back to it 'til it starts to make sense, and maybe consult some other, more \\"user-friendly\\" textbook at the same time. Einstein claims his book allows a lay reader with only high school math to understand relativity. To which a friend of mine replied \\"Yeah, if you have an IQ of 800\\". To which I say, have patience, keep thinking about it and going back to it."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"In Relativity, Einstein trys to bring his theory of relativity to the masses. When the special and general theorys of relativity were concieved of by Einstein, they revolutionized our perception of space and time. This revolution was so complete that many of the most significant physicists of the time believed that it was nonsense. When Einstein won the Nobel prize for his work on the photoelectric effect, his certificate unequivocally stated that the award was NOT given for his theory of relativity. For much of his life, even Einstein was unwilling to accept some of the predictions of his own work such as black holes.This is all very good, interesting science and history which should be read and understood by everyone. The problem is, though, that Einstein was not a particularly good writer. Einstein is too brilliant for his own good and it shows through frequently in this attempt to stoop to our level. His explanations are usually hard to follow and unintuitive(and I study physics even!). This book exists on an uncomfortable middle ground between rigor and easy reading.If you would like to read this book simply because of its (and its author's) historical significance then I couldn't discourage that. If you know little physics and want to try to understand relativity, read Kip Thorne's Black Holes and Time Warps or the first few chapters of Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"I've used this book with my high school students - very slow going. You can definitely understand the issues involved in relativity, even as a layman, from reading this book, but THIS IS NOT AN EASY READ! A mature, dedicated reader will get through this book. I'm proud of my high school students for struggling through this book, but readers at that age mostly do not have the intensity to really appreciate it."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"This book is truly a scientific gem. Not only did the brilliant Einstein envision the theory of relativity, but he also felt compelled to inform non-scientists by writing this &quot;less&quot; technical explanation of his theory. The book's section on Special Relativity is not too difficult to grasp. However, having some basic understanding of algebra and classical mechanics is helpful. On the other hand, the section on General Relativity is quite profound, requiring the reader to imagine new concepts of space and time that are alien to one's sense of reality. Indeed, I had to read this section several times and I'm still not sure if I completely understand it. However, this is more of a function of my imagination skills rather than Einstein's literary abilities. For he uses an abundance of familiar terms and analogies to simplify the understanding of some of the more &quot;unusual&quot; implications of General Relativity. I would not recommend this book to someone averse to technical subjects. However, I do recommend it to those wishing to learn the basics of relativity theory."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Einstein's theory of relativity is still about the only advanced science theory that I am able to fully understand. His book is the Bible of Relativity, unfortunately like the Bible it is a bit difficult to understand because he is not very fluent in English and although correct he uses words which we modern English speaking people are not familiar with. He is so long and drawn out that one often loses concentration and forgets the start of a topic before getting to the end. This is why I took off one star. If I were to rate Einsteins genius as a ten, then Hawking and others would be a one!"},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"I own this book and have read it a few times and each time I am impressed by the clarity with which it is written. It explains the concepts of relativity in words only. It avoids (technical) calculations and formulas, not for the usual 'commercial' reasons, but because the author shows he can do without. And ask yourself: how many authors are capable of doing that?The strength of the book is its conciseness: the author forces you to think things through, before moving on to the next chapter. I think this little book is great to own next to a more advanced textbook because it really adds value, for a small price.Buy this book for its content only: it contains no fancy graphics or other 'eye catchers'. Because the author (obviously) knows what he is talking about, he was able to keep the book thin without making compromises. Again an achievement."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"This book is probably the best place to start in understanding the theory that revolutionized science. It is lucid enough for practically anyone to understand. I should know, I'm still in junior high school and I understand it. Einstein conveyed the nature of his own genius into a prose that clearly explained nearly all there is to know on the basis of modern physics. The Cosmological Supplement was, in my opinion, the most interesting part. Natural science is an amazing branch of knowledge and some even say that physics is defined as the only true science. I reccommend this book to all readers who are interested in Einstein's work and even those who don't have a clue. It is all just basic science."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Written by Einstein himself, this book gives excellent insight into special relativity.

When Einstein won the Nobel prize for his work on the photoelectric effect, his certificate unequivocally stated that the award was NOT given for his theory of relativity. For much of his life, even Einstein was unwilling to accept some of the predictions of his own work such as black holes.This is all very good, interesting science and history which should be read and understood by everyone. The problem is, though, that Einstein was not a particularly good writer. Einstein is too brilliant for his own good and it shows through frequently in this attempt to stoop to our level. His explanations are usually hard to follow and unintuitive(and I study physics even!). This book exists on an uncomfortable middle ground between rigor and easy reading.If you would like to read this book simply because of its (and its author's) historical significance then I couldn't discourage that. If you know little physics and want to try to understand relativity, read Kip Thorne's Black Holes and Time Warps or the first few chapters of Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"I have an old copy of this book with different publisher and would like to buy a new copy as a gift for my brother. When I got the book, I am so disappointed with its printing quality. The font sizes are different in different pages, and some of the lines in the letters are just not visible. Instead of giving my brother the new book, I would rather giving my copy even though I has already written all over it."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"I believe in reading primary source material. You can't get much closer to the source of the theory of relativity! My high school math and science classes did help me through this book.I like it because it's not my normal subject matter. Einstein helped me think out of the box in terms of how things in the world (and universe) relate. Even though I won't remember all (or any) of the equations, I'll definitely remember his wonderful word pictures."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Einstein himself wrote a 1918 paper which is not generally discussed, and which basically agreed that parts of the special theory were contradicted by the 'twin paradox'. The theory is pushed so hard in some quarters that any contrary thoughts are simply quashed. The special theory, especially the thought that their is no such thing as absolute space, is, in my view, simply wrong. Many have written on this subject, for instance the Australian, Builder, but they are ignored by establishment science, which is not science at all but rather politics, and dirty politics at that. That is not to say the Einstein was like that, but rather those who support his theory for political reasons."},{"Title":"Relativity: the Special and General Theory","review":"Maybe I'm a retard but I just don't get the whole Quantum Physics thing. Well this book is excellent. It describes it well. It is still not an easy topic but at least it's written in a way that the average person can begin to comprehend. I strongly recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Mask and the Sorceress: The House of the Pandragore","review":"I remember the 1st book being very good and thought it was going to be a long series of 3 or 4 books. It took me forever to get the 2nd volume and it appears it is also the final volume. If there are more somewhere please let me know. This book was ok but not as good as the 1st one. In places it seemed like he was in a hurry to get it over with! Overall the book was ok but not totally satisfying.

As a volunteer at a local equestrian center, I told the manager that it should be mandatory for every volunteer to read this book! Working as a mentor for wild horse adopters, my first suggestion is &quot;read Mark Rashid&quot;. It is an easy read, and enjoyable for all levels of horse enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This is an amazing book. I had read A Rashid book before - Horses Never Lie - and immediately went for the other two.The thing that interested me the most about this one is that the main idea was to tell the reader that horses are all good by nature no matter what shape, colour, or breed they are. We make them go bad by how we treat them. He tells stories from his experiences about horses that suffered from prejudice and how he could make them better horses by being everything other than pre-judgmental of them.We love horses but we are humans and as such we sometimes tend to form an idea about horses - as well other people - based on what they look like or where they come from. We all do that at some point of our lives even though we do not like it and even though it is against our beliefs, but we are humans after all. And many think that it is more \\"OK\\" to be pre-judgmental of horses than it is when it comes to other people. Well I do not agree and I hate prejudice in all its forms. And thus I say that I love the book because it really helps the reader get rid of all the pre-formed ideas about some types of horses. I finished the book and found myself amazed by every horse that I see no matter what colour, shape, or breed it was.I recommend it for all horse people and horse lovers."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read about training and working with horses. Mark Rashid shares stories from his childhood helping an old man with ranch work, and tells remarkable tales of how to become a passive leader rather than an alpha leader. He also includes stories and advice about buying horses, foaling, training, and many other interesting topics. I would definately say that this is a book that must be on your bookshelf! I've made reference to it several times, and having it handy to look up something is wonderful. I'd give this book 5 stars with no hesitation!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"I started reading this book and just could'nt put it down. It was both easy to read and funny too. I'm buying Mark Rashid's other books.After being around horses for over twenty years and finally owning my own, I can really say my relationship is going to get better and better, with my beautiful Standardbred mare, Princess.Moved to New Zealand, Jan this year."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This book is another excellent source of training insight, and every bit as good as Mark's other book - &quot;Considering the Horse&quot;. The writing style is so unique, and there is so much information and knowledge packed in these pages that it will become an important reference, as well as a very entertaining read for any serious horseman."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"I have read all three of the books Mark has written so far and find them very easy to read. After reading these books you wonder how such common sense horsemanship has been overlooked for so long! An absolute must for anyone into True Horsemanship.... good reading for any level."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This book is very interesting and will keep you attention. My favorite part is when Mark talks and tells about how good horses can be no matter what color or breed they are. This book will have an impact on you and horses. You will have a new way to look at them and understand them. If your on the search for a better way to work with horses then this book is defintly for you! I don't think you will be disapointed."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This is the second installment of Mark's ponderings and experiences. I didn't like it as much as Considering the Horse, but liked it enough to read it twice! Mark's perspective is refreshing, and defies a lot of typical horseman who use brutality and verbal abuse as training tools. To further your love of horses and horsemanship, read all three of this books."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This is one of those great books that can reach across all interest groups and walks of life. The way the author relates his personal stories to shed light on horse training really drew me in. But, not only do these stories relate to dealing with animals, they are like Easop's fables... there is a nugget of wisdom to be taken away and stored for you to use dealing with people and struggles in everyday life. He has great insight into behavior of those around him, not only the horses, but the wisdom of the old man. We could all learn something from this book and I'll definitely buy his other books. I had to doctor a sick calf just a few days ago, and I used some of the patience and techniques he uses on the horses, and I felt like the calf whisperer! Instead of it being a grueling chore in freezing weather, I really started to feel a sense of accomplishment that I was helping an animal."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"Mark Rashid is amazing. Can't say enough about his books, ideas and training methods. I've been a horse owner for over 25 years, yet Mark has a way of teaching that still leaves me saying \\"ahh-HA! I never thought about that!!!\\". Mark's inspiring books have kept me trying with a Mustang I purchased that everyone else gave up on. If it weren't for Mark, I don't know where my horse would be today. I've purchased this book three times and given away two copies to friends that are also horse owners. Read Mark's books - get inspired - get enthused - and build a better relationship with your horse through understanding the \\"try\\". Thanks Mark, for putting things in perspective."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This is simply a great book. As good or better than &quot;Considering the Horse&quot;. Heartfelt, compelling stories ... the ending was the best, in part because it is a true story. An absolute must read."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"After reading &quot;Considering The Horse&quot;, I thought it couldn't get much better, but it did. He has an insight that he shares with his readers and has managed to get it across to us without the usual 'how to book' boredom. Even if you never train a horse but just admire the animal, this is a great book to read. He and the old man in this book have shared a fortune of knowledge with us. Thanks again Mark."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"Mark Rashid has struck upon and presented a brilliant concept that, while not entirely unprecedented, has never been (I believe) better presented. He has made both himself and his techniques out to be far beyond what we have come to expect from horsemen. Coupling his great equine skill and understanding with an obviously skilful pen, Mark Rashid has produced a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"There are two things that make this book a surprising disappointment. One may not be a problem for everyone, though I find it annoying and unattractive, ie, the repetitive and slightly self-important harping on 'giving a breed a chance' and 'being gentle.' For some, that makes it a crossover, feel-good book with links to human relationships. For me, PW got it right with this line: \\"reiterates these two themes ad nauseam, illustrating them in long-winded and meandering anecdotes.\\"But the other problem is that it's very poorly written. Rashid, who probably has a thousand great stories, needed a good editor who could have cleaned up and sharpened his material."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"I would give this book to every friend I have! It is absolutely wonderful and teaches so many lessons. I would read it over and over if I had the time. Thank you so much!!!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"Magic! If you are a therapist (I am - CranioSacral Therapist) this guy actually lays down a few pointers for you in his approach to horses. His general approach is centred on the horse and the way to approach it is down to you and not the horse - excellent - so many therapists think that because they learned the skills the client is supposed to come to them - wrong!! Many clients are unaware of their motivations. So if you read all this guys books it will assist change in the way you look at and assist your clients for ever. Check it out - his method is one of calm and measured involvement with the horse. he is still asking the horse to reveal to him what the horse wants/is willing and prepared to do to reach his goal. His books are an evolvement of his approach and how he came to the realisations. I have seen much of what I believe as a therapist but have been unable or unmotivated to put into words appear on his pages. I believe it's been an honour to learn from a real human being. A word before anyone says anything - as a therapist I simply do not have an agenda the way this guy has to - our clients can work out their agenda themselves. Anyway a thoroughly good read and looks to me like his stuff is applicable across the board in real life. It would have been great if that was the way your parents treated you and if the Presidaent of the USA had some of these methods then that would be radically new and welcome if totally alien to the world of politics. PS. I have the same review on each of his books"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"Truely Mark Rashid is one of the best authors on horses that I have read. He writes so even the novice horse lover can understand what he is saying. He is a great inspiration to the Horse World!!!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"&quot;A Good Horse Is Never a Bad Color&quot; is like a manual put into story form. In my opinion this makes it entertaining, and you can retain the information easily. The methods Mark uses are not through force or fear but rather through a waythat allows the horses to respond positively with their own free will."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This book is a classic piece of work!&quot; It is not a step-by-step technical manual; there are plenty of them out there (both good and otherwise). This book is more an &quot;Equine Manual For The Heart.&quot; It is written in a low key manner, is full of common sense and is a very enjoyable read. Other equine books provide a technical description of &quot;How&quot; to do something - this book, by way of throughly enjoyable stories, provides the &quot;Emotional and Mental Perspective&quot; to use.&quot; I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"I bought this book in an attempt to gain some insight into my yearling colt's behavior. It worked! My communication with my colt has begun and I'm now looking forward to the lessons this beautiful little guy has to teach me. The book is very well written by a man who obviously cares deeply about all horses. His insight into horses' behavior and his communicative skills with them leave me in awe. My only regret is that the author did not go into a little more detail in certain areas. I have much to learn, but the book certainly gave me lots to think about. Good job, Mr. Rashid!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This bbook is a lot of fun to read. It really gives you some good insights into handling horses and what a good trainer does. If you have horses, want horses or just ike horses then I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This is a terrific book. All horse lovers should read it. I like the way the author tells stories pertaining to his life experience to get the points across."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This book is full of heart-warming stories as well as very useful training facts A MUST"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"I finished this book in two days, I could hardly put it down. Things in the book were easy to understand. Basically, its about an old man teaching a young boy the ins and outs of horses! I cried at the end of the book, and wished the old mans teachings would never end."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"Truly, Mark Rashid must be here on earth to be the voice of the horse. Never have I read a more eloquent, spellbinding pair of books as 'Considering the Horse' and 'A Good Horse is Never a Bad Color.' If you read them as training manuals, you will find them informative and thought-provoking. If you read them for entertainment, you'll find humor, drama, compassion, and common sense.Rashid doesn't offer a quick fix for horse training problems. Rather, he advocates considering the lesson from the horse's point of view, then using communication, patience, gentleness, and compassion to form a lasting partnership with the horse.I urge you to read these books, apply Rashid's principles to your training programs, and spread the word to as many other horsepeople as you can. We owe it to our horses."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"I bought this book not knowing what it was about. I had read Mark Rashid's two other books, and his name on this one was all I needed to make the purchase. I have already been educated and inspired from 'Considering the Horse' and 'Horses Never Lie' more than I have been from all other horse books put together. I knew 'A Good Horse Is Never a Bad Color' would be as good. I was not disappointed.Unlike the other two, though, this book covers a slightly different subject. While the others mainly discuss training attitude and problem solving, this one focuses on making good horses. It discusses practical issues such as choosing a good horse, imprinting newborns, early training, solving problems that might occur along the way, and even changing a bad horse into a good horse. Of course, Mark never tells you, \\"if you have a problem with that, do this to solve it.\\" Instead, he writes in story format, recalling his experiences as they happened. This charming style guarantees the book unputdownable. Even if you are not into horses, you could read this book as an autobiography.In the last chapter, Mark concludes that it was 'the old man' who had passed on this gift to him. He hopes that through this book, he had been able to pass on the gift to the reader. But really, to learn the gift and use it, you must read all his books. They complete each other and deliver his message to the world: a horse will give his all to the person who talks to him in a language he understands. This book costs only $[money], but I would've bought it even it the price was $500. If you have to read only one book in your life about horses, make it one of Mark Rashid's."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"I grew up around horses most of my life, but never really understood horses. As a child, I rode horses as a passenger, and did not really appreciate my horse. I am now older, and have a horse of my own. She is green as green can be, and I love her. I have decided not to continue my ignorance of these beautiful creatures, and read and learn all about them. I was bombarded with wonderful books and training techniques to assist my equine partner and myself, but no other book touched me like this one. It kept me turning pages, and I even stayed up til 6 am to finish reading it. Unfortunately, I had to be at work at 8:00. Uuuggghhh. Anyway, I enjoyed the stories, all the wonderful theories and techniques enveloped into a book that just grabs you. I could not recommend this book higher. I passed it on to my parents so they can also benefit from this perspective, and begin to appreciate their horses as well. By the way, It worked. They are now born-again horse lovers. Do not get me wrong, we all love horses, but you can love them for their beauty, strength, and the enjoyment you can have riding them, but that is not a true and complete understanding of horses. We now are working on our relationships with our horses. Wish us luck! Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"I have long been a fan of natural horsemanship, and have read John Lyons, Pat Parelli, Monty Roberts. I learned a lot from each, but always felt that something was missing. Enter Mark Rashid. Rather than profess that we should be alphas (harsh, dominating leaders), he argues for a passive leadership where respect is gained from consistency and kindness, and so true partnership becomes possible. This book is wonderful to read for pleasure (I devoured it in 2 days), and also has very practical insights into common problems. My relationship with my horses is already the better for it. So much for the other books on my shelf--I won't be referring back to them again!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"To get absolutely! If you love and live with horses, this is what you need! This book will make you understand the horse point of view and will broaden your horizons. At the same time, the author focuses on specific problems that we've all been confronted to, from catching an &quot;uncatchable&quot; horse to make a young horse go through the water and more. I don't want to reveal anything, just read it... Also, the author has great writing qualities, I didn't put this book down!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"Mark Rashid &quot;shows&quot; instead of &quot;tells&quot; us about the ways and means of better communication with horses. For years, stories have been used to convey information and social commentary. In this age and day of &quot;Self-Help Manuals&quot; and &quot;Do It This Way&quot; books, I found it extremely refreshing that I was allowed to enjoy my education into a wider range of &quot;horse talk&quot;. Mr. Rashid displays in his writing an unusual sense of humility and honor, and as a result I find that I value what he has to say all the more. I look forward to anything else he may decide to put into print."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"My 3 year old is a pleasure to ride and shows even better but on the ground he is down right nasty. I was about to give up when my trainer suggested a certain book, while online amazon brought my attention to this book. It certainly changed my view of my geldings behavior and with a different perspective on his behavior I gratefully stuck it out with him. He is not completly cured but he much more pleasant to be around (and a success at the shows). This book is written in such a way you want to keep reading, it is not written above your head."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"An absolutly great read. I've been a horseman for 27 years and have to say that I have never found a better,more common sense approach to horsemanship. We always have something new to learn when it comes to our horses and Mark give us a lot to think about. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves their horse."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"In an era of horse whisperers and natural horsemanship, Rashid quietly writes on about his life long experiences training & caring for horses. I appreciate the perspective Mr. Rashid writes from and being a true gentleman in the horse world only helps to reinforce the natural tendency to believe in his writing. He is one of the few trainers who doesn't take on an \\"in your face\\" style of writing. When I bought my first filly, I read this book while waiting for her to arrive from another state. Before she arrived and I finished this book, I was on Amazon buying up everything else he had published at the time! The lessons taught by Mark Rashid's stories transcend the horse world and send wonderful life messages. A true gentleman and scholar in the world of horsemanship who doesn't seem to put the capitalization of his knowledge first...It's a refreshing read!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"Mark shares his experiences with horses in a short story format. He explains different situations that he has encountered and how he approached them - not always succesfully, but what he learned and how he could handle them better in the future. He shares what he learned from &quot;the old man&quot; and how he has used the knowledge in his dealings with horses. Mark does clinics around the country where he shares more of his stories and his knowledge about working together with your horse to create a better partnership. Check out his website for clinic dates and comments from participants - look it up! Rumor has it he's working on a third book!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"You know how Dr. Phil is always teaching his life lessons? This book does the same, but in a different sense. I have always wondered why certain people and animals were brought into my life. This book gave me an answer to that question. I have never had a person readily available to teach me anything about horses, what I have learned has been self taught. Simply from observing and from trial and error. Mark Rashid, shares wisdom from those who have taught him and the way that he gets this across is extraordinary! If you are looking for step by step instruction, this most likely won't fit the bill. However, this book is a learning experience that is interesting to read for once! I can't see how someone could be disappointed. In addition, this book is suitable for anyone, no matter their age. Read it to your kids! They will love it too!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"In a very easy to read style Rashid takes the reader on a journey in horsemanship. It reads as easily as any novel, told from the point of view of 'the kid' under the guidance of 'the old man', but there are nuggets of pure gold here. A great book for either adults or children who want to learn more about horses and why they do the things they do -- and how you can get the best from them without force or cruelty."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This series of books has been most entertaining and highly educational. I find the skills applied by Mark Rasid can easily be used with people in principal as much as with horses. Easy to read, extremely understandable, and you feel good afterwards. I recommend this series to anyone wanting to get along better in life with other people or their animals."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to improve their relationship with the horses they own or work with. The book moves more like a story with the author telling how he learned about horses from an old cowboy. I found everything in this book to be very helpful. A must for the equestrian library!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"Thanks Mr. Rashid. It's one of the best horse training books I have ever had the privledge to read and I have read a number of horse books in my 60 years. Grandma, daughter and granddaughter have read it in the first 48 hours we have owned our copy.

Great story which holds a reader's interest!"},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"This is a interesting book, although most of the information has been written about in current books and articles. The author wrote this in the '90's and then it was new, he brings to light that we should remember to deal with horses as horses, they are prey animals and subject to flight if necessary. He gives us reminders to work slowly and take all the time necessary so that the horse can understand, we do not speak his language, therefore we have to communicate in a way that our horse will \\"get it\\".I found the book interesting, though a bit choppy and I didn't know if the chapter was when he was young or when he has his own business. I will definitely read his other books, this is a wonderful reminder to horse owners that it take time to have a good horse."},{"Title":"Good Horse is Never a Bad Color","review":"A Good Horse Is Never a Bad Color: Tales of Training through Communication and Trust (Second Edition, Revised and Updated)Now I look at my horse differently!

It was very refreshing to read about Rashid's successful training without physical abuse. I've been using many of his ideas to work with my donkey and have been so proud of the results. Thank you Mark Rashid!"},{"Title":"The Country Kitchen","review":"Mildly intrigued by the title of this book, I bought a used copy...a flea market in Lunenberg, Mass. this past fall. It turned out to be a real gem. Superbly well-written, it weaves together accounts of the author's family life in rural Michigan at the turn of the Twentieth Century with recipes of the food the family ate. The effect is very much along the lines of MFK Fisher's books about her life in France. But unlike Mrs. Fisher, Ms. Lutes is no self-conscious bohemian. Very much a woman of her time and place, she is nonetheless independent, intelligent, and very funny. That is, there is nothing genteel and Victorian about her, and nothing pretentious. She is modern, one of us. Who was Della T. Lutes? Hard to tell at this late date. My 1965 edition of &quot;The Reader's Encyclopedia&quot; has no entry on her. Amazon.com has only this title for sale. But she must have had a considerable following in her day. My copy of &quot;The Country Kitchen,&quot; printed in 1948, was apparently the 22nd printing of a book originally published in 1936. The flyleaf lists four other titles by her. I gave &quot;The Country Kitchen&quot; to my wife, a chef, for Christmas. She has yet to stop raving about it. More than a cook book, a culinary history or a social history, &quot;The Country Kitchen&quot; qualifies as capital-L Literature."},{"Title":"The Country Kitchen","review":"This is quite an extraordinary book: a combination of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and one of my grandmother's old cookbooks. It was pressed on me by a friend whose reading tastes I don't normally share. I started reading &quot;The Country Kitchen&quot; to be polite, and ended up reading straight through to the end. Even though I wasn't even born until well after this book had gone through twenty-three editions, it had the power to evoke memories of my own childhood--at least the stories my grandfather used to tell me about his life on the farm.Della Lutes was born in 1872 and lived on a farm near Jackson, Michigan until she was sixteen, when she left home to teach school. She eventually became the editor of &quot;American Motherhood,&quot; &quot;Today's Housewife,&quot; and in 1923 the &quot;Modern Priscilla&quot; magazine. When the publishing firm she worked for went bankrupt during the Great Depression, Della became a freelance writer and produced &quot;The Country Kitchen,&quot; which started out as a series of articles in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly.&quot; Her book was named &quot;The Most Original Book&quot; of 1936 by the American Booksellers Association and was described by Christopher Morley as a 'gastronomical autobiography.'I don't know whether I'll ever try the recipe for &quot;salt-risin' bread&quot; or buy a quarter of beef to be &quot;nicely ripened by hanging a couple of weeks or so in the woodshed,&quot; but I'll long remember the story of how Della's father entertained the Ladies' Church Aid Society by turning a baby skunk loose during their annual dinner. And then there's the story of Little Runt, who was fated to be the Thanksgiving pig, and Old Wart, the garden toad. Della's story wheels you through the complete cycle of seasons with all of the sights and smells of rural Michigan (you might not want to know what some folks used for home insulation, come late Autumn).This author deserves a place on your shelf right next to Laura Ingalls Wilder. She has saturated this book with the tastes and smells of a late nineteenth-century rural kitchen, bringing back recollections I never knew I had. Maybe it's got something to do with ancestral remembrance, since nearly all of our folks were rural up until the early decades of the last century.All I can urge you to do is read it and remember."},{"Title":"The Country Kitchen","review":"This is quite an extraordinary book: a combination of \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" and one of my grandmother's old cookbooks.

It became their favorite book. In 1985 I purchased this book for our 4 year old niece. When I got the book home my son and daughter sat on the couch &quot;searching&quot; for GOLDBUG. It was such a wonder picture to see the two of them, then 13 and 11 (repectfully), flipping the pages of this book and screaming &quot;there he is, I found him&quot;.

I purchased a couple other Richard Scarry books and \\"Cars and Trucks\\" has surfaced as the favorite, mainly because she loves searching for the gold bug in every scene. The other Richard Scarry books we own have the worm and bug hiding out here and there, but this is the only one that I've found, so far, that has the \\"where's gold bug\\" consistenly throughout. She loves it and I know that as she grows, she'll learn to love it for other reasons, including the kooky characters and funny storyline."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I got one of my favorite Children's books in good shape and it came quickly."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My 2-year old daughter *loves* this book, especially finding Goldbug. Although now she's done it so many times, she remembers where he is on each page, so even though it's still fun for her, it's lost a little of the mystery. Can anyone recommend any similar proto-'where's waldo'-type books for toddlers?"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My grandson loves the book.

We haven't even finished the book because we spend so much time looking at each page and talking about the cars!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son has this book. He wants to read it every night. All zillion pages of it. And we do.... on most nights until Mommy cant take another minute of finding goldbug, looking at pickle cars or worry about Penny Pig.But this book is, in the end, wonderful. It has a bunch of unique cars, a hidden bug to find on each page, and a silly story that follow throughout the book. You can just name cars, look for the bug, or read the story. I try to skip pages (it is kind of long), but get busted by my 3-year-old each time. But, it is the kind of book that you can skip pages with.The best part? It makes a great present for new parents. First of all, most of the dads had this book as a kid. So they take a walk down memory lane, with a smile of a three-year-old. But even better, I get a smug sense of satisfaction in knowing that someday, they too will have to look for gold-bug until they go running out of their house screaming \\"NO MORE GOLDBUG!!!\\". It is a rite of passage."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My 2 year old won't leave home without this book.

GREAT FOR THE LITTLE ONES!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I have three boys and all three of them chose this as a favorite! It was one of their first \\"real\\" books and they could sit and look at it forever. I had to replace my first one because it got so used by the first two. I really winner!!!! Highly recommended! Even I grew up looking at this book with my brother!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Picture book with lots of detail for little ones to discover on reading. There is a basic story line that links the pictures together, but the joy of this book is the wacky illustrations of all sorts of vehicles crammed onto each page. Many of them are fanciful, but they keep toddlers interested and engaged. I feel my kids are sometimes disappointed that vehicles in real life only have pictures and letters on them rather than looking like the contents!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Excellent book!! The best of Richard's so far!!Having to find the little golden bug on each page kept them going for hours! And somehow they never got tired of this book. After it was wripped to pieces from wear and tear I bought them another one."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"We bought this for my son, it by far is his favorite book. On every page 'Goldbug' is hiding, at 2 years old he could find him on every page, even his parents had trouble finding him. You won't be disappointed buying this one."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son will not go to sleep without reading this book now! He loves to look for Goldbug and although he doesn't talk much for a two year old, he says \\"Goldbug, Goldbug\\" over and over and \\"Got it!\\" He loves to look at all the different animals and says \\"uh-oh\\" on the pages where things are spilling or slipping. He loves this book so much that he brings it in the car and if it's not in the room, he searches the house for it. I love it too, because every time it's a different experience since there is so much detail. I'm ordering more Richard Scarry books now!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I like this book a lot. I am five years old and have had this book since I was three and I still read it often. Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Our copy of this title is now on the second child. My first loved it too but has moved on to other books.

I have been trying to get it in book stores and I said well I'll try Amazon and lo and behold Amazon had it and a great low price. Now my son can read this wonderful book to his son who turned 1 in June. So Grandpa is proud to give it to his son so the fun to find \\"Goldbug\\" will continue for another generation. Thanks, Jeffrey Doty."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son loves this book!!!! We actually ordered it to replace a borrowed copy that my son destroyed through over-use! If your child is crazy about trucks, busses, heavy equipment, tractors, planes or cars, then this book will entertain him/her for hours. I never imagined that one of the words my son would learn so early (about 13 months at the time) to say the word \\"ambulance\\" (there are three or four in the book). Really fun book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My almost 2 year old has worn out this book. He requests it every night. We can read it page by page or just flip around and look for different details. I've been able to use it to look colors, characters, and other details. I've even caught him \\"reading it\\" all by himself - well honestly, he isn't reading the letters, but he is definitely reading the pictures and focusing on each page."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My mother purchased this for my son at a garage sale for 50 cents. My 2 year old loves this book. He gives it to me and sits next to me in my chair every night. He and I go through it every night and he cries when we have to stop. He has memorized where goldbug is on every page. He has torn out about 1/4 of the pages and half the pages are drawn on, but he still loves it."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"We were given this book when my son was born; he has always enjoyed the colorful and imaginative pictures, and has been finding Goldbug on each page since he was about 18 months. However, his early love for this book pales in comparison to his obsession with it now -- it's the only book he wants to hear at story time, day after day ... Luckily for Mom and Dad, it's also whimsical enough that we enjoy it, too, day after day."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Over 20 years ago I bought the first copy of this for my oldest child. That copy is falling apart from use, and I'm buying the 2nd copy for my grandson this Christmas. He has so many words in his vocabulary for a 2-yr-old, and (as an educator) I give a lot of credit to Cars and Trucks and Things that Go! We read, he is delighted and entertained, and he learns new words every time! This is truly one of the best books ever!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book is a must have for children! My 4 year old son adores this book. The book is very original. Each page has so much to look at and talk about in addition to the main story line. Plus you have to find the goldbug hidden on each page!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"There is so much going on on each page that we can easily spend half an hour reading it cover to cover. It's great for helping teach him words for all \\"things that go.\\" When he wants us to read it to him, he will ask for \\"gold bugger\\" and point to the book shelf. He loves looking at all the pictures and finding gold bug on every page. A great book that we read together at least twice a day."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book is terrific. I purchased this one for my 4 year old grandson, whom I am told is into trucks, buses and literally any thing that moves...even bugs and worms. He reads all the time with his parents, so he just can't seem to get enough books. This book, I thought would be a good one to add to his collection. It is sturdy, colorful and not so busy...easy to understand (a quality item). Amazon has a great selection of any variety of books for anyone. Thank you!!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My girlfriend recommended this book for my two boys. What I didn't know is that on every page (two) Goldbug is found...somewhere.

Just a great book for kids.Grew up with his books and now that I'm a Dad, passing them on to my son.Great sale.COULDNT BE HAPPIER!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son has adored this book since he could sit up and look at the pictures. He is almost 2 now and will ask for it by name. The scenes unfold page after page, and you never know what the characters might encounter next! If you have a little one I ABSOLUTELY reccommend you own a Richard Scarry picture book. They are timeless, fun and creative. You can literally retell the book in a 1,000 different ways and engage your child by asking him about colors, objects, animals, shapes, etc. that are in the book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I bought this book after he visited a friend's house and the mom said he loved the book! While her daughter just said \\"car,\\" he was saying \\"excavator\\" and pointing out tractors. So I promptly bought the book, almost a month ago now, and hardly a day goes by that we don't read the book.Pros:- Lots of animals and vehicles and actions to look at.- Searching for Goldbug on each page is a more toddler-friendly version of Where's Waldo.- Big book that's light enough for a toddler to carry around.Cons:- Really the only one is that it is long and that reading the whole thing through in one sitting is an event. But setting limits like, only 5 pages or only reading until the halfway point help with this. So far, our son won't really let us skip pages because he's paying too much attention :)A great book overall!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son was thrilled to receive another Richard Scary book, it is now his new \\"go to\\" favorite book! Great book for a very inquesitive 4 old!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"\\"Busy, Busy Town\\", \\"What Do People Do All Day\\", and \\"Cars and Trucks and Things That Go\\" are pretty much a complete pre-K Library all by themselves. And \\"Cars and Trucks\\" should satisfy any kid who loves midgie cars.They are calm and gentle books. The characters are bright, energetic and cheerful. The stories are about activity, sharing, doing things, working and playing. The jokes are just right for little ones. There is no irony or condescension in the art or in the writing.You know how people would make fun of Mr. Rogers, but moms and dads came to appreciate his calm, gentle and supportive influence. Well, that's sort of the feeling you get from Scarry's work. No showboating; no post-modern take; no grim in-your-face shots. Just energy and gracefulness. Lowly Worm is a fun little guy. Huckle is a solid kid. Adults are responsible and trustworthy. Things are neat and cool and exciting and fun, and sometimes a little silly.Now, you probably don't really want a full time diet of Scarry, and edgy or zany or frantic can be fun in the mix too, but day in and day out and generation after generation, these books are solid. (And you know what? The Scarry VHS tapes and DVD's are as mellow as the books, and just seem to fascinate the kids.)"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"my children were toddlers in the early-mid 80's. this was one of their 'verymostfavorite' books and i have bought many copies as baby gifts for girls and boys since that time. finding goldbug was a nightly ritual (as was the book) and if i ever have grandchildren i'll be happy to read it another few hundred times. this is one of those books that should never go out of print (and should never be resized)."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My 3 1/2 yr old son LOVES this book.

My daughter was then about 2. Some of the pages were missing and scribbled, but we loved it none-the-less. Then our 14 month old son finished it off a couple months ago by tearing all the pages from the binding. I knew it was time to buy another as our boy (and girl) would still enjoy it. Sure enough, the two of them 3 1/2 and 16 months just LOVE it. It is one of the first books our little guy picks up by himself to \\"read\\". Each page holds illustrations that we never noticed the last 100 times we read it. It is a bit long to read for a bedtime story as mom and dad are ready to have \\"our time\\" but it is one of those books that both of my kids love to read and look at together.

We checked it out months later and he was 'reading' it the whole drive home. When I needed a boy baby shower gift it was the perfect choice. This book is jam packed with crazy cars and silly happenings, my son loves it. In fact, I ended up caving letting him keep the book and purchasing a second copy for the shower.

He's three now and has grown out of it a bit-graduated to more story oriented books, but this book got him really excited about books!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My grandson loves the pictures of the vehicles-he's really into cars, trains, trucks, etc. and looks at the book on a regular basis."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I remember loving Richard Scarry books as a kid...and my son is now loving them! We got him this book for Christmas and it has quickly become his favorite! There is so much going on on each page that we can easily spend half an hour reading it cover to cover. It's great for helping teach him words for all \\"things that go.\\" When he wants us to read it to him, he will ask for \\"gold bugger\\" and point to the book shelf. He loves looking at all the pictures and finding gold bug on every page. A great book that we read together at least twice a day. I definitely recommend this book for toddlers and big kids too!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"When I was a kid I loved this book. So much so that I went through three copies of it, wearing out each one with my constant page flipping, reading and pointing. I can't wait until I have a kid of my own so that I can give this book to them and watch them wear it out. I will buy them a new copy every time."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Gave this book to our almost 2-year old neighbor boy for Christmas, and he LOVES it. He wants to go over it with his parents several times a day and looks at it himself! Cars, trucks, tractors, wheels of all shapes and sizes. Great pics of vehicles with imagination and fun. Our own daughters, now grown, also loved this book. All the Richard Scarry books are great!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This (and all of Richard Scarry's Busytown books) is a big hit in our house with our preschooler. There are tons of details on every page to look at and talk about, and multiple activity threads throughout the entire book (follow the Pig family, follow Dingo Dog, find Goldbug). I think it was overwhelming when our child was younger, but around 2 1/2 I think the book became more interesting, and has remained a big favorite for years."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was a great book for my 2 year old grandson. He loves cars and books but especially enjoysthis book as did his Dad 30 years ago. He always says \\"That's funny\\"."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book instantly became my son's favorite. We bought it to complement Busy, Busy Town. He loves to look through it and we especially love to find Gold Bug! This will be my go-to book purchase for upcoming birthday parties. Great value for the money."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is a family favorite that both my husband and myself remember from our childhood. There are so many wonderful and whimsical illustrations in this book, I think it was almost 1.5 years and a full roll of scotch tape before we ever read the actual story from cover to cover. It has also sparked so much imagination... my son loves to play \\"Cars and Trucks and Things That Go' when we are in the car - pointing out different trucks and pretending that he sees aligator cars and bananamobiles. You can just imagine his delight when we actually saw the Oscar Meyer Wiener Mobile (see p.27 for the hot dog car)! I can't wait to share it with my younger son! Every child should have a copy!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"If your little boy (or girl) loves trucks and cars then this book is for you. This classic book has so many pictures of different trucks and cars, my 15 mos. son loves it. He is always pointing at something different every time we open the book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Our 2 year old son loves this book so much -- he sits for the longest time poring over it. It has really helped to increase his vocabulary, as well, by bringing to life so many of the things he is naturally fascinated by right now...he wants to know the name of every type of vehicle, etc. It's also good for increasing his attention-span as he searches every page intently for Goldbug. As an aside, it was also great fun for me to sit down with a book I remember from my childhood and find it unscathed by any re-editing. A great book all the way around!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I buy a LOT of books for my son because he loves to be read to and this book is absolutely one of his top 5 favorites!At 60+ pages it is long, but my (almost) 2-yr-old will sit on my lap for 30+ pages at a time, sometimes the entire book. I am just amazed at how much this book entertains him. There is so much going on with each page that even I continue to notice things I didn't previously.He loves looking for \\"Goldbug\\" on each page. Whenever we find \\"Goldbug\\" first we tell him to look for the purple car - so he has fun and also learns colors.As a mom, I love the illustrations and how it teaches my son about boats, airplanes, trains, construction equipment, snow, the farm, beach, etc.If anything were to happen to this book I would definitely go buy another one. As a result of my son enjoying this book so much we already have addded, and are going to continue to add, Richard Scarry books to his collection.Not that this will work for you, but my husband and I have discovered that when our son is overtired reading him this book settles him down everytime!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son received this book for his first birthday. In less than three years we have worn the book out from use. It is filled with informative, often imaginative pictures of all sorts of vehicles. My son loves racing Mom and Dad to see who can be the first to find Goldbug on each page. He wins almost every time, of course. This is a sure bet for any child who is into cars and trucks. At 70 pages, there is plenty to look at and never get bored."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I bought my three-year-old son this book because I loved Richard Scarry when I was growing up. What little boy doesn't love cars & trucks? He LOVES this book and we must read it nearly every night before bed. And there is so much to look at on every page that he likes to sit and look at the pictures after the reading is over. He loves all the silly kinds of cars and, of course, looking for Goldbug on every page. I highly recommend this book for your little car & truck lover!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son is now 30 and this was his favorite book when a toddler. I have it stowed somewhere, and the cover had to be taped several times. Now I am purchasing for my 2 yr. old grandson. I just KNOW he will love it."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son loves books. We've been reading to him since he was an infant and at 21 months. he even reads to himself. We love everything Richard Scarry, but especially This book.There's a small little yellow bug, called Goldbug, hidden on every set of left/right pages. My son loves to find them all. Now he looks for hidden thigns in all his children's books. What a fantastic idea!The characters are great. The trucks, busses, cars and motorcycles are exciting, and the action fun. This book is a good one to grow with. Once he can actually read, he'll enjoy it even more."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My almost 3 year old son is usually very active and does not sit still for more than 5 to 10 minutes.This book has such lively illustrations and a million and one things to look at that it managed to keep him occupied and sitting still in a bookstore for almost 40 minutes at a stretch that I could do my own browsing in peace! Best of all, he picked it out himself and ran his little finger all over the book \\"reading\\" to himself!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"We have about a 70 different childrens books in our house that have come from all different sources. Of those 70 books, my 2 year old son asks for &quot;tars and trucks and things at doe.&quot; He loves the pictures. Everytime we read it, he notices something new. He requests that I read this book every night before bedtime. When we drive around town now he identifies all the different vehicles. Great book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I've always loved Huckle and Lowly (and the pigs and rabbits and Miss Honey, etc.), but Goldbug deserves a Shirley Bassey theme song about him. My 3 year-old daughter is entranced looking for him every time we check this book out of the library. She goes as far as calling the green bugs \\"Green Goldbug.\\" I don't recall having this book when I was a child, but am so glad I found it as a parent, and will be buying it as soon as I think about it when near a bookstore."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"25 years ago my 9 month old daughter would crawl to the book shelf and pull this one out! After three kids (and two copies)I can't say enough good things about this book. I am now buying it for my every new Mom in my daughters crew. They are fascinated by the busy scenes and it is definitely a keeper! A good friend is an English teacher, I gave this to her toddler, she was amazed when it became his favorite book...I wasn't! Buy it!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I loved it and now my 2 1/2 year old son loves it too. We have a great time looking for Goldbug. The only negative thing I can say is that he wants to read it every night!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Our 18 month old is obsessed with this book. She calls it \\"bus book\\" and wakes up saying that phrase every morning. She has memorized where goldbug is on every page so that she can now point to him as soon as we turn the page. And she still gets so excited! I can see us using this book for many years. Now, we have three main ways of reading it. 1) find goldbug 2) point to a picture and ask her what it is - \\"mouse\\" or \\"bus\\" are examples of ones she can say 3) ask her where an item is and have her point to it - \\"where's the fire truck?\\". #1 and #3 work the best for an eighteen month old. she gets better at #2 every time we read it. not sure when she'll learn to say \\"excavator\\" :-)This book is a must for *all* toddlers!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Not exactly my own review, but the 4-year old, truck loving boy, I gave this book to gave it '5 stars'! According to his mother, he spent all evening looking at the book the day he got it. It is a very large and colorful book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My three year old Grandson makes for this book nearly every time he comes in the house and requests that my wife or I read it to him. Who can argue with such a critic? I ordered it from a Z-Shop and may have to look for another soon, as our copy is getting some very heavy wear. I haven't had a book get such heavy usage in my house since Catch 22 came out!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was my favorite book when I was a little kid. It is fun to read because on every page there is this little yellow creature that you can find on every page if you look for it. There is an Officer Flossy who rides a bike and chases a terrible driver in a sports car throughout the book while the Pig family goes on a picnic. The pictures are very interesting and neat to look at."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was my favorite book that was ever read to me growing up. Highly recommend for children ages 0-8. This book still gives me warm feeling when I am reminded of all the different characters. There are a ton of things to look at on every page."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"A friend of mine had this book when I was eight years old, and I would read it every time I went over to his house. It was the coolest book, and I haven't seen it in 13 years. I'd like to buy it for myself now, just so I'll have my own copy."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is a great book to read to toddlers who are just beginning to talk. When my son's chubby little fingers point to the illustrations he likes to shout out &quot;truck!&quot; or &quot;beep-beep,&quot; and we both celebrate with giggles."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is a great book for kids (and adults too). Loaded with detailed illustrations and weaved together with an interesting story of the pig family moving house. My 3.5 year old loves to pretend that he's driving any or all of the the great vehicles on display. This book can provide hours of entertainment and is a perennial favorite during our nightly reading."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I still love this book, I read it over and over for my son, now 34, and am reading it now with another vehicle crazed two year old. The only difference is now I am not so good at remembering where Goldbug is hiding! It's hours of fun, full of humor and fun things to see and stories to tell. I also appreciate having an Officer Flossy and a Mistress Mouse (who repairs cars and has a tow truck) STILL to this day!! This book is one to pull out when you just want to SIT and not run around after your toddler."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Our 20 month old grandson loves pointing to and naming the vehicles and the animal occupants on every page. We enjoy looking at the book with him and we enjoy reading the story to him. This activity reminds us of the wonderful time that we had reading this book to our own children. It is fun to follow the pig family on their travels and to see what they find when they arrive home."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I'm getting this for the next generation of our family. My son memorized where the gold bug was on each page and astounded family members by finding them before they could. Now it's time for the next generation to learn the joys of finding Gold Bug!This book never gets old."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Some of the first books I received as a child were by Richard Scarry. That much said, even 30-40 years later they still hold up in terms of keeping kids engaged in the action taking place over the course of some very detailed and colorful pages.One thing I want to point out is that Scarry was one of the better anthro artists in his own right and he deserves a second look beyond the \\"child's book author\\" label. Each and every one of his characters, be it Lowly Worm, Huck the Kitten, Mr. Fixit, Officer Murphy and the anti-authority Dingo (along with his much-abused sports car -- it actually seemed to be a living creature in some respects with its reactions to Dingo's more blatant acts of stupidity over the years) have their own recognizable personality traits. There's even a twist ending of sorts in this book where Dingo does get his comeuppance after 25+ pages of vehicular mayhem.It's a good book for the small fry -- nothing scary, someone who is misbehaving gets caught, nobody gets hurt and there's even a subtle potty joke (the little 'mouse in a hurry' at the rest stop)."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My two boys loved this book. I read it to them many, many times. It was our game to find the gold bug on each page. Now I have bought a copy of this book for each of my grandchildren.Richard Scarry's Cars and Trucks from A to Z (A Chunky Book(R))"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"i grew up with richard scarry.i bought this for my 3 year old twins as a potty reward.they havn't put it down--they are toddler motorheads and as all three year olds-want to know the name of EVERYTHING and WHY everything is...this book has the answers...its a lot of fun and although you can tell the pictures were drawn many decades ago it is still relevant now."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"As others have mentioned, I loved this book as a child and we got a copy for our first child (who is now 6 years old). When we had a second child, we had to purchase a second copy as the first child wasn't ready to give hers up. This is a classic that we will add to our list of favorite gifts for our friends' children."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is a great book , My 2 year old great grand son loves it. It is a good investment."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I went through two of these books with my children and I ordered one for my first grandson. Story is fun and lots of things to talk about and have young ones find. Builds vocabulary and very creative. I really like Richard Scary books. An all time favorite of mine."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Wonderful book. Lots to look at and discuss. My son cannot get enough of this book. It has been his favorite for at least three months so far! We wore out a yard sale copy and bought a new one! It is a great distraction in the car and at restaurants. Excellent at bedtime. Richard Scarry is great."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I bought this book for my 2-year-old son and he loves it. He is into trucks and cars and wouldn't put this down. He now knows about all kinds of trucks. There isn't much of a story. He just likes looking at and saying all of the different trucks (such as a flatbed trailer)."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son loves Richard Scarry books and construction equipment so this book is a good match. He pores over the pictures looking for Goldbug and pointing out funny things like Hilda Hippo driving a loader."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"We discovered Richard Scurry and this wonderful book by accident. A friend of ours went to a library sale and picked up this book for our daughter, because she knew that our daughter is very much interested in cars. We got it shortly before Anna turned 18 months, and we took this book with us on cross-country trip to Florida, since we hoped to keep her occupied. Well, this didn't quite work out, since Anna was already overwhelmed with novelty of everything around her, but she fell in love with this book on our return. For months Cars and Trucks and Things That Go was her must-read-before-bed book. Her vocabulary literally exploded with its help. And she blows me away with her ability to find Goldbug in each page pretty much instantaneously. First there is gleeful, \\"Hello Goldbug!\\" and then her chubby finger points to where he is hiding. It's a wonderful-wonderful book, and I am sure we will enjoy it for years to come."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Both our sons loved this book . I bought this for our grandson, who, I am sure, will have as much fun looking for Goldbug as his dad did some 30 years ago."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I purchased this for a grandson's 2nd birthday and he just loves it. He has it virtually memorized by now but it is still his first choice at bedtime."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I bought this book with Scarry's A Day at the Airport book to help entertain my 23 month old during a cross country flight. My son wasn't as absorbed in Cars and Trucks as I'd hoped he be during the flight but in the weeks since he has been asking for the \\"Trucks\\" book every day. We narrate some of the pictures but he also spends some time looking at book every day on his own, paging through the book and absorbed in the illustrations (and commenting on the pictures occasionally, or at least as much as a near 2 year old can). We have other books with photos of vehicles which also interest him but this book so far seems to have more lasting appeal. I think it's the combination of the sheer volume and variety of the vehicles, interesting animals driving them, and just lots going on on each page."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Our 19 month old grandson loves Cars, Trucks and Things That Go, so this book is perfect for him. It is not too old for him. He looks and looks at the pictures on the pages and says the name of the object over and over.He has learned many new words from having this book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"The Pig family takes a road trip. On their way to the beach for a picnic, they encounter cars and trucks, vans and motorcycles, tractors and buses. What an exciting day!My kids delighted in finding Goldbug. A very fun book for children who like cars."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"After wearing out a couple of these books 30 years ago with our own kids, we still have fun giving copies to new parents so that their kids can enjoy the search for Gold Bug with them--over and over again. The detailed illustrations keep kids' attention for hours, and the fanciful vehicles and their drivers are great for feeding little imaginations. There is a whole host of R. Scarry books, but this is the one we like the most."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I bought this book for my sons over 25 years ago, and now I'm buying it for my two grandsons. Even before he was 2, my oldest son absolutely loved this book. His brother was no different and it quickly became our every night bedtime book, not to mention it accompanied us on every vacation and out-of-town trip. Even when they were toddlers, we would make up all kinds of games to play using the pictures, such as who could find the little gold bug which seemed to pop up in various places throughout the book. I still have the original book I bought back then, and when my Grandsons come visit they immediately run to the bookshelf for this book and proceed to fight over who gets to hold it. Just recently my youngest son saw this book on the shelf and sat down to read it to his his 1 yr. old son. As they looked through the book, my son began sharing with his son all his favorite pages, dicussing why he like this or that page so much. It was heart warming to see the sparkle in his eyes as he shared a fond memory with his son, and I was surprised how much joy this book actually did bring to them then. My grandsons will each get their own copy for Christmas this year with pictures of their Dads as very little boys being read this book taped in the front, and a special wish from their Grandma and Granddaddy.Excellent book. Even as a parent this book was a joy to read EVERY NIGHT!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"When my wife and I were going to Ecuador to visit our son and his family we wanted to take gifts for each of our four grandchildren there. Since toys are hard to pack and since books really last longer, we wanted to take them each a book. As we thought of our four-year old grandson we remembered one of the Richard Scarry books that his father had liked which was Cars and Trucks and Things to Go. It is really a great book that gives hours of entertainment and a also provides a wonderful learning experience. Needless to say, Gold Bug was an added attraction and reason for us to buy the book. Nathan was very happy with his book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book is, by far, the most loved book in our household. Both my 3 year old and my one and a half year old are captivated by its colorful illustrations of favorite objects. Each page has dozens of things to see and talk about, which makes this book a must for long plane flights and trips where we need to get maximum \\"entertainment value\\" for each item that we bring. We highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I first read this book to my daughter 22 years ago. It was her favorite, and alas it wore out. Searching to find Goldbug on each and every page was the most fun, and the verse was very entertaining as we did so. It helped teach her words, spelling and all about the different ways to get from here to there. I just reordered a copy to surprise her for Christmas, as she prepares to start her own family. I highly recommend this book by one of the most beloved children's authors."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son (21 months and obsessed with cars and trucks) asks to read his \\"cars and trucks book\\" every single day. It seems like every time we read it, we find something new. Great for keeping kids engaged, and the photos are excellent."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"We have had this book for years and the binding finally came apart. I was pleased to find it at Amazon.com and was very pleased with the price. My grandson and granddaughter really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"this richard Scary book is the original with great pictures and excellent creative ideas.

My grandchildren love the book just as their fathers did so many years ago.... Thanks for the opportunity to pass on such delightful reading adventures!!!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son loved this book when he was little. He wanted to carry it around all the time, The pages were worn out as he looked at it all the time until we had to purchase a second copy. I highley recommend this book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I loved Richard Scarry as a little boy and my 2 year-old son loves him, too. It's still fun to read this story and follow the family across the pages and past the myriad of crazy, zany vehicles. My favorite always was (and still is) the apple van. Definitely on my top ten all-time list for kids' books!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"We purchased this book after buying the yellow book with the lion on it which is the entire collection of stories from Richard Scarry. This one is good but my son still prefers the yellow one. It could be that there is a wide variety of stories. Personally I like the size of the yellow book because it's not too big/bulky and can be comfortably carried by child and adult alike. This is a good book overall but if I had a do-over I'd stick with the yellow book and leave it at that."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Received my used copy of Cars & Trucks & Things that Go, by Richard Scarry. Ordered from Goodwill Of CT for a good price-and the book arrived in good time, well packed. It is in better condition than I expected. I would recommend this book-and this seller- to anyone. Thanks Amazon, Goodwill of CT, and especially Richard Scarry! Did not give 5 stars only because the book was not in \\"New\\" condition-but I did not expect it to be. All is good!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I recently ordered this book. The first copy I received had a quality issue. The print colors in many of the illustrations were incorrect. For instance, the pigs were green. For another, there were paint cans to help teach children colors and the paint can that was labeled blue was actually printed in red, etc... I returned the book and ordered a new one. The new book had the exact same print color error. I believe Amazon has a complete lot of incorrect books. I have notified them by phone and e-mail. I am waiting to hear back."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This would be a great book except for a color printing error. The pigs change from orangish to green in the book and back again. In addition, one page shows cans of paints tipped over and the color and the labels are incorrect- the blue label is with the pink, etc. I am waiting for a new one from Amazon but I am not convinced the customer service rep understood the issue. Will be disappointed to get another bad copy!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I purchased this for my two year old grandson. He loves all kinds of cars and trucks but this book is not a favorite. I purchased it because my daughter in law said her [...] daughter loved it. Although he likes the pictures and will call out some of the cars like the alligator car, it doesn't seem to hold his attention. The story doesn't interest him and the cars may be too fanciful. He can identify more with the illustrations that are less fanciful."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My daughter loved this book when she was one and two years old. If we still had it, I'm sure that at age 4 she would be begging for me to read it to her daily. I threw it away last year when it was really worn out... I'm talking about she loved this book so much that she drew on every page and then started tearing out the pages and sleeping with them under her pillow.I give this book two stars because I hate it, and I'm the one who gets stuck reading it to her. I can't stand the stupid cars that look like a pickle, etc. This is why I hate Richard Scarry books. He didn't have a lot of great ideas. He just had a great publisher. I remember loving these books when I was a kid, too, but it was really like an addiction. Richard Scarry books are like junk food."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son, who is obsessed with every vehicle out there, loves, loves, loves this book. Every time we checked it out from the library and had to return it, he would get so sad, so I finally just decided to buy one. It's a great addition to any toddler's library."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son loved this book when he was a toddler and now his son,my grandson Leo, is also enjoying this book. It is timeless in its appeal to little ones who love all things that go!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was a gift for my grandson. He loves this book. We read it and he elaborates on the adventures that each of the vehicles is going on.. Great book!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Wonderful book. The drawings are fabulous and the story line is engaging. The pig family get into all kinds of trouble as they make their way by car to a picnic. All the wonderful transportation vehicles get involved in the mayhem as they travel along...fire engines, tow trucks, buses and many silly cars as well...like the pickle car. My grandson (21 months) LOVES the book and loves pointing out all the vehicles as we turn each page. I love the fact that you can make up your own story as you go along as well. It's also fun for my grandson to search for the different Scarry characters that are always in his books.My own children (4 boys) had Richard Scarry books...and I saved them all these years and now read them to my grandson. Cars and Trucks and Things that Go was not in our original repertoire, so I purchased it... and as usual...the book didn't disappoint."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"We have this book from when my husband was little (1970's). He loved it then and now our 4 year old loves it! We were so glad that we found a new one because my husbands book was falling apart from so much use. Our 4 year old was so excited when he received this book at Christmas! So many things to look at which makes such great conversation with your kiddo. Always on the lookout for goldbug whom is a bug that appears on each page and you have to find him! Just an overall fun book!Enjoy some fun reading & talking time with your little one!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is a big story with lots going on but for my younger boys we skip around and just look at different pages every time we read it and they both love this book! It is great for letting the kids guide the story by letting them tell you what they see on different pages and tell you about it! It is very entertaining and has lots of vocabulary building potential too!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I bought this book years ago for my boys and we all loved it! A warning to parents--it will be frustrating when your little ones can find goldbug before you do! Have given many copies to kids over many years. It's always my first choice."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"So much to look at on a single page and so much to talk about! Its huge size is perhaps the only down side (but then again how else can one fit so much in a page!)--the books is too big for my son's little hands. But the stories, images, and humorous creativity is matchless! Cars of all sorts of fruits and vegetables...moving things for animals and with animals....My son's favorite has always been the banana car, mine is the bug van. Keeps us busy for a good 20 minutes! That's a wow for us!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Bought this for my grandson to keep him busy while his baby sister was being christened. He loved it then and still enjoys the busy, busy pages with the cars and trucks."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Such a clever creation that your child or grandchild can leaf through for quick enjoyment, but even more intriguing once the child begins to discover the tiny but intricate hidden charaters, items, and detail. Perfect for parent/child, or grandparent/grandchild time, and will provide years of fond memories."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book was an old time favorite of my now 17 year old son. Several months ago, I took it out for my 2 year old nephew. He was hooked after the first viewing. He had several favorite pages and since he is at the age of loving all things transportation, he asked for it over and over again. I gave him my son's copy until I purchased a copy for him a few weeks ago. He calls it \\"his new book\\" and uses it every day. A friend and playmate got hooked on it while visiting, and I purchased a copy for him too. It turns out that it is now his favorite book too. The beauty of the book is that as they get older they can read the text and also search for \\"gold bug\\", but for now it is all about the silly cars and trucks and building vocabulary and memory.I purchased R.Scarry books on the airport and firehouse as holiday gifts for my nephew, as well as a DVD from Busytown. I am sure he will enjoy those as well. I highly recommend the book for any youngster from around 2 years old on up to emerging readers. Great fun for them to look at or read alone, and a blast for them to share with friends, siblings, parents and other adults too. Richard Scarry continues to ROCK!!!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I had this book when I was a little girl, and through the years it has seen a lot of little readers...and because of it isn't in the best shape. I bought a new copy so that I didn't have to worry about my childhood memory slowly falling apart even faster. My daughter is 2 and loves it. We read it almost every night and look for Goldbug on each page. Its a great read while we are getting ready for bed, and the book is a ton of fun! I would recommend it to any parent!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was my husband's favorite book as a child. It is now our 2 year old son's favorite as well! We've read it together so many times, he has memorized most of the book and knows exactly where to find Goldbug on each page. Fantastic book!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My daughters loved to find 'Goldbug' hidden on the pages of lively illustrations. They literally wore the book to pieces.Only criticism is simply that I think Golden Books should put a little more into the binding. I think it should have held up better than it did."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is the second generation of our family loving this book. We have 2 grown sons and our book has taped and tattered pages from all the use. I just gave a new book to our nieces 4 year old for his birthday and he loves having it read to him and finding the elusive Gold Bug on every page. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I just purchased this book for my grandson.My son had this book when he was young and loved it.There are so many things to look at on every page.Also a little yellow bug called \\"gold bug\\" is hiding on every page andit was amazing how quickly he could find him. Faster than me.It's a great book to share with your child."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is a great book for 3-5 yr. old boys and girls. It has a lot to look at and absorb."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"For preschoolers, I have yet to find any author/illustrator who matches Richard Scarry in appeal. This particular book has a whimsical streak that delights little boys (possibly also little girls, but my sample includes only boys). Be prepared to read the book many, many times--even after the kids have it memorized."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This has always been a favorite among the young set. We had one of these when our kids were young. Besides the learning aspect even toddlers can have fun searching for the \\"Gold Bug\\" This jolly little fella is somewhere on every page. This is not only a hit with kids but also adults after finding our old copy we had three adults huddled around the book trying to find the \\"Gold Bug\\". I recently orderd two new books (the original is a bit tattered from years of use). My grown adult children have each requested one of these as a Christmas gift and they do not even have children of there own! Great Book!!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is a classic gift for new parents and babies. It encourages reading aloud to even the youngest child, and has the added bonus of finding \\"gold bug\\" included on every page, so the book grows in interest as the child grows. I keep several new copies on hand for gifts."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I absolutely love this book. I still remember this book from my childhood and received it as a gift for my son when he was two. We still use it to find Goldbug and now that he is five we also use it for learning to read. My most recent purchase was as a gift for my nephew. I will continue to buy this book for all of the children in my family."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was the only book my son would sit still and look at from cover to cover.I remember loving to try and fing &#34;Gold Bug&#34;.that was 30 years ago. Now I am passing the tradition on to my friend's grandson."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"To put it succinctly, I grew up on this book. It was present in my first memories, and I remember flipping, then later reading, through it time and time again as a child. I consider it a must have for any young child, placing it in my personal pantheon next to Seuss' best.Things That Go has a simple premise - it's about a family going for a drive to go on a picnic. Along the way, they encounter a wide variety of imaginative vehicles, like trucks that look like mustard and ketchup bottles, an alligator car, and many others. It's standard child story fare, but it does the job.The magic of the book is Goldbug. Hidden on every page is a small, yellow, friendly-looking insect. Sometimes he's fully visible, other times just the top of his head is showing, but he's there. It's a precursor to something like Where's Waldo, but not so punishing or annoying. Goldbug is hidden in some clever areas, but there's never any trickery involved.If you have a small child, then get this book. I bought a new copy for my infant nephew. What, did you think I would give away my own copy?"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is probably my favorite book from my childhood. I spent many hours enjoying the adventures of the Pickles Pig, his family, Dingo Dog, Officer Flossy and Goldbug. The mix of real vehicles and absurd creations made the experience both educational and fun. I bought this copy for my nephew's first Christmas in 2009, and I plan to pass on my copy (duct-taped binding and all) to my son once he's old enough to look at books without ripping out the pages."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Our son REALLY loves having this book read to him. He loves searching for Goldbug on each page and is so proud of himself when he finds him on his own. I will say this is NOT a quick read. There are many objects that are labeled that you will be reading along with the story itself. This is great if you want to have you child cuddled in for a bit while you share the story together (a bonus for my husband and I). The neighbor's little girls loved this story as well (they is 6 and 8 years old)."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I bought this book for my friend's 4-year old. He loves it. It was my son's absolute favorite book when he was litt.e. He carried it everywhere and we read it everyday! We went through 3 copies due to hard use."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is one of the most well loved books from my childhood. My brother loved it so much my mother had to buy another copy. I was kinder to the book, and now 30 years later, my 2 year old is fascinated with the book. It gets many reads every day. There are so many pictures and so much happening on every page. And there's the fun of trying to find 'gold bug' on every page. It's a classic, and I think it will be for many years to come.Definitely buy a back-up. While my 30-year old copy made it through a year of my son's intense interest, it is definitely time to get a new copy."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Our toddler son is quite the avid reader, and right now this book is by far his favorite. Scarry's imagination is a great fit for young minds, and this book could not be better for boys obsessed with vehicles. It has so many intricate details that make it a pleasure to read again and again. Beware, though, of your child reenacting the massive car crash at the end of the book!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I borrowed this book from the public library and my 5 y/o son loved it!! When I found there were used copies for sale, I jumped on it. There's so much to do besides reading the story, and wondering if Officer Flossy will catch up with Dingo. We looked for Goldbug, counted the number of cats or mice or other animals. We talked about all of the different types of vehicles and which ones were real vs. fictional. I didn't have this book as a child, but I hope my son will share with his kids someday."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My cousin just had a son, and also has a two year-old daughter, and I was thinking of a gift and immediately thought of this book. My middle child, a son, loved this book so dearly he slept with it every night. No teddy bear for him, just \\"Cars and Trucks and Things that Go\\", until the cover fell off, and we had to buy a new copy. So beloved and timeless--I'm happy to start passing this on to a new generation."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Bought this book after checking it out from the local library for my son. He loved it so I bought it. Happy kids means happy dads! He absolutely loves this book and all the interesting vehicles in it & for less than $10 shipped, who can complain?"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book was our older son's favorite book when he was a toddler. He literally wore the binding down. We had to find Yellow Bug on each and every page!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My 3.5 and 2-year-old boys LOVE this book. It's wonderful-informative, creative, and with just the right amount of silliness to captivate readers young and old. It is VERY long-great for car trips, too long for before-bed reading. I think Richard Scarry should be a part of every child's library!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I remember loving this book as a child, and now my son (currently 2 yrs old) wants to read it with me every single night before bed (it's even the same book I had as a child, taped page and everything). We both love it. Who knows, perhaps one day he will be reading to his kids."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Cars, Trucks and Things That GoThis book was one of my son's favorites when he was a child. Now my grandson is enjoying it as well. Finding Goldbug is a fun activity that sharpens cognitive skills."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I was first exposed to this book when my son was born. An elderly friend of the family gave it to us as a gift. She explained that kids (especially little boys) were fascinated trying to find the gold bug on every page. Let me tell you...not only did my son and daughter both love this book, but it became the featured entertainment whenever we had guests! Everyone racing to find the gold bug first!So, when a neighbor/colleague recently had a baby boy, the first thing I thought of was \\"Cars and Trucks and Things That Go!\\" I knew I could find it on Amazon. I ordered and it was delivered to my house within two days.Amazon is the best. Richard Scarry is the best."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"For those who can appreciate the drawings by Richard Scarry, I wanted to make a couple of other recommendations: check out this title on Amazon.com 'Around the World with Mouk by Marc Boutavant': we love MOUK and we are so happy that this title is now available in English! And if you love books with a positive message you will be madly in love with another French character 'Barbapapa'! Barbapapa (meaning Cotton Candy in French) is both the title character, and name of the \\"species\\" of said character, of a series of children's books written in the 1970s by Annette Tison and Talus Taylor, who resided in Paris, France. You can still purchase the books and DVD's in Europe (or through Amazon.fr - available in French or Amazon.co.jp with DVD's available in French/English/Japanese, make sure to get a multi-region DVD player). The story is always educational and there is always a message: to protect the earth, the animals, nature. One of the most positive books for children ever created! Barbapapa was and still is a huge hit in France, Belgium and Japan. Unfortunately, Barbapapa was never really distributed in the USA. If you want to bring up your children with a positive and peaceful message, you should give Barbapapa a try! One of the most undiscovered gems in children's literature. Barbapapa is the best!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is my two year old son's most requested book, with Scarry's \\"Best Word Book Ever\\" coming in a close second. He loves pointing out new details in the pictures and asking the names for everything!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"3 boys all loved it-- they are now grown. I am a speech/language pathologist and this is what I give everyone having boys! It is great for categorization, differeniation, and vocab etc etc. ours fell apart from so much use-- Sign Of A Great Book!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book was a favorite of my son over 30 years ago. Richard's imagination and artwork make this a book that will be read until it falls apart. There is so much to see and look at, it is like seeing a new book every time it's read."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Got this as a gift from my college chum--a mother of three--when my son was born. He discovered it last year when he just turned two and is now three and a half. Now, if anything, he loves it more. The story itself and pictures are even entertaining for mom and dad--at least the first three or four hundred times through. Just be warned, this book will get used, and used, and used!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I started reading this book with my son when he first learned to talk a few years ago. He's not tired of it yet (and neither am I). There are so many fun illustrations (I especially like the &quot;pickle car&quot;), and so much going on that this book can be read again and again. Now that my son is familiar with all of the vehicles, and able to point them out when we go driving in our car (although we have yet to see a pickle car in our area) we have fun not just reading the story, but looking for the tiny &quot;Goldbug&quot; on every page."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I have tried hiding this book and pretending it was lost. That is how desperate I got to read something (anything!) else to my son. I personally get very bored by this book and have never understood the (often male) obsession with motor vehicles. My 19 month old son, however, cannot get enough of it and will sit quietly, making various vehicle noises along with me, for hours if I let him. No other books in our library compete (though there are many I personally enjoy reading more). There is a very loose story, which we never manage to actually stick to. And there are a seemingly infinite number of pages with endless numbers of vehicles to name, comment on, and assign motor sounds to. It has single-handedly created a truck obsession in our home and we can no longer go for outdoors without my son excitedly pointing to and declaring every car and truck he sees. However, through this book (and some creative reading of it) my son is also learning all about colors and numbers and animals and fruits (bananamobile!) and vegetables and relationships and cause and effect and shapes and tons of other things besides \\"things that go\\". The book is what you make of it and it certainly has enough going on to capture the imagination and attention of just about any child (and, admittedly, parent). I have finally accepted it (somewhat begrudgingly) as the classic and masterful book that it truly is."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I bought this book when my son was 2 years old. He enjoyed this book every single night for at least half year. He is 4 years old now. This book is still on his nightstand. If you can only buy one book for a boy who loves cars, this is the one. And by the way, I enjoy reading it, too. :)"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My 3 kids could look at this book every night. It was the first Richard Scarry we bought and loved to death. They can't get enough of looking for Goldbug. I recently bought The Best StoryBook Ever and they love that as well. Brings back memories, too."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I recall reading this book to my younger sister many years ago.I recently purchased this for a 6 year old. He squealed with delight.It is his favorite R S book.Richard Scarry books are classics - great for young & old.Delightful pictures & so fun to look at!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Another winner by Richard Scarry! His books are chalk full of action pictures, silly characters, etc. My boys love his books just as much as I did when I was their age."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Many creative vehicles are a great way to discuss transportation possibilities with very young boys, and I suppose girls, but my boys needed more persuasion to sit and develop an interest in books with Grandma.I loved it, too!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My 22-year-old daughter called from college last week asking if I still had this book. Apparently one of her friends (in law school!) had this book as a child and mentioned it to her. Of course I still have this book! The cover is torn and the pages are well worn but it is tucked away in her childhood memories box. It was her ultimate favorite as a child. Many hours were pleasantly spent searching those pages for that little 'gold bug'. I would highly recommend this book for any parent with an inquisitive toddler."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I had this book when I was little and I am so excited that my son gets to enjoy it as well. We spend time everyday looking for the little goldbug on each page. He loves it."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My husband wanted to buy this book for our two year old daughter because he remembered it very well from his childhood. Even though there are many pages our daughter loves to flip through them and see the different types of automobiles and trucks, and she loves to find the little goldbug on each page. The book is a little larger than most of her other books, but she doesn't have any trouble turning the pages, especially if it is laying on the floor. As she gets older she should not have any trouble with it if it is in her lap. I think that this book will entertain her for years to come, as there are so many different things to look at on every page, plus the fun of finding goldbug."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"It probably helps that my son is obsessed with \\"things that go\\", but this has been one of his favorites for some time. He could sit and stare at the pages for a long time - well a long time for a 2-year old. There's a lot going on on each page, so I thought he might be a little overwhelmed with it all, but there are things on each page he focuses on. Dingo the dog and Goldbug help tie all the pages together. It helps his observation skills to search for them."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My four children (ages 5 and under) all love Richard Scarry. I use their motivation to use these books to teach. We count \\"How many blue cars?\\" We spell and read using the labels in the book, and we use it to practice Spanish lessons as well \\"Donde esta el carro rojo?\\" After any lesson using their other books like Teach your child to read in 100 lessons, or Flip Flop Spanish, I often hear, \\"Can we practice with a \\"best book?\\" (Their term for all Richard Scarry books.)Fun to read, fun to use, sturdy, and useful for everyone so far, from 7 months up to age 5 1/2!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Most importantly my daughter loves the book. It takes longer to read and can be difficult on some pages to find the little yellow bug, but the book was a big hit in our house."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My grandson and I have spent hours pouring over the pages of this bookwhich contains wonderful images of every type of vehicle, both real andimagined. The pages have provided opportunities for reading, counting,dreaming, laughing and what could be better for a 3 1/2 year old andhis grandmother to share? I urge you to purchase this wonderful bookfilled with magical visions to tempt a new reader to spend time with abook - a treasure at any price."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"What's not to love about Richard Scarry? This particular book has pages jammed full of illustrations that kids love! Not only are there hundreds of vehicles (like the carrot car, pickle truck and donut truck) the story also follows a family along as they make their way on vacation. I've given this book as a gift many, many times and toddlers seem to love not only discovering different things each time they look at it ... but they also love finding the gold bug hidden on every page."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son got this book when he was only 18 months. Now he is three and this is still his favorite book. He has read this book from front to back so many times and yet he wants more."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"We have worn through at least four copies of this book. It was my oldest son's favorite book for at least two years, and is now my youngest son's favorite book. We have read this book more times than I can count! Lots of fun stuff to look at, funny stories."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son used to call it his pickle book. He is 28 years old today and I think it is still his favorite. I bought it for a friend's child who is two years old and he loves it. He makes noises every time he points to a vehicle and taps me on the shoulder to look. His sister who is 4 years old cracks up at the Piggies in the car and has found all of the Gold bugs. It is definitely a family book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book has all kinds of cars for kids who loves cars to read and learn. My son just loves it."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was my (now teenager) son's favorite book. I must have read it to him a thousand times. I have bought numerous copies since then and given them are gifts. I'll bet if you ask my son today to name some of the characters in this book - he could still remember them."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My 2 1/2 year old loves, I mean loves, this book. Great book for potty training too! It has so much detail it keeps him in the bathroom until he is finished. It was his dad's book when he was a wee one and my son's gran passed it to my son so it has extra special meaning also. I given as a gift and will do so again."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My children loved this book back in the 70's and now they are requesting it for their children. I'm a preschool teacher and this book keeps children attention for a long time. The childrenhurry to get to that book first during silent reading time."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My oldest son loved this book in 1989, we looked at it and read it every nite for the longest time. We would point out different cars and trucks and look for mr frumble on every page. I attribute his early speech and large vocabulary at a very young age to the nightly reading of this book. Now I have a baby again and I am so excited to be buying and sharing this book with my new son. I know his brother will smile with fond memories of his own early reading."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Hunted for this book. Used for my children when they were little and wanted it for grandchildren. Love Goldbug. Kids always have so much fun trying to find him."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is BY FAR my 2 year old son's favorite book. He sleeps with it every night and I've had to cover the pages with contact paper they are turned so often. There is lots of detail so it keeps his interest. He loves looking for Goldbug hidden on every page."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"If your child loves trucks and cars as much as my son does, this book is for you. It has wonderful and imaginative illustrations. What a great find."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"When I was a little boy I loved this book and spent hours pooring over it. My mom recently found our copy and now my two year old son is spending hours looking at it and pointing out all the trucks. I love sharing this with him."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My son got this last Christmas and he has literally loved it to death -- the binding is broken, pages are dog-eared and torn. He just adores it! There is so much packed into this book that every time we read it, we find something new to talk about."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I read this book when I was small- and loved it.

I can't wait until I can share this book with my children."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I remember this book from when I was a kid.

A must have!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"The odds are you read this book yourself when you were young, perhaps passing it on to younger siblings or cousins. Cars and Trucks and Things That Go by Richard Scarry will never, ever go out of style. It is so amazingly filled with action and color, it keeps young readers enthralled over and over again. If you pick it up again as an adult, you'll be caught right back up into its excitement!Beautiful! Delightful! Wonderful! Silly! Educational! Entertaining! Cars and Trucks and Things That Go just has it all."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Richard Scarry does it again. Good for boys and girls with lots of interesting pictures to name and very colorful."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Product was shipping quickly and arrived in good shape. This is one of the best books you can buy for your toddler. Hours of fun are spent searching the pages to find the little gold bug. Child learns visual discrimination, a very valuable skill that needs developing for the child to learn to read. We wore out the first copy and had to replace it. My kids used this book in the 1970s and it is just as exciting for toddlers today to feel the sense of accomlishment by finding the bug. Great interactive reading."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book was read at bedtime every night for weeks, to the point that parents were being driven insane. The detail on every page makes this one that can be read again and again by children. I'll never know when boredom would have set in because my son destroyed this book by reading it so much before that happened."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My great grandmother gave this book to me and each of my cousins when we were very young.

Kids of all ages really enjoy it!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I recently checked this book out of the library for my two and a half year old son and he loves it. It is a wonderfully creative book he will be receiving for Christmas this year. He really enjoys searching for the goldbug and Dingo Dog on each page. My son loves all the Richard Scarry books we have read so far."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"You will be asked to read this every night. Your child will sleep with it, and bring it out to breakfast. The hardcover binding thankfully is up to repeated page-turning by a toddler, and the printing is vibrant and clear. I prefer \\"What Do People Do All Day\\" as it tells more stories, but who can tell a three-year-old!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I have been sharing this wonderful book with so many new mothers of boys ever since my 32-year old enjoyed his book as a child. It is so colorful and eye-catching and it is such fun to find Goldbug. It is a wonderful way to share with your child and to help him use his mind."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My 37 year old daughter loved this book, especially searching for the Goldbugs. I bought a copy for her almost-three year old daughter and she loves it just as much. Makes me happy!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Our three boys went through 3 copies of this book. I bought a copy for my granddaughter and have given at least a dozen as gifts. It's a wonderful book to read to several children at once. The double page spread with SO much action is perfect. The ilustrations are detailed enough to appeal to children of different ages. It's fun to find Goldbug and the race is on as you turn the page. The enriching vocabulary and examples of vehicles make this book a great learning tool."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was a kid, and is now a special book for my daughter and my mother to share.

This used to be one of my favorite books, and after finding it again, i see that it still is. Every page has a new scene full of strange vehicles and critters and you follow a family on their trip through these crazy scenes. I love the creativity of the vehicles and the critters and the names of everything. And I love the fact that you can stare at a page for hours and still find new things. Can you find goldbug?"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I bought this book about three years ago for my then one year old son. He loves this book.

He is getting two more Richard Scarry books for Christmas."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was my husband's book as a child we pulled out of a box for my 19 month old daughter. It has become a ritual for her to read this book every night before she takes a bath, and sometimes several times during the day as well. When she wants this book, she will say Goldbug over and over again. It has helped her with many things from memory to learning names of trucks and cars. She loves airplanes and her favorite page is the airport with the mouse in the airplanes. My husband still loves to look at the book himself to look for Goldbug!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Its a great book from beginning to end!

They are enjoying it so much -they &#34;go&#34; by car many places, but now they have a &#34;look&#34; at how other things &#34;go.&#34;Much fun for them! Maybe they will drive something else when they grow up -all kinds of opportunities for them or maybe they will appreciate vehiclesthat others drive - for fun and work."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"Richard Scarry books are timeless.

I love reading it to my new born, and seeing all the art work that I took for granted when I first got this."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book is one of the Scarry books that's great for all ages. My kid's only 9 months old so we just flip through the pages and I point stuff out rather than read the story. She likes to turn the pages and will usually let me point out 2 or 3 things before flipping it. I figure eventually she'll become more patient and then we'll get to the story later. Lots of stuff in this book is labeled, which makes it great if you love his word books."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My three-year-old son is crazy about this book. It's practically the only book he wants to use for story time, which gets a little old. It's great for kids who get bored with just one picture and one short phrase on each page. My son loves checking out all the busy pictures - with all the fun vehicles."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"The product was shipped quickly and at a fair price. We love the book. Our grandchildren will enjoy having a copy of the book in their homes."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I grew up with this book as my favorite and it got a lot of use in my readings. After lots of scotch tape repairs, the books binding finally fell apart and my mom had to buy another one for me.Now I have my own child and even though he is a 16 month old and doesn't fully appreciate everything it has to offer, he loves the variety of pictures and the large pages that he can turn. And as he learns the names of more things, he has more to point to in the book.The main upside of the book is that there is a lot to look at on every page. Not just vehicles, but scenery and action make each turn of the page a new adventure. While there is a story that goes on through the entire book, you can get lots of enjoyment just by flipping through it and this makes it worthwhile for younger children who don't have the longest of attention spans. The pictures are clear and bright and help with building vocabulary and recognition.Before \\"Where's Waldo,\\" there was Goldbug. After a while, children will know exactly where he is on each page but having to hunt for him the first several times through adds something else to the charm of Richard Scarry.The downsides are small and not worth worrying about. The pages are big but that means they are easily ripped. Just keep the tape handy. Also, pagewise, it is a long book for that age and parents can grow tired of reading it. But the actual amount of words is small. Most of the time is taken by looking at everything and searching for Goldbug. And most kids seem to enjoy looking through the book by themselves.And I can't complain at all if a book keeps kids interested in reading. And I expect to buy another copy someday."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book was my favorite book when I was a little kid. That is part of the reason I gave it five stars. It is not only a fun book to read but it is also fun to look for this little yellow creature on each page. There is an Officer Flossy who rides on a bike and chases a terrible driver in a sports car throughout the entire book, while the Pig family goes on a picnic to the beach. The pictures of all the different types of vehicles are very interesting and fun to look at."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My kids are hooked on these books. Richard Scarry comes up with an amusing collection of cars and trucks that take on anthropomorphic proportions. He leads the reader along with various devices such as \\"spotting the bug.\\" The book has been translated into many languages, including Lithuanian, making it one of the most widely read children's books in circulation. Best to buy the hardback as it will get plenty of use."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I AM SO SICK OF THIS BOOK! Both of my sons, ages 2 &amp; 4 are obsessed with this book and I have to read it at least once per day. They can also look at it without me as the many cute, silly pictures speak for themselves. It's an adorable book."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I loved Richard Scarry books when I was an older sister looking for library books for my younger siblings--the stories and recurring characters were fun, but the most fun was looking for the little jokes scattered throughout the book...the appearances of Lowly Worm or Bugdozer in the margins of pictures, the mix of fanciful (the alligator mobile) with the mundane cars on the same street. It's a book that can be read aloud for the main story, or provide hours of fun looking at the pictures for all the details. I got this particular Richard Scarry book for my 2 year old nephew as he is a big fan of all \\"things taht go\\" and my sister told me that it was an extra big hit, since he had previously had a copy of the book that was destroyed in an unfortunate book tearing incident, and he was overjoyed to have a new copy!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This is a great book for kids. It was my son's favourite and I bought it for his child. It is a book that a child can spend hours with, however the paper and the binding of the book are quite inferior and low quality. It certainly does not have the sturdiness of the older books. Content is great though."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My husband and I are both teachers. Of all the books that we bought and read to our two sons (now ages 18 and 21), this is the only one they insisted we read again and again (every night for months for each of them). We even made up a Goldbug song to accompany the search each time."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book is so much more than a vocabulary builder! There are dozens of modes of transportation (from motor-scrapers to locomotives to doughnut cars), real and imagined, represented in the humorous illustrations. The settings take children through various seasons and parts of a community (a farm, a Main street, a campground, a beach, etc.). The questions from your child will be endless...How is a road made? What are the firefighters doing? Has Officer Flossy found Dingo Dog yet, so she can give him a ticket? And where, oh where is that Goldbug hiding? Inside the limousine? Behind the ambulance? Inside the broken-down car that is being towed by a small tow truck, which is being towed by a larger tow truck? This is so much more than just an entertaining story to be read, but an opportunity to ask and answer questions together, to find something new each time you read together, and to explore an imagined version of the world around us. My 3 1/2 year old son has loved this book for two years and hasn't stopped requesting it, even though we own many many quality books. Okay, maybe it helps that he is obsessed with cars, trucks, and things that go to begin with. Well done, Richard Scarry!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was my husband's favorite book from his childhood; since his copy was very worn, I bought a new copy for him to share with our son.My son loves the book--he reaches for it and picks it up, and when we're reading to him he grabs for all the pictures; he's very interested!I've never been the world's biggest Richard Scarry fan, but this book is way better than I thought it would be, too--it's so funny. I love the frightened parking meter and other funny details, and finding Goldbug on each set of pages can be quite challenging.Cars and Trucks and Things That Go is an entertaining book that can hold the whole family's attention!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"When I was a little kid, this was my favorite book. Between myself and my brother, we read our first copy so much we wore it out and had to buy another one. If I ever have a son, this is the first book I'll buy him (and a daughter will probably like it too!)."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I grew up with Richard Scarry books, including the now out-of-print \\"Busy Busy World.\\" For some reason I had forgotten what a gem this is. Any child will delight in it, and for parents it is so nice to have a book that can be different every time you read it, as most of our books are read over, and over, and over."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book is great. Kids like the stories and pictures, but best of all they like finding goldbug on each page. Everytime I read it, I find something I missed. I recommend this for kids of all ages."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My daughter and I had years of enjoyment with this book, from pencil cars to 3-seat pickle cars, to transportation using everything imaginable. The search for Mr. Goldbug on every page just increased the fun, and I never figured out how she managed to remember every location when I had to search every time we read the book. Now, my granddaughter and I are giggling with our heads together in the same way. A wonderful picture book for pre-schoolers, and a good reading practice book for grade-schoolers. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I recently purchased this book for my 2 year old and she loves it as much as I remember loving it when I was a child. I am a huge Richard Scarry fan because of the colorful detailed illustrations, I had a huge collection of them when I was a child. Cars and Trucks and Things That Go was one of the books that disappeared and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon so that I could share it with my daughter.

I highly recommend this for young children."},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"My brother loved this book years ago and now both my son and daughter love it(ages 3 1/2 and 1 1/2). They search for Goldbug and the \\"Worm\\" and can locate them immediatley on each page. This book has helped my kids learn colors, similarities, size, shapes, and entertained them at the same time. Sometimes we read the main story and sometimes we just pick our favorite car or truck. Many of the Richard Scarry books are wonderful and entertaining. They are worth every penny! :)The kids are now 4 and 2 and still loving this book!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This book has become a classic in our family. My children loved it thirty years ago until the book fell apart and now I buy it for my grandchildren. The illustrations are so wonderfully creative and accurate even one year olds learn to tell the difference between one type of vehicle and another.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"I have just purchased my SECOND copy of this book. My 22 month son loves it so much that it has been through the ringer in the past months, with his favorite pages ripped out because of over use! I had it when I was little, and it brings back great memories. But, I never expected the reaction that he would have to this book! It is perfect for any who loves PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES!!

Richard Scarry is the best!"},{"Title":"CARS AND TRUCKS AND THINGS THAT GO","review":"This was the first book my son received in 1992. I started reading it to him before he was 1 years old.

I first bought it back in the early 80s when my children were younger. They would spend hours looking for \\"Goldbuggie\\" until they had his placement on the pages memorized.

It is such a great \\"boy\\" book and has tons and tons of great trucks, tractors, military vehicles, snow vehicles, make-believe vehicles (like a pickle car!) and the like. The story is quite cute as well, as it chronicles the family's looong and ridiculous journey to the beach for a picnic and then back home again. It is is actually quite long if you read the whole thing in one sitting. My kids LOVE finding Goldbug on each page and think maniac bug is hilarious.

(Numbered))","review":"i love this series. this isn't the manga, it american so its bigger, but it has more pages, and more story in them i love these books."},{"Title":"Oh My Goddess! Volume 19 (& 20): Sora Unchained (Oh My Goddess! (Numbered))","review":"This is kind of an odd entry in the series. Instead of focusing on Keiichi or the goddesses, the focal character is a small, shy, four-eyed young lady named Sora, who in a rather complicated setup must race Keiichi, based on rules set by his boss, Chihiro, to decide who becomes president of the motor club. Chihiro (who in my opinion is the prettiest of all the pretty ladies in this manga, so that's a point in this volume's favor) skews the rules vigorously in Sora's favor, to the point where Belldandy is obliged to help Sora rather than her usual role helping Keiichi.Sora needs some confidence built, and of course Belldandy is the one to do it. That's much of the preliminary to the race. The race itself is a bizarre cross-campus jaunt among three checkpoints using any available route. Again, this is geared to Sora as she knows all the short cuts from her experience as a messenger girl. These short cuts end up being bizarre at times, with one through a women's locker room with a dire warning notice on the door. Keiichi needs some encouragement at this point, and it's Urd's turn to provide it, in her own distinctive way.The whole is more of a morality tale, as Sora finds her confidence, and the other club members become a team working to support her.A concluding note announces that future installments in the series will convert to a more traditional manga approach, with a right-to-left reading order and a direct correspondence with the contents of the equivalent Japanese volumes with the same number (which is why this volume has the two numbers even though it's not that much bigger than the usual installment)."},{"Title":"Oh My Goddess! Volume 19 (& 20): Sora Unchained (Oh My Goddess! (Numbered))","review":"The oddly numbered volume 19/20 of DH's \\"Oh, My Goddess\\" manga only seems to feature its main character Keiichi Morisato as a supporting player.This isn't necessarily a bad thing as, instead, it allows for characters who don't normally get any serious development to shine. In this case, that means the often overlooked Sora and the Nekomi Tech Motor Club (who are often just there to add to the body count and do manual labor).Since K1 has moved on to the working world, someone has to take over as the Motor Club's president. K1 picks Sora, much to her dismay. Unfortunately for her, she can't refuse without first beating Keiichi in a race. And, thusly, we have a plot for a story arc. The book ends with a lovely little story of sisterly competition between Urd and Skuld for rights to the only color television in the Shrine. Antics ensue, and laughs are out there to be had.More racing fun and auto tips in this volume, that's for sure. Mostly, though, the story revolves around the various people in Sora's life allowing her to regain her confidence and shine.A decent book, to be sure, but I'm rather mixed about the note DH left in the back of the book concerning subsequent volumes and reissues. One of the last Americanized manga left (reads left-to-right), \\"Oh, My Goddess\\" is finally being changed to the now standard right-to-left format of printing. This will be reflected in all volumes to come and (apparently) in all reprints of the old set.*sigh* More books to buy.You may think that's a funny statement, but since the order in which the manga first appeared was altered when it came to the states, it means that older fans who have all of the original volumes will have to shell out yet more cash if there is anything restored in the new reissues."},{"Title":"Buddha and Buddhism (Overlook spiritual masters series)","review":"There are many introductory works that survey Buddhist beliefs and history, just like this one (and I've reviewed a number of them), so content-wise this one is not unique. Its explanations are concise and aimed clearly at the general reader, which will make some of it seem a bit simplistic to a more knowledgeable person. What makes it stand out, however, is that, of all the introductions, this one makes one of the nicest to give as a gift to someone curious about your own interest in Buddhism. The text is not over-whelming and is broken up by nearly seventy black and white illustrations of Buddhist art and life, making it a non-threatening read. While it may not be the best introduction, it may be one of the better for other practical needs."},{"Title":"Buddha and Buddhism (Overlook spiritual masters series)","review":"At the time this book was first published in France in 1956, Maurice Percheron had \\"lived for more than a decade in the Far East, traveling extensively. He is also the author of 'Genghis Khan.'\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"It was not the common herd that Buddha sought to enlighten.

The copy I received was as advertised (used and aged) and arrived quickly. The information in the book gave me a lot of insight into the terms and phrasing my bosses use in my performance reviews.

In the previous volume, Jani has solved the mystery of Le Blond, the point man for a semi-legitimate trade association and the man trying to smear the reputation of both Jani and Tsecha. Ceel, the Oligarch of the Vynsharau, and his suborn Shai have managed to ease Tsecha out of his positions as ambassador and Propitiator, but Tsecha regains most of his status as Intercessor for the Haarin; moreover, now he doesn't have to attend any more boring meetings, can sit in comfortable chairs and doesn't have to wear boring clothes. Furthermore, he and Jani have forced Shai to allow the Haarin to sell a much needed water filter to the Elyans.In this novel, a year later, Jani, Niall and Tsecha are observers for a mine removal operation on the grounds of the Haarin enclave at Chicago. Something goes wrong and the mine explodes, killing a Terran bomb disposal tech and an idomeni security suborn and injuring Lieutenant Pullman. Jani is suspicious of the official explanations for this incident; since she is leaving for the Outer Circle on business for Tsecha, she asks Lucien to join the investigation team to uncover the true situation.Jani travels to Elyas in a Neoclona ship with John Shroud and Niall. There she is kidnapped and transported to a Haarin colony, where she finds hybrids much like herself. Soon she is in the middle of a political conflict in the Haarin community between the established dominant and a hybrid challenger.Back on Earth, Lucien singles out Faber, a comtech who had been on the bomb site in the bunker with Jani and who has been acting strangely since the incident. Lucien has Faber followed and keeps showing up in the comtech's life. Among other things, he notices that Faber is checking out the specs of the latest model military exoskeleton armor.This novel is an investigative procedural on Earth and a character study on Elyas, with various side stories. Although the author tells part of the story from the viewpoint of Faber, she is able to maintain the suspense up until the final climax. You probably will not want to put the book down until the story is done.In this story, Jani starts taking on some of the responsibilities of Tsecha's suborn. She acts as more that Tsecha's Eyes and Ears on Elyas, stabilizing the hybrid challenge in a very priestly manner and then gathering a cadre to keep the situation under control after she returns to Earth. While the immediate problems are resolved, this story ends with the promise of more excitement to follow.Highly recommended for Smith fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of suspense and intrigue, with a touch of romance, in a SF setting.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Contact Imminent","review":"This tale, the fourth in the Jani Kilian series, has a kick to it. Kristine Smith, smart and sophisticated (she throws in quotes from John Donne) has been a great writer since her debut novel, &quot;Code of Conduct,&quot; and she's improved each time out. In &quot;Contact Imminent,&quot; she's conquered her one weakness--plotting. In the past I got the feeling sometimes Ms. Smith confused even herself, but not this time. Things just hum along (the climax is a masterpiece of cross-cutting action that's positively cinematic) as Jani, the hybrid human-idomeni, is sent on an intricate mission, in the course of which she finds a club that would want to have her as a member--and it's one she actually wishes to join, too.The members of her mob are all back--the Shakespeare-quoting Naill, the semi-smarmy Lucien, her doctor chum John who hybridized her in order to save her life, the crafty idomeni leader Tsecha. They're always true to Jani in their fashion--for the most part anyhow, as for the most part they all have their own agendas.And then Ms. Smith introduces a new character, the terrorist Micah Faber; and through his character she speculates on the idea of virtual reality via hypnosis: a fascinating concept.As with the previous novels this one is complete in itself. There are no cliffhanger endings. It's clear Ms. Smith has plans for more books in the series, but they'll come at her own pace. At the back of the paperback edition you will not find a preview first chapter of the next book in the series, which in some sense is a blessing although you'll probably grab the next one as soon as it appears.Notes and asides: Naill refers to MacBeth as &quot;The Scottish Play&quot; because actors consider it to be bad luck to speak the play's true name. One would suppose that Ms. Smith has made Chicago the capital of her &quot;Commonwealth&quot; because she lives in Northern Illinois, as her biography makes perfectly clear."},{"Title":"Contact Imminent","review":"I'll admit to being a bit disappointed in the latest installment of this series. The first couple of books were action packed, but the pace seems to have slowed in this book. The stakes for Jani aren't quite as high, and for much of the book she seems to be reacting to situations rather than trying to take charge.That's not to say that I didn't like it. Smith has created a fascinating and believable alien culture, and the conflicts as the idomeni and humans interact are very well drawn. There are characters that you care about, and an interesting evolution in Jani's personal life.On its own merits it's a good read, even if it isn't quite up to her earlier novels."},{"Title":"Contact Imminent","review":"I have found in the science fiction I have read very few books about the contacts between mankind and different species worthwhile. The one I have liked best so far is Westerfeld's 'Fine Prey', without any doubt related to the fact that I love language above many other things. Kristine Smith's four part tale of Jani, the hybrid, the priest, the lover, the woman and her men is of a different order. It's compelling, it's a great read and a tremendous effort to put the books down. It's fascinating, the war-like description of the meeting of two species through the eyes of an outcast, a borderline case. And the distance Kristine makes her characters travel is significant and most certainly worth it. The one thing that I find makes Kristine's writing different from 'Fine Prey', as well as from Lyda Morehouse's most brilliant approach to different-ness, is the roughness in the telling, the edges in the flow and the occassional jumpiness of the perspective. If you start, start with the beginning: code of conduct. Kristine finds difference-ness in the most violent of humanish: the military. It's worth the exploration!"},{"Title":"Contact Imminent","review":"Jani is the first genetically-engineered human-idomeni hybrid. Humans and idomeni do not have idyllic relations and Jani is not completely trusted on either side. She does serve as a bridge for communications. Contact Imminent begins with an attempted mine disposal on the grounds of the idomeni enclave near Chicago. The deaths resulting from the explosion of the mine increase the tension between the two races. Xenophobic zealots on both sides are plotting death and destruction.Tsecha, Jani's idomeni dominant, asks her to travel to the planet Elyas in his place, to try to stave off civil war among the idomeni. She travels with Niall Pierce, a Service officer, and John Shroud, the doctor who saved her life by making her a hybrid. Before they leave, they discover the possibility that there might be another hybrid on Elyas. Upon arrival, Jani is thrust into the middle of the leadership crisis and the related existance of an entire enclave of hybrids. Jani must remain independent of the two factions and act quickly to keep peace among the idomeni.In the meantime, Jani's friend Lucien remains on Earth to investigate the mine explosion. In the process, he finds a human plot to attack the embassy in order to drive the idomeni out of human space. While trying to warn the embassy about the attack, he is challenged to a duel by the hostile idomeni Ghos. Jani and Niall have to race back to Earth, hopefully in time for the duel and the attack.Author Kristine Smith does and excellent job presenting a complex and well-realized alien culture, complete with religion and politics. Jani is a very strong character who is strugging with her identity as a hybrid. Smith gives us a good view of Jani's internal turmoil as she deals with her human and idomeni relationships. The supporting cast is fairly well developed, although without reading the previous novels, their motivations aren't always clear.Contact Imminent is the fourth novel in the Jani Kilian series. It can be read stand-alone, but the start can seem a little slow as you figure out the backstory from clues. Once you get settled in and comfortable with the setting, the story takes off and it's hard to put down."},{"Title":"Contact Imminent","review":"It is such a large universe that the sentient races should co-exist peacefully but that is not the case. Although humans and idomeni have enclaves on each other's home worlds there is little trust between the races and much fear. Jani Killian is, thanks to a medical practitioner that saved her life, a hybrid, part humanoid and part idomeni. She has one foot in each world but the humans fear her for what she has become and what it could mean to the human race.Even though it is treason, zealots, who hate the Idomeni and want them to leave human space, are using violent means to start a war. Some factions of the Idomeni want to use Jan to further their own agenda but the hybrid is a strong-willed independent thinker who will use whatever means at her disposal to make certain that there will be peace between the two races.Kristine Smith knows how to tell a fascinating story about two races in conflict with each other because each is xenophobic. The heroine is a master of diplomacy who wants the best for two races and favors neither when it involves xenophobic plots and politics. The culture of the Idomeni is complex and alien but not dangerous to humans unless they provoke them. CONTACT IMMINENT is a stellar example of excellent space opera.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Contact Imminent","review":"I love this series, the characters, and the world that Kristine Smith has created.

This man has one of the finest musical minds in American popular music history. When I saw that this piano collection of his work was available and that it is arranged with his chord changes and special harmonic colors, I couldn't wait to buy it, play it, and learn from it! His songs, particularly &quot;Emily&quot; and &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot; are classics, but arranged with his chord changes and colors is simply for me, the ultimate learning tool. I love to play these songs yes, but I really enjoy learning and piecing together music that really comes across as harmonically breathtaking to me. I may seem a bit over dramatic in my opinion of his work, but I find it no coincidence that Johnny Mandel is considered the best in his field by heavyweights in the recording industry."},{"Title":"Greek Coffin Mystery - Collection Of Mystery Classics","review":"The Ellery Queen stories will remain among the most remarkable American classic mysteries ever written. And this superbly constructed story, The Greek Coffin Mystery, is among the best of Ellery Queen.Ellery Queen first appeared in June, 1929 in The Roman Hat Mystery, followed by The French Powder Mystery (1931), and The Dutch Shoe Mystery (1932). The plot in the fourth story, The Greek Coffin Mystery (1932), actually pre-dates The Roman Hat Mystery and reveals a younger, less-experienced Ellery Queen. We readers see an overly confident Ellery Queen stumble in his deductions and are led through not one, but a several flawed solutions.Not only is this \\"younger and cockier\\" Ellery Queen misled and chastised, but it will be a rare reader indeed that does not likewise become ensnared in faulty deductions and erroneous conclusions. Ellery Queen regains any lost prestige in his final, remarkable deductions that lead unerringly to the actual solution.The New York City setting is an old, drooping brownstone at 11 East Fifty-Fourth Street. Adjacent to the Georg Khalkis residence is one of the oldest private cemeteries in the city. Georg Khalkis had died, apparently of heart failure. His burial is in an old brick-lined subterranean crypt.I am hesitant to say anything more about the plot itself for fear that I might unwittingly say too much. Just be prepared to be surprised.The reader acquainted with Ellery may notice that his penchant for quoting literature (and thereby exercising his ivy league education) is more marked in The Greek Coffin Mystery than in his later stories. We encounter literary and philosophical observations in English, French, German and Latin. Ellery is even able to roughly translate a note in modern Greek from his knowledge of the classical Greek language. Who but Ellery Queen would quote Byron, Goethe, Terence, La Fontaine, Chaucer, Rousseau, and Schopenhauer while solving a muder?Like Nero Wolfe, another famous master of deduction, Ellery also enjoys an occasional vocabulary excess, treating the reader to expressions like \`eremitic in its furnishings', \`caparisoning his cousin', \`greatest animus', and \`the charming amanuensis'.The Greek Coffin Mystery is classic Ellery Queen. The plot is intriguing, the characters are memorable, and Ellery Queen's exercise in deduction is simply dazzling. The Greek Coffin Mystery is no longer in print, but used copies, especially in paperback, are still available. Make the effort to find a copy. This is definitely a five star Ellery Queen masterpiece."},{"Title":"Greek Coffin Mystery - Collection Of Mystery Classics","review":"This is one of the first Ellery Queen's books that I read. Before I used to read books by 'Agatha Christie'. Being introduced to EQ character and his method of deduction for the first time had me hungry for more. As with the other reviews regarding this book I agree with them totally. The grand finale is mind boggleling."},{"Title":"Greek Coffin Mystery - Collection Of Mystery Classics","review":"Not even Agatha Christie in her prime could construct a detective story plot of this complexity, with so many delicious twists and turns. Ellery Queen investigates the murder of a man who was found mysteriously buried in another man's coffin. There are many suspects, and as the story progresses the plot just gets more and more complex (for most mysteries it's the reverse).What's notable about THE GREEK COFFIN MYSTERY is the number of solutions. There are no less than four solutions to the mystery, but only one of them--the last one--is the true one. The final solution comes as a genuine shock--when I found out who the murderer was, I was momentarily tempted to throw down the book in disbelief. But Ellery Queen's careful deductive processes show that only (blank) could possibly have committed the crimes. This is an absolute tour de force, a must-read for mystery readers like myself who have, until this point, lived under the illusion that only English writers can construct ingenious plots. Ellery Queen has more than proven that the quality can be an American one as well."},{"Title":"Greek Coffin Mystery - Collection Of Mystery Classics","review":"I have read al lot of detective stories, but I have never found one with a more complex plot than this one.

One of their earliest mysteries, published in 1932, this book has a difficult puzzle to perturb problem-solving mystery fans and a more human detective than the thinking machine with which they started. Remember this was still the heyday of best selling Philo Vance detective stories which were the model for successful detecting until the tough guy series came to the fore. The story starts simply enough, the wealthy owner of an art gallery has died of natural causes, arousing no perplexing problems but the search for a new will has proven fruitless. In the search for that will another body is found, this one surely the product of murder. The puzzler has mystery, a bit of romance, many interesting characters and a less than infallible amateur detective who tags along with his eminent police inspector father. The co-authors write well, create memorable characters, spin many a web of puzzlement. While denser in style than their later works, this one is still an easy read, captures ones imagination, and involves one with its people. Still a first rate example of its genre."},{"Title":"Greek Coffin Mystery - Collection Of Mystery Classics","review":"It is my habit to read a \\"mystery\\" series from first published to last.

There is no book that suits all. Recently I needed to know something about moment generating functions. With all my advanced engineering background though, I find it difficult to get into probability.So I bought the following supposedly introductory texts: Ross, DeGroot, Stirzaker, Bersekas & Tsitsiklis. To me, Ross seems like a review lesson to cram for finals; it's choke full of examples but fairly spare in exposition. DeGroot is the opposite, long on descriptions but short on examples; by the time it finishes describing the problem, you have forgotten how to solve it. Probability is set up more as a prelude to statistics in the second half of the book. Stirzaker calls his book \\"elementary\\" the way Sherlock Holmes dismissed a case after slogging all night through the English bogs. It is more for the well-drilled boys from elite British \\"public\\" (private actually) schools. Bersekas comes closest to what I look for in a text, straightforward in prose with a judicious selection of examples to explain theory.For beginners, the best approach I found, in the end, was to go the local community college and buy the text used for Finite Math. Usually, there are 3 to 4 chapters that introduce probability.Such a text is aimed an audience from wider academic and language backgrounds, as community colleges are mandated to do. Therefore, probability is taught in simple, plain-spoken language crafted through multiple editions. One such is Finite Math, by Karl J. Smith; however, many others like it will do. For self-study, one might start in the chapter on probability to understand the author's approach, then go back a chapter or two to pick up the permutation and combinatorial math needed to calculate probability. Another alternative is just to enroll in a Finite Math course at a community college. Generally, such a course stops at Markov's chain which is enough to get you jump started in probability.In any case, a good Finite Math text gives plenty of examples with clear, succinct, and layman-like explanation to help you tackle Ross' book or supplement any other at a higher level. If you plan to apply probability to your work, then shop around for another text after you get the basics. The thicker tomes delve more into theory which is good because real life problems are seldom like the examples given. However you can't go wrong by planting your feet solidly on a good Finite Math text first."},{"Title":"Introduction to Probability","review":"The visual aides of the book greatly increases the understanding of the subject.

The book is intended for advanced undergraduate and/or beginning graduate students. While many introductory probability texts are dominated by superficial case studies (which in my opinion convey a false sense of confidence about the subject), \\"Introduction to Probability\\" promotes deep understanding through clear mathematical writing and thought-provoking examples.Testimonial: I recently adopted \\"Introduction to Probability\\" as the text for a first-year, masters of engineering course on stochastic systems, and it was a great experience. In working with the book, I found that the authors' thoughtful approach really helps to solidify the students' understanding of basic concepts. For example, the text's approach to conditional probability, particularly with its emphasis on sample-space, is so clear that several students (even the TA) came to me afterward saying that, prior to reading the book, they never had a clear understanding of what the formulas actually mean. From an instructor's perspective, \\"Introduction to Probability\\" is easy to use. It is accessible to students with diverse backgrounds, and it is also well-balanced, with lots of intuitive/motivating discussion in the main body of each chapter and advanced concepts in extended end-of-the chapter problems. The authors support the text by making available a large amount of supplementary material on the web, including supplementary exercises (suitable for homework or exams) and lecture notes from their introductory probability course at MIT. I highly recommend \\"Introduction to Probability\\" to anyone preparing to teach an introductory course on stochastic systems, probability, and stochastic processes."},{"Title":"Introduction to Probability","review":"I am a university student taking a probability course and found this book to be invaluable.The book actually assigned to our class was Sheldon Ross' A First Course in Probability. I found Ross' book unreadable so I began looking for another text in order to help myself pass the class.After reading numerous reviews I decided on an Introduction to Probability. The book is well written and easy to understand. The main points are highlighted and made extremely obvious. In addition they are backed by step by step easy to understand examples. Another feature I found very helpful was the use of graphical examples to reinforce the points being made.In short I would recommend this book highly to anyone looking for an introduction to probability.Update: I finished my probability course in May with an A. I completely stopped using Ross' book around the time of this review. This book was by far the most useful tool I had. I strongly back my original recommendation. I will be graduating this fall, and this book has turned out to be one of the best mathematic books I have encountered thus far.I say this for the following reasons. First, the layout of the book, and the order it presented material is very intuitive and helpful. Second is how well the book reads. My experience with quite a few mathematics books has been the following. The math books are written by mathematicians. While being a mathematician may qualify you to teach a subject, it does not generally translate into an ability to put your ideas into written form. The result is a book that is not read by the students, but instead only consulted when all other methods of information retrieval fail. Introduction to Probability does not share this fate. The writing style of the book is very straight forward and easy to understand. While this may sound redundant, I personally think this is one of the best reasons to buy this book."},{"Title":"Introduction to Probability","review":"Probabilities are a powerful way of understanding the world and doing science. Trouble is, understanding probabilities is not easy: it takes math, insight, and a fresh way of thinking. Worse, the stuff is so useful in so many contexts that its expositions are often obscured by the intended applications.I recently found myself looking at several probability books to give a recommendation to a friend. This book (by two well-known MIT professors of Electrical Engineering) is a wonderful treatment in terms of its style (simple informal explanations, motivating discussions, frequent notes of a historical/philosophical nature); its selection of topics (the basics, mainly, usually from the most useful perspective); its rigor and accuracy; its reasonable brevity; its rather conventional point of view (contrast it, for example, with the very interesting recent book by E.

The book's quality would have been improved if the author/publisher had engaged the services of a proof reader and editor. Some of the word usage is just wrong, and commas are scattered about more or less randomly in the text.

You won't find proofs of everything, but you will find excellent guidance and intuition through the various topics, especially the fundamentals. The only significant complaint I have is that certain topics are covered too briefly (such as the central limit theorem or stochastic processes) or not at all (e.g. null hypothesis significance testing).Much of this will be rememedied in a second edition, which will include a welcome added chapter on estimation. We used a preliminary version of the chapter in the probability class for which the book was written, and it's fantastic. It was the most interesting part of the book, and I'm sorry that I didn't wait to buy the book when I could have gotten the final version.I hope the second edition also fleshes out the chapter on Markov chains, which are presented very tersely, and without the benefit of linear algebra. Studying Markov chains without using linear algebra is like studying differential equations without the Laplace transform; you can do it but it's a heck of a lot harder than it has to be.In the end, the terse coverage of certain topics is more than made up for by the fine handling of the basics, and I unreservedly recommend the book for anybody studying the topic for the first time, and even as a refresher for those who have."},{"Title":"Introduction to Probability","review":"This is an excellent introductory guide to anyone interested in probability.

Instead, this work overturns the conventional 'wisdom' of politicians and media and asks and answers a series of questions which will become increasingly vital in C21 USA. If you've ever laughed at the idea that money doesn't buy happiness, here is the proof that it really doesn't. SimonF"},{"Title":"Spoiled Rotten","review":"Goff and Fleischer have put succinctly into words an answer to the question, &quot;What's wrong with America?&quot; In the midst of prosperity and plenty for virtually all Americans, why does it appear that contemporary society is falling apart? Why are there Columbine High Schools and other, equally horrific, events occurring with frightening regularity? On a daily level we see shattered families, young girls raising babies and other disturbing events. The authors argue, persuasively, that it is primarily because we are so prosperous that we are having these ills. One reviewer missed the point entirely-in America, unlike the rest of the world all he has to worry about is getting an apartment, doubtless wonderfully made, fully equipped with all the conveniences and a huge number of true luxuries-cable tv, dvd players, etc. He drives to work in an air conditioned car and works in a pleasant environment. Hello! In this book, they make the point that even the &quot;poverty level&quot; family in America has access to things that are only a dream to the rest of the world. We do not work and slave just to get a mouthful of food for our family, use an open air latrine and sleep in a hovel. This is not about Gen X bashing, it's about the fact that we are spoiled and don't even know it. The great question is-what will we do about it? Get this book."},{"Title":"Spoiled Rotten","review":"I'm getting tired of contemporary young Americans (I'm 29)being bashed constantly and portrayed as these evil losers. Anyone who came after the &quot;Baby Boomer&quot; generation (modern teens, college students and young adults) are often the objects of irrational hate. Anything our generation does wrong is hyped in the media and in preachy books like this one; even though statistics show that crime has been rapidly *decreasing* ever since Generation X came of age. We drink more espresso than liquor for goodness sake; and most drugs are pretty much out of style as far as long term use is concerned. A pretty tame bunch compared to the old hippie crowd. And the idea of today's young Americans as rich and spoiled is truly absurd. I have to wonder what planet the author is living on! No generation has worked so hard for so little. This is a time period when getting a nice little apartment for yourself is more like a far out fantasy than a realistic goal. Work hard and live paycheck to paycheck--then come home to your dingy little hole in the wall to listen to the media elite talk about how spoiled and weak you are and blame you for the Columbine massacre just because you own a few black clothes!"},{"Title":"Real Men Don't Apologize","review":"I really enjoyed Phillip Roth's \\"The Plot Against America\\", but felt it feel apart in the last third.

Perhaps this book was written in his \\"According to Jim\\" character (or a combination of both).

Probably not. Do you need a degree to write a good book about relationships. Probably not. But you need to have a brain and some sense which Belushi lacks. I guess this book could help some people if your mission is to get laid as much as possible and then when you're 35 finally get married. In fact, Jim's obsession with 'getting laid' is an annoyance in the book since about half of his sentences end with \\"and you'll get laid tonight\\" or some variant.Not much in this book that you couldn't glean from an episode of a sit-com any night of the week - Your life should revolve centrally around having sex as much as possible; Getting hitched is a good way to have consistent sex so good for you.Virtue and ethics are not words in Belushi's vocabulary.Belushi thinks he has learned a lot from two failed marriages and after reading this book I have doubts that his third will be much better.One indicator that there are no pearls of wisdom in this book is the price people are trying to get rid of this book ( see used prices).This is one for the trash."},{"Title":"Real Men Don't Apologize","review":"I have to say I'm very surprised by this book. I bought it after seeing him interviewed about it on TV. I have never watched his show, and I don't think I've seen any of his movies, except maybe Red Heat. But this book is really hysterical. I laughed outloud several times. It's not highbrow humor or anything...far from it. It just has lots of humorous ways of looking at life, from a \\"guy's guy\\" point of view.

Look for the \\"Glurk!\\""},{"Title":"Real Men Don't Apologize","review":"Jimmy and I knew each other pretty well in Chicago back in the mid to late 80's. We became friends went to the same parties and hung in the same circles. I've always respected him as an artist and as a person - until now.Let me start with the time before I even read this book. I really thought that Jim had more class than to bash single mothers during his book junket. When I heard him reply to a question about his ex-wife with, \\"That's why women shouldn't raise boys. They teach them to never hurt women\\", my jaw dropped to the floor! I know that he wasn't referring to physically abusing women - at least I hope he wasn't. I'm sure that he was just stating that men need to be fearless when it comes to leaving relationships. Men need to get out of relationships that will hurt them, even if it means hurting the woman's feelings. Do I have it right???The problem is that he blurted out this ridiculous and poorly thought-out statement, in order to appear strong and in control. Unfortunately, he came across as angry and bitter. He then said that women don't know how to raise boys to take care of themselves and remain strong in relationships - of course, he couldn't be more wrong! I am a single mother raising my boy to respect women, to love women, but to drop one like a bad habit if she's not the right one. I'm also teaching him to do that firmly, but with RESPECT! I guarantee you that I can teach my son more about respect, strength and women than Jim Belushi could any day of the week. And I could do it while teaching him to be a REAL man.I decided to give this book a chance and see if I'm mistaken about all of this. Unfortunately, I'm not mistaken at all. This book is all about flexing his muscles as a damaged man and making sure that he's the one in control of his relationships for this moment forward. That's about as realistic as world peace. Although there were a few tender moments when he talked about his brother John and his love and respect for him, it doesn't make this any better. He comes across as bitter, emotionally injured and in need of some therapy.I've known Jimmy for a long time and he has now shown me a side of him that I can't respect. He has a lot to learn about women and raising kids before he puts it on a shelf in a bookstore. I'm afraid of the men that are going to read this book and how they'll treat women afterward. My son and everyone I know have already been warned to stay away from it."},{"Title":"Real Men Don't Apologize","review":"The book I got was great! Just what I wanted. I got it in a timely manner also."},{"Title":"Real Men Don't Apologize","review":"Let me begin by saying that I've been a regular fan of Jim Belushi's since I saw him in 2000's RETURN TO ME (he steals the show in the scene where he takes off his shirt to flex his somewhat flabby pecs and his now famous Buddha-belly dance for Bonnie Hunt and Minnie Driver) and I keep up with his ABC series ACCORDING TO JIM; and I've seen a handful of his other films (most notably the poignant and family-oriented K-9 and also the completely forgettable sexual thriller TRACES OF RED; a sidenote: for someone who enjoys taking off his shirt and showing off his \\"body\\" he was pretty chicken to not do a simulated nude scene, one where he was at least nude from the waist up; but either way don't even bother with that one; rent K-9 or even MR. DESTINY).That said, Belushi really makes a nose-dive with his recent attempt at writing a self-help book that really just makes him out to be a chauvanistic, self-important pig from hell. I really only enjoyed a small handful of passages in this book therefore making the rest of it an overbearing task to read. Usually if I enjoy a good book I can't put it down and finish it within a week or two. It took over 6 weeks to finsih this one, mostly because I found other books that were better and then I returned to finishing this one and it was completely anti-climactic.I'm realy sorry Jim, I know you did this just for the easy cash, but you don't have what it takes to make it as a humorist writer... you're too macho, too insensitive and way too cynical (something I've always found repellant in people).

When I called him he told me to take him to court - which I did. He brought in an expert witness that never even seen the vehicle and lied to the judge who was mechanically clueless. That's being a real man!I had the expert witness fired for his testimony so that was more than enough satisfaction for me.When I flew out to LA to go to court I ran into a film production executive who told me that Belushi is largely regarded as a jerk in Hollywood. I couldn't agree more with him.He can't even give these books away never mind try to sell them - in fact he did try to give them away to his stunned staff on Martha's Vineyard as a gift for working for him all summer last year!!!Anyway, that's just a little insight about Belushi's true character from my experience in dealing with him."},{"Title":"Real Men Don't Apologize","review":"I can hardly begin to explain how bad this book is.

I was intersted in reading this because he is so funny - even though this is obviously dedicated to men. It's not an advice book though - it's insightful and surprisingly so. While there is advice in there, it's main goal was to be a funny read. This is his comical take on life and love. He does get serious through a portion of it - he goes on to talk about his brother dying and trying to make it as an actor too.He loves relationship expert Justin Sterlings concept of three types of men; the Curly, the Ghandi and the Clint. Curly (of The Three Stoges fame) for humour, Ghandi for compassion and Clint for strength. I guess Jim is the Curly mainly.He strongly wants guys to read this, but not women so much because he'll let out too many mens secrets.This really is a good read.

I had some qualms, some issues with references I didn't follow, some advice I'd disagree with.But on balance, a very respectable entry into the world of coaching for men.One of the entries I liked most about his book was a passage on boundaries.Having rececently completed my relationship coaching certification, the topic of identifying and sticking to your relationship requirements was of great interest to me.Belushi puts this concept into his own terms - first in terms of the caveman, and the three personas a man should embrace - the Clint (Eastwood, strength), the Ghandi (spiritual sensitivity) and the Curly (Howard, humor). Those examples worked.\\"Then our caveman friend bared his teeth and smacked his ass to let his woman know he was unwavering, an early Clint.Oh sure, she was upset. But she realized her caveman was right...And even though she was mad, she respected our caveman's strength for standing his ground. He set boundaries. He established rules for the relationship.\\"He goes on to write about how those boundaries will be put to the test in a relationship:\\"So in order to make sure their men are strong, women need to test us. And if your want your relationship to work, you have to pass the test.It starts with little things...Ask yourself: Does it compromise my agreements with myself, my terms? Does what she asks me to compromise me as a man?...The longer you are in a relationship, however the tougher the tests become.\\"And there you have it.Tests are part of a relationship, the only thing you can do is determine which battles are worth fighting, which parts of your life are worth a sit down.(That's mob talk for 'working things out.' :)- Razr"},{"Title":"Real Men Don't Apologize","review":"Many years ago, there was a book (and an audio presentation) called Real Men Don't Eat Quiche.

The advice Belushi gives in sound MACHO advice for today's males over the age of 35. It makes sense for Today's manThe humor in this production is so true to life and the advice makes sense. His reading of his book is good, better than most celebrity narrators...which is above the rest.

Belushi does an excellent job of blending a lot of useful advice on what it takes to be a man with his own life stories to validate his opinions, along with plenty of humor to keep pretty much any reader entertained from cover to cover.From definining your \\"terms\\" to the explanation of the \\"Glurk\\", Belushi pretty much hits the nail on the head as far as explaining some keys to the guy's guy way to handle women, friends, low times, and life in general.I would recommend this book to any man of any age, and have already loaned mine out to a number of my cheapskate buddies who claim they don't know where the nearest Waldenbooks is. If you're a man and you read this book and don't pick up any new advice and think you already knew all of this, then in Belushi's words, where's YOUR book?For the women who read it, I hope you get some enjoyment out of it, but please remember this is written by a man for men, and let us men review this book, amongst ourselves, in peace - the stuff in this book means a heck of a lot more to us than it ever will to you."},{"Title":"Real Men Don't Apologize","review":"Every woman should buy this book... and every man should read it.

It was a great experience, the book itself and meeting Mr.Belushi right after reading his book!"},{"Title":"Real Men Don't Apologize","review":"I was not too kind to a woman's advice book I reviewed on Amazon awhile back, so I need to say, what justifies this book getting four stars is you know Jim Belushi is trying to be humorous first and (occasionally) insightful second. He gets a good chuckle on every other page, and a few times per chapter he gets a good belly laugh, so I'd call the book a success on that account. If you're a card-carrying member of NOW, you already know not to read this book unless its to blast it in a review. Please do, it will generate lots of free publicity for Jimmy. This is typical guy-talk on the surface, the stuff that can make a \\"modern\\" woman's skin crawl. However, at the end of his rants and raves, you find a pretty dependable, decent guy that will stand behind what he believes and the people in his life, and that's what counts in the end.Jim gives the type of advice you'd hear from guys in a South Side bar on Friday night. Now he pretties it up a bit being all Hollywood, but unless you've got a strong daddy or uncles left in your family, a lot of guys don't get this kind of wise talk on a regular basis. I do agree with Jim, modern society has rewritten the \\"rules\\" to suit the collective whims of women, and this isn't necessarily in either society's best interests, your best interests as an individual male, OR women's best long-term interests either. One of his truisms, is that men need to have a support network of guys they can trust. So true. One of the reasons women have become so much more powerful the past 30 years is their endless networking amongst themselves. Don't ever underestimate the importance of social support from friends and peers. The inner Clint is important, but only in the movies does Clint take on a whole gang of thugs by himself and come out alive. There are other insights, but I forgot them now. Read the book.At other points, Jim sounds like he's really onto something, or he's going to tackle a touchy subject, but then it seems to slip away. Ahh, Jimmy, the world's going to continue waiting for a modern male manifesto. At least Jim's pointing the way, getting a few laughs, and getting paid. Not a bad gig. Problem with men nowadays, is there are a lot of SMART guys, but finding guys that are both SMART and WISE takes extra work. By the time most of us get the WISE part, we're either ancient, or beat up by life to the point we just want the easiest, fattest paycheck and to be left alone. Modern women know the average guy is putty in their hands, and that's why they can work us so well, especially when they make it a collaborative effort. And modern women, with their Cosmopolitan magazine, Oprah, and endless social networking amongst themselves, have male behavior under the microscope from the first pick-up line until they either put you in your grave or the judge signs the divorce papers. Don't be a fool, and don't end up a tool, unless its a tool for change.Anyways, Jimmy, you get four stars. Funny book, with enough insights to make it worth picking up to thumb through when the King decides to sit on his throne and think deep thoughts."},{"Title":"Real Men Don't Apologize","review":"This book is totally hilarious and very true.

But if you want insightful, subtly beautiful and out of the ordinary images, take a look at \\"Trees: National Champions.\\"Bosworth's photographs are always thoughtful and often surprising--some of the \\"national champions\\" are not majestic at all, at least not as towering giants. Instead, they may seem relatively small compared to the trees of larger species that grow around them. Bosworth also shows most of the champions in their surroundings in a way that comments on the larger landscape and its human presence even as she takes individual trees as her starting point. She's a marvelous photographer, and this great series deserves a good long look."},{"Title":"Trees: National Champions","review":"I just received this book in the mail. I was so looking forward to taking in the images - but now I am so disappointed. First of all, I understand panoramic images have certain proportions, but when an extensive landscape photo in a book is only slightly over 4 inches in one dimension, that is just too small to be able to show all the detail to the viewer. This book would be much more successful if it were larger. Also, I am a big fan of black and white, but I did not read in any advertisement that these images were black and white. I think that should be stated, especially in nature photography since black and white film creates an entirely different product from color film. The consumer should be given the information to make their choice according to their taste. I was looking forward to comparing the different shades of green in the different varieties of trees and landscapes I would be seeing. Looking at these trees in black in white is more a study in texture, tone, and form. The trees have been abstracted for me since these images do not make me feel like \\"I am there\\" since being \\"there\\" would be in color. Also, the majority of the images all have the horizon line in the same place and the tree in the same place in the photo, as if the trees were all taken to the same studio and asked to sit in the same chair. I'm sure this perspective choice brings unity to the photo series when it is hanging on a wall, but in a book it is visually boring, page after page. I am sure I would enjoy these photos much more in person. They are just not impressive in this book."},{"Title":"Trees: National Champions","review":"(Planeta Journal) -- Panoramic black-and-white photographs document the authors visit to the largest of their species in the United States.

Perhaps Mr. and Mrs. Bowman should consider exploring visual and literary experiences that are better matched to their obviously limited capabilities - The Hallmark Store!Bosworth captures the ineffable grace and dignity of trees with clarity and directness: the green ash that shades a midwestern crossroads, the common pear that blooms in a Washington field, and the Florida strangler fig with its mass of entwining aerial roots. Her photographs, panoramic views taken with an 8 x 10 camera, show the immensity of the largest species and the hidden triumphs of the smallest. Some trees are dethroned each year because of sickness or destruction, but more often simpy because a new and bigger specimen is discovered; only three trees from the original Register in 1940 are still living today.

You can call them that. But they don't act like hate-filled zealots. The Four Just Man are civilized. They advise their targets they are guilty of crimes. They tell their targets to reform. They alert their targets to the date of their death. They even give their targets a final warning --- delivered in person. As the author notes, \\"The honesty of the Four was their most terrible characteristic.\\" Honesty --- how thrilling.Now the Four Just Men have a new target: Philip Ramon, the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain. He is a public servant of unquestioned integrity with a conscience in working order. And yet he is about to commit a crime. A legal crime. But a crime nonetheless: His proposed legislation --- The Alien Extradition Act of 1905 --- would send a great Spanish social reformer, currently directing his followers from a safe perch in England, back to Spain. Once there, the corrupt government would kill him.No reasonable Brit wants this to happen. But the Four Just Men are not like those of us who read the newspapers and bitch. Because they believe Sir Philip is a good man with a single blind spot, they have sent word to him: Drop the bill, or die. Naturally, almost every policeman in London is assigned to protect Sir Philip. The question is: Are they up to the task? Can they even identify the Four Just Men?Very quickly you will get past the moral question --- terrorists? vigilantes? heroes? --- and find yourself lost in the whodunnit. And the howtheydunnit. You may even find yourself rooting for The Four Just Men.How does it end? Glad you asked. Edgar Wallace held a contest when he published this novel, offering 500 pounds --- not a small sum in 1905 --- for the correct answers to some esoteric questions about the ending. Several readers guessed the answers. Wallace lost money. Or did he? For Wallace hyped 'The Four Just Men' as if it were a new flavor of Coca Cola. He took out full-page newspaper ads, put posters on subways and buses, even advertised in the movies. The publicity launched his career.And Wallace went on to become the most famous writer in the world.He was quick --- he could write a novel in a weekend. He was good. And he was prolific: 175 books, 24 plays and countless articles. The only title known to the contemporary reader? \\"King Kong.\\" Maybe you've heard of it.'We kill for justice,' claim the Four Just Men. On that morally uncertain but dramatically delicious boast rests the second of Edgar Wallace's titles that the world should remember --- and relish."},{"Title":"The Four Just Men","review":"If you are the Saint fans, you'll be also interested in &quot;The Four Just Men&quot;. They are also a kind of &quot;Modern Robin Hoods&quot; who fight against the injustice beyond the reach of the Law. I read some Edgar Wallace's short stories before and they were splendid. This book is enjoyable, but not so good as I expected. Unlike the Saint, the Four Just Men lack outstanding indivisualities that attract readers. Indeed they are nondescript and distinguishable only by names. When more than one heros appear, they should display different characters or abilities."},{"Title":"The Four Just Men","review":"Modern authors can learn much from this book by the late Edgar Wallace. It is an intriguing plot,captivating to the very end.

It contains some stories about great but obscure basketball players.This book contains a reprint of a story written by Roy Blount, Jr. and originally printed in an issue of \\"Sports Illustrated\\" in the early 1970's. It is entitled \\"47 Years A Shot Freak\\". It is one of the most unusual basketball stories you will ever encounter. It is the story of basketball trick shot specialist Wilfred Hetzel who for 47 years traveled around the United States performing basketball trick shooting shows at assembly school programs and pregame and halftime shows at collegiate and professional games.When I read this unique story about Wilfred Hetzel it inspired me to develop my own very unusual basketball trick shooting skills.

The author captures the essence of being in the room with Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as the excitement of the music of the times, the racial tension, the hippies, and all that encompasses that part of the 60's for me."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"Downtown is a real attenton holder. The author gives the reader an interesting narrative about the growth and change of the various characters. I didn't want it to end. I do recommend it for the under 50 age group."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"Disagreeing with the Publisher's Weekly review (who called her Stormy instead of Smoky BTW), I think this is one of Siddons' best novels. I've read it at least 3 times that I can remember. The turbulent times and the sheer life of the south during the Civil Rights movement is what draws me back every time, paired with the tight-knit characters that surround naive little Smoky. Everything this character does, she does with passion and wonder. What happens in the span of one year in this young journalist's life is a wonderful coming of age (later in life - she is 27 when she moves to Atlanta) and love story set during one of the most palpable times in modern American history. A job well done. This is a truly timeless and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"What makes \\"Downtown\\" resonate for me is that Siddons captures so well the boundless energy, excitement, passion, zeal and optimism of a young woman making her way on her own.The civil rights and women's movements, Atlanta's rise, and the Sixties are a wonderful backdrop, and Siddons draws well on her own experiences to create a fascinating setting. But it's Smoky's discovery of her voice, her spine, her identity, her passion and her purpose in her journey from repressed woman-child to strong woman that gives the story life.Any woman who remembers the dizzying, almost scary, thrill of the endless possibilities that came with striking out on your own for the first time -- as well as the disappointments, compromises and disillusionments that follow -- can identify with Smoky."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"It took me awhile to finish this book. But as soon as I did I realized how much I actually enjoyed it. I found myself crying and laughing with Smokey through this book, I loved how &quot;Downtown&quot; takes you from Smokey's life as a naive young Irish Catholic girl moving away from home for the first time TO an amazing grown woman. If you can handle a 500 page book with a heroin who's searching for herself and a bunch of quirky characters on the magazine staff, you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"This was the greatest book I ever read.

I have to say I enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time, even with knowing the &quot;surprise&quot; ending. The characters were loveable, the hate-able ones immensely so. Her descriptions of the south during this particular point in history was fascinating, the book a true page turner. I couldn't put it down! Perhaps I'm just a young idealist with low standards but I found Smoky (the heroin, as it were) to be refreshing (if a little unbelievably naive, but hey I didn't grow up in a strict Irish Catholic home in the sixties so i really wouldn't know)and I found myself relating to her on many different levels. I laughed right out loud and often cried with the characters. I can't wait to read more!"},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"As with her other books, this one was a delight.

It gave me insights from a young &quot;career woman's&quot; perspective about the South during the era that I was growing up in the northeast. Lots of wish-you-could-meet-them characters. Wonderfully rich language and images. If you like spunky heroines in a thought-provoking upbeat storylines, this one may transport you for a while like it did me."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"Most of Siddon's characters are introduced early in their lives and when a major occurrance happens, they weather life-changing growth. Downtown's character was too one-dimensional; her growth wasn't really believable and the ending jumping to present-day circumstances and a &quot;surprise&quot; husband was contrived. Siddon's characters are what I ready her books for and Smokey did not come across as a real person. Read all of Siddon's other books before going to this one. If this is your first Siddon's book, it may be your last."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"Maureen Aisling O'Donnell is tired of living in plain old Corkie. Other wise known as Smoky, Maureen has lived in the same neighborhood all of her life, and so she wants to leave. When the opportunity comes along for her to work on a promising magazine in Atlanta, GA, she leaps on the chance, and leaves. This novel is about her many discoveries about life outside of a dominantly Irish suburb. Smoky lives in a period where the civil war is still going strong, having loose morals is common, and the start of the Vietnam War has begun. I found this book to be very interesting. I read about the civil war from someone else's point of view. I did find that many of her chapters were somewhat pointless, and felt that she could have done a better job on the overall plot of the book. The main character, Smoky, is only somewhat realistic, in comparison to the remarkable imagery. While I could feel what she was feeling, and see what she is seeing, I could not identify with the character. I would only recommend this book to someone who has a lot of time, and little expectancy of a book."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"I read this book years ago, and I fell in love with it then.

The editor is patterned on the notorious and terrific Jim Townsend of Atlanta Magazine, where Siddons worked in the '60s and the staff members she worked with then show up with personalities slightly skewed. It's obvious to the reader that every bit of the material here is close to Siddons's heart. In some places she seems restrained, as though she's holding something back; in others she lets loose and her youthful passion surfaces.I lost my paperback in a recent move (I'll replace it with a hardback so it'll last) or I'd copy a passage so you could see the sensuousness of her writing. She is, without a doubt, one of the finest wordsmiths practicing today. She writes about things that are part of her, what she has known and what she cares about -- and she'll make it all a part of you, too.Sunnye Tiedemann"},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"Just wondered if anyone else has ever cottoned to the fact that the scene where Smoky visits La Carrousel with Luke, and sits with him, John Howard, and Juanita the Black Panther, is duplicated from &quot;Peachtree Road&quot;? Check out Chapter 16 of PR, in which Shep, Lucy, and Jack Venable visit the same club. Much of it has been translated verbatim, even to Smoky's awareness of her white flesh glowing &quot;rottenly among all the rich shades of blackness around her&quot; (or something like that), the same dialogue with two of MLK Jr's lieutenants, and the same description and encounter with King himself. What's up with that, I wonder? Did the author run out of inspiration...or did she underestimate her audience's intelligence?

Siddons can do, and has done, much better."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"I've read a few of Anne Rivers Siddons books so far, and they were mostly light reading, the story of a woman who has some issues and then seeks to resolve them. But Downtown is a different and more complicated book. This book details many of the civil movements in the 60s like the Vietnam war, the African-American quest for equality, and the changing of society. The different types of characters in this book are fascinating, from the upper crust society types to the people living in projects and slums. The narrator, Smoky, is a sort of tabula rasa, a blank slate who records many of the changes around her, as she herself changes. Not having lived through this period in history, I found that reading this book gave me a lot of insight into the lives of people in the 60s. It was a very engaging read and I would highly recommend it. And the ending is somewhat surprising, which should keep you tuned in until the last page."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"I am an avid fan of Ann Rivers Siddons but I thought this book would never end and when it did I couldn't believe she would waste so much effort on a self-indulgent group of people.

However I am an older person and perhaps should listen to my nieces and their children when they keep insisting-- this is the nineties."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"The author is not at her best.

Anne Rivers Siddons writes the kind of books that you don't want to end. She creates another world--really paints a unique vision with her words. This story rings so true, it really has that feel of authenticity--almost autobiographical even.

I had just moved to Atlanta, and I had heard that this author also lived in Atlanta and that all her novels were based in the South.I enjoyed reading this novel, not only because I was familiar with most of the places described in the book, but also because I liked very much the style the author uses to describe the characters, their emotions.Suffice to say, I was totally &quot;hooked&quot; and I have read almost all of her books."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"You've read reviews that give you the basic story line of this book so I won't go into that. You've read the Editorial Reviews and I can't say I agree with them. Don't we read fiction to escape our world, the reality of it, and enter a fictional world that the author so generously created for us? Well, I do and I think you do also.This book isn't action packed, filled with buried body parts or \\"sheet\\" action that will leave you standing in a cold shower. No, Siddons writes good old fashioned fiction stories where the story itself is the excitement that keeps you reading.To be honest, Anne Rivers Siddons writes books for women. Forget the fellas, ladies, her books are all ours! No man could understand the emotional feeling Rivers puts into her stories. The ups and downs of a woman's life. The happy times and the sad times that we all survive. When I crave a well written book that I can seriously sink my teeth into, I go for one of hers and this book is as good as any of her others.So get settled into your favorite chair, tell everyone to leave you alone and open the book that will \\"take you away\\"."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"In Downtown, Anne Rivers Siddons lovingly recreates boom-town Atlanta in the 1960's, and places Smokey O'Donnell, a twenty-six-year-old virginal Irish Catholic girl from staid Savannah (a thinly-cloaked stand-in for Siddons, herself) in the thick of the most exciting and momentous times the city has witnessed since the Civil War. Smokey cheerfully crosses the bridge from the class-smothered old south of her roots, to the new south which spreads around her like a banquet. She steps forward into a dream job with a progressive arts and culture magazine, and begins a series of romantic and political adventures, the likes of which she could not have dreamed back in her native Savannah. Smokey comes to know members of the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King, and is there at its height, before its is replaced in the public consciousness by the more radical protest movement against the Vietnam War.Smokey's story easily fills the pages of Downtown and succeeds because she is in her optimistic innocence, fulfilling the sort of dream so many women of all times and places have had. Who does not aspire to leave behind the past and leap face-forward into a new and better life where a real difference for the best can be achieved? In the enjoyable tale called Downtown, we get to live vicariously through Smokey's triumph.A fine novel that resurrects a time and place and should be a worthy read for almost anyone."},{"Title":"Downtown (Thorndike Core)","review":"Anne Rivers Siddons has introduced me to a part of my country that I know nothing about: the South. Growing up approximately at the same time as Siddons, my life experiences are similar but the locales are so different. Her ability to create a sense of time and place are remarkable. Her characters have complexity and depth. While &quot;Downtown&quot; is not my favorite, I find it fills in a nitch about Atlanta that needed exploration. &quot;Peachtree Road&quot; is a good place to begin with Siddons.

Moreover, the notes are truly helpful, adding information about botany, the classics, astrology, and other references that give the poetry additional depth and make these seemingly simple verses richer....Housman, Graves's biography tells us, wanted his books inexpensive so as to be widely available. Surely plasticated paper over boards in a perfect binding, no matter what the costs of storage and overhead may be, can't justify this steep a sum."},{"Title":"Amusement Park Guide","review":"This book is a must for all amusement park fans.

His writing sways back and forth, keeping you perk and alert, trying to understand what's going on. I had to keep on flipping back to see what I had missed. As long as you understand this book, you will like it. From any other point, if you don't like the typical average classic, this one will addict you.Even after I finished reading the last page of this book, I was still thinking: &quot; WHY?

It was truthfully that good, you can't put this book down, or forget about it."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I don't understand why everyone else who wrote a review didn't like this book. It's one of the weirdest yet greatest books I've read. It's up there in the pile with Jane Eyre! From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness. Usually a book has a fierce female fighting the mean, crude, bad man. But this book was different, being a weak girl and innocent man, and being different is just like thinking differently, and that's good."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This was a very chilling and creepy book to read, I highly enjoyed it and recommended it. It came as such a great surprise that this book, written decades ago, is comparabely as scary as Stephen King novels, but more wicked (and rather a bit more difficult of a task to read).Through circumstances and the evil of others, the young just prior nymph Tess Durverfield, suffers a series of tragedies.

But because of her innocence and little contact with other humans, she is seduced and ultimatly raped by a distant relative, something that drags her into the pits of life and kills her in the end.I personally thought this book was difficult (had a hard time grasping what exactly happened while Tess was &quot;seduced&quot; and where she was &quot;seduced). Unlike most classics, this book was very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess is a very difficult book and I would not recommend it to the average old contemporary reader. There is so much more meaning behind the birth of the rapist's child, and the break-up of Tess and her &quot;husband&quot; Angel. You have to read the fine-lines and &quot;footnotes&quot;. In other words, there is absolutely no way you could relate to this book, and anyways...why would you want to relate to books?

Her father discovers he is descended from aristocracy and drinks himself into a stupor, unable to fulfill his obligations. Tess takes his place and, through a series of misfortunes, is sent away to rich 'relatives' with the hope of getting financial assistance for her family. She meets a rogue at the mansion, and is taken in by him in so many ways. Fast forward. She meets another man and falls in love. Through their tragic love story, much is discovered about the morality, rules, and expectations of Victorian society.Thomas Hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work, and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again. It's a beautiful love story, and so much more. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I read this book because one of the young ladies I mentored felt like she needed someone to sympathize through her work with her.

It is so beautifully written that even through the frustrations and hardships the heroine faces, you are drawn on by the power of the language and the force of the story. Hardy was trying to make an important point in the writing of this story, and while such a tale seems unimaginable in today's world, it nevertheless resonates, particularly with women. Shocking in it's day, Hardy's efforts were felt. Tess is a provocative look at the plight of the 19th century woman, unnaturally naive to a world run by world-wise men. I'm not sure I've ever recovered from this book, and it has been a powerful influence in my own work.But yes, it's always wise to read the forward and preface LAST in any book, particularly literature."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A MUST READ! Although I was originally recommended this story alongside The Scarlet Letter on a reading list, other than the theme of love and extramarital pregnancy, Tess exceeds in every way. My favorite aspect is that it is intricately woven with complex characters that make the reader question whether they should love, pity, or hate each (or all of the above). And I love that the story is complete... almost a series of stories following Tess, flowing from one stage of her life to the next. I can't go too in depth with this review without giving away important details I think you'll enjoy discovering along the way. All I can do is recommend that every read Tess of the d'Urbervilles at least once! Or in my case going on my 9th time so far. lol)"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This book is one classic I had been looking forward to reading this summer. It was a good book in the end, but I did have a little trouble really getting into it. Once I did get it started I wanted to keep reading to see what Tess would do next. I would recommend that people read this book, but keep in mind it is a classic!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"No happy fairy tale happy ending here. Hardy's novel must have been quite scandalous back when it was written for its treatment of a taboo subject. Things inevitably go from bad to worse. I typically adore tragedy but I found even myself desirous of untroubled ending, but it was not to be."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"*The following may contain many spoilers*Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles was an amazing novel. The language was full of beautiful imagery and the characters were unforgettable. Hardy's use of birds and colors as symbolism provide a vivid picture of the novel. Tess's story is compelling, tragic, and beautiful. Despite the difficult language, once one begins to catch the flow of the novel, it is almost impossible to put the book down.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is the tragedy about a young maiden who is seduced/raped by an incorrigible Alec Stoke-d'Urberville. Her life from there only becomes worse. She falls in love with Angel Clare, who does not know her secret, so their relationship is doomed from the start. Circumstances and human nature drives the innocent Tess to unspeakable bounds, finally leading up to a murder and an execution. Like a bird, Tess has unknowingly flown too high and tragically falls from grace. She is the 19th century version of Eve. Hardy's subtle yet profound allusions to the Bible, more specifically Genesis, cannot be mistaken.This novel is one that should, or must, be read by all. It is a grand tale about love, fate, and the human condition. Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a classic novel because it never goes out of style."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Even though the length of this book is very long, it was one of the most compelling books I have read. You are taken back in time to the 1800's and how life was lived, the wealthy and the poor. Tess is accepting of her life of poverty but her Father wants more.He wants the life that goes with the surname so sends Tess off to meet and marry one of the d'Urbervilles so his dreams might come true. She was very innocent when it came to dealing with the aristocracy and became pregnant. She returned home, much to her Mother and Dad's disappointment and spent a great part of the rest of her life by feeling like a failure. She left home and then came the dealing with a difficult reality of numerous jobs and people who would take advantage of her.The characters in this book are memorable and you will become part of Tess's life. A wonderful work by Thomas Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Sad,sad story of love and faithful waiting for a quite undeserved husband for his return.

A classic tale of women's suffering and the unfortunate things that happened before women's rights were liberated. Amazingly written, another triumph for Thomas Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles, written by Thomas Hardy is a classic novel set in the countryside of England at the turn of the century . It reflects the lifestyle of the 19th century-- women didn't have many rights back then, men being superior in every aspect. Communication was not very fast and effective, increasing social and personal isolation.The main character, Tess, is a very credulous and naive daughter of a poor cottager. At the beginning of the book, the cottager learns that he is a descendent of Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles. The cottager instantly thinks of himself as a rich man because of the money his relatives have, and celebrates the great news by going to a bar to drink. When their dad doesn't come back from the bar, Tess and one of her many younger siblings go to get their dad from the bar with their family's horse, Prince. On their way to the bar Tess and her brother fall asleep and lead Prince to a near fence with sharp nails, causing Prince to stab himself on the chest with the nails and dies. Tess, feeling guilty, agrees to go to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles so that she can work to help the family. It turns out that the 'relatives' living there were just trying to build position for themselves and had bought the name\\"d'Ubervilles\\", a secret that no one knows until too late.While working at the D'Urberville Tess meets Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her endlessly until he gets what he wants. Tess goes back to her home village and learns she is pregnant, but soon loses the unwanted baby. Trying to make a new start, she goes to a farm where she makes a few friends and learns basic farm work. She falls in love with Angel, the son of a minister, who chose the peaceful farm life in hopes of running his own farm some day. It seemed like Angel did love Tess, but didn't want to really know her. Tess then gets into a self conflict where a part of her wants to tell Angel about her past, but the other part just hopes to keep it a secret. They get married, and that same night, Tess makes up her mind, thinking that Angel will accept her past if he really loves her because he had been in a similar situation before. But, unfortunately, Angel refuses to give her a chance and leaves to another country. This episode describes a traditional, but altogether hypocritical, male attitude towards females.The character development is realistic, Tess gets stronger and more mature as her life gets harder. At the beginning of the book, Tess was this a fragile and somewhat responsible girl who cried very easily and as the book ends, she shows her strong side where she can actually defend herself. In my opinion, she was a good daughter who cared about her family even though they used her as a source of money. Her parents, in contrast, are selfish, trying to earn money the easy way.As one reads this book, the impression emerges that Tess' love for Angel was greater than his love for her. Angel wasn't 'innocent' when he married Tess, yet he was disgusted by her past. If he hadn't left her, then she wouldn't have gone to Alec to help her family and she wouldn't have died a tragic death. Thus, this insensitive man was actually responsible for the tragedies of other innocent people. I believe that Tess' love for Angel was somehow 'greater' because even after Angel leaves her for months, she accepts him back and even kills someone to be with him. In this way, Hardy suggests that women are actually are actually more steadfast and strong in their love.Tess' death was unfair if we think in modern day terms. Alec had pursued her, ruining both her marriage and her entire life. The books describes how Alec and Tess get into a fight when Angel comes back for her. Tess killed Alec for both revenge and self defense, but British justice did not acknowledge that and executed her. Again, we have a criticism of social rules and practices which treated women unfairly.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a tragic novel which will make readers feel gloomy, sad and upset for quite a while. It is definitely not the best read for summer, or in that case any other time of the year if the reader seeks pleasing entertainment.It will, however, make readers think deeply just how different the whole system of justice and society operated in the past and how much has changed."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I'm not going to write a long, flowery review. I will merely say I loved this book. I read it many years ago in school and it moved me in a way a book never had before. This book changed me from a kid that had to read, into a kid that loved to read."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I cannot believe I waited so long to read this fantastic and fabulous novel! Without a doubt, this is the most probing and moving novel I have ever read in my entire life. It hit areas of my heart and mind as no other book ever has, especially in terms of being a woman. It was never required reading in any area of my schooling, even college. Yet as a former administrator, grade advisor, and mentor in a private school, I now realize that many of the students were required to read this book, but I never thought of reading it to discuss it with them; what a mistake. Had I known, this book would have been an invaluable tool for bringing out the horrors of the double standard.Every man, woman and child alive should read this book to find out the true sentiments of a woman who is brutalized sexually and mentally and shunned, not only by the man in question, but by the community, her family, the clergy, and ultimately, the man who claims to love her. How she deals with a \\"shame\\" that has been thrust upon her is crushing, and brings to mind that even in this 21st century, the double standard has not changed one iota, not even in the biggest of cities, regardless of what we see and hear in books, films and music. Go into any neighborhood, in any town, and in any city, and we see that this still exists. Tess of the d'Ubervilles walks among us even today, for she is still whispered about."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A very good story once you get used to the old English language. Learned a lot about life in Victorian England and the double standard for men and women. Glad I read it."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Not being a particular fan of some of the current trends in fiction, I've decided to read through the classics this summer. If I had bothered to read what this book was about, I probably wouldn't have started with this one. It was wonderfully written, compelling story telling. It was also incredibly sad. I spent the whole time rooting for the heroine and, if you've read the book, you know exactly how that turned out. Now to find a classic novel without a depressing ending."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This book, while perhaps well written, is just so ridiculous and self-contradictory that it's maddening to read. While it's necessary to forgive him some annoying parts of his style as being a part of his age, one cannot overlook the horrible plot and characterization.Not one of the characters in the entire book is coherent or believable. He begins with a stereotype--the innocent country lass (Tess), the skeptical intellectual (Angel), the depraved rich dandy (Alec)--describing mainly their appearance and superficial thoughts, so that they never rise above the stereotype. Then, if they stereotype doesn't suit the plot, he'll simply have them act in complete contradiction of their previous shoddy characterization, without any explanation of how they might have changed. Angel's rejection of Tess, for example--he, the skeptical nonconformist who questions conventional social mores, suddenly repudiates Tess for being the victim of a rape, despite his own questionable conduct. I might expect that behavior from a conceited hypocrite, but not the all-around good guy that Hardy has made Angel out to be. And it's not like we've made a discovery here about Angel's real nature, because Hardy goes right on describing him the way he had before. Of course, he takes her back, which is perhaps believable, except that he has not a moment of hesitation when he finds out she murdered Alec. So when your wife tells you she was raped, you leave her, but when she kills someone, you help her to escape without even a second thought?Then there's Tess. She seems like a pretty resourceful and sensible girl right up to the point where Angel leaves her for a stupid reason and she spends the next five years or whatever pining for him. She writes him one scolding letter, and then regrets it. And even though she can't muster the courage to approach Angel's father, or tell Angel off, or rebuff the advance of Alec--although Hardy describes her as having \\"natural fearlessness\\" at one point--she can somehow stab Alec later.Alec, of course, is the one who first becomes a preacher because someone talks to him on the road, and then gives it up because Tess is just too darn beautiful. You'd think some more convincing would be needed for either conversion, but nope, Hardy can't spare any time for actual character development when he could describe Talbothays again.Finally, I can take an example from a minor character. At one point in the book Hardy describes Izz Huett, a milkmaid, as \\"by nature the sauciest and most caustic\\" of the milkmaids; a mere 20 pages later he describes her as \\"a girl of tact.\\" Did he read what he wrote before sending it to the publisher?Aside from the contradictions in every one of his major characters (and a lot of the minor ones too), there are also points in the book that are just plain ridiculous. I mean, Stonehenge? Come on. How cheesy can you get? Not to mention the fact that he sent sixteen cops after them so they could be surrounded in the morning. It's as if he put stuff into his book because he thought it would be cool. Same deal with Angel going to BRAZIL. Also, apparently Angel can pick berries with his whip. Hardy also tends to get carried away with his own writing. He once mentions the plains of Brazil (if by \\"plains\\" he meant \\"rain forest\\") and describes a cow's \\"large-veined udders.\\"Lastly, the book oozes prejudices about country folk and women--mostly to the effect that they're naive and ignorant. In fact, Hardy seems to share the prejudices of Angel Clare. In any case, this book is a lot of reading in return for all the reward of a trashy romance novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I'm a French student of English, in my third year at university. I have to read \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" for my British literature class and it's just terrible. The author spends so much time describing Tess' beauty, virtue, kindness and courage, that I wonder why her name is not Mary Sue. There is no character development : instead, we are told a hundred times that Tess' eye colour is somewhere between blue, violet, grey and black -- seriously, can you picture that ?Furthermore, the heroine's so-called \\"kindness\\" is nothing but stupid weakness in my opinion. Her love interest, Angel Clare -- who, for some obscure reason, is also loved by most of her dairymaid friends --, blames and rejects her for being raped, and yet she still worships him and behaves like his obedient slave, despite his cruelty to her. This is merely a ridiculous and unhealthy obsession, not a true love story.To my mind, the only likeable character is Alec D'Urberville. Although he is supposed to be the \\"villain\\", I find him rather funny and much less annoying than Tess and Angel. Too bad that Thomas Hardy did not choose Alec as the main character. The novel would have been more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"When i started reading the novel,i did't feel like droping it.I felt so touched that the herione of the novel could still carry on with life,and reconcile with Angel who is hypocritic about the religion he criticizes and yet practices when discovering the past of Tess who forgave him of his sin which could not be weighed with hers,but failed to do likewise."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"tom hrdy was a \\"wimp\\". He wrote with aauthenticity \\"Tess of The D'Urbervilles\\". The English aristocrats didn't want to read about their lack of morals in print.

The English Aristocracy threatned to close down English Publishing Houses if they published \\"Tess of the \\"D'Urbelles\\". The Macmillan publishing house in New York publishedTess of the D'Urbervilles. Macmillan Publishing House is a United States publishing houseowned by a United States private company.Tess of the D'Urbelles became a best seller in The United States and in English conqueredcountries.as well as London.Hardy was so disgusted with his countrymen and members of The English crown he only wrotepoems after \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" became a best seller.England is only 1,000 years old.

This book is extremely sad, and I don't understand why it's a classic. Tess is very happy until her alchoholic dad discovers that they were a noble family, so, getting to big for his britches, he sends Tess over to another D'urberville family, which actually just adopted the name because they wanted to seem influential. That's when the trouble starts. Soon, Tess gives birth to a baby, and goes back home in disgrace. Then she meets another nice guy, who abandons her when he learns of her past.

As a story it was poigent and overdone, as a character, Tess was an insult to women everywhere. She had no backbone unill the end of the novel. fankly, I liked Hardy's poetry better and wish this book would be removed from all required reading list."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I enjoy reading classics, and have read several. No more than anyone else, perhaps, but a decent few that i could get my hands on.I've never read Hardy, and though his style was different, it was not hard to follow. The flaws in his characters are realistic enough, but it is those flaws that made me dislike the book. Tess is a simpering simpleton who should be smarter than she is. Angel is a Devil, who is the most hypocritical, bigoted, delusional idiot that walked in the book. The evil man, Alec D'Urberville, was terrible, but his evils could be comparable to Angel's. And in the middle is the lost child Tess, who can't be counted on to have a milliliter of sense or perception concering people throughout the entire book. She worships Angel, and blames herself for her rape, because Angel blames her despite his insisting that he doesn't.The plot could have been better, the characters could have been likable, and for God's sake it could have been less repetitive. Yes, we all understand, Tess you love him, Tess you need him, Tess you live for him, whatever, we understand, stop obsessing. Well written, but only worth reading at most once. I would borrow it instead of buying it."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Bad cover. Half of the book is ruined because the spine has come unglued...false product description!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I was looking for another edition of TESS and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the \\"average customer rating\\" was only three stars. So I'm taking a moment to correct the balance.TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES must be as close to a perfect novel as anyone has written in English. It is a genuine tragedy with a girl/woman as tragic hero. It is about life on earth in a way that transcends mere sociology. It has the grandeur of Milton but concerns itself with the lives of mortal beings on earth, as much with sex as with dirt, blood, milk, dung, animal and vegetative energies. It concerns itself with only essential things the way the Bible does. It is almost a dark rendering of the Beatitudes.The story is built with such care and such genius that every incident, every paragraph, reverberates throughout the whole structure. Surely Hardy had an angel on his shoulder when he conceived and composed this work. Yet it was considered so immoral in its time that he had to bowdlerize his own creation in order to get it published, at first. Victorian readers were not prepared for the truth of the lives of ordinary women, or for a great many truths about themselves that Hardy presents.The use of British history as a hall of mirrors and the jawdropping detail of the landscape of \\"Wessex\\" make it the Great English Novel in the way we sometimes refer to MOBY DICK as the Great American Novel, though the works don't otherwise bear comparison. Melville's great white whale is a far punier creation.Hardy's style is like no one else's. It is not snappy, as Dickens can be. It is not fluid and elegant, like George Eliot's. It can feel labored and awkward and more archaic than either. It has no journalistic flavor, but is painfully pure and deliberate and dense, echoing Homer or the language of the Old Testament rather than anything we think of as \\"modern.\\" Don't start with TESS but with FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, another very beautiful book, where Hardy is at his loosest and wittiest. Once you have the key to his style, then pick up a good edition of TESS with notes, e.g. Penguin, so you get the full richness of all the literary allusions. Hardy's lowly shepherds and farmhands move and breathe in a very ancient literary atmosphere. The effect is not pretentious but timeless.There is wisdom, poetry and majesty here. Tess stumbling through the dark and taking her last rest at Stonehenge will send chills up your spine like no other reading experience. I wonder if anyone can know why there are novels, why we care about them, or what they are capable of, without reading this one."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best stories I've ever read. Its characters, especially Tess herself, are so alive and memorable that they stay in your mind long after you've finished the book. That being said, though, it's also not a novel for the casual reader. This book is so thought-provoking and, ultimately, heartbraking that it can't be easily forgotten, and will more than likely leave you with an overwhelming sadness for a long time afterward. I read a lot, and material with very different subject matters, so I'm not being melodramatic when I say that this book left me extremely choked up, and almost on the verge of tears. For a guy in his mid-20's who never gets emotional, I think that's saying quite a lot. It certainly left me with a lot of respect for the author. The reader comes to care so much about Tess, and agonize over the way her life turns out, that it becomes almost unbearable at times. For a fictional tale to have that effect on a person is quite incredible. Difficult or not, anyone who is interested in reading a brilliant and moving story that deserves to be called a classic should read Tess of the D'Urbervilles."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Recently, my brother and I were discussing the \\"poverty penalty,\\" the concept that the poor pay more for what they must buy because they have no bargaining power to invite competition, which drives down prices. This is obviously not a new phenomenon, because poor Tess Durbeyfield pays quite a poverty penalty through the course of Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy.This is the first novel of Hardy's I have read, but I chose it after reading \\"What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew\\" by Daniel Pool, a fabulous book about 18th century daily life.Hardy's title, as quickly becomes evident, is tongue-in-cheek (he is author of my favorite title of a book, Jude the Obscure, which I haven't yet read) is ironic and mocking. Tess, the lovely and somewhat educated daughter of a cottager in Hardy's British district of Wessex, has the last name of Durbeyfield, but in the first pages of the book, her father, the ne'er-do-well, learns that he is descended from Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles, and there aren't many of them left, except his clan, as the local reverend informs him. He instantly thinks himself very grand and takes it as an excuse to go carousing, which causes Tess and one of her many younger siblings to have to make an early morning journey with the horse for the family's means of making money. Sleeping on the journey, Tess wakes to find the horse impaled in a wreck and killed. Feeling guilty, she agrees to be sent as a poor relation to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles to seek assistance of some kind. (They are \\"new money\\" and have bought the name \\"D'Urberville\\" to build position for themselves, so they are actually no relation.)There she encounters Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her vigorously, though she repeatedly eschews his attentions. She takes a job for his mother, watching her fowl, but one evening, separated from her friends in the village on the way home from a Saturday night out in the village, Alec stops accepting no for an answer.Later she falls in mutual love with a gentleman (the son of a minister) who has rejected the pulpit himself in favor of learning the trade of dairy farming so that he may run his own farm some day. Angel Clare does fall in love with Tess, but at the same time, he doesn't seem to really know her, or want to... he thinks of her as a pure country maid, and has no idea about her past. When she tries to tell him, he shushes her, thinking he knows all about her. When she finally confides in him after the marriage, the results are disastrous and Tess is once again dealing with harsh reality.I won't recount the rest of the story, but it's clear that the bourgeois (Alec) and the gentry (Angel) have a great deal to do with the pain and hardship of Tess's life; they inflict the poverty penalty on her. The idea of the fluidity of the aristocracy in the 18th century -- Tess is descended from them, but has no rights thereof, Alec has taken the name due to his money, and Angel has rejected the career of his familial role in favor of farming whilst entertaining a very aristocratic (and inaccurate) view of the \\"peasantry\\" -- is prominent in the novel, with Tess's inability to care for herself and fulfill her perceived familial goals without resorting to asking for help from those who don't have her bloodline at all. The town of Kingsbere, where Tess's ancestors are said to be buried, figures somewhat in the novel, and one cannot help but think that this symbolizes their use to her as being just as dead as they are.There are some motifs of paganism in the book... Tess meets Angel for the first time at a May dance, a pagan rite, and she has another climactic plot moment at Stonehenge toward the end of the book. Angel himself seems to reject his father's Christian teachings, and the beliefs of Tess and her society are often deemed superstitious or quaint and encompassing of pagan belief systems. Tess often wishes to be free of her life of burdens, and who can blame her? She didn't cause the horse's death that plunged her into this chain of events, and yet she is punished and punished and punished.Hardy's writing is beautiful and engaging. The book, though long, seems to quickly move from event to event, and the author's descriptions are enlightening and complete. I really liked this book and look forward to reading more by Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"When Thomas Hardy first had \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" published in 1891, the controversy that surrounded it ensured for him financial security and status as one of the most popular authors of the time. The novel's scandal was concerned with the plot itself, in which an innocent young maid is seduced by an aristocratic cad, and pays for such an indiscretion with everything she holds dear in her life. In Hardy's journal (as recounted in Margaret Higonnet's introduction in this edition) he records that one of the Duchess of Abercorn's dinner parties ended in an argument between those who believed that Tess deserved her fate, and those that sympathized with her plight. However, by today's standards (in which premarital sex barely registers an eye-blink) one can't help but wonder if such a novel is relevant anymore.I'm going to argue, that yes, of course it is - if not simply to illustrate how lucky we are to no longer live in a world where a woman can be utterly destroyed through the hypocrisy of the society she lives in. However, there's considerably more to it than that, particularly as the remnants of this ideology remain to this day; and since one of the central themes of the novel is the negative effect of past traditions on the present, this bears keeping in mind.Tess Durbeyfield is a simple country lass, easily manipulated and with a limited education, but with a keen intelligence and insight into human nature. However, when her foolish father is casually told by the village minister that he is the offshoot of a once-noble family, Tess is thrown into her parent's ambition mechanizations. Made to leave her home and younger siblings, Tess begins work tending chickens at a relative's house whilst attempting to ward off the unwelcome attentions of her devious cousin Alec D'Uberville. However, her resolve slips one night when she is alone with Alec, lost and (as the text suggests) intoxicated, and he takes full advantage of her vulnerability.Having borne his child and lost it soon after (all without Alec's knowledge) Tess seeks employment elsewhere, and finds a sense of peace and security as a milkmaid in a neighboring village. That is, until she meets the parson's son Angel Clare, a very different kind of man from Alec D'Uberville. Falling in love, (along with every other girl on the farm!) Tess finds herself in a new moral crisis. Should she reveal her secret to Angel? Would he accept her if he knew? Her family (not to mention her common sense) warn her to keep her mouth shut, but can any relationship last if it is based on a lie? Shouldn't she have faith in Angel's testimonies of love to her?However, you've probably already guessed that the story doesn't have a happy ending, and this is a tragedy in the old grand tradition. When young Tess is seduced by a man her fate is sealed. She is a fallen woman, carrying the shame of her indiscretions throughout the rest of her life. However, the novel is remarkable because of Hardy's ability to find light amongst all the grimness. In the depths of Tess's drudgery and despair, we feel her moments of tranquility and appreciation of the beauty that surround her. Likewise, in moments of joy and peace, there is the underlying dread of the secret threatening to rare its ugly head. The emotions stirred in reading this novel are relentless - not to put anyone off from reading this novel, but I was in a constant state of agitation and discomfort in reading; that's how vivid the circumstances of the novel were. I mean that as a good thing of course; books these days are like movies - you sit, you watch, you more often than not feel nothing. But I was truly moved by \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" and her story; and I can't remember the last time I became so invested in a character and her happiness. Despite the pain it brought me in reading it, \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" was worth every agonizing word.In many ways this is a feminist novel, and although I would hate to put too modern a spin on it, it is very easy to see that Thomas Hardy's sympathies lie with Tess, writing in a letter: \\"I lost my heart to her as I went on with her history.\\" It is impossible not to feel a swell of indignation when Alec D'Uberville makes Tess swear not to tempt him anymore (as if his lust for her attractiveness is somehow *her* fault!) and a sense of bitter frustration at Angel Clare's inability to accept Tess's indiscretion, particularly when he himself is guilty of the same crime. When his lofty image of Tess as his pure \`child-bride' is taken from him, you can't help but feel he's doing it just as much out of injured pride than any sense of propriety.But this propriety is all-powerful in the novel; a heavy weight upon Tess that destroys her life. Hardy brings forth the idea that this is indeed a fallen world, but that it is so because of mankind's own structures of tradition and circumstance, rather than any divine ordination or original sin. To be free of some of them is a great release, though there are plenty that remain in this and other cultures around the world. The story is one of endurance; enduring the condemnation of others, the physical trials of manual labour, the suffering of a broken heart, the terror of encroaching death. We cannot control any of these aspects of our lives - all we can do is endure them, as Tess did."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I'm many years out of college and thought I should start reading some more of the classics. Previous favorites of mine have been The Sound and the Fury, Jane Eyre, and Pride and Prejudice. I saw Tess of the D'Urbervilles on my sister's bookshelf and for about a year I considered reading it. Finally, I picked it up and began. Wow! I read it in about three days. I never expected I would feel so much by reading this book. I cried when she baptized Sorrow herself. Her concerns that he be buried in the churchyard and her efforts to ensure he was were touching. I wanted to help Tess Durbeyfield. I thought she was a very complex character--she was sweet and unworldly but she wasn't actually stupid. And she was strong in many ways--for example, her family relied on Tess for so many things--eventually even their support. In fact, I hated her family for not working harder and making their own sacrifices. All the burden was on poor Tess. I also wanted to shake some sense into Angel. He really did wrong by Tess--although he eventually realizes this, it comes too late. The only thing I really did not care for was the sudden inclusion of a minor character (who we met earlier)into the end of the book and the implication that she would play an important role in the future of a major character. I barely knew this minor character and NOBODY could compare to Tess of the D'Urbervilles. If you are reading this to find a good book, ignore the negative reviews by high-school students and buy this book NOW. It's unforgettable."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"When I saw the depressing amount of 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews for this novel, I had to wonder what had gotten into the general populace. Then I read the actual reviews, and realized something. They are reading this for pleasure, yes - but why in the world to people turn to a classic novel for a fast-paced, action-packed story? (Yes, I quote.)Tess's is a dark tale, a depressing tale, a tale with no perky moments to speak of (seeing as how we all know it'll get that much worse should anything good happen). The language is poetic and ethereal, with descriptions of incredible beauty that I would give anything to have written and an overtone of intense tragedy and ill-fated cruelty. The characters are all conflicted and in turmoil, oppressed by the moral standards of the day, and Tess is likeable, as opposed to Emily Bronte's Catherine Earnshaw, say. I would like to mention that I chose this book to write a ten-page analytical paper on, know it cover-to-cover, and know that it is SO much more meaningfull when one stops to take in the paragraphs that scream, \\"Pay attention to ME!!!\\" I would also mention that I am not a college professor. I read this as a high-school freshman, which goes to show that this isn't just a book for the elite.And in relation to all the readers who feel that Hardy is a bad author? I always believe that people who act as though they can write a classic far better than the author really ought to try their hand at writing a story that will survive the ages as well as Tess. Hardy writes in lyrical prose, in similar style to his poetry, and though I completely understand wanting to read \\"mind candy\\", I don't understand expecting books accepted as real literature to do the trick. Maybe try a trashy novel first, and read Tess to cleanse the palate.This is, ultimately, my favorite novel of all time. Naturally, I have many more to read, but of all those I have tried, I have never read another that so seamlessly combined luminous tragedy, heartwrending romance, and cruel fate in a novel as beautiful as it is painful."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"In a certain light, Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" might be seen as a Cinderella story horribly disfigured by a tragic twist. When we first meet the heroine, Tess Durbeyfield, as a poor, hardworking farm girl who has to take care of her five younger siblings and fulfill the responsibilities abandoned by her inebriated father, she seems like a girl destined for greater things: a brilliant career in a more stimulating occupation, a blissful marriage to a wonderful man. But Hardy likes to illustrate fate's capacity for cruelty, and Tess is merely an innocent woman who is seemingly punished for her innocence.The name Durbeyfield is a vulgarization of d'Urberville, a family with a rich history descended from Norman knights and wealthy landowners, but various misfortunes have reduced the lineage to the commoners who presently inhabit the impoverished Durbeyfield household. (We learn later in the novel that the Durbeyfields are not the only local family to have suffered this appellative fall from grace.) Although the d'Urberville nobility is defunct, in the near past an enterprising businessman named Stoke sought to increase the prestige of his own family by appropriating a distinguished name from the county annals, and d'Urberville is the one he chose. Thus when Tess, to aid her family's finances after an unfortunate accident deprives them of their income, takes a job tending the fowl at the nearby d'Urberville estate, she mistakenly believes she is working for her relations.This ostensibly minor detail is really the basis of the irony which drives the novel. Had Mr. Stoke been honest and not assumed the name of the Durbeyfields' ancestors, Tess would not have been likely to meet the lecherous, skulking Alec d'Urberville, who rapes her after she rebuffs his attempted seduction and impregnates her with a baby that dies in infancy. Of course Hardy, evading the risk of censorship, is decorous enough to suggest in the subtlest manner possible that the rape happened rather than describe it explicitly, but Alec's immoral behavior is clearly implied.Mortified, heartbroken, Tess then goes to work as a milkmaid at a dairy farm where she and a young man named Angel Clare, the heartthrob of several of the farm girls, fall in love. Angel has defied his father, a vicar, by spurning a career in the clergy for agriculture and marriage with a middle class girl for Tess. He scoffs at his parents' snobbery, but after marrying Tess, he reveals a disturbing hypocrisy when she confesses to him the vicious treatment she had received from Alec and its consequences. Angel's reaction is far from the gentle sympathy one would expect from the magnanimous personality he projects; he is disgusted that she has been robbed of her purity and draws a strange parallel between her violation and the fall of her family's ancestral prestige. He rejects her, they separate, and once again she is mortified, heartbroken, and looking for a job.Tess is destined to rencounter both Angel and Alec before the end of the novel, and the changes to their characters not only advance the plot in unexpected ways but further emphasize Hardy's utilization of irony. The starkly contrasted images of the novel's penultimate scene at Stonehenge and the last scene, which takes place outside a prison where a black flag flies announcing an execution, raise the question of whether even Hardy knew when he started exactly how this somber story would end.The novel contains several recurring Hardy elements. Like most of his major work, it takes place in the southwestern part of England he calls Wessex, this time in the fertile Blackmoor Vale, and his evocation of the scenery sets the stage beautifully. Tess's co-workers at the dairy farm are a realistically cheerful lot and provide the continuum of humanity that such a story needs as a reprieve for its tragic mood. An interesting touch which shows that Hardy is not above recycling his own motifs is the similarity between the death of the Durbeyfield horse (a definite foreshadowing for Tess) and the tumbling sheep in \\"Far from the Madding Crowd,\\" in that both incidents cause their respective protagonists to take distant jobs with fateful results. The incentive to read Hardy lies in his ability to put language at the service of one of the greatest functions of literature: to express the deepest desires and emotions of mankind."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I see \\"Tess\\" as the story of how a beauty is wronged by evil and by arrogance.But oh, what a story. Hardy's novels read like poetry. Tess is so lovely, innocent and good, Alec so relentlessly hideous, and Angel so pathetically self-righteous, that I find the gradual destruction of Tess (with whom I empathize) at the hands of these two men, to be difficult to experience again, line by line!What a masterpiece of the human condition, and I'm told, of the female experience. Hardy's bitterly honest portrayal of the worst and best of human behavior is as powerful as any I've found in literature.When I need a Hardy fix and I don't want to be depressed, I turn to \\"Far From the Madding Crowd.\\""},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"(Warning: Tells Plot of the Story)Through many revisions and editions, Tess of the D'Urbervilles A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented By Thomas Hardy still holds readers captive over a hundred years later. Tess's plight though childhood innocence to womanly revenge is similar to other fairy tales and classic novels. It is said to be a love story for young girls or an adults' treasure of allusions and serious themes. Tess grows up fast, having to deal with the wrongs of mankind, her social class, a noble lineage, and the renewal of her true self. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a novel that can surpass the ages as a heartbreaking tale for any reader who believes in redemption and compassion for the all-encompassing heroine.In 19th Century Britain, Tess searches for a little pleasure out of her wronged life. Through many novels, Thomas Hardy has told the stories of characters and flaws. Hardy's insight to a woman's life is remarkable. He shows the injustices women have received and the stereotypes that follow women still today. Without knowing the narrator to be a man, it could easily have been a woman who told this very feminine tale. The book was very controversial at the time of its release in 1891. Parts were censored and seen as obscene because of it's sexual views. Hardy continually revised the story, changing the interpretations of the main characters. He did this through including information on some facts and removing statements on others. Alec D'Urberville could be seen in one edition as only the antagonist, not the villain he is in this version. His alterations lead to the 1912-13 edition that is usually the book available now.Hardy focuses on many themes throughout the book, mostly on the feminine role and social class. Tess Durbeyfield realizes her social struggle when she caused an accident to happen sending her family into financial need. With the recent discovery of their family's lineage to be that of the once very prominent D'Urbervilles, Tess is sent off to her wealthy relatives. The relatives in reality are not D'Urbervilles, only a family that had taken the name because questionable activity was attached to their old name. Alec D'Urberville realizes Tess's financial need and uses it against her to join him at his mother's estate. Gender roles are brought up when Joan Durbeyfield, Tess's mother, believes that \\"her face\\" (53) is her one advantage. Only D'Urbervilles advantage is greater. He holds the blackmail of economic need over Tess's head until he eventually takes advantage of her. \\"An immeasurable chasm was to divide our heroine's personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother's door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm\\" (74). The pregnant Tess, as an unmarried woman isolated from others, escapes home to have her baby. Tess tries her hand as a field worker where women \\"were the most interesting of this company of binders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature\\" \\"A field-man is a personality afield; a field-woman is a portion of the field\\" (87-89). Roles are defined by gender again as women being earthly and beautiful, men having no goodness, and in the end the man still gets the better of the woman.Tess's baby dies, leaving her to start over at Talbothay's Dairy. Finding real love in Angel Care, he convinces Tess to marry him. She tries to tell him of her past only to have him refuse to hear her each time. After their wedding, Clare admits his previous sexual experience asking for forgiveness and receiving it. When Tess relates her story, he can no longer be with her, claiming that \\"forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another\\" (228) \\"the woman I have been loving is not you\\" (229). Men's double standards are shown. Clare leaves her for Brazil to decide if they could fix matters. During his long extended absence, Tess is reduced to farm labor. Her father dies and her family is evicted from their home. Her economic welfare falls again into Alec D'Urbervilles hands. His advantage persuades Tess to be his wife because her real husband was never coming back, according to D'Urberville.Clare came back to find his wife living with D'Urberville. Tess, in a moment of revelation, avenges the wrongs of D'Urberville by killing him. Clare and Tess have a few days of paradise together before she is taken away for D'Urbervilles murder. Tess understands that this is how it has to be. She will be able to die before Clare can despise her again. She dies a fulfilled woman, \\"'I am ready,' she said quietly\\" (396).Besides being a wonderful tale, Hardy's strength in writing merits the book to be an excellent read. Hardy achieves his goal of relating the story of an innocent girl whose life was simple before the villain D'Urberville comes into the story and nearly perfect after he is out of the story. Hardy portrayed his \\"Pure Woman\\" with brilliancy and faithfulness. Social class issues are displayed though Tess's country girl nature yet noble lineage. If her family had not been in economic problems, her tragic flaw would never have occurred. She could have lived as a farmer's wife and lived a simple life. The feminine stereotypes and generalizations are represented by the actions of others upon the poetic Tess.Hardy's background in poetry gives the novel a lyrical quality missing in the books of today's generation. Hardy alludes to several other works of art including Greek mythology, Shakespeare, fairy tales, and the Bible. He utilizes imagery as well. His uncanny imagery creates the entire world of Tess for the reader, down to the little window reflections upon a dress. The extremely detailed and well articulated descriptions can easily be seen in the readers mind. These literary elements are well used and fit the tale accordingly.Enjoyment would be received from Tess of the D'Urbervilles by those hopeless romantics who value depth to a story and appreciate the British setting. Gender roles and social class issues are blatantly raised with no subtly. Love story or social issue awareness, the beloved heroine, innocent, strong, loving, and pure will reach into one's heart and capture it forever in the world of fairy tales and happy endings."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Man... I thought that The Return of the Native was good...Tess of the d'Urbervilles by the Great Thomas Hardy was a very long novel for me. Hardy's scope and incredible projection of Wessex was very admirable and how he presents Tess as a person is very beautiful.The novel begins with Tess' father learning that his family, the Durbeyfields is descended from a long gone ancient regime, the d'Urbervilles. I really love how Hardy makes you feel like this is the ultimate cross for Tess and her family to bear. How Tess grows to hate this fact. After the Durbeyfield's horse is impaled, yes impaled, when Tess and her brother are trying to deliver something that her father is too ill (or too drunk) to deliver, Tess blames it all on herself and is sent to work on the manor that her parents think that her \\"cousin,\\" the cruel Alec d'Urberville resides in. A great Hardyan lustre of that element of the story is that Alec d'Urberville's father just bought that name after lookin it up in some book, so Tess falls into a trap of fate and is continually punished. Tess' whole life is told through the novel and is filled with very tragic scenes, so if you like feel good books, stay away from this one.This novel is full of beautiful and moving tragedy, incredible projection of Victorian rural life, and just about everything Hardy can give you in one novel.Definatley essential Victorian Literature, definatley essential Thomas Hardy, and without question one of the greatest novels ever written....Only a poet could've written such a beautiful novel..."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This book is wonderful for many reasons and especially for its portrayal of Tess. It raises questions (still pertinent today) about women, reputation, and sexuality in society.

Don't miss _Jude the Obscure_ and _The Mayor of Casterbridge_."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles,&quot; by Thomas Hardy, is a book about a young woman who struggles to find her place in society. When it is discovered that the low-class Durbeyfield family is in reality the d'Urbervilles, the last of a famous blood line that dates back hundreds of years, the mother sends her eldest daughter, Tess, to beg money from relations with the obvious desire that Tess wed the rich Mr. d'Urberville. Thus begins a tale of woe in which a wealthy man cruely mistreats a poor girl. Tess is taken advantage of by Mr. d'Urberville and leaves his house, returning home to have their child, who subsequently dies. Throughout the rest of this fascinating novel, Tess is tormented by guilt at the thought of her impurity and vows to never marry. She is tested when she meets Angel, the clever son of a priest, and falls in love with him. After days of pleading, Tess gives in to Angel and consents to marry him. Angel deserts Tess when he finds the innocent country girl he fell in love with is not so pure. This touching story depicts how difficult it was being a woman in the 1800s.There are many reasons to recommend &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; It is a story one can easily relate to. If anyone has ever suffered prejudice, then he/she will want to read this book. The book is also thought-provoking. &quot;Tess&quot; is also interesting in that the author gives the point of view of all the characters in it, not simply that of Tess. This means that the reader gets a better understanding of the plot. Thomas Hardy writes in an eloquent and descriptive manner.&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; does have perceived flaws. It has been described as rather verbose, but one finds that this is not the case, and that the details only add to the book. The plot is tragic, which might make it depressing to read. However, one finds that it is tragic in a beautiful and compelling sense, not in a sad sense. &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; is a book that will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I had been meaning to read Tess for years and finally did this past week. I was mainly disappointed. The book starts off well...but it seems that 2/3 or so of the way through, the author became rushed....and the story becomes so slapdash and contrived I could not believe in the situations and definitely could no longer believe in the characters.The second quarter of this book, when Tess is at the dairy farm, is the strongest part. Hardy slows down; we believe in the characters and most of the emotions, and there is some wisdom and beautiful writing to be found here.After this point, it is, sadly, all downhill... I kept throwing up my hands in disgust."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I don't think that Tess of the D'Urbervilles is to be considered a realistic portrayal of life. It is more like a Greek tragedy or Shakespearean tragedy. The characters are larger than life and the events of the book mythic in scale. Nevertheless, just like with, say, Macbeth I was drawn into the plot and actually found myself getting angry and upset about the turn of events. So I got my money's worth. Hardy definitely has cast this story very darkly. Tess is no mere innocent victim. And Alec is not so clearly just an evil villian. Nor is Angel an angel. The characters are complex and deep, and the reader ends up caring about them. That's why this book is a classic. See the A&amp;E adaptation in film for a fascinating and moving interpretation."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I was required to read this book for AP English IV.One of the best books I've read for class all year.

Never again be whisked into this particular world so far removed from my own and yet so heart-wrenchingly close. Never again turn the pages of Tess of the D'Urbervilles with baited breath and a longing ache that realistically shouldn't stem from mere fiction.Phenomenal, this work of Thomas Hardy's is.Not since reading Jane Eyre have I been so totally immersed in the life of a character, so in tune with her sufferings and joys, so hopeful yet fearful for her future. Tess seems so real, sometimes pathetically so, but always wishfully so. Her story is a sad one, but it brings with it its own reward.I almost wish I could have stopped reading at a point before the ending, so I would be free to imagine my own perfect conclusion. Or better yet, so Tess could live on, could still have that elusive chance at fulfillment and lasting joy. But Mr. Hardy's ending is the best one, the most fitted to the rest of the book. Still, I was shocked. I think the ending just increases the tantalizingness of the book though.So anyway, this book deserves at least seven stars, but only five are given, so. . . read it for yourself.

Thomas Hardy's writing is simply brilliant, and poignant.Thomas Hardy imagines a new way of being for British society. One that is not so hung up on narrow social conventions, one where people are rewarded for hard work and positive moral attributes.SPOILERS BELOW!Tess is supposed to be the embodiment of this new society as it comes into being, but runs into trouble at every step of the way in her development. Her parents do not work as hard as she does, she is cruelly seduced, her baby is cruelly denied a Christian burial, even her true love Angel Claire rejects her because of her past and the narrow social conventions he has been brought up with. And in the end, she dies, a Christ figure for Hardy's new society, with Angel and her sister \\"apostles.\\" The ending is even slightly ambiguous...What will Angel and Liza Lu do? Will they advance Hardy's new society?"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy was written in 1891 and challenged the Victorian sensibilities of the time and to this day it offers much to the reader. It is a book which has intense atmosphere, character development, romance, an interesting storyline and yet still gives us much food for thought.At the start of the book our beautiful heroine Tess is a teenager of a poor family with a father who is an alcoholic. She is a young woman who always tries to do the best for her family which lands her in trouble. Tess is eventually raped and gives birth to an illegitimate child. That she remains a good person who still tries to do her best and is a heroine of a book was shocking at the time of publication.In many ways it is obvious that Tess' story is going to end tragically. Even while we root for Tess and grow to admire her courage and perseverance we are aware that it is against all odds. This then provokes interesting questions about how the story would appear in today's world and the moral questions involved in contemporary society.Growing up as a farm girl, I enjoyed all the interesting details about the various types of farming in the late 19th century England. I loved the descriptions of the walks and travels by coach across the rural countryside."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"'Tess' is a beautifully-written classic that kept my kindle dictionary busy. It is a story about how painful and unfair life can be, and especially to those who are by-nature the most loving, kind and sensitive. You will fall in love with 'Tessy' and wish only the very best for her. Be forewarned, however, that Hardy wrote very little of the 'best' you will wish for Tess into this story. As a result, you may want to delay reading this book until you feel 'up' for reading a very sad and tragic tale. That caveat aside, 'Tess' is an exceptional work of literature, and a book you aren't likely to forget.Caution: Amazon has posted an editorial review that gives far too much of this book away. If you plan to read 'Tess,' I don't recommend reading its editorial reviews."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This book was a good book at times and a somewhat boring book at times.

Tess had her moments when you wanted to cheer her on but most of the time was spent looking back to try and understnad what happened, and many times the book was such that it put you to sleep ( which happened to me on 7 occasions ). In all it is not a bad book, but I would not recommend it to younger readers, and if any english teachers are reading this please think about what your students would like to read not yourself and what you think is good."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I disagree that Tess is an insult to women.

Now I'm thinking she was switched at birth with some stranger. I won't go as far as saying I hated the book, (though I really did) but it's sure close. Tess is a brainless twit with no backbone and NO common sense at all. I wanted to shake her into reality. Even her own mother thought she was nuts for confessing to her husband (on their wedding night) that she wasn't a virgin, even though it wasn't her fault. Of course the self-centered husband can't even look her in the face and leaves her as soon as possible - sending her home to her mother. The book is all about Tess and every wrong turn she makes - not one good decision. I was disgusted with Tess and had to fight my way through to the end. I had to force myself to pick it up.

She goes to live with some guy named Alec and falls in love with him or something. I never read it but have studied Thomas Hardy's works and that is all I know about this classic. I also know it has a very sad and tragic ending because I ruined it for myself by reading spoilers on wikipedia so don't ruin it by doing that, read it and reach the tear jerking ending, if you can survive a TOME! HA HA HA HA! (Of course you can \\"survive\\" this one. I was just cracking a joke about the length of this book. Thomas Hardy was one of the greatest writers who ever lived and this book proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt)The story attacks the role of woman in Victorian society and because of that, it wasn't really well received in 1891 but at least it did better than Hardy's final novel Jude the Obscure, published in 1895 (some sources say '96 I'm not sure) Jude the Obscure was hated so badly that it was mockingly renamed \\"Jude the Obscene\\" and Hardy stopped writing novels altogether and focused on poetry.This is essential Victorian age literature and is Hardy's most famous novel. Read it today!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I was a little bit disappointed by Tess, but it is a good outlook of late Victorian Era on the progress of woman. It is a simple story of how a Norman family declined and rose and declined again. It is also about how a men can control the lives of woman. It is a good read for those who like a mixture of feminism wiht social history with a little romance thrown in."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The book starts out strong, but ends in an inexplicable state of affairs.

However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my oldest granddaughter.

Couldn't put the book down. You become attached to all the characters, feeling they are your own group of friends."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"By today's standards certain passages of this book may seem rather vague and subtle, but they were shocking when first written--enough that the book was subject to heavy censorship--vital passages from it were removed. And that is really what makes this book so grand. Its take on the double standards of the society in which fictional Tess lived may seem very distant from today's post-60's equality society, but it was very real then.The book follows Tess' journey through the English countryside, but what makes it so fascinating is the constant flow of her thought patterns as she tries to rationalize the hand she has been dealt. The modern reader may be befuddled, as her thoughts are representative of another culture and another time, but what is fascinating is the little insights on human nature that shine through. The joy she feels tempered by the despair in her past. The ignorant self-righteousness of overzealous youth. The mistakes that even very good, well-meaning people can make, without realizing it, that hurt others deeply. We hope for her as she lives through the initial tragedy, the slow recovery, the surge of joy she experiences, we are disgusted at the hypocritical betrayal that eventually leads to her final breakdown.The prose itself too has a personality, often taking time to smell the roses and indulge in the lush scenery, fascinating historical anecdotes and social interactions that Tess deals with on a daily basis. For those who over-glamorize the past, here is a very honest look at the physical and mental hardships people faced in it. Hardy quotes Ascham: 'We find a short way, by a long wandering.'"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I had to write a review just to bring up a rating that was unfairly knocked down by a handful of obtuse reviewers. I wasn't an English lit major like some of these reviewers, but I have read upwards of 10,000 books in my life -with a concentration on literature- and have to say that the descriptive writing in \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" is the most beautiful and poetic I have yet encountered. It is not the most exciting, nor the most stunningly transformative(that honour goes to \\"Altas Shrugged\\") book, but the construction and execution is exquisite.The book is in fact slowly paced - so much so in the first couple of chapters that I was rebuffed the first time I started reading it. However, a little patience will grant you entry into the gorgeous spell Hardy invokes. Yes, it is a \\"victorian\\" novel, but the sublimity of the writing and of the plot's tragedy emancipates it from the staidness of the genre.The upshot is that you shouldn't turn to this book if you want a fast paced thriller or \\"clever\\" writing. Read it if you want to cultivate your awareness of exceptional beauty; this book is for the cultured connoisseur, not needy readers."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Never have I been so moved by a work of fiction...

This is one of the few classics that can still grip the modern reader, enchant, outrage and enlighten him.

(well almost) Without giving too much away, strong irony is cleverly used here and there, Hardy's always wonderful theme-setting descriptive skills shine as usual and the character studies are brilliant. Every main person in the book has one surprise or other up their sleeve. All in all, it's a classic tragedy..."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I didn't.

All through the story I kept hoping that at some point she would find happiness or at least peace with herself. instead her situation kept getting more and more complacted and depressing.

My wife will attest to the fact that I have a strange affinity to depressing stories. With that in mind, let me say that I really enjoyed this book.The writing was at times a bit too much for me for the reason that I get annoyed at many 18th and 19th century novels...namely, that Hardy focuses far too much on minute descriptions and in-depth analysis of setting and location. Don't get me wrong, I love a vivid and lush environment and I much prefer a fleshed out character to a flat one. I just sometimes feel that all of the flowery descriptions slow down the story telling element too much. There were a few paragraphs/pages that I tried to skim through in order to get to the next relevant points of plot. Still, I don't know that I'd want to edit out the descriptive text since it does comment on the narrative itself in a metafictional sort of way.The main characters in this book are wonderfully composed. They are absolutely and completely frustrating but they are superbly crafted nonetheless. I wanted to smack each of the main characters on many occasions.Tess is far too willing to simply be acted upon and then to bemoan her fate. Alec is an absolute pig (although towards the end of our experience with him, it's debatable just how awful he truly is). And Angel is far too inconsistent to be liked at all...at first he seems almost lovable...then he deserves to be hated...then he seems slightly adequate...then he becomes repulsive again...he's just far too wishy-washy in his behavior and ideals to ever be fully redeemable.The story itself falls into the realm of realism taken to its extreme. The plot elements felt almost like the Bible story of Job...whatever could go wrong willgo wrong. And even though Tess was generally found to be almost whining about her circumstances rather than trying to make things better for herself, the story was still rather thought provoking since it makes you wonder just how you would handle horrific circumstances and what can truly be done about them. Is it better to try and solve the problem or better to just let fate and happenstance take its toll.Personally, I try to make the best out of any bad situation...perhaps that's why I like \\"depressing\\" stories...they make me realize my life could be worse and they help inspire me to always think of the best possible outcome.I'm sure this book won't be for everyone. Those who want a happy fairy-tale romp through a girl's life would do better to stay away. Those who are easily frustrated by fallen characters, will find themselves hating all of the primary roles in this book. The book isn't terribly lengthy (~300-400?) but some of the longer descriptive passages do crawl by at times.Still, I whole-heartedly recommend this book to those who are willing to look imperfection and awful situations square in the face and come away smiling. It's not a happy book. It's not a terribly fast past book (which can also be frustrating...I wanted to shout Just do it to Tess many times).But it is a wonderfully rich book and definitely worth getting into.*****4.5 stars (out of 5)"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Any woman who has been pursued by the likes of an Alex D'Urberville will appreciate with a shudder his sinister characterization. Hardy's pastoral description is beautiful as is his handling of diary life especially if one is familiar with such rural settings and labors.However, as Tess's persistently over-sensitive conscience regarding her past rumbles on and on and on, I began to wish she would find the river and put herself in it. But there are philosophical gems here and there such as \\"By experience...we find out a short way by a long wandering\\" that make the reading worthwhile."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy is a definite for anyone serious about literature. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is not to be passed up, it's a treat. I didn't find it at all over descriptive nor boring."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Having read Tess several times years ago and then revisiting it now, I am reminded how frustrating a book it can be: frustrating that Hardy's 19th century England could be so cruel; frustrating that Tess (and others) blamed herself for being ruthlessly violated at 16; and frustrated at Angel's initial behavior after he learns of Tess' tragic and blameless past. It's just too incomprehensible for someone living in the 21st century to relate to--and you wonder about Angel's incompatible behavior--for someone of his supposed character. As much as I love the pastoral beauty of Hardy's described vales and heaths, I loathe the society under which the characters lives are always ruined. The whole books starts to seem silly and tedious when viewed from such a perspective."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Although written well over a century ago, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a surprisingly modern novel with unmatched poetic beauty. The author, Thomas Hardy, jabs at the age-old issues of sexism, social class, and morality in this seemingly simple tragic romance. The heroine is the titular Tess, an elegant but unassuming countryside beauty from a poor farming family. Her misery begins when the family discovers that they are not the shabby Durbeyfields after all, but rather the descendants of the illustrious and ancient D'Urbervilles. But Tess' doom goes hand in hand with her heritage. Introduced to her newfound rich relations, she is forced to become the mistress of her cousin Alec D'Urberville. Naturally she is blamed for her \\"defilement\\" and resulting pregnancy. Tess of the D'Urbervilles cynically examines the high-strung, sexist Victorian society and the hypocritical Anglican Church, while simultaneously providing a window into the human soul. Hardy captivates the reader with his luminous heroine, a saintly creature forced to commit terrible deeds against her will. He questions the very nature of morality, asserting that neither society nor the church has the authority to judge virtue. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a masterpiece of literature--tragic and romantic, poetic and critical--a wondrously perceptive literary work. The reader is captivated from start to finish, from the opening imagery of the lovely English countryside to the fateful, deeply symbolic conclusion set amid the cragged rocks of the Stonehenge."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Deep. Tragic. Memorable.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a wonderful read and highly recommended. I had high expectations of this book and they were all surpassed after reading it. It is very moving and the story stays with you long after you've read it. It is also full of memorable scenes such as the one wherein Angel sleep walks with Tess in his arms.Read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles must be one of the most moving and beautifully written novels ever created. Hardy's writing doesn't just move the plot from one point to the next, it undulates and flows from season to season with Tess as her life flows from one point to the next. As has been pointed out in other reviews, it does have a good amount of pagan imagery and associations. Tess is dancing on May day (the first of May) when Angel and she first cross paths, Angel often calls her by the names of pagan godesses when he is wooing her at the dairy and she agrees to work for Farmer Groby until \\"Old Lady's Day.\\" The imagery that Hardy interweaves in the novel is even more pagan. Tess is virginal and innocent and hopeful, like a nymph or thing of nature. And even when she's no longer a virgin (a rather important event in the novel) she's still innocent and hopeful. Truly, she does not lose her hope until the very end and then she is allowed to regain it, if only momentarily. The hardest thing about reading this novel is that it is tragic, for Tess anyway, the whole way through. But that's the way Hardy meant it. And in the end it breaks your heart. But not in a melodramatic way, drawn out, Hollywood ending/Braveheart kind of way. More like the slice of the guillotine: quick, clean, but certainly not painless. It's definitely worth the time and effort to read this masterpiece of a novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Angel's perceptual turnabout comes a day late and a dollar short. In Hardy's Victorian world, the victim was the co-perpetrator. He had to justify to his audience that despite her technical loss of virginity, Tess was pure in essence. She was a victim of bad luck, particularly that of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. I loved when Irving Howe remarked that \\"Tess is...goodness made interesting.\\" Unfortunately, Tess never got to appreciate or even recognize her goodness. She was so full of (unmerited) shame and a sense of inferiority. Angel's liberalism and code of ethics gave way to censure, and he reinforced Tess's self-doubts. He could overlook her being a milkmaid from the fallen D'Urbeville lineage, but not a victim of rape. That even a man like Angel would be influenced by the Victorian attitude (and not recognize the timeless double standard) is Hardy's sharp social critique."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Several years ago when I was in high school we had to read The Mayor of Casterbridge (also by Hardy). I did NOT enjoy it under the circumstances, but decided to give Tess a try a few years later. I must say, it has certainly become one of my favorite all time books. Hardy really lets the reader see and feel what is happening in the lives of the characters. I must admit that I even shed a few tears at the end (something I rarely do while reading). This book is a must read for anyone who likes literature at all!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles,&quot; by Thomas Hardy, is a book about a young woman who struggles to find her place in society. When it is discovered that the low-class Durbeyfield family is in reality the d'Urbervilles, the last of a famous blood line that dates back hundreds of years, the mother sends her eldest daughter, Tess, to beg money from relations with the obvious desire that Tess wed the rich Mr. d'Urberville. Thus begins a tale of woe in which a wealthy man cruely mistreats a poor girl. Tess is taken advantage of by Mr. d'Urberville and leaves his house, returning home to have their child, who subsequently dies. Throughout the rest of this fascinating novel, Tess is tormented by guilt at the thought of her impurity and vows to never marry. She is tested when she meets Angel, the clever son of a priest, and falls in love with him. After days of pleading, Tess gives in to Angel and consents to marry him. Angel deserts Tess when he finds the innocent country girl he fell in love with is not so pure. This touching story depicts how difficult it was being a woman in the 1800s.There are many reasons to recommend &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; It is a story one can easily relate to. If anyone has ever suffered prejudice, then he/she will want to read this book. The book is also thought-provoking. &quot;Tess&quot; is also interesting in that the author gives the point of view of all the characters in it, not simply that of Tess. This means that the reader gets a better understanding of the plot. Thomas Hardy writes in an eloquent and descriptive manner.&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; does have perceived flaws. It has been described as rather verbose, but one finds that this is not the case, and that the details only add to the book. The plot is tragic, which might make it depressing to read. However, one finds that it is tragic in a beautiful and compelling sense, not in a sad sense. &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; is a book that will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I love the book but the size is very unwieldy.

For a modern love story containing these themes, check out Sophie Simons'l'Amour, available on Kindle."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I read this novel immediately after viewing the PBS Masterpiece Classic Theatre version starring Gemma Arterton as Tess. As the production follows faithfully all the key plot of the story, it really helped me with the book. In lieu of this, read the Wikipedia entry which outlines the plot in depth.The book is wonderful for analysis and discussion. There are many questions that can be created. The book has a lot of symbolism and foreshadowing.For instance, after Angel Clare and Tess marry, Angel finally learns from Tess why she has hesitated for so long to marry him. He mentions once that the only way he can feel released from his difficulty with her past is if Alex D'Urberville was no longer alive. One wonders if this is a seed planted in Tess' subconscious. Technically, Tess had no real functional reason to murder Alex. He was no woman beater, Angel had finally reached the point he needed to be in in order to accept Tess again, etc.The very first scene of the book is the cornerstone that starts the sealing of Tess' destiny and fate and nothing she does or doesn't do from then on can stay her from this. Her father's learning of the real family name of D'Urberville and not Derbyfield leads her to meeting up with Alex, her rape/seduction, subsequent pregnancy, inability of initially being able to marry the love of her life (Angel Clare), Angel's initial inability to live with his new wife, Tess' murder of Alex and her ultimate fate by a hanging execution.To me, the whole of the book is greater than it's individual parts. That is it's ultimate greatness. One can criticize the hugely long section of Angel and Tess' courtship at Talbothays Dairy where Angel/Tess seem to go on endlessly coming together and falling apart as Tess struggles with whether Angel can accept her if she tells him all the details of her past. (And then the subsequent hugely long time it took Angel to come to see a way to have a full married life and future with Tess.) But I took this time to appreciate Hardy's writing style, the way he uses Nature as a character in and of itself, to learn the real and authentic \\"what it was like to live\\" in that time in England, etc.I don't feel inclined to pass a negative judgment on Tess. In many ways she was the most moral, strong, and contemplative of everyone. Alex attempted to turn good by becoming a traveling evangelist but couldn't keep up the pretense. Angel, who rejected the more obviously suited to his moral viewpoints (Mercy Chant) to choose his more emotionally compatible love, Tess, had to undergo a huge personal struggle to rise above his concerns over what society would think of them. Angel's concerns were such that he states that even if they traveled as far off as America or Australia, that they couldn't be really certain Tess' past wouldn't come to affect them and even said it could continue to affect even the lives of their children. I really felt that Angel had the weakest courage of all the various main characters.Tess, on the other hand, continuously makes tough choices in life. At times, she uses pride to keep her head up and at other times, leaves pride aside to choose paths she feels benefits her family, her ability to be a good friend, to support herself honestly and the like. For her, love should conquer all and she struggles valiantly to understand Angel's point of view.I definitely will be reading more of Hardy's novels."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The shipper sent an email immediately that they were on vacation so would be cancelling the order. As I did not need the item immediately, I wish they would have just let me know it would be delayed instead of cancelling. I am glad, however, that they let me know. I would try them again. Good communication.A rating didn't really apply, but it wouldn't let me exit without one."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"My quirky yet brilliant English teacher assigned this work in the beginning of my senior year. Undoubtedly, I approached this book with much doubt and skepticism. If you know Hardy, you immediately recall his superfluity of detail and monotonous landscaping, which inevitably impedes character and plot development. Suprisingly, though all discouraging factors were present, I found the book exceptionally appealing. Hardy's portraiture of Tess validates him as a captivating author. He draws us into her persona, leaving us trampled and bruised with the grievances of life. He walks us through her struggles, though mangled with her inability to step forward, she still persists.I highly reccommend this book to any avid reader of British literature."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"How amazing. Thomas Hardy actually makes you fall in love with his leading lady, Tess, yourself. Other reviewers have complained she allowed herself to be walked on; that is not true. She had a deep sense of the (false) injury comitted to her husband and accepted what she percieved as justified punishment. Mr Hardy simply rips out your heart and makes you bleed with her. I don't expect your average high school student forced to read the novel for an assignment will agree, but as pleasure reading, this definitely has money on any modern day romance or drama."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"An utterly terrifying tale of a woman and her difficulties in life.

It is a novel, not a prose!! I wonder why the author had to waste bunch of pages expressing the emotions of the heroin? And I think Tess is terribly idiodic. Why should she continue to love her unforgiving and cruel husband? Isn't that such a degradation of female saying that they will always be loyal to the man no matter how the men desert them?

Hardy does indeed capture the English landscape fairly well into his somewhat lengthy, verbose paragraphs. But his plot (to be frank) stinks.The moment the reader meets Tess Durbeyfield he or she knows exactly what her fate will be. The book is a ridiculous web of intertwined coincidences which finally succeed not in giving the novel the air of a distinguished and accomplished work, but of a silly contrived plot line filled with poorly developed characters that could easily be crammed into 20 short pages. And the book might be all the better for it.The point is that after I read this book and labored through the hundreds of pages and looked up archaic English phrases and fluffy words that Hardy seemed to fill the pages with, I was struck at how much time I had wasted to learn so little, how disappointing it was to be forced to read so much obsequious symbolism and heinous happenstances.Don't read this book unless you have to. It isn't worth your time."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult.

I had no idea what I wanted, because she wouldn't allow me to read anything by Stephen King, and I had no other ideas for something worth reading. My friend suggested Tess of the D'bervilles, and so I took it from the school library.Unfortunately, I started reading it a week before I was supposed, and finished it the next day, and so I must choose another book to read for class.This is an excellent book that makes you think about what women had to go through a few hundred years ago. It makes you think about the complete lack of backbone shown in Tess untill the very end, when she finally realizes the injustices done to her were NOT her fault. You must remember that she had not been brought up to understand certain things, and could not have understood how to cope, or over come with problems that many women of her time had to face.The ending was excellent, and rather sad.If you enjoy learning about history, I suggest reading this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This book is tragic and wonderfully written. Hardy uses words to create a scene for you that creates the visual for you completely. I think that the sadest thing for me was to realize people did live like this, life really was that hard. As a 21st century woman I was outraged at the way that Tess was treated by men and by society. Who is the true bad guy, Alec or Angel? When we read it with our societies mores we perceive it one way, but if we were ken to the morals of that society how would we see it? Are they really dastards, or are they all just victims. I am not a scholar, I liked the story for being a good story.After reading the book I rented the A&amp;E movie. As I watched it, I realized how well the book translated into video, because I had already seen the exact same scenery in my mind. The only thing that surprised me was the bleakness of the trunip farm and Tesses horrible conditions. I couldn't imagine anything that awful.There are a lot of words, similar to DH Lawrence, but I wouldn't get rid of a one of them. If you come to this book as a great story and not as a classic novel, you will hold Tess to your heart and never forget her tragedies."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Tess. Many years ago, after completing a grueling mind-numbing week of exams in college I sat down to read this story, as a sort of reward for living through the previous five days. I have since read many of Hardy's novels, but Tess remains the dearest to me. Early on, in chapter 4, Tess is on a journey at night with her little brother Abraham and he is asking her if all the stars in the night sky are worlds similar to ours. She compares them to apples on a tree and concludes that most of them are &quot;splendid and sound - a few blighted&quot;. &quot;Which do we live on?&quot; asks Abraham. &quot;A blighted one,&quot; says Tess. Minutes later, their carriage crashes into some oncoming traffic... the family horse Prince is killed, and Tess is plunged through this incident into predicaments that will result in her complete undoing.Those who are familiar with Hardy will know of his fatalistic tendencies. His themes were not exactly &quot;jolly&quot;. And here, in the above incident he sets that ominous tone that is so omnipresent in his work. Tess is the story of an exceptionally gifted and beautiful peasant girl of decayed aristocratic stock who is betrayed by two men: one is the rich and sensuous Alec D'Urberville, the seducer of her body and for a while of her emotions; by him she has a child which dies in infancy. The other is the intellectual free-thinking son of a clergyman (Angel Clare), whom she loves with her whole being, and who abandons her when he hears, immediately after their marriage, of her earlier violation. Here is a picture of that Victorian double-standard that similarly condemned Hester Prynne in Hawthorne's &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot; Angel fully expects Tess to forgive his own past indiscretions (and she does), but he, in turn, will not forgive hers. More precisely, he flounders in his disillusionment, and cannot move from forgiveness to forgetness... as is obvious when he says to her in Chapter 35 &quot;O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another.&quot; The double-standard breaks our heart even as we read of it.And hearts are broken here. It is not until many years later that Angel realizes his error by pondering on the Biblical story of &quot;the wife of Uriah being made a queen&quot; (2 Sam.11:1-27). Realizing (a bit too late) that he had judged Tess by the deed rather than the will, he searches for the girl... only to find that the extreme poverty of her family has driven her back to the other man. So strong is Tess's love for Angel Clare, and so powerful her disgust at what Alec D'Urberville has forced her to become, that she kills Alec. Now husband and wife are re-united but on the run from the police, and they spend a few days of loving reconciliation before Tess is arrested, tried, sentenced to death for murder, and.... (read the book).Hardy considered this to be his finest novel, and claimed that Tess was the most deeply felt character he ever created. Originally published in 1891, it yet remains a timeless story of the power of love to overcome the most profound betrayal. Significant is Hardy's choice of the subtitle: &quot;A Pure Woman&quot;.&quot;...Poor wounded name! My bosom as a bed shall lodge thee.&quot; - Shakespeare -"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best books I have ever set my eyes upon. I have tried to finish the book in one sitting but found out that I can't because there is just so many things to figure out in the story. No doubt, fate plays such an important role in the life of Tess Durbeyfield and it is due to her noble descent that spawns the events leading to her own demise. The ending of the story is somewhat disturbing. Should we feel happy that Angel fufiled Tess's wish or should we feel sad for Tess?"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The great thing about Tess of the D'Urbervilles is the poetry and the depth of the main character.Tess is an extremely complex character and yet a very simple person. It is hard to explain her:Hardy seems totally in emphatuated with his character. She is a thing of beauty like a beautiful flower growing on the road side. The flower knows nothing of why it is or how it grows, and so Tess is naive of her existance and surroundings only driven by the knee-jerk of her emotion, egged on and commented on the romantic and love struck Hardy.Hardy makes a character , falls in love with her and then day-dreams about her. Guarding her innocence amd jealously defending it by - 1)making her so complex that no other character in the book can love ,know and understand her truely.2)She ends up tragic so no one else can have her. Thus destroying her and tearing himself away from his ideal.It is true he builds her up only to tear her down. Such a tragic figure makes the reader feel a lament amd deep sorrow for Tess having tried to fathom her whilst becoming enchanted by her.I found all of this made the book frustrating and it flawed the main character. It is a very difficult, long and hard book to read- which would have made the book very hard to write by anyone other than a very idealistic romantic poet. 4 stars because I am a romantic fool for Tess as well."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"There really isn't much I can add to what has already been said about this wonderful Thomas Hardy novel. One of the things that really struck me about Tess was the importance of setting and how Hardy relates Tess's emotional state to the setting in which she finds herself. The contrasting settings of Talbothays Dairy and Flintcomb-Ash seem to represent the opposing forces in Tess's own life.At Talbothays, the air is &quot;clear, bracing and ethereal,&quot; the river flows like the pure River of Life,&quot; and the atmosphere &quot;set up (Tess's) spirits wonderfully.&quot; For Tess, the valley where the dairy is located is akin to Paradise and she feels an emotional high while she is there.In the dairy, itself, the milkers form &quot;a little battalion of men and women,&quot; often &quot;singing songs to entice the cows to produce milk.&quot; Everyone works together to bring about a common goal, a common good. At Talbothays, Tess is able to escape the pressures and prejudices of Victorian England. She is at the peak of happiness in her life and falls in love and marries the intellectual and difficult Angel Clare.It is when her marriage to Angel fails, that Tess moves to the dreary and desolate Flintcomb-Ash. Flintcomb-Ash is in direct contrast to Talbothays. There is not a single &quot;green pasture,&quot; nor anything besides &quot;fallow and turnips everywhere&quot; at the &quot;starve-acre place.&quot; Here, Tess reaches a new emotional low and her heart is as empty and dark as the setting in which she finds herself. In contrast to the camaraderie at Talbothays, at Flintcomb-Ash, &quot;nobody come near (Tess)&quot; as she stands &quot;enshrouded in her uniform&quot; working &quot;hour after hour.&quot; The other workers at Flintcomb-Ash do not fare much better and most are kept busy in the fields in order to earn enough money to simply survive. There is no time for friendship in this place.Obviously, Hardy was a master at description and the use of setting to emphasize the emotional state of his characters, Tess in particular. Although this book is a masterpiece of sensual language, Tess is also a wonderful example of the use of contrasting settings to convey strong emotional states in a way that mere words alone never could. Tess is a book that should not be overlooked by anyone."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I am a Senior at Linville High School. I recently read Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles for my term paper. I chose it because a teacher told me it was very good. I was quite disappointed with the book in general. After reading the description on the back of the book, I inferred that Tess would be confronted with a problem, but being the &quot;heroine&quot; she was described as, she would overcome it victoriously. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her. The only thing that was good was the little surprises inserted every now and then. The whole book depressed me and I would rather not read another book of Hardy's again."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I decided to read this book after reading the Fifty Shades series....our main character in those books,Anastasia, refers to Tess several times and identifies with her. Anastasia of the Fifty Shades books is an English Lit. major...If you love history, and will immerse yourself in the times, you will enjoy reading, or re-reading this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Read this as an indulgence into the classics. Never appreciated in school but really loved it as a 40 something woman. Thomas Hardy for me is a slow and deliberate writer. The pace, the details, the development of the story is beautiful. Be good to yourself and read it."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess Durbeyfield is beset by guilt over the accidental death of one of her family's horses - a main source of family income. In an attempt to create a social connection and to gain financial assistance for her family, she entreats the d'Urbervilles to acknowledge an ancient familial connection. Unfortunately, Alec d'Urberville is taken with Tess and rapes her. Her life is haunted by his sexual assault from that point forward. Eventually, Tess begins to recuperate and finds employment elsewhere as a dairymaid. Her days as a dairymaid are happy and peaceful until she falls in love with Angel Clare. She agonizes over telling him of her tainted past, and when she confesses the truth on her wedding night, Angel is repulsed over her past and her deception of waiting to tell him. Tess is parted from her true love and never fully recovers, even when he returns to her.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is more than a sad story. It pays homage to the type of unhealthy family atmospheres that many children are raised in. The death of the horse is a direct result of her father's drunkenness and irresponsibility, though Tess never realizes this. When her parents hear of her misfortune, her mother reprimands her for not seeking marriage to the very man who raped her. The story also explores the mental effects that sexual assault can have on a person. Tess experiences extreme guilt, depression and feelings of unworthiness - common feelings for victims of sexual assault. In the end, as she is continually subjected to Alec d'Urberville, she experiences insanity which results in extreme actions.This particular edition included an introduction and notes about the text which I found helpful. However, I thought the girl on the cover did not resemble the maiden of the book. The girl on the front is plain and unremarkable, whereas, Tess, according to the text, is remarkable.I can see why this book is considered a literary classic, but I can't say I enjoyed it. That being said, I think everyone should read this book once. Tess is a memorable character that one can not help being fascinated with."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This book was absolutely brilliant!

It was just too slow...Tess took forever to make her mind up. Liked the descriptions and characters but so little in the way of action."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"It is easy to see why this book is considered a classic. To the modern reader, this tale of love and morality may seem like kid stuff at first glance (they talk about more serious situations in my niece's junior high sex education class).Hardy's genius is in his incisive character portrayals and the depictions of the social and moral structure of 19th century England. Tess and her feelings and decisions stay with you long after the last page is finished. I kept wishing we had read this in college so that I could have argued with someone about the moral themes."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is a startling book and one in which Tess is forced to make difficult decisions in the face of awful circumstances."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles plays out in Shakespearean tragedy-like fashion, but maybe there is more to the word tragic in the case of Tess, being that her problems are not self-inflicted, but more in line with blind fatalism. In fact, Hardy underscores the theme of injustice playing out in the common folk's lives, with Tess being the microcosm of ill-fated individuals. The book isn't an uplifting read, but who's to say that a tragic--or even downright depressing-- novel can't have power, essentialness, importance, and beauty. Some condemn this novel as being \\"boring and depressing\\", but I would argue that there is a beauty in Hardy's prose, as he such a power in its way of making Tess' story coming to life with poetic descriptions, and this adds such an element of pathos to passages depicting her fate. Despite her suffering and pitfalls, Tess is a tragic character you feel for by novel's end, and there's a sense that Hardy is sympathizing with his tragic heroine all along.When Tess' father learns of supposed relations with a family of nobility, this sets in motion a series of events which leads to Tess leaving her family to go work at the D'Urbervilles estate in hopes of getting in good with the family. Tess' foolish father sets the tone for the themes of poor calculations and mistiming repeated in the novel. As it turns out, Tess' family is not related to the D'Urbervilles (a fact which no one from the family realizes). Tess, while here, falls under the clutches of manipulative and superficial Alec D'Urberville. Returning home pregnant and somewhat disgraced, Tess experiences more setbacks when her baby, who she names Sorrow, falls sick and dies; she cannot even get a proper Christian burial for her baby. For the duration of the novel, Tess' existence is synonymous with an emotional rollercoaster. Just as she is mourning her loss, she then goes to another place to work, where she encounters Angel Claire, a man she saw previously at a dance. Slowly, the two begin to get to know each other and fall in love, although Tess, based on earlier experiences, is mostly resistant to the idea of marriage. Tess wants Angel to know about her earlier experiences, but has a difficulty bringing herself to tell him; finally, she attempts to leave a letter, but once again fate intervenes and Angel never sees the letter. After Angel wins her over, they decide to exchange their previous indiscretions after their marriage. However, as fate seems to plague Tess, Tess is more forgiving of Angel's previous affair with an older woman than his forgiving of her relations with Alec. He can't forgive her. There is a sadness experienced as Angel leaves Tess; perhaps we feel even more pity because we know that Angel, for all his goodness, is acting a bit too impulsive and rash, hypocritical at an important moment in Tess' life. While it is a sad scene, Hardy is able to evoke great power in this moment. Tess once again finds Alec and Angel later in the novel, and each character acts in line with their character, but, as others have alluded to, the stars just seemed to be against Tess, and she makes a foolish, hasty decision.Despite this range of pathos experienced, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a powerful, poetic read, one that moves you. Hardy takes on a ride of emotions through Tess' life, and, she becomes a sort of martyr for the injustices in the world, a point that Hardy insinuates throughout. Hardy can capture the essence of detail one moment, and then invoke humanity the next. Sure, it's not a picnic reading Tess, and it is a bit emotionally draining by end, but this is a deep, emotional novel that works on many levels, one that has stood the test of time for a reason. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one novel I'm glad is required reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I know this is great literature, and I'm glad I finally read Tess of the D'Urbervilles, but I could not get past the fact that our plucky heroine Tess is a bit of a twit. While the injustices done to her may have reduced a lesser person to perpetual self-pity, Tess actually comes out the hero and pulls herself together, making a real life for her away from her family and her tormentor, Alec D'Urberville. It's only when she meets, falls in love, and marries Angel Clare that she begins acting the twit, the fool, and the loser. For some bizarre reason, she decides to be excruciatingly honest with her newly-wed husband (on their wedding night, no less), about her past trouble, involving apparently a rape, and her child born out of wedlock. I suppose it's hard for modern audiences to understand Angel's reaction (leaving her) when he realizes that she is not a virgin. Ah yes, the hypocrisy of Victorian culture. I understand that there's a huge sub-text going on in this novel about the social hypocrisy of the Victorian age, but it doesn't make sense that our formerly plucky Tess would now allow herself to fall to pieces.Great story, in all. The writing itself, however, is not great. Hardy's prose is really rambling, roundabout, and he just does not get to the point. Sure to wear out even the most patient modern reader. So, great literature, although Tess is a twit and the writing itself is rambling."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The most depressing book in the English language. And yet, I think I was the only person in my high school English class that actually liked it. Does this mean I'm depressed? We'll leave that question for my analyst and just say I think I have a thing for melodramatic novels.Tess starts out a poor peasant girl with a drunk father and a stupid mother. After their only horse dies, they send her to their rich \\"relations\\" the D'Urbervilles, to beg for work. Her supposed cousin, Alec, rapes her and she has his child. The child dies in infancy and Tess leaves home to seek a new life and better work at a sunny dairy farm. At the dairy farm, she falls in love with a clergyman's son, Angel Clare and they get married. On their wedding night, he tells her he is not as virtuous as his name, that he went on a bender in London and slept with a prostitute. She says \\"That's great, because I'm not a virgin either - now forgive me.\\" And he's like, \\"Um, no. My hypocritical moral beliefs will not allow me to be with a woman who is 'impure'. Here's some money. I'm going to Brazil to be a farmer.\\"So he leaves her and she wanders the land again searching for work and a new life. She's doing back-breaking labor for little money on this awful farm when who should show up but...Alec D'Urberville, her rapist cousin. He's found Jesus -- until he sees Tess's face again, and then he goes back to smoking cigars and being a general d-bag. He tries to get her to marry him, so he can possess her legally. She says no multiple times, until her father dies, leaving her family with no home and no money. So her mother sells her into marriage with Alec (This is the point in the novel when you, the reader, start thinking that suicide would be a good option for Tess).Who should show up next, but Angel Clare! He's back from Brazil, having realized what a hypocrite he is. He finds Tess and begs her to be with him -- she tells him it's too late. After Angel leaves, Tess kills Alec with a bread knife. Then Tess runs after Angel, tells him what she's done and asks him to forgive her -- again. He's like \\"Whatever, we gotta get outta here. You're on the lam now.\\" So they run away and get as far as Stonehenge before the fuzz catch up with them, arrest Tess, then execute her for her crimes. The End.A fun, feel-good novel for the whole family."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Hardy writes beautifully, tells stories, evokes feelings and describes landscapes, times and cultures that touch the reader's core.Read this novel for the story and description, savor it later for the depth of existential questions and half-answers. Hardy is an early modernist, raising the big questions, describing the loss of classical innocence and hinting at potential paths to solutions. But, he does not provide definitive answers. His work suggests that the time of certain answers is permanently gone, to be replaced by a difficult journey, at best.Man has a burning need for significance and meaning, but can find neither fully. Character is the most important thing, shining through all situations ... but it is partially shaped by fate, chance, history, family, society and the environment ... and while potentially noble, ultimately inadequate to fully address the challenges of life.The reader leaves the book exhausted from the journeys, the hopes and the many pursuits. The flow of life and history continues in spite of the heroine's choices. In the end we are left with a bittersweet memory of this life which Hardy personally inserts as narrator, \\"will never be forgotten by those who knew her\\".Perhaps this is the best current answer to the ultimate questions."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles may be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel and would certainly be almost anyone else's. A dark, sweepingly tragic vision, it is a masterpiece in nearly every area: characterization, plot, meaningful themes, prose, and more.Hardy is well-known for being depressing, and this may be his most depressing novel. The structure of his dark novels is greatly influenced by Greek tragedy, and this is probably his most purely tragic. Many have thought of him as taking a near-malevolent attitude toward characters like Tess, who indeed seems born only to suffer. The concatenation of dire circumstances engulfing her is truly stunning, and perhaps even more notable is the ceaseless way in which they flow together to wreak the greatest possible devastation. Hardy is famous - or infamous, depending on whom you ask - for complex plotting and melodramatic coincidence, and this has some of his most highly wrought examples. Tragedy of this extent requires a very deft hand to pull off well; it is all too easy to become hyperbolically implausible or even melodramatically corny. However, Tess is so well planned and finely executed that the events unfold not only with verisimilitude but almost with inevitability.This last is another distinct Hardy characteristic. He had long been an agnostic by, abandoning belief in a benevolent overseeing power - nay, in any force that took account of humanity at all. Added to this was a profound awareness of human insignificance and a consequent absence of conventional meaning. However, he wrote nearly throughout his artistic career about a concept that he eventually came to find very plausible - the Imminent Will, a blind force controlling the fate of humanity and perhaps all else. Hardy is also generally considered a naturalist - a writer depicting environment as a crucial, almost insurmountable force in shaping personality and destiny. Like all of his greatest fiction, Tess dramatizes this vividly, portraying characters unable to escape wretched circumstances and even more wretched fates. Such ideas held great sway with nineteenth century writers and thinkers but was almost entirely replaced by existentialism. Few will now agree with the shadowy forces underpinning the book's tragedy, but the dramatization is so well-done and stunning that it will at the very least provoke thought about important philosophical and theological issues - and of course bring admiration for Hardy's great artistry.As all this suggests, the novel is incredibly moving. One would be very hard-pressed to find a more pathos-drenched story, and Hardy runs us through a dark emotional gamut. Much of this has to do with the character of Tess, generally considered Hardy's best and seemingly his favorite. The subtitle calls her \\"A Pure Woman,\\" and so she is in a sense; an innocent, nave, and ignorant country girl of the kind no longer possible in the developed world, she is far closer - in spirit and otherwise - to people from civilization's first few thousand years than anyone from the last century or so. Hardy plays up her symbolic worth, making her a sort of Eve and giving her many pagan goddess elements. He is well-known for his heroines and generally for depictions of women far removed from Victorian stereotypes. Though not current feminist ideals, they stood out as strong individuals with real feelings and thoughts; Hardy's gender and sexuality views were well ahead of his time, greatly influencing his portrayals. Tess is his most famous, fully realized, and complex example. The most obvious sense in which she is pure is sexually and otherwise morally, but she is not the virginal domestic queen of most Victorian fiction. The pivotal scene in which she loses virginity is deliberately ambiguous, leaving it unclear if she is raped or seduced. Either way it is a sort of reverse Genesis story, as the pure woman is made impure - by Victorian standards - by a worldly, sensualistic man.Hardy uses this dramatic scene and its aftermath to boldly confront gender and sexuality issues that had always been central to his artistic concerns. He pushed the proverbial envelope in these areas from the start, often facing censorship and always struggling to get his point across in print. A few years before Tess he wrote a famous letter saying his goal was to destroy the doll in English fiction in order for England to have a fiction at all, and Tess was his bravest and most direct attempt. She is in many ways a simple village girl but is not unaware of her beauty, and Hardy was one of the very first modern writers to even acknowledge that women could experience sexuality. We must remember this was several years before Freud revolutionized this area and also keep in mind that this was a time when statues were covered and it was not socially permissible to even mentions legs or ankles. Women were idealized as non-sexual beings meant only for domesticity and with no thoughts beyond it. It is now near-impossible to appreciate just how daring the character was or adequately convey her impact. Hardy's depiction and the issues he uses her to discuss made him world famous - the talk of high society and casual conversation as well as the literary world. For example, in his autobiography, he recalls how a society hostess told him she seated guests according to whether or not they sympathized with Tess and then had them debate. The novel received many glowing reviews but also about as many condemning it as perversely immoral. Hard as it is to believe since it was positively pass&eacute; even a few decades later, many thought it nothing less than pornographic - and a shockingly bad influence to boot. Perhaps the greatest sign of how much things have changed is that Roman Polanski's faithful 1979 film version was rated PG in the UK.This was clear reactionary hyperbole from a society so repressive that it had become pathologically hypocritical. Tess was a long overdue wake-up call. Victorians were essentially scandalized by the idea - from a man! - that it might not be a woman's fault if she is raped or seduced. This would be laughable if it were not so sad, but their offense hardly ended here. The novel vividly portrays the plight of many women at the time, especially lower class ones. Far too many women unfortunately identified strongly with Tess' problems: unsought attention from higher-class men that may have been flattering but was above all confusing; pregnancy resulting from rape or seduction without a father to raise or even acknowledge the child; suffering at the hands of grossly unfair sexual double standards from prospective and actual husbands; and, perhaps worst of all, consequent ostracism not only from society but often even from family and friends. Hardy was astounded by how many women, including quite a few high society ones, wrote him saying they were in Tess' position or a very similar one and how much the book meant to them. All this shows how strikingly well the novel dramatized contemporary issues; it is in many ways a novelistic equivalent of Henrik Ibsen's contemporaneous \\"problem plays\\" dealing with current social problems.This was a large part of the reason for Tess' impact and success, but the book would not still be so widely read and appreciated if it were the only feature. As Hardy envisioned, time has proven him right and the reactionaries wrong; the violent outbursts are now seen as perversely fascinating and mildly amusing historical curiosities, but the book's themes shine at least as brightly as ever. Feminists have unsurprisingly long had great interest in Hardy and this novel particularly, which has many themes of note to them and numerous others. Sexuality and morality aside, Tess strikes a somewhat subtle but ringing chord for women's rights via its bleak depiction of their woefully low Victorian status. Hardy movingly and accurately shows how barren life was for women, especially intelligent ones; there was not only a dearth of intellectual stimulation but hardly any stimulation at all. Sexual politics are still hotly debated and may never be resolved, but hard as it may now be to believe, rural women at the time of the novel's setting were actually kept in such ignorance that it was possible for them to not be aware of seduction even as a concept. The novel shows the tragic consequences that could so easily result from this and associated complications. Perhaps more importantly, and even more movingly, the novel also shows the grinding poverty that many rural English women faced. Worse still, it starkly portrays the consequent necessity of earning money without training, help, or encouragement. Hardy sometimes goes into considerable detail to describe the farm labor that girls like Tess had to turn to, putting particular emphasis on then-new machinery. Some may find this somewhat boring, but the point is well taken, especially as the infernal imagery used to describe the machines is particularly emphatic and highly symbolic.This leads in to some of Tess' other themes, giving the novel relevance to many with no particular interest in women's issues. Rural poverty in general - a perennial Hardy theme - is on grim display, letting readers see just how much life has improved for farmers and other laborers in the last century plus. Hardy's work is also notable for showing what one critic calls \\"the ache of modernity,\\" and Tess possibly depicts it most painstakingly and memorably. It is important to remember that Hardy grew up in a world without automobiles, electricity, railroads, and many other modern conveniences that were beginning to appear when the novel was written. Tess shows how such innovations were slowly filtering into rural England, profoundly changing a society that had altered little since the Early Middle Ages. It is thus of significant historical and sociological interest.Relatedly, and as always with Hardy, place is of great importance. Perhaps no one equals him in depicting settings with such close detail and vividness that they become an integral part of the story; setting is never mere backdrop in Hardy. Tess is one of his Wessex novels depicting the part-real, part-dream country, based on his native Southwest England, that he made world famous. We get a good idea of what Hardy country looked like and how its people lived. The landscape is not as important as in some Hardy novels, but we still get an unforgettable depiction of a bygone era.But the novel is great over and above all this; one can indeed love and appreciate it without knowing any of these factors. The engrossing and profoundly moving story is a large part of this, but Tess herself is at least as important. One of literature's most sympathetic characters, readers have found her irresistible from the start. It is often said that Hardy's depiction is so idealized that he almost seems to be in love with her - and there are indeed some interesting biographical stories behind the claim -, but beauty is only one of the factors making her memorable. Hardy describes her so minutely and reveals her inner thoughts with such breathtaking force that she seems truly alive in a way very few characters do. Labeling her \\"Pure\\" caused more controversy than any other element, and perhaps all will still not agree, but it would be very hard to find another character so much more sinned against than sinning. Some of her thoughts and actions may seem extreme - or, in our greatly changed society, perhaps absurdly nave -, but only the few who have suffered comparable sorrows can say what they would do in her situation. It would take a very hard heart indeed not to feel for Tess, and the strength of her characterization, along with gut-wrenching depiction of her downward spiral, continues to fascinate and move readers - and indeed viewers, as the novel has been filmed no less than seven times and also been adapted into numerous plays, operas, etc. - more than a century after she first became a sensation.Nor is she the only worthwhile character; Tess has perhaps Hardy's largest, most varied, and most interesting cast. Though set almost entirely in Wessex, we get a good cross section of humanity: Angel Clare, who is intelligent and sensitive but selfish; his father, who is a Christian in the truest sense and a rare example of Hardy depicting a minister positively; Alec D'Urberville, the kind of hedonistically and hypocritically evil man who habitually preyed on girls like Tess; Tess' father, an alcoholic and possibly insane deadbeat of the kind who may first seem harmless and even comical but who inadvertently lead many rural families to ruin; and Tess' mother, who though well-meaning, has a combination of harsh practicality and ignorance leading to near-Machiavellian scheming that often has unforeseen negative consequences. Characterization is not Hardy's acknowledged strength, but this proves that he was on par with the greatest writers here as well as elsewhere.Another of the book's biggest and most easily recognizable assets is incredible prose. Hardy was a poet at heart, and it shows. An autodidact, he has a distinct style with a strong self-taught air that can be hard for current readers to immediately grasp; his eccentric vocabulary, full of archaisms and \\"dictionary words,\\" and his heavy use of dialect can easily make his work seem stilted and older than it is. However, this is the apex of his prose as prose; its beauty and power are simply undeniable. Though a very dark novel, the writing often reaches heights of sublime beauty, and philosophical asides about humanity's insignificance, the absence of providence, fate's apparent malice, and social stigmas' drastic effects are immaculately phrased and stunningly forceful. The narration during Tess' lonely ride, the short segment with her son, and the final chapter is almost unmatched in literature, and the writing throughout is incredibly strong - so much so, indeed, that the book would be worth reading for it alone.In reality, of course, there are many other reasons. Elevated prose and other complexities may mean it is not the best Hardy introduction, and new readers would probably be better off with more accessible masterpieces like The Return of the Native or The Mayor of Casterbridge. Some who have read Tess first have also said they found it so depressing that they vowed never to read Hardy again, but its undeniable greatness forced nearly all to break the vow. Thus, whether you read Tess first or not, Hardy is a must read for any serious lover of literature, and Tess is at or near his considerable summit."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"There are many good things I could say about this novel: it is excellently written, the characters are vivid, the message is clear and important, the setting is richly textured and gives a detailed glimpse into the past, and it is never boring.Yet, one thing I cannot say is that it was a fun read. Even in the essay in the back of my copy of the novel, critic Irving Howe admits that, \\"The book begins to mobilize and direct large masses of tension which, until the last page, will make the reading of it an experience slow and grueling, a drain upon emotion.\\" There is such a ludicrous amount of tension and tragedy in this novel that reading it is a stressful experience. In a way, it reflects how *good* the author is, because he made me care so much about the characters that I wanted to throw the book against the wall when one of them did something stupid. Finally finishing the novel created a feeling of palpable relief.Despite how stressful it was for me to read this book, I still appreciate its many qualities. There is just something about the characters and the compassionate voice of the author that is very moving, and will surely linger in my mind."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I bought it because it was mentiones so much in Fifty shades of gray, that I had to know Tess!

We read this book in class, and the book wasn't bad, but that is a hard thing to tell when you haven't read through the book because your english teacher doesn't encourage it enough because the students make the quizes for each phase. EVERYONE cheated. It was good. If she spent more time on teaching correctly rather than perming and afro-ing her hair, maybe we'd have enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"All I could say when I finished the book was, WOW. The rigid 1800s society and the wickedness of Alec were what really killed Tess by increments, but through it all she was a noblewoman in the truest sense. Thomas Hardy creates a strong female character that is sure to continue to stand the test of time with flying colors."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Truly an excellently written book. From the very beginning, Tess comes alive. Her parents are witless drunks with two many children, and Tess must care for them. When news comes to her idiot of a father that once the Durbeyfields were the D'Ubervilles, a family with a famous past, money and land, her life takes some terrible turns.One of the best things about this book is that it is not happy-go-lucky. When terrible things happen to her, Tess has no where to go. If you want to see what life for women was like, you can easily find out through Tess.The end is very unexpected, and absolutely perfect, and very satisfying as well. I didn't need to know what happened next, I wasn't dying to read a sequel, I was content.For you people who love happy books, that have happy endings, middles, everything- read something by Jane Austen. If you are into reality, check this book out."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is possibly the saddest novel I have ever read. I have been thinking about it ever since I finished it. Few novels have evoked so much emotion in me. Tess makes me feel sad, frustrated, and angry.Tess of the Durbervilles is the story of Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of poor, alcoholic parents who learn that they are of a noble bloodline and send Tess off to work for her noble \\"cousin\\" Alec Durberville. While there, Alec rapes Tess and she has his illegitimate baby. This event ruins Tess's life. She is no longer pure, and virginal, and therefore brings shame upon her true love Angel Clare when her past is revealed.It is hard to believe, in this day and age, that Tess is shamed and ostracized because she was the victim of a horrible crime. Hardy's novel is a powerful statement on the questionable morality of Victorian society. Tess, who is a heroic, brave, caring, selfless woman, is not worthy of Angel because she is somehow impure due to the rape. Angel, who has lived with a woman out of wedlock and is clearly not a virgin himself, feels justified in punishing Tess when he learns of her past.The writing is beautiful, but the story tragic. It will stay with you a long time."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I love all of Hardy's books but this is my favorite thus far. The ending is definately not what I expected and I could not stop thinking about it for days afterward. It is a break from his earlier works in that things do not really turn out for the better in the end. In typical Hardy style, people and events in the main characters past come back to bite her in the behind at the worst moments. This story is like a powder keg which is gradually packed over time until the fuze is lit and everything explodes into a million pieces."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I think Thomas Hardy is an interesting mixture of romantic poet and social realist novelist although his dramas take place in primarily rural settings. The poetic strain in Hardy's temperament makes him romanticize some of the same things the romantic poets did. For instance few settings in his work are more powerfully evocative than a ruin. And his sense that we are at the mercy of both nature and our own emotions makes reading a Hardy novel a bit like reading romantic poetry. So if you like romantic poetry especially the bleaker of those poems you will like Hardy's novels. Tess was made into a great film by Roman Polanski in 1979(and another more recent film version appeared on A&amp;E) and it is hard for a Victorian novel to compete with that kind of entertainment but what the novel has that the movie versions do not is Hardy's descriptions of landscape. You may remember a scene from the (Polanski)movie when Tess is walking through a field and as beautiful as that scene was visually it is even more beautiful to read Hardy describe it poetically linking Tess to nature in a very sensuous prose passage. Hardy is not known for his optimism ( most romantics aren't after all so very optimistic) and both his prose and poetry seem to seek out the starkest surrondings and settings to offset and emphasize the fleeting nature of those rare moments of beauty. If you like spending time in the country this novel is a kind of hike back in time and into the countryside where men and women live out their days affected by forces they cannot altogether explain and that conspire in ways that do not lead down the rosiest of paths. Most of the men in this novel are weak, but Tess's strength which is perhaps linked to her heritage makes this an unusual and powerful story. She is perhaps the best bit of poetry Hardy ever came up with. She is certainly the strongest thing ever to appear in a Hardy landscape."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I will admit that I read this for an advanced high school English class last year, making me one of those notorious 'immature high school reviewers.' However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Much else has been said. Hardy in this book describes better than anyone I have ever read, the experience of being in love. Not one sentence, not one paragraph and not one scene: It is full of the description-excellent....

It's insane-driving."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"After many years of reading and prodding classics in my courses, Tess of the Durbervilles was not at all a book I wanted to read.

Such a tale!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy really outdid himself with the creation of this novel. Tess is the quintessential protagonist to pity, sympathize with, and root for. Wronged by at least three men--her father, her cousin, and her husband--she remains pure in every sense by the corporeal. There is an overriding sense of despair that pervades the novel. Yet, what's a Hardy novel without that feeling?With this book, Hardy solidified his place as my favorite author. The author's ability to perfectly describe the English countryside, the charm, yet provinciality of the country folk, and the repressiveness of Victorian morals, makes this book one of his best. His subtlety often makes the reader question what it is that he just read, and leaves many things open to interpretation. Thus, as with many good texts, rereading it might lead to different understandings of different scenes that took place.All in all, there are few books that I have read that have made me want to give up sleep just to read them. I adored Tess, and I adore this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I am collecting the Penguin cloth covered books. These classic books look awesome in a bookcase.

Now on my kindle fire and will go with me everywhere."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" tells of the titular heroine; a simple rural girl who, because of her beauty and gentle, trusting nature, is used and abused by those around her. The story begins when her impoverished family is informed that they are descended from a local wealthy clan. Her family sets about trying to better their situation by having Tess approach their distant relatives; unfortunately, this decision results in Tess meeting the devious Alec d'Uberville, who agrees to help Tess, with the intent of seducing her. Despite being the victim, Tess is the one who will pay over and over again.Hardy has created a genuine masterpiece. The characters are complex - even the seemingly simple Tess. The incredibly sad story is used to explore human nature and the ways in which people treat each other. I found myself highlighting passage after passage of the book and noting the fundamental human truths Hardy describes. I was particularly struck by a passage in which, after her seduction, Tess ponders, \\"The past was past; whatever it had been, it was no more at hand. Whatever its consequences, time would close over them.\\" She further muses, \\"To all mankind besides, [she] was only a passing thought. Even to friends she was no more than a frequently passing thought.\\" How true, but unfortunately, Tess' past would never stop haunting her.When Tess meets the aptly names Angel Clare, she thinks that she has finally put the past behind her. Angel accepts her unquestioningly. Once again, though, fate intervenes and Tess is made to suffer for her past misdeeds, which are not really even misdeeds. At times, her victimhood is a bit much, and Tess appears weak, but her treatment is reflective of the sexual mores of the time, and Tess's willingness to endure mistreatment to protect her family and others is noble. The plot marches toward tragedy, with Tess managing to miss every opportunity for happiness. A truly devastating book.Note: This review is for the Kindle Duke Classics version. The text has fairly few noticeable errors aside from a few scattered misspellings. Occasionally, a paragraph has not been indented properly. However, these problems are minor and do not impinge much on the reader. The only major issue is that the Table of Contents is not linked, which is a hassle with such a long book.

I read a lot of books on my Kindle and am very happy with it, but there is something so very seductive and special about this hardover edition with the pretty sheaves of wheat (red, of course...that crops up a lot in this story!) and I love the little red satin bookmark that is included.

Tess Durbeyville is a poor girl in rural Wessex. Her father is a drunk with a weak heart. Her mother is childish and her parental skills are sadly lacking. Tess is the leader of the family. Her father learns their family descends from the aristocratic but decadent D'urberville clan who came to Britain with William the Conqueror. Tess visits a nouveau riche branch of the family. She is quickly seduced, drugged and becomes pregant by the evil Alec D'urberville.Tess returns to her family in disgrace. She baptizes the illegitimate child Sorrow who dies soon after birth. Tess travels to a a dairy owned by the Cricks. Here she meets Angel Clare the nonbelieving son of a ruralclergyman. Complications and irony ensue as in all Hardy's well plotted novels. Angel is a weak man who is a fallen angel on what Hardy calls this blighted star (earth). I did not care for him or his pious family!The culmination of the novel comes when Tess murders Alec; flees with Angel; is captured at Stonehenge and is hanged for murder. These are the plot developments but Tess is so much more.The book is a poetic prose masterpiece. Hardy the countryman provides rich evocations of the English countryside yielding its pristine beauty to the coming industrial age. Reapers and trains are intrusions into old Wessex's slow progress of the bucolic season. Throughout the novel I appreciated Hardy's hatred of killing animals and birds such as the poignant incident of the dying pheasants in a field following a wantonhunting expedition by humans. Tess too is hunted, hounded and caged like a bird entraped by her dire circumstances.Hardy fell in love with the fictional Tess. Who is she? She is woman!An earth mother; sacrificial victim; a panther; a temptress; an innocent country girl; a pagan goddess sprung from the soil of England; a mysteriious presence who is often pictured in the fog and mists. Tess dreams as does a fairy tale princess. Tess is a woman of strong passions inherited from the D'urberville family who kills and loves, laughs and sings, cries and rejoices in the complicated and tragic life she is given.The prudery of Victorian England disdained Tess causing Hardy much pain. He often had to change the text of the novel to assuage the prim souls of his editors. And yet Tess lives in the minds of the reader as the acme of his creation of memorable female characters. One can never really understand the multifaceted Tess; we can simply spend time with this fascinating witch and madonna. Tess will live forever in the minds of all of us who consider Hardy a genius."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess's father, Mr. Durbeyfield, is told by a minister that his family is the direct lineage of an old, noble family that was once thought to be completely gone. There's nothing left of the family's land and fortune, except the family name (d'Urberville).However, Mr. Durbeyfield and his wife see this as a chance to move up on the social ladder. They devise a plan to send their daughter to become acquainted with a rich woman who's last name is d'Urberville. From then on, Tess is left to try to maintain her dignity and honor and to pick up the pieces of her broken life that resulted from her parents' need to be important.This is my first time reading anything by Thomas Hardy. I was warned that he was cynical man, and I'll agree that Hardy's prose is cynical, yet heartrending. I couldn't help feeling bad for Tess through all her troubles. This is not a happy novel. For a moment, you think that things will get better for Tess, but the fates seem to be against her.The landscape of the novel changes with the mood of what's happening. The land itself almost seems to be a living person that he described.He uses vivid, beautifully described imagery to describe people and places in his novels. There are themes of theology (Hardy had internal conflicts with believing in God), virtue, the boundaries of love. He employs everything from Greek mythology to modern (or what was modern in his day) poetry.There are no illusions of a happily-ever-after in this story. This was simply a beautiful novel, a novel that portrays its female heroine as the strong woman she was. She could put more modern women heroines to shame."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place. In fact, it is essential to the storyline.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and it made me think and reflect on the values that I believe are truly important."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Since Hardy can be rather boring in his poetry, I expected that I wouldn't even be able to finish this book. On the contrary, as soon as I had started to read it, I couln't put it down! This is a work of great depth and Hardy has an amazing way of expressing himself, one that really captures the imagination (like Dickens)! I heartily recommend this book for anyone, Victorian-lover or not. The articles are also highly illuminative; this book is definitely worth reading more than once!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I had Peglet's experience when reading this book (and &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; as well). I recommend, as she does, that the reader not try to empathize with the characters; it'll make you too angry. I wanted to reach into the book and strangle Angel a few times, for reasons that are obvious to anyone who has read the book.I must point out that one reviewer has stated incorrectly that Tess was &quot;raped.&quot; If she had been, the book would not have had the force it does. It would have just been another &quot;victim of society&quot; or &quot;victim of men&quot; book. Take a close look at Tess' confession to Angel on their wedding night.Think of this book not as an indictment of marriage and Victorian mores (although it certainly was meant to be, as &quot;Jude&quot; further develops), but rather look at it as the relationships of three people who are never quite able to understand themselves and their natures well enough to avoid disaster. An excellent book. But once again, don't try to empathize with the characters."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"When is pain the necessary entry price for involving oneself in great fiction, and when is it simply something you might call \\"author abuse\\"? I believe the tipping place can be found somewhere in the pages of Thomas Hardy's most famous novel.In it, we meet young Tess Durbeyfield, a simple English farm girl who struggles to make it through everyday life. Her father, convinced he's the rightful heir of an extinct family of Norman nobles, the D'Urbervilles, is a shiftless layabout who drinks and lets his numerous children do his chores. The family starves quite pitifully until fate puts in the first of several appearances. Tess meets a rich young bravo who goes by the D'Urberville name and decides to merge his bloodline with that of Tess, no matter what she thinks about that.Alec D'Urberville is one of two men whose attentions cause Tess much heartache and make up the substance of the book. Actually, there are three such men if you count Hardy, which I pretty much do. Alec is a right cad and Angel Clare, the other man, manages the impressive feat of being much worse, but neither lays for Tess the snares Hardy does, of horrible coincidences, contrived reverses in character, and way too much tolerance for ill treatment. There's even a letter-swallowing carpet. Man, I hate when carpets do that!When Hardy isn't pounding poor Tess into the ground, he's doing the same to us, pointing out how Tess in her misery represents the nullity of our common existence. \\"She might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly - the thought of the world's concern at her situation - was founded on an illusion,\\" he writes. \\"She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a structure of sensations, to anyone but herself.\\"If only!Here's the rub. \\"Tess\\" is a pretty pleasing book to read if you manage to ignore or at least discount the plot. Hardy writes with great verve and knowledge about the world of his characters, fictional Wessex with its villages of hayricks and barn dances. At times it's like reading Wordsworth, and at others it's like reading Lovecraft. I don't know how else to describe a writer who can wax so lyrical and then shift into something darkly surreal and macabre without missing a beat. He was a master of description at the height of his powers in 1891 when he published this.\\"Tess\\" is also a deep book, with much Biblical allusion and symbolic foreshadowing matted into the subtext. Reading the novel with an online study guide helps bring out a rich harvest of Hardy's learned genius, as you can see the careful layering and connecting up he does throughout the book.Alas, it doesn't make the story itself any more digestible.Tess herself is hard not to care for, but she's frustratingly passive in a way that can not be blamed simply on the time and place where her story is set. She seems more of a piece with something Hardy was trying to say of the human condition, of suffering being one's lot in this vale of tears. You keep hoping things will turn around, but pretty soon you see the author has other ideas. Hardy pretty much wants her to suffer, so she does.Maybe in some imaginary alternative existence, I'll be treated to the scene of Hardy being called to some kind of literary court of law, answering for the misery he put me through here. I'll gladly waive my charges against him - only if they let me watch when it's Tess's turn to collect."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Ubervilles is sooo tragic! I can't even... So good, so romantic... so sad... so wonderful. Shakespeare's tragedies never EVER touched me like this! Promise me you'll read it! Just promise me!The most I can say in the way of analysis right now (and having just finished this story I probably shouldn't be writing this review with tears and the utter agony of human love and despair both streaming down my face) is that Tess is a classically tragic tale of what might have been but could never be. I hate to write anything so simple in the way of anyalyzing anything this vast, and there is no ONE LAYER or way of reading this story, but this to me is the overriding principle.That, at least, and the concept of what does it mean to be a pure woman/person? Clearly Tess was pure, even in light of all that had happened to her. What a fool Angel was to let such a treasure slip out of his hands, and what a hypocrite! I know I'm understanding this from an American, 21st century way of thinking, but come on, Angel?! Seriously!? You don't blame the victim for their crime, and YOU had done the same thing WILLINGLY! Blame yourself for bringing her to this end, you and the elitist group of fools you come from (author's note: I realize it's not very sound to be venting so much rage on a fictional character, especially one in a story particularly designed to make a social comment about the day in which it was written, but seriously, why didn't he just scoop her up in his arms and run away with her when he had the chance? Bad form, Angel! Bad form!)."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I went into \\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.\\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this \\"modern\\" society."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I read Tess of the D'Ubervilles two years ago. I have read several of Hardy's novels and this is his best work. I recommend that everyone should read this novel.I am somewhat confused on some of the low ratings of this book and do not agree with the opinion of Tess. Tess is a strong woman who has weathered through some tough adversaries and situations. As with many books written in this time period, many women are weak, can not handle themselves and require a husband - not so with this novel.At the time this book was originally published there was much controversy and reviewers were very negative against Hardy (he stopped writing novels after bad reviews of Jude The Obscure). This is unfortunate since this novel teaches us many things about life and respecting people even after 105 years.Update:I have read most of Hardy's novels and still believe that Tess of the D'Ubervilles is his best work. I have since bought the Hardy complete poem edition by Palgrave and am looking forward to reading his poems (I like some poetry but not a total fan; I am sure I will his poems)."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The popularity of Hardy's Tess makes me wonder why the apparent context in which the book was written seems to have been lost. Twelve years before Hardy's Tess hit the shelf George MacDonald's Paul Faber: Surgeon received a less controversial if almost equally popular release. While the two books could hardly be more different it is interesting that the fundamental plot elements are identical. A careful comparison of the scene in both books immediately following the confession of the recently-married protagonist of her youthful indiscretion to her unforgiving husband will reveal a passage where Hardy essentially quotes from MacDonald--and then flatly contradicts him. MacDonald's Faber is a longer, more complex story--perhaps less accessible than Hardy's. Where Hardy finds despair, cynicism, and ultimately destruction, MacDonald mercifully provides forgiveness, hope, and evidence of the divine in humanity.Other reviewers have heartily recommended that you read Tess to discover how accurately great literature can portray life's struggles. If you liked the authenticity and poignancy of Tess but felt there must be another side of the story, please read Paul Faber."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is a wonderful story, it left me thinking instead of my usual forgetting about it 5 minutes later. The characters are intriging, and the story is interesting, making me not want to put it down. I (being only in high school) would definitly suggest that you read it."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"For English class, we wre assigned to read Tess. I love to read, but however was skeptical about this book. Once I started to read it, I just couldn't stop; I finished he whole thing way before deadline. I found the story incredibly intriguing, and the feelings and emotions so real I found myself throwing the book down in anger, screaming &quot;Darn it Tess, just marry him!&quot; But i always picked it back up to see what would happen. It thorouhly engrossed me."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I had difficulty at first staying with the book but after a couple of chapters I couldn't put Tess down. As her character developed she showed me what a fine line the Victorian woman lived --whether to profess her thoughts, will, love or to abide by society's wishes and be self-sacrificing and totally obedient to the man she loves. Without spoiling the ending, her last act was the crescendo of all of the small ways in which she held herself back. There were times that I pleaded with her to &quot;go to him&quot; or &quot;tell him&quot; but it would have been out of character for a woman of her day. Hardy kept us informed of the landscape, weather and all living things in Tess's environment, which I found breathtaking on many occasions. He painted the picture of his perfect woman. So perfect that he didn't want anyone to have her because he loved her himself. I enjoyed Tess very much."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"\\"I became acquainted with Thomas Hardy through another of his classic works, which lent to my curiosity on this one when the audio version was made available to me. It was an experience, to the say the least, hearing how the innocent life of this girl of late 19th century England played out. For no reason other than her own naivet&eacute; is she rendered with injustice and prejudicial attitudes of the day - Hardy's denouncement of his own country's false morals. In my view, all males of our current day and age should find this impressive work required reading, and then determine whether they are an Alec D'urberville or an Angel Clare. It seems we all fall into one category or the other.\\""},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"If there were more than five stars possible, this book would get about seven. Hardy's excellent descriptions and deep pathos combine to make this novel one of the best and saddest books I have ever read. This one is a must-read, but be prepared to cry."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Please ignore the immature high-school student reviews and understand that this book is a masterpiece. Hardy analyzes the relationship between human desire and society's mores to an unprecendented degree. The characters are multi-faceted and very life-like. Hardly aptly avoids the mistake of creating mere carciatures of the pure woman, idealistic intellectual, and spoiled playboy. Moreover, his use of religious allusion is excellent although this may alienate the modern, secular reader. And perhaps this is the problem with some readers. Finally, Tess is an admirable and strong woman who had difficult circumstances. How many people would act as admirably in her circumstance? Not many! The reviewers that criticize her actions should realize this and that they ignore one of Hardy's key points: Don't be so judgemental! This is one of the best books I have read and believe me, I have read a lot of the &quot;good&quot; books."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"It's been a long time since I've read a book written in this type of literary style so I have to admit it took some getting used to. Once I got into it though I really enjoyed the story. There was a real sense of sympathy for Tess, a real sense of hatred for Alec, and a sense of &#34;what?&#34; with Angel that could not be denied. As the story was reaching its climax I found myself racing to the finish. The ending will leave you angry, sad, infuriated...Tess's life was so manipulated and in the end torn apart by family. Great story. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Hardy cleverly divides this novel into \\"phases\\", like those of the moon, and each has its own atmosphere within the greater plot. It's a novel about the destruction of innocence with two of the most complex male characters in fiction; Alec, who seems like the archetypal pantomime villain but never abandons Tess, and Angel, the bad harp player who appears to be a perfect lover but who turns out to be a hypocrite of the highest order. The famous Stonehenge scene at the end is almost poetry, which is the way Hardy was heading in his career. It's impossible not to empathise with Tess, whom Hardy calls \\"a pure woman\\" in the part-title."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Great story. But so, so sad! It is one of those books that you love, but hate how sad the story is. You cannot help but feel for Tess as life seems against her at every turn."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is one of the most emotionally powerful books I have ever read. It's long and the writing style is a bit wordy by today's standards, but stick with it and you will be rewarded. The story centers on poor, innocent, good-hearted, beautiful Tess who, at age sixteen, is persuaded by her parents to visit their wealthier relatives in hopes that they will help Them out financially. Tess gets taken advantage of by her sleazy \\"cousin\\", Alec d'Urberville, and returns home pregnant, her reputation ruined. Thus begins Tess's sad, sad tale. Tess eventually marries Angel Clare, a man she idolizes, but on their wedding night.... Well, I'll let you read it for yourself and find out what happen. The story really picks up in the second half, so don't give up on it.Tess, Alec, and Angel are all complex and fascinating characters. The story deals with issues of religion, morality, class differences, the changing English economy, and the double standard that pertains to men and women. It never loses its focus on Tess and her incredibly moving story. It builds to a devastating conclusion that I never saw coming.

The book is, at times, difficult to read, and it is filled with Biblical allusions that the average reader may not comprehend. Nevertheless, it is a powerful story, one that I would highly recommend. Beyond the story is Hardy's description of the English countryside, which, in themselves, are masterpieces. Granted, it is not an idealistic in tone, but still, it is an astounding novel. Anyone who does not read Thomas Hardy is doing themselves a disservice."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The classic tale of Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a deceptivly simple story. What at first appears to be a story of a young woman becomes a symbol of nature versus the mechanical world, love and hate, and good versus evil.The pure, sweet, young Tess is at odds against the world and in seeking to aide her family in their struggle to survive she becomes entrapped in a new world of deciet, betrayal and pain. Her quest to ask the aide of recently discovered, distant kin leads Tess unwillingly into the arms of Alec her &quot;cousin&quot; and from this action her life falls into a spiral of difficulties. Her misdeeds and those of others lead again and again to trials in her life. Hardy creates wonderful full-bodied characters and sets into motion one of the greatest stories of a woman of all time. Ideas of love, hate, betrayal and the nature of the world all mingle to make a superb novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"&quot;Tess of the d'Ubervilles&quot; is the story of a young and innocent woman who wants nothing more than to live a happy life.

I always wondered wether if Tess and he would get together throughout the entire novel.Boy was I surprised!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is a tragic, timeless story. I was in awe of Hardy's ability to flesh out this woman, Tess Durbyfield, and just give her total realism. The other main character, Angel Clare, is also brilliantly flawed, and shows you that in real life there is no such thing as a prince charming. If you can sit and work through the sometimes tedious 19th century style of Hardy, you will come away from this book moved. That is, unless you're a high-school chap too busy worrying about whose going steady with whom to care about anything important."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This book gave me an insight into myself.

If your a weak person, emotionally, try read a softer Hardy book like THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE, other than that, grab some tissues, and be prepared to control your emotions, it's one heck of a crazy rollercoaster ride."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the Dubervilles is a truely tender and fascinating book that deeply feels the human heart. This is not a book for the average Daniel Steel- Stephen King reader. Tess is highly reccommended only for those who can respect and understand great literature that has lived through decades of readers and prints. One is left thinking, pondering what sort of a person Tess was. An adolescent who remained one in adult hood? Or a child who has had many experiences-good or bad- to consider her part of the elder human race."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy is a beautiful and horrible writter. Beautiful for how he uses words to for sentences to form paragraphs to form a book. Yet horrible on how he can do such a thing to his characters. Tess's death reminds me of Lady Jane Grey, age 15, the queen of england for 9 days. A beautiful and intelligent being, died innocently from a hanging. Jane Grey died &quot;a true Christian woman.&quot; Tess &quot;dies as a pure woman.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"About fifteen years ago, this book was almost universally considered Hardy's great masterpiece. However, times have changed and its relevance is not as immediate as that of Hardy's last novel, Jude the Obscure. Still, the message of this book is far from foreign. Hardy's gift for creating sympathetic characters seems infinite in magnitude. His prose is unique and at times more harrowing in tone than Conrad's. This book would be a great introduction to the work of one of the great masters of English Literature."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is a wonderful book written by Thomas Hardy. When i first bought this book I had someone with me that said it wasn't very good, but I bought the book anyway and am now really glad that I did. Tess is such a sweet woman who has bad luck within her life.The man who abuses her and the man who loves her and can not forgive her. It is a beautiful romance story with a unforgettable ending. I almost cried after reading this book and it has now become my all time favourite.You really should read it.

Hardy tells it well, attempting to understand the ridicule and unjustice women had to endure at the time. Although he could never fully percieve a woman's point-of-view, I thought he did a good job expressing the trying times women had; those that women have overcome."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"any woman can both despise and admire tess at the same time for her weaknesses &amp; her strength. under such repressive conditions of the victorian society, i believe that she handled her blighted situation as best she knew how....theres so much more to say , its a terrific novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"No one else can write such a forceful story with a forceful plot as well as Thomas Hardy can. You feel pain, grieve, and above all respect for the characters in a sense.

It is a pastoral - the set-piece descriptions of nature (the play of light at differing times of the day, the verdant plenitude during Tess and Angel's courtship, the astonishing effect of bonfires at dusk etc.) are among the most overpoweringly vivid in literature, genuine word-painting - and an anti-pastoral, with even the natural world infected with poisonous, unnatural social conventions, with the growth of Talbothays petrified into the sterile limbo of Flintcomb-Ash.As in Shakespeare, there is a conflict in 'Tess' between the surface, linear plot, which tells a transient, austere tale of some people whose existence is short and ultimately barren, and the movement of the imagery, eternal, self-generating. The abundance of the latter makes the relentless grimness of the former just about tolerable (although the Flintcomb-Ash section is painfully unreadable) - as in Shakespeare, the burden of sexuality and emotion denied by society is placed on the natural world, on the language and the imagery, so the emotional deprivation in the plot starkly contrasts with its potent, lubricious surroundings.The plot is not 'realistic', but ritualised and patterned, set in heavily symbolic, paganistic sites, human nature stylised in pageants and tableaux. The climactic part, where Hardy twice startlingly changes narrative point-of-view, ushers in a new age of anti-Victorian fiction."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I was forced to read Tess for summer reading. I have possibly never been so glad to finish a book, not out of joy at a good reading experience but because the novel was such torture to wade through, in all its melodrama, sensationalistic elements, unlikable characters, and gaping holes in the plot, especially towards the end. Tess is a weakling who acts illogically, vacillates and secures the reader's complete disgust before the end. One should already know it from the title and the first few pages, where Tess's father, a peasant, finds out that he is the relic of an old noble family (his real name is Durbeyfield). Why cannot books have sense? All through the novel I longed to be reading Pride and Prejudice or Middlemarch. The time this book was written in has nothing to do with it; both the two books just mentioned were written considerably before it. I was left with a very poor impression of Thomas Hardy's talents as a writer. (Incidentally, it should tell you something that more than one reader/reviewer compared it to the movie Titanic.)"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A true joy to read, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is filled with situations that paint pictures of real life. Hardy knew that Tess' reality was filled with enough emotion and drama that there was no reason to add to it the things fairy tales are made of.When reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles you are brought into the story by Hardy's suberb way of sketching the scene. Though Hardy's descriptive writing can sometimes be hard to digest, his choice of words allow you to enter the landscape and smell the glen yourself.Overall, an excellent book for the more ambitious reader, and for the one who isn't afraid of the less popular unhappy outcomes."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy is one of the best books I have read in the past five years. It combines love and tragedy wonderfully. The characters leave memories enbeaded inside your mine. Especailly, Tess and Angel. Their love for each other is magical. It truly is a wonderful love story. By saying this you have to have a thought-provoking mind to understand the different subject matter. That is why most people read the book because you have to think and it is a sad story. I personally had to read it for class, and what honestly surprised me is the cleverness Hardy portrays to make his heroine more real rather than just another character. The way that it starts off how Tess and Angel don't seem like they are going to get together and how they eventually do. When they finally get together Tess has a confession to make to Angel. In the book we find out that Tess may have been raped or seduced by Alec. We are not sure but Angel leaves Tess because either way she isn't pure anymore. This is so hypocritical of Angel because Tess forgave him for having an affair with an older woman in London but he doesn't forgive Tess. So basically he's a jerk to be blunt with it. Eventually Angel forgives his wife, Tess and they leave Brazil. Tess goes back to Alec and murders him, so she can be with Angel without any worries. Due to this they hid away but get caught and the tragic ending comes. Tess is exacuted for what she has done.I like how the plot is not really &quot;realistic&quot; but follows a designed pattern, using heavy symbolic means. Hardy writes the book to leave an effect of you. You feel Tess's agony and confusion. You want to help her and wish you could show her the right path to take. I found myself talking to her when I read the book so she can do the right thing. That shows how Hardy gets you really involved. Difficult or not, if you like to read, I strongly recommend reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles. It is deservinly allowed to be called a classic. Hats off to Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy is a master craftsman. With the help of words that fit the sentences like a key into a lock, Hardy ensnares his readers like a spider traps a fly. Such is the power of Hardy's prose.\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\", was published in 1891. It was one of the last -- and arguably the best -- novels from Hardy's pen. It's the story of Tess, a country girl in a fictitious English county,Wessex, and her tragic struggle against destiny. As somebody has already mentioned, Hardy has chosen the backdrops of the story with the same care with which he describes people: valleys and moors are also portrayed as if they too are characters of the novel. The Vale of Blackmoor, Tess's birthplace, is described as \\"an engirdled and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscape painter\\", and \\"in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry\\". The Flintocomb-Ash, the place where Tess was subjected to some very rough manual work, is painted as \\"a complexion without features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of skin\\". And the place where Tess fell in love, the Vale of Froom, is \\"that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts.\\"There are several tearjerkers in the novel but I found one moment particularly touching where Tess decides to baptize her illegitimate baby herself. And when the baby -- named Sorrow -- dies, Hardy becomes a little bitter: \\"Poor Sorrow's campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was doomed to be of little brilliancy - luckily perhaps for himself, considering his beginning\\".To put forth the case of an unwed mother so passionately in &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles&quot; was something of a stir in the English society of late nineteenth century, which was so obsessed with feminine virginity. The novel received some severe criticism initially, which ultimately forced Hardy to stop writing novels and concentrate on poetry."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I found myself disecting each paragraph and reading sentences over and over again, with no reason to may I also add. There was so much meaning behind everything, so much depth and wandering.Unlike many readers, I do think Tess to be a heroine, she was strong enough to tell Angel about her past, which haunted her and she knew that it would have affected Angel and her's relationship.Vibrant and alive, this tale jumps down your skin."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The back cover of my book described Tess as a heroine for her time. I was thrilled to begin reading this book to discover what it was that made her a heroine. I was very disappointed by the end of the book. She was no heroine, more like a self-pitying brat! Hardy did a fantastic job of describing life during that periold of time, but that talent was not enough to change my opinion of the book. Very aggrevating!!!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This tragic tale of a women plagued by an unfortunate past is truly one of the saddest tales ever writtn. Thomas Hardy's skill in tying the parts of the story together is meticulous. The commentaries and other supplemental information contained in this edition are informative and helpful."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"It was a pretty exciting book, but I hated the way Tess acted in the story. She keeps wishing she would die! It is so weak! Someone needed to slap her once or twice to knock some sense into her head."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"TESS is one of the more boring works of literature. Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"What is the point of reading classic literature if all you are going to do is analyse it? What a waste. Hardy, Austen et al would be turning in their graves if they knew that their work would be treated in this way by self-proclaimed experts. Classic novels are to be enjoyed; they are written for the satisfaction of all readers, not just to massage the egos of academics.Yes, I've studied classic literature, and it isn't the genre I am typically interested in. However, \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\" is the novel that has inspired me to give this genre another try. I found it to be incredibly moving; dismissing the idea that it was poorly written. I've found English literature too stifled by its own airs and graces, but this is not the case with Thomas Hardy. He paints a picture of great hope in a way that allows us to empathise (unlike some of his contemporaries) with the characters of a different era.I recommend anyone who wants to start reading classic English literature to begin with \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\". You will find it an easily accessible read. It is beautiful, hopeful and tragic."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"It seemed to me that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a bit dull at times, but the storyline as a whole was quite interesting. There is a great deal of imagery, so much that I deemed it to be in the way of my actually getting absorbed in the novel. Surprises abound, but they are surrounded by lengthy passages describing everything and anything. Nature, being an important aspect of the novel, receives so much attention, and Hardy expounds upon it so meticulously, that it becomes an effort to read through everything. I was disappointed in the very beginning by this style of narration (actually, thinking of Hardy's other novels, it is very much like him), but by the end, I found it to be absorbing. The character of Tess is very memorable, and awe-inspiring. I recommend this if you have plenty of time to devote to a novel (not looking for a quick read), and if you like Hardy's style; if you do, you'll find this to be a very good read."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A love story that has all of the makings of a made for TV movie.

This is one of the best, if not the best, novel ever written. 5 stars isn't enough."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"There is many ways to look at this book and how it corolates to his Hardy's life but the point is I think he wanted to make this a beautiful work of art. And it is. Many girls who went through tough times in life can relate to this like I have. It might not be dramatic as this book but I have been in many situations that were unbelievable and &quot;soap opera - ish&quot; and I have seen all sorts of people and I do not misjudge people because everyone at one point in their lives do things out to character.

Tried it anyway and it worked really well. My dishes have never sparkled with quite so much luminosity. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is part of my attempt to read classics and non-fiction as well as my usual speculative fiction this year. A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a novel remarkable only in its quality to inspire hatred from those unfortunates forced to read it. Melodramatic and unrealistic, it meanders interminably exploring the theme of a &quot;pure woman&quot; before finally finishing with an ending that has little impact on the disgusted reader.Tess is, in short, a useless book. Apart from keeping a healthy fire roaring in my hearth, Tess contains little of merit. Well, I suppose one could improve one's vocabulary by reading Tess (fun, but completely useless words like &quot;prestidigitation&quot; abound), but reading &quot;How to improve your verbal scores on the SAT&quot; is inarguably more concise and probably more entertaining.Not to say that there is nothing to be learned from the characters. Simply observe their actions in certain situations and do the opposite. The three main characters, particularly Tess, are just begging to have a little common sense smacked into them. However, Tess can be considered enigmatic in one respect. Hardy seems to be unable to decide whether she is just ordinarily pretty, or 'a dazzling fair milkmaid' so it is up to the reader, should he still be awake, to decide. At any rate, her big, multi-colored eyes and Pre-Raphaelite hair and figure hide a complete vapidity painfully evident to the modern reader. She only develops a spine near the end of the novel, when such a change is unconvincing and thoroughly out of character.So...a predictable and heavily padded plot, infuriating characters, too much symbolism, inappropriate philosophical discussions and a great dollop of Victorian fluff. The result? Tess of the d'Urbervilles roasting on an open fire."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"HARDY HAS A MAGICAL WAY OF CREATING A CHARACTER THAT EVENTUALLY BECOMES REAL TO US. REAL IN THE SENSE THAT WE CRY WITH HER, WE EMPATHIZE WITH HER AND MOST OF ALL, WE WANT THE BEST FOR HER. TESS HAD PERSONAL QUALITIES THAT WE OFTEN FIND IN OURSELVES WHICH EXPLAINS OUR NEED FOR HER TO FIND HAPPINESS. OBVIOUSLY, THEN EXPLAINING OUR SORROW WHEN THE POOR SOUL EVENTUALLY SUBMITS TO HER UNHAPPINESS BY KILLING HER LOVER. HONESTLY, CAN WE SAY THAT WE WOULD NOT DO THE SAME IN SUCH HOPELESS CONDITIONS?

Ok, that's all."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, is truly a classic. Hardy's use of vivid imagery to evoke emotion was magnificent. His ability to bring life to the scenes of the novel made the comprehension of the story much easier. The sad story of Tess' demise was provided with a great deal of emotion, which made the novel incredible to read.We follow Tess throughout her life, experiencing all the emotions associated with her horrific teenage years. We are able to see the progression of her character and the emotions that drove her all the way towards the end of novel. It was evident that Hardy used his keen ability to address his opinion of the imminent will.Hardy has done an outstanding job, and though Tess' story, he has addressed serious problems with society that have transcended to even this era. An outstanding job! To see that the only a few people have given this novel five stars amazes me! Tess was an extraordinary novel; the power of this work of literature is unlike any other. It is unique and a must read for any high school student. I'm proud to say that this novel was enjoyable and an interesting read. From start to miserable finish, Hardy kept my eyes glued. His vivid imagery and interesting diction proved to be a great addition to an already interesting plot."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A must read. Thomas Hardy's diction is unforgettable. Just like a Shakespeare play, every sentence must be savored. Despite the seemingly overwhelming amount of detail included, the novel is extremely readable. All this detail allows the reader to have vivid pictures of each and every scene painted in their minds. From the action filled beginning to the somewhat predictable but nevertheless fantastic ending, the reader will be on the edge of his or her seat, wondering what misadventure Tess will fall into next. The protagonist, Tess, can easily be classified as a heroine of the Victorian era. Her character is impossible not to love, tragically selfless, humble, and beautiful inside and out. The events of the novel make one feel an anger towards not only some of the characters, but towards what they represent and the society which they live in. From the misogynistic, deceitful character of Alec to the well-intentioned but foolish character of Tess's mother, even to our main character, the wide eyed, innocent, ever altruistic character of Tess, every character has a statement to make about the world that Hardy places them in. And with Tess's fatal flaw, one can't help but think of how applicable it is even in today's time. Making bold statements on gender lines, social status lines, and the inevitability of fate, this novel transcends time. A quick recommendation-though at times the book may seem to drag out, it is certainly worth it to continue reading and finish the novel. Also, as the novel progresses, the wording certainly gets easier to understand."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The stories and the characters may seem simple and dramatic, however, of the classic nature of Greek mythology, consistent with other books by the author, such as The Return of the Native, and the Mayor of Casterbridge. The essence of the book seems to me, is about the tragedies humans suffer, caught in the conflicts between nature and culture. The nature is harsh but straightforward as love is, but the culture presents hypocrisies and judgment, separating people between splendid star and blighted one. Whether to worship the sun, or to worship the standards of Judeo Christianity? There are different judgments in wealth vs. poverty, religion vs. spirituality, men's honor vs. women's purity. And there is plenty of ambiguity in all of them but ultimately, the \\"anachronism of love and chance\\" leads the characters to classic tragedies in the end. Beautiful writing."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The title character Tess journeys across the rural English countryside amidst a stark voyage of discovering exactly who she is. Her story is one filled with various sorrows, cathartic or otherwise, punctuated by only fleeting amounts of peace and happiness tossed somewhere in-between. It's not an easy read--nor is it meant to be--for a few reasons. Hardy thrives on description, some of which might seem unnecessary to the modern-day reader (particularly the extended glimpses of the dairy farms), though we do need to understand the Victorian world we're in. Consequently, the author wants to garner as much support as he can for his protagonist, who loses her innocence quickly and spends most of the book scraping up the pieces of a wreckage that was never her fault in the first place. And these glimpses into her troubled consciousness ache and resonate with us a century on. So if we understand the atmosphere she has to contend with, we begin to understand Tess--and sympathize with her plight and misfortune along the way.When the meat is torn off the skeleton, it's a solid (albeit lengthy) read about the meshing and clashing of various characters in nineteenth-century England. The choices of some of the characters throughout, some of which might be construed as twists, are not entirely believable though add definite color to the work, especially the last two \\"phases.\\" These culminate in a conclusive ending that is both haunting and beautiful. This won't be for everyone, though if you can withstand some archaic language here and there, you might enjoy this tragic tale about love, loss, and a stringent society that tried so desperately to dictate both."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is a great book. The desriptions are beautiful. I was shocked to see how many people trashed it.Look, Thomas Hardy was portraying the tragic struggle of a simple country girl living in the 19th century. Women weren't treated well, let alone poor women. In my opinion, he spoke of Tess with tenderness and compassion. He was not trying to say she deserved all that anguish, but the reality is that that's the way it was. If anything I think he was trying to advocate respectful treatment of women."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I first read this book as a teenager. It has been a few years since I was a teenager, to say the least, but it will always stay with me as one of the \\"best books I have ever read\\" that is for sure.

I understand why and how she came to do what she did."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This review is for Amazon.com - don't read if you don't want a spoiler for the ending. I loved this book - it had great character development, a truly elegant writing style, and a plotline that kept me enraptured right up to the end. Hardy's forte was capturing the irresistability of temptation even with the most staunch of intentions. However, I'm quite irritated at the amazon.com editorial review that gives away the entire ending. What's up with that? Thinking that Amazon of all places wouldn't be so daft as to give away the ending in the review, I was expecting the ending in the middle of the book and was sorely disappointed to learn that WAS the ending and that I had known it all along. Please update the editorial review and remove the details of the story ending.As for the ending itself, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending wasn't quite as expected. While the plot of the ending wasn't unexpected (especially having read the editorial review), the turn of events and seemly strong character traits of Angel and Tess appear to have evaporated in an instant. While Angel had to spend a year away from Tess to work up to his acceptance of her prior transgression, he doesn't seem to think more than a blink of her having killed a man. And Tess holds such a strong belief in her own low self worth, that she is unwilling to marry the man she loves for disgracing him. And then, kills a man without as much thought as deciding to boil a cup of tea. So, even though the writing style and the majority of the book were fantastic, the ending is the spoiler and the reason for only 4 stars. This book is still very much worth a read simply for the enjoyment of the journey."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Just a fantastic novel. The larger issues it addresses, as is the case with Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, are the very largest that we face. But the detail is also there, all the way down to every scent, sound, and emotion of the daily commute of a young milkmaid in Victorian England. That such strikingly detailed imagery sits easily atop the largest issues of our existence is a marvel. An amazing, important novel. One of the best."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite novels.

I would definitely recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading.Eric Gundberg"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Exquisite writing, fascinating story, a rural English world so real it's as if you're walking through it, smelling every meadow and farmyard, hearing every hoof beat and raindrop, feeling the sun and the mist, seeing every color change as the light shifts. Readers who like Tom Clancy will probably find Hardy too slow. Readers who like James Joyce will probably find Hardy too old-fashioned. The more time I spend in Hardy's world, the happier I am, even when the outcome is unhappy, as it is with Tess. It's hard to pick a favorite of his books; they're all so wonderful, but if I had to choose only one to take to a desert island, this would probably be it (though a tough choice between this and \\"Far From the Madding Crowd\\"). My husband and I dream of going to Dorset because of Hardy. I hope one day we make it. You simply can't do better than Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

I like to read books other authors have read or recommended or quoted. I like reading period pieces and about the lifestyles of how people lived and viewed the world at different times in our history, and this book falls into that category. It's a love triangle with serious characters and story line. Sometimes I make the mistake of thinking people were not sophisticated 2 hundred years ago, but they were and had difficult issues in which to deal within their cultures. As the author was an Englishman, there were loads of vocabulary learned with reading this book, but it was fun because it's so easy with the Kindle to look up a word. It's a story of innocence lost, love found, lost, found again, and ultimately lost again (and ever so tragically). Sometimes I enjoy when a story ends not all tied up in a pretty little bow like this one."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"good cast, good story, nice to read in the true form......... ... ... .... .... ... ... .."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Sometimes a classic is the best read.

Tess is one of the most awful books I have ever read...Tess is a sap with no spine and an insult to all women. I understand this book was written in an era when women were not strong but still...couldn't Hardy have given Tess some common sense?? This book put me to sleep more than once with its long descriptions of the same valley...and can anything else happen to Tess at the end of this novel? I think every bad thing that could happen to a woman happened to Tess...a bit melodramatic, maybe? I don't know how this book became a classic...was it classic for its ability to put somebody to sleep...or how about sending someone into a depression or fits of anger because Tess is a moron? If you want to read classics read Crime and Punishment or even Madame Bovary...I also had to read those this summer and I actually enjoyed them...so don't go saying to yourself the only reason I don't like this book is because I was forced to read it...I was forced to read those other books and I liked them. In short, I pity anybody who has to read this book...and I don't know how anybody in their right minds could have given this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A few years back I was forced to read &quot;Tess&quot; for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on &quot;Tess..&quot;"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The whole tragedy is in the fact that I was NOT forced to read this book but actually picked it up because I WANTED to read it (or so I thought at the time). I have read many books in my life, quite a lot of them classics, but I have to say that this book just about drove me bananas. I think there is a general misapprehension in thinking that a classic must be good.I dare not even think of how many times I probably came close to being committed to an asylum for acting suspiciously on the train while reading \\"Tess\\" (every two seconds I would sigh, roll my eyes, scoff or just plain throw my hands in the air from frustration). Many reviewers had rightly pointed out that the character of Tess is the shubbiest excuse of a woman in the whole Solar System. How can anybody, in any age, on any continent, be as spineless and masochistic as she is? This woman is more of a martyr that Joan of Arc, for crying out loud.The excuse that this book takes place in Victorian England doesn't quite cut it. I saw more strength and backbone in Hester of The Scarlet Letter (which story took place in a much more prudish and puritanical setting than England of 1800's).I think Thomas Hardy invented himself a woman who would act like his cocker spaniel; no matter how much he beat the crap out of that 'faithfull friend' the poor dog would always come crawling back and lick his boots, which is pretty much how Tess acts throughout the book. The whole scenario smacks a lot of a perverted male fantasy. Maybe Hardy had a nasty mother, who knows. I bet psychiatrists would have a field day with the author.I am disappointed and feel cheated of the time that I could have used to read something else; Dickens, for example. Or just Maeve Binchy, if I wanted female driven narrative. \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" would have been a much better book if that idiot-of-a-husband and Tess herself would fall into that bloody river in the middle of the book (exactly as Tess wanted it) and have done with it. I know I would applaud such a great ending!In short: steer way clear of this one."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"fascinating story of an ancient civilization"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Having a degree in English Lit., it seems sinful for me to accuse Thomas Hardy of being a terrible writer, but there it is. Any writer today submitting a manuscript like this would have it rejected out of hand. This is not a book for an audience seeking a good, fast-paced story that speaks for itself. If you read this book, you will have to interpret every word, description, and action, try to guess what universal message the author is attempting to convey and what the characters are thinking and feeling at any given time. In short, the kind of book that college English professors love, and try to emulate, and remain college English professors because they will never get such a thing published.First of all, character development is not only lacking, it is absent altogether. It might be assumed that the book's title character, at least, would be strongly drawn, someone we could sympathize with, empathize with, or relate to in some way. Not the case. While Hardy expounds upon Tess' physical appearance ad nauseum throughout, never did I gain any real insight into her thoughts and feelings, her motivation. Maybe the insight is hidden in these endless physical descriptions or her inane actions, but frankly, if I'm reading for pleasure I don't want to take the time to search. Sorry. And it follows that if Hardy failed in his title character, forget about all the others.Secondly, his wordiness is irritating. One paragraph of half-way interesting action is followed by a full page of useless description and genuflecting. Perhaps essential to hidden meanings and motives and social commentary, but again, I'm not taking the time to search. I found myself skipping over these, the result being my finishing the book in two evenings.Conversely, Hardy seems to gloss over the most important event in the book, cloaking it in overly subtle tones. Granted, this was written during the sexually-repressed Victorian Era, for an audience with \\"delicate sensibilites\\", but come on. Something as traumatic and life-shattering as rape, in fact the event that is supposed to drive the entire novel, deserves more than an allusion to medieval knights taking advantage of peasant girls. Not that I want graphic details, on the contrary. But please, give me a break; even if her society deems she take it as a matter of course, let us see, clearly, her inward rage, hurt, bafflement at what has happened to her. Something. Anything. Make her human, in other words.If you really must read this, a synopsis would be enough. The novel's idea is a good one, and could have probably been done brilliantly by someone else. Hardy fails it miserably."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A great windbag of a novel, Hardy seems to think that not only does a grassy meadow take half a chapter to describe, he thinks that everyone else agrees with him. Please. Not the largest complaint I have, but surely the first, is that Hardy's style is like looking up looking up &quot;stone pillar&quot; in a thesaurus, then two others, and then writing down every single synonym. It takes pages for him to describe a dairy farm, and at some point you wonder if he's introducing the farm as a character, it gets so much time.Not that he seems to spend that much time on his characters; they are created with little that interests, and contain less development that a homeless shelter under President Bush.Tess is described, at great length, and quite often, as a beautiful woman. Okay, so what? Her personality is so weak I wonder if he even thought about what she would do in a situation, or just had her do whatever the other characters wanted her to do, until the very end, when she makes an out of character action that is supposed to be shocking, but is more perplexing; the character described in the rest of the book wouldn't do that, and there is nothing to indicate why she has a sudden change of being.Angel is built up as the &quot;perfect prince in shining armor&quot; until he finds out about Tess's secret, when he suddenly acts like a selfish and snotty child that is the very opposite of what he has been in the rest of the book. Then he switches back at the end, with little thought as to why by Hardy, at least not much that is apparent in the book.Let's see, boring writing style and poorly done characters, what else is there? Ah, plot. The only way to describe plot is that it made the description seem riveting and his characters thought out. He's spend the time to talk about Tess getting a job, then the next chapter she is suddenly running away from it; I felt robbed of the time spent in the build up, and knowing more in detail of what happened in the intervening time from when she got the job to when she quit would have helped with her character. And when you think there is no need for detail, Hardy's got more than enough. He spends ages talking about Tess and Angel's time together at the dairy farm, but none of their actions change the way they feel about each other. He could have cut our some of their horse riding, and no one would complain.In short, Hardy's the kind of writer who is analogous to a storyteller that likes the sound of his voice; just because he can say something, he does. And in his endless drivel, what might be interesting is skipper over. This guy could have used and editor.When it first came out, this book was ill received, and I see no reason for anything to have changed since."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too!

It was a real disappointment and the reading of this book by anyone with a life should by outlawed."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This book has touched me in a very different way than many others have. It is a tragic story and envelopes the reader in a different kind of sadness - a sadness which one cannot pull out of quickly or just draw aside. Many thoughts contained in this book are worthy of reflection. Each lingers in your heart. The happy moments are all tinged with a bitter taste. Each character is flawed as a natural human being and each mistake they make reflects on their future and affects them drastically. Tess Durbeyfield is one of the most tragic characters I have ever read of. From the moment she leaves her home to the supposed D'Urberville relatives, she is pushed into catastrophes and heartaches that just lead to more doom. I recommend this book to any reader who is willing to undergo the myriad of emotions that accompanies Tess's journey through demise. It is not for the flippant, unconcerned, and unsympathetic reader. Everything that happens to Tess happens for a reason, and the reader must be able to realize how each affects her to appreciate this book. Read this book and expect to ponder on many philosophical wonderings. This book WILL affect you! It is worthy of any person seeking a deep and life-affecting novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"My review is based on the Oxford Classics Edition.Thomas Hardy seems to have been interested mostly in sad, unhappy characters who lead troubled, disappointing lives, struggle against fate, and lose. There is beauty in artistically represented sadness, though, and notably so if we are only spectators. I am not giving away the ending by writing that &quot;Tess&quot; is a sad novel. I think most people who choose to read this book do so because they know it is a sad story, or they have read Hardy before. In my case, I had to read it for school, and what truly surprised me is the ambiguity that Hardy so masterfully portrays in order to make his heroine more of a real person instead of a mere character. By the book's end we really do not know whether Tess was raped or seduced by Alec; whether he took advantage of a sleeping girl and forced himself upon her, or she allowed it in a moment of weakness, tired after a strenous day and grateful to him for &quot;saving&quot; her from the other workers. However it happened, Tess's life is radically changed after the fact and this event will have grave consequences for her and Alec.The ambiguity is troubling with the entrance of Angel, the hypocrite who falls in love with Tess because she looks angelic, virginal, and beautiful as a child, but rejects her when she tells him that she is not a virgin (therefore not a child) anymore. Her other qualities are there, but Angel equates purity with virginity --something many people still do when it refers to women-- so he can construct a perfect excuse for his terrible behaviour towards the woman he has said he loved. In spite of the forebodings that Hardy drops before Chapter 35, this particular chapter, at the beginning of Phase the Fifth, is very powerful and almost surprising in its intensity. The level of troubling ambiguity goes up several notches at the end of the novel, when it appears that Angel may indeed get his &quot;little girl&quot; as a replacement for the one he just lost.&quot;Tess&quot; is a sad and beautiful story. There is much more to write about this novel, but I have decided to concentrate on what Hardy seems to have intended when he wrote so beautifully about so sad a theme, but in such an ambiguous way. He calls Tess &quot;A Pure Woman,&quot; and she is that. But as only a truly great writer would, he does not present her as an outright victim: there are plenty of opportunities for Tess to escape Alec before they have sex, and plenty of opportunities for her to deal in a different way with the cruel hand that fate has dealt her. She does not escape Alec, and she chooses Angel (rotten luck with men). There are tragic flaws in Tess, and that is what makes her human while making &quot;Tess&quot; into a true tragedy. Hardy knows this. His prose is elegant and, at times, it reads more like poetry, going from good to beautiful.This edition of the novel is helpful, but it could be better. I prefer foot-notes rather than end-notes. If they have to be end-notes, they should have numbers. The Introduction by Simon Gatrell is original, although I do not agree with its main premises: that there are two Thomas Hardys at work in &quot;Tess,&quot; and that &quot;A Pure Woman&quot; refers not to purity, but to &quot;essential, wholly&quot; woman. This is valid as an opinion but unsupported by evidence. I recommend &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles.&quot; If you have never read Hardy, read this. If you have read him, you know what to expect."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I was supposed to read this book 25 or so years ago in high school. It was heavy going, and pretty meaningless to me at the time. It has come to be one of my favourite books, and I have read it more than once. The thing about hardy is that the sense of place, and time is so evocative. I have lived as an adult in Dorset - hardy Country, and recognise many of the locales he writes so beautifully about. More astounding is that some of the social mores and economic system ( indentured labour, tied villages) still exist. Like Dickens, coincidence plays a heavy hand in Hardy's plot development, a contrivance that is a little agitating to the modern, more cynical reader. Still, I find it entiely appropriate to an era when people were most often trapped in a life dictated by circumstance, when free will didn't play nearly as large a part as it does now, in a Britain where there was no place for a meritocracy, class and social station being everything. Some vestiges of that are still very evident in English life (Royalty representing the apex of the class system). Tess is a classic, well worth the effort on a number of levels - the rhythm of language, and what it says about its time and place."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"But if you get the Wordsworth Classics edition, don't read the introduction until you finish! I'm going to make this standard practice for all classics from now on. I was hoping for some background on Hardy but before I even realized what had happened I'd read a summary of the entire story in one paragraph, plot twists and all. And it really did ruin the climactic last couple chapters for me. I hate it when editors / publishers assume that if a novel is famous and critically acclaimed then the reader must already be familiar with the story. Completely false: In this day and age reading for pleasure isn't as widespread as it used to be and the old classics are fading into the distance. The story in \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" is certainly not common knowledge anymore, so when you discover a gem like this I beg you not to ruin it for yourself by reading the canned introduction.Still a fabulous read, certainly. The story centers on the simple, sincere, hard-working farmgirl Tess Durbeyfield who is fated to stumble into a few serious and unfortunate challenges over the couple years that the novel spans. Hardy spins a truly magnificently written and plotted tale in narrating poor Tess's adventures & mishaps.I read another Hardy classic, Far From the Madding Crowd, several years ago and enjoyed it immensely. For the life of me I can't remember any of the story in that novel except that the central character was rather strange, but a few pages of \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" instantly resurrected my memories of Hardy's unmatched power of narration. He truly brings every scene and character to full animation and vitality, does the poignant scenes full justice, and even handles humorous situations with aplomb.Easily five stars, one of the best classics I've ever read. Just don't read the introduction!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is a classic novel that is one of the saddest. It involves a very likeable, innocent country girl who is seduced by a cruel employer. She has a child by that union that dies early in infancy. She later meets a man who loves her but upon learning her past rejects her. She then meets up again with the first man, who forces her to be his mistress. The ending is very sad.Through it all Tess maintains her dignity and is a very likeable character. This novel shows the extreme cruelty of legalistic morality that is not tempered by compassion and respect for others, particularly women during this time period.The book is very well written if you like poetic descriptions and vivid imagery. Hardy is a master of both, and of the human drama."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another. Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I went into \\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.\\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this \\"modern\\" society."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Like other novels by Thomas Hardy, this is a beautiful and densely written work; I have read several of his other novels, but it is the character of Tess that sticks most in my mind. This is a tragic story, make no mistake, and as such it left a deep impression upon me. Numerous scenes and details linger in my memory, due to Hardy's rich prose style - the terrible death of the Durbeyfield horse; the texture of Tess's cheek, unwillingly yielded for Alec to kiss (as \\"damp and smoothly chill as the skin on the mushrooms in the fields around\\"); Tess's humane execution of mutilated pheasants, preyed upon by careless hunters. I could go on...but then half of the pleasure of reading is a sense of discovery, so I shall end there.Hardy's usual pastoral idyll is present here (in the form of Talbothays and eloquent descriptions of the bounties of spring), but this is thrown into powerful contrast by the increasingly bleak events that overtake the hopeless Tess as she progresses.I recommend it for any reader willing to try 19th century novels, and particularly fans of Eliot - Hardy was of a proto-feminist persuasion, like Eliot, but I think he writes with even more emotional power. It is interesting to observe that modern male writers seem relatively unconcerned with creating such singularly memorable female characters, although Hardy was admittedly an oddity of his era.If you have struggled to get beyond the first few chapters - as I initially did - I found that a total-immersion policy helped; the intensity of the denoument means that this is a book best read over a short time. I grew so attached to the characters and settings of the novel that I felt lost when I finished reading it.If you have read this and relished Hardy's fatalistic approach as much as I did, then Jude the Obscure is definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"if i'm being truly honest most 'classics' leave me cold. Pride and prejudice ? Bored me rigid. The amabassadors ? A guaranteed way to induce sleep. Remembrance of things past ? Still only read two of the books...and have no real desire to read more So when i picked up tess i was expecting more of the same. Worthy, intellectual, dull .I was wrong . Tess was a page turner , populist in the best way and strangely, considering cinema hadn't been invented yet , rather cinematic in it's description and creation of scenes . Even the passages that described the countryside add to the overall feel and mood of the book, rather than just describe for describing sake . As for the reviewers who accuses Hardy of being verbose, I can only say that for the time he's positvely Hemingwayesque.Yes, the book is a little melodramtic and if it wasn't for all the tragedy and downbeat ending you could see it being made into a mini series on tv but frankly.... what's wrong with that ? It's precisely this approachability that lets Hardy get you thnking about issues like women's rights , men and women's relation to each other and predeterminism.Finally to those that say Angel and Alec's behaviour is inconsistent .I can not agree. Alec is exactly the kind of person who rushes from one passionate extreme to another and Angel is exactly the kind of idealist who has trouble excepting the realities of life and the failings of the average person.Finally a word on Tess herself .She is one of the sexiest characters i've ever seen written in victorian fiction .It interests me that a man should write such a character and then have her killed as if such beauty (both internally and externally) can't be allowed to exist on the earth becuase of men like him, me and maybe you...."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Bleak and depressing, as far as the plot is concerned it's sort of like Hardy was experimenting with how many terrible things he could make happen to a trusting, wonderful person, until she's finally crushed under the weight of the world and her society. Really makes you feel awful to read it, honestly, but that's ok because the writing is beautiful and the structure is flawless. There are moments of pure poetry on a Shakespearean level, that make you want to weep for all humanity. The characters, especially Tess, are very believable, and the psychology effecting their decisions is what drives the story, for me. I'm impressed, I'm going to read more Hardy. I've looked around and it seems like most of his books are similar - a great set-up to a disaster, all the while people's hearts being ripped out of their chests and their hopes and dreams crushed one after another by a cruel world and cruel circumstances. He obviously had a pretty tragic and pessimistic view of our human situation, but a view that must have filled him with sympathy. He really goes into his characters' heads and makes you feel their pain through it all, going through the stages of their grief, with really amazing descriptions that feel dead on. Or at least that's what he did in this book.Also, it's pretty amazing that he blatantly pointed out the sexual double standards of his time and their utter hipocrysy. It's so crazy that people in Hardy's day were outraged after the publication of this book by the subtitle, \\"A Pure Woman,\\" because Tess was raped. When you keep in mind how firmly these ideas of purity and female sexuality were implanted in people's minds, it makes the plot completely believable."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This was my first Thomas Hardy book but it will not be the last. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is now one of my all time favorite stories. It's so hard to recommend a book that is at times utterly painful, but it's the effect it has on you that makes it so awesome. I was actually weeping audibly at times. These characters are so real you feel as if you know them. I found myself yelling at them as if somehow I could intervene in their lives. Thomas Hardy is a poetic genious with the ability to create people and places vividly awake in your mind. Is there anyone out there who can write like this anymore? When I say haunting I mean I was effected for days after I closed the book and placed it back on the shelf. This is a classic work of fiction that cannot afford to be missed. Read it! You will be better for having done so.On a lighter note these penguin classic hardcovers are amazingly beautiful. They are my new obsession. This one is no exception and the notes in the back were so helpful."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess is a novel written by a man about a woman who is mistreated by other men until she defies the men's acts with a crime conceived by the men's cruelty inflicted upon her. In short, it is a passionate statement about man's cruelty to a woman.This book understands the differences between man and woman, and for the most part, it is not complimentary to men. Exceptions exist. \\"The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal look, demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression.\\"And during the hard times inflicted upon her, Tess refuses to reproach those men who made her life a miserable existence. It starts with her father, whose newfound nobility engage him in a mead house where he misses a deadline, requiring her to carry on the family business, which results in a horrible accident and family economic loss. From there, she must endure hard work, be sexually mistreated by an employer, move away from her castigated self from a problem to which she had no cause, live a life as a simple milk maid, and then marry.When she marries, it seems that all is well. But, her husband, when discovering during their honeymoon that her flower was violated (even though without permission) by one before him, immediately exiles himself to Brazil and leaves her in poverty and public humiliation. Her life is not good - and she knows it: to the point where she contemplates suicide.But, one day, when walking in the woods she sees maimed birds (hunting's collateral damage) which slowly walk about to a cruel and painful demise. When seeing their tortured final moments on earth, she says, \\"Poor darlings - to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in the sight o' such misery as yours!\\" \\"And not a twinge of bodily pain about me! I be not mangled, and not bleeding, and I have two hands to feed and clothe me.\\" She is miserable, but she understands the relativity of such emotion.Men in this book really have to take the blame. Like the hunters who irresponsibly leave half-shot birds to limp to their graves, her husband must atone for his terribly misguided and failed judgment of her and her unwelcomed sexual experience. She was by modern standards too young to consent, and certainly did not consent. And, after years of review of the issue, her husband concludes what modern men would have been capable of doing in moments - ask for her forgiveness and pity her. \\"Thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate.\\"But, this is not a love story with undertones of happy endings. Shakespearean in many ways, devoted to tragic ending, this book raises the title character to sainthood. And, like most tragedies, only the cold can complete the final pages without welled eyes."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\", first published in 1891, is set in Dorset (or \\"South Wessex\\" as Hardy called it) during the latter part of the nineteenth century. It tells the story of Teresa (\\"Tess\\") Durbeyfield, a beautiful and innocent country girl who is seduced by a wealthy gentleman, gives birth to his illegitimate child, and is eventually, after numerous vicissitudes of fortune, hanged for his murder.This was a controversial subject in late Victorian England, although perhaps not as controversial as we might think. Today we like to flatter ourselves that all great nineteenth century writers were effectively twenty-first century spirits avant la lettre, voices crying out in the wilderness against the hypocritical moral code of their contemporaries, and therefore doomed to be misunderstood by a scornful bourgeoisie. The truth is always more complex than that. In the case of \\"Tess\\", the subject of illegitimacy and unmarried motherhood was not unprecedented in English literature; Dickens, for example, had dealt with it in \\"Bleak House\\", as had Elizabeth Gaskell in \\"Ruth\\". The reception afforded to the novel was by no means uniformly hostile; indeed, Hardy himself admitted in the preface to a later editions that \\"by far the majority\\" of reviewers had \\"generously welcomed the tale\\".Hardy was a countryman, and all of his novels are set in the rural area of South-West England which he named Wessex. He had not only a deep feeling for the English countryside but also the ability to convey this feeling in vivid descriptive prose. This is not, however, mere description for description's sake; the landscape becomes a vital part of the structure of his novels- at times it can almost be regarded as a character in them- and Hardy uses description of the natural scene in order to amplify his descriptions of his characters' feelings.There are two passages in \\"Tess\\" which particularly exemplify this. The first comes when the heroine, following the death of her illegitimate son, is working as a dairymaid on a farm in the Frome valley in southern Dorset; it is here that she meets Angel Clare, the man who is to become the great love of her life. The second comes when Tess has been abandoned by Angel, after he discovered the truth about her past, and is forced to find work on a farm on the Dorset Downs, slightly further north. The scenes set in the valley take place in summer, and Hardy's writing is dominated by images of heat, of ease, of fertility and of luxuriant growth, symbolising the burgeoning growth of Tess's hopes for her future happiness. The scenes set on the bare, stony Downs take place in winter, and the imagery is of cold, of hardship and of bleakness, symbolising the dashing of those hopes.In this novel Hardy's powers of description are matched by his powers of characterisation. There have been few, if any, male English novelists who have had such a gift for creating memorable female characters- Dickens' heroines are pale and insipid by comparison- and Tess is perhaps his greatest. The author used to speak of her as though she were a real person, and wrote \\"I have not been able to put on paper all that she is, or was, to me\\". If it were possible to fall in love with a fictional character, I would have fallen in love with Tess and so, I suspect, would most of Hardy's readers.Another feature of the book is that it reads as both of its time and timeless. It is not set in some unchanging Arcadian landscape but in the real English countryside of the late nineteenth century, a period of rapid social change. Agriculture was becoming increasingly mechanised; one key scene takes place while Tess is operating a steam-powered threshing machine. The position of the traditional landed gentry was being challenged by the rise of a new moneyed class, a phenomenon illustrated by the history of Tess's own family. The start of her tragedy is the discovery, by a local antiquary, that she is a descendant of the aristocratic and once-powerful d'Urberville family, of whose surname her own is a corruption. Her seducer goes by the name Alec d'Urberville, and Tess mistakenly believes him to be a distant cousin, but in reality he is neither a relation nor an aristocrat, but a parvenu. His father, a wealthy financier from Northern England, changed the family name (originally Stoke) when he purchased a Dorset country estate.The countryside has also been changed by new learning and ways of thinking which have challenged the power of old ideas. Although Tess is from a poor family, she is significantly better educated than her parents' generation. Hardy describes the gulf between Tess and her simple, superstitious mother Joan as being as great as that between the Victorian and Jacobean eras. Angel, the freethinking son of a pious clergyman, represents the growing force of religious scepticism, although his views on sexual morality turn out to be just as puritanical as those of his father's generation. Indeed, Angel's Puritanism may be connected with his personal philosophy; he seems to have kept the Christian injunction to hate the sin while rejecting that to love the sinner.The book's timeless quality derives partly from Hardy's prose style, formal even by the standards of Victorian novelists (although Hardy can be demotic when writing dialogue for his rustic characters). This style is characterised by an elevated vocabulary and by allusions to the Bible, to Greek and Roman mythology and to Shakespeare and other English poets. These allusions help to create the idea that Tess is not just a Victorian country girl but also a tragic heroine comparable to the heroes of Shakespeare or Aeschylus. Tess's downfall can partly be attributed to the social structures of her day, which made it all too easy for a rich man like Alec to take advantage of a poor girl, but also to a tragic flaw. She may be pure and innocent, but she is also a poor judge of character, too besotted with Angel to realise how priggish and self-centred he is, making excuses for him even after his callous rejection of her.Having recently reviewed Manzoni's \\"I Promessi Sposi\\", widely considered the Great Italian Novel, I started wondering what might be considered the Great British Novel, and thought I would celebrate my 100th review for Amazon by putting forward my own candidate for that honour. The book is a complex one, both in terms of its plot and of its themes, and there has not been space to do full justice to these aspects in this brief review. What I have tried to do is to set out some of the reasons why Hardy is my favourite novelist and why I regard this as the greatest of his novels. I cannot think of another novel with so loveable a central character, nor one whose plight has affected me so deeply. This is a work of immense emotional power."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy, who wrote Tess of the D'Urbervilles, also wrote one of my favorite poems, The Blinded Bird, and another wonderful one called The Darkling Thrush. He has beautiful gift for words, character development, and emotional imagery. He has some vivid descriptions of the passion of love and the beauty of life. As many critics complain, Hardy seems to view life with some skepticism. He seems to believe that life is hard and people sometimes are not treated fairly by the very ones who should be there to help and protect the hurting. This philosophy parallels the feeling of many people that the Church has hurt them. A friend of mine wrote an impassioned essay about the personal pain she and others had experienced through transgressions of the Church.The difference is that she recognized a loving, all-knowing God who loves us deeply and whose love is sometimes not reflected in his people - whereas Hardy's story reflects the world's perception that a callous church represents an absent God. Still, I detect in his writing a subtle thread of hope as reflected by the hope of his characters, though not by their plight. I appreciated this book because it made me realize I am the hands and feet for the people in the world whose hope is gone.Anyone who hurts for others will be as greatly frustrated if you read this book. But you will also gain so much if you keep the perspective that God is in control and cares deeply about every person's plight. In this story, I see the undying faith Tess had in Clare as a picture of the way our faith in Christ should be, and the kind of love I want to have in another person.Tess' pain would not have been so hard to bear if the church had acted toward her as Jesus acted toward tax collectors and sinners in Luke 15, and as the people in those three parables acted. If the Church had applied the anxious determination of one who has lost an important object, Tess would have received the support she needed during her time of hurt. It makes me ponder the question: What will I do for the hurting Tess's of the world?"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The story is well known; one can choose from many editions or printings. If given the choice, choose Norton Critical Editions for the classics.This edition includes factual background provided by Hardy's pre-eminent biographer, Michael Millgate, who opines on the \\"originals of, and models for, Tess Durbeyfield.\\" Absolutely fascinating.Critical essays include contemporary criticism: Robert Louis Stevenson panned it; Henry James enjoyed it despite it being \\"chock-full of faults and falsity.\\"Virginia Woolf's six-page essay regarding \\"Tess\\" is worth the price of this edition.But most illuminating is the verbatim interview with Thomas Hardy himself concerning the ending of the story. When asked why he gave \\"Tess\\" the ending he did, he answered: \\"For the simple reason I could not help myself...When I got to the middle of the story the characters took their fates into their own hands, and I literally had no power.\\"Reading \\"Tess\\" without the supplementary material and criticism will leave you having enjoyed a most wonderful buffet but having missed out on the dessert.One will also get so much more enjoyment from \\"Tess\\" if one reads either Millgate's or Martin Seymour-Smith's biography of Thomas Hardy. I prefer the latter."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This book will capture you and pull you in as you follow Tess Durbeyfeild, the blameless rape victim whose tragic jounrey through Wessex, England brings her love, despair, comedy (yes, there is some), friendships, tears, self-awareness, empowerment, but ultimately tragedy.This book is sad...yes, but Thomas Hardy's poetic prose litterally makes the insides of the reader do summersaults. This story printed on the pages of \\"Tess\\" are more than a novel, they are a portal into the world of a blameless woman. You'll feel the pain of these characters, escpeically our heroine Tess."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"One favorable evening, Tess in her white garb attends May-Day dance in sleepy town of Marllott. A passerby not used to sophistication will incline to notice her. It is not the extravagance, nay the ostentatiousness of the girl's beauty, but the softness in spirit and demeanor conspicuous on her big, beautiful eyes that sets her apart. The same passerby endowed with experience will not pinpoint Tess among the young, comely girls as someone prone to vicissitude of tragedies. Unfortunately, this is not the case.Tess Durbeyfield later known in the novel as Tess d'Urberville is the hapless victim if not the heroine of this tragic tale. Born from poor parents, she is whisk away to work for the rich d'Urberville family. There she meets Alec, the handsome scion of d'Urbervilles clan. His incessant seduction of the young maiden results in violation of her rights. Forlorn, she returns home to the embarrassment of her parents and her neighbors. Stripped of clear prospect in life, she travels miles and miles away to be a milkmaid. While in the vast dairy field of Thalbothay, Tess falls madly in love with Angel Clare, the fledgling agriculturist of noble descent, convinced to make the newcomer his wife. Thus the journey that leads Tess from one farm to another is side by side with her lamentations over the two Englishmen and becomes her heart's landscape that stretches beyond endurance.Hardy, an architect by tuition, molds his male characters in an anvil of insensitivity. Their frozen hearts incapable of thawing by burning tears of a woman's pleading. As to his female character like Tess, Hardy constructs her similar to obelisk with solid foundation of faith that gradually narrows at the peak.Unsurprisingly, Victorian society scorned Hardy when this novel came out in 1891. The way he chose to describe Tess and her violation were less subtle in comparison to Eliot's writings. At present society however, Thomas Hardy is as impeccable as the clock ticking on the wall. He is in command of his story as if time is in command of denizens elsewhere. Under no circumstance he pauses to please his readers. He continues and takes them where nothing exists but the certainty of time."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is among the best novels I have read when judged on its purely literary merits. Hardy's command of imagery in his creation of the nuanced satire of society and the values it imposes upon Victorian women is outstanding. And, Hardy uses nature to structure the novel and reflect the plot. He is also able to introduce a fatalist approach to the characters' actions that flows seamlessly with his characterization of them. However, Tess is more than an invaluable piece of English literature.Tess of the D'Urbervilles is also a strong insight into the forces of nature that shape our lives. It is a tale about the unlucky girl Tess, who has to endure suffering on two fronts: from the man who takes advantage of her, and the man who rejects her. She is symbolic of the person within us all, who is oppressed by the outside world, and depressed from within. She is humanity, and her story will speak to anyone who reads this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I read this in about 8 hours. I loved the prose, the descriptions, the whole feel of the book. I have to say I have a hard time with the type of heroine who just lets things happen to her like this. You know the characters I am referring to---I mean this book was kind-of like an 8 hour train wreck. I knew what was going to happen, well, at least that it wouldn't have a happy ending. But the writing is so great I couldn't help myself!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Timeless story of a woman and her struggle to care for those she loved. Fighting against the male dominated society of her time, Tess sacrifices her own interests to provide for her family and attempt to stay true to the man she loves. Hardy does a wonderful job of painting the landscape and using it to enhance Tess's physical struggles. His portrait of Tess as a strong woman is balanced with her vulnerability, pure heart and hope for a better future.Norton's version includes insight into Hardy's background and the writing of Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Very helpful towards understanding the dynamics of the story."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Many readers will fail to realise that such a tragic life was the common lot of young, attractive poverty stricken women ages ago just as it is today. Children and teens continue to be sold and/or directed to a life of drudgey, service or near slavery, if not in fact slavery, by parents knowing no way out of their own dire conditions. That poverty worldwide continues to dictate a similar fate for young ones today while we, in comfortable surroundings, debate the merits of a novel, here in America, is a sad legcy indeed for a tale of warning, and unfortunately, of prediction. It is all well and good to fasten ones attention on a good resd-but pray do not miss the point! Hypocrisy lives on when the book is finished."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is one of the greatest novels ever written.

It is the story of a tragic heroine whose life is shaped by events beyond her control.I purchased the book for a college class and hope to read more by the author.The descriptions of life in rural 19th century England are superb."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"By today's standards certain passages of this book may seem rather vague and subtle, but they were shocking when first written--enough that the book was subject to heavy censorship--vital passages from it were removed. And that is really what makes this book so grand. Its take on the double standards of the society in which fictional Tess lived may seem very distant from today's post-60's equality society, but it was very real then.The book follows Tess' journey through the English countryside, but what makes it so fascinating is the constant flow of her thought patterns as she tries to rationalize the hand she has been dealt. The modern reader may be befuddled, as her thoughts are representative of another culture and another time, but what is fascinating is the little insights on human nature that shine through. The joy she feels tempered by the despair in her past. The ignorant self-righteousness of overzealous youth. The mistakes that even very good, well-meaning people can make, without realizing it, that hurt others deeply. We hope for her as she lives through the initial tragedy, the slow recovery, the surge of joy she experiences, we are disgusted at the hypocritical betrayal that eventually leads to her final breakdown.The prose itself too has a personality, often taking time to smell the roses and indulge in the lush scenery, fascinating historical anecdotes and social interactions that Tess deals with on a daily basis. For those who over-glamorize the past, here is a very honest look at the physical and mental hardships people faced in it. Hardy quotes Ascham: 'We find a short way, by a long wandering.'"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy is an extraordinary writer; though his writing is poetic, and includes on point historical references, he is an imaginative and thoughtful storyteller. Hardy reveals Tess's soul with such care and regard that she is irresistibly complex; delicate and strong willed, deeply loyal and obstinately independent, yet submissive and capable of extreme violence. So well did I come to understand her that, over time, I could predict her reactions and decisions -- though I hoped she would decide otherwise. Once a preacher reveals to Tess's father his connection to a long lost prominent family, Tess's is life is set on a seemingly unalterable path. Used, manipulated, misjudged and shamed, she struggles on, grinding out a living in unspeakably harsh conditions, while resisting with all her might a man who had already stolen her innocence and would shamelessly destroy her soul as she waiting for the man who had abandoned her. I found myself wincing at her pain, hoping she would receive what she deserved rather than what life seemed intent on doling out to her. Perhaps the best novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\" is, well, the story about Tess of the D'Urbervilles, a \\"simple,sensuous and passionate\\" peasant girl whose maturation into a woman has tremendous antipathy to its brim. The transfiguration of \\"a fine and handsome\\" country lass into a blooming woman with hapless consequences is the theme of this the most ambitious tragic Hardyan novel and the artistic flair of the late Victorian novelist blended with the subtle craftsmanship transcends the individual concern into one of the society.The proposition involved in \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\" first published in 1891 in three volumes has a tragic enough diction as we get it so clearly throughout the 550 or so odd pages of the book. It is to contract the unending horizon of the human life into a miniscule and apparently insignificant domain of an individual, who's inexperienced, unsophisticated, candid and uncanny. Tess Durbeyfield is a meek, submissive sixteen-and-a-half year old country girl with several siblings, a dissipated father and an illusioned mother living in the village of Marlott in the county of 19th. century fictitious Wessex,Hardy's eternal refuge from the real world outside. The chance discovery of John Durbeyfield from Parson Tringham, the antiquary of Stagfoot Lane, of his ancestral line of D'Urbervilles and a freak accidnt culminating in the death of one of his horses for which Tess herself shouldrs the blame sends the eponymous protagonist of this darkly compelling drama to find monetary solace in the wealthy Mrs. D'Urberville. As if the exploitation of the have nots in terms of financial issues weren't enough, the poor peasant girl from the poor \\"blighted\\" Durbeyfield family is seduced by Mrs. D'Urberville's sensual and lustful son Alec. Alec shuns her, Tess becomes pregnant, the child passes away in infancy, the unmarried mother mother starts working as a diarymaid in a farm, the Talbothays, falls in love with Angel Clare, the rector's son.....the whole flow of the tyde has a strangely familiar suspicion about itself and it's actually Thomas Hardy's exceptional gift for exploring a relatively small setting to compile a general drama of human life that transpires real tragic proportions from a fictitious figure.Art is indeed often illusory, sometimes it's even a whisper of the urge of reformation; but in more probabilities than one, art is symbolic, a sign of much deep-seated intent. The genuine accomplishment of all forms of art---be it literature, painting,sculpture,music or much else---is to portray the vastness of the human expanse in the most trimmed space and geniuses of all ages in all spheres of art have managed to do just that. Van Gogh's \\"Sunflowers\\" and \\"The Starry Night\\" are more symbolic than cliches, Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina\\" is the depiction of social turmoil in 19th. century Russia, Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" is a journey through a distorted and divided soul's mind and Eric Clapton's song \\"Tears of Heaven\\" is the ultimate homage to our passed away beloved ones. \\"Tess of the D'Urbevilles\\" too is a metaphor for agonies, humiliations, inward and outward strifes, twists and turns in life and the ultimatum. The unprecedented and nihilistically conspiring turn of events that Tess encounters in her hard and lonely life could've been thrown to anyone in general and any woman of any age in particular and through Tess's character as well as through the brilliant evocation of the fictional Wessex landscape and people, Hardy stags \\"the ache of modernism\\"in the novel.This abyss of \\"the ache of modernism\\" is aptly poured into the images of the rustic realm and the ascend of the morally and spiritually corrupt. Nowhere in the book is this concept clearer than in the nature of the shrewd and machiavellian Alec D'Urberville. A sinful man come to no good by demolishing an unsuspecting girl's life, Alec is also a preacher of the Gospels in his so-called reformed stage. But all his baser passions are aroused on seeing Tess after four years and he turns into a wolf once more: \\"Remember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master again. If you are any man's wife, you are mine!\\" This to a Tess whose innocent flaw of revealing her horrendous past to Angel on their weddind night had caused their subsequent separation and 'the deserted wife\\"-'s struggle in sustaining hr livelihood. The typical male sexual desires and possessive phyche is symbolized in Angel Clare whose own sinful past is acceptable but not Tess's unconditioned misery.Throughout the novel, the bounteous description of the landscape, the environment and Nature keeps the reader spell-bound at the author's immense imaginative power, marvellous visualisation skill and abundant choice of similes and metaphors and aptly used words. Yet the language and mood always maintain a touch of pessimism and not even spares the simple, unrestrained and self-sacrificing friendship of Marian,Retty Priddle,Izz Huett and Tess.Hardy is barely good at analysing characters and that is vividly exposed towards the end of the novel. Angel returns from Brazil and scampers to rejoin with \\"a cottage-girl, his young wife\\" only to find her with Alec D'Urberville once again. In utter desperation of realising that she was taken in by Alec with morbid promises about her dishevelled family, Tess kills him and then elopes with Angel nly to be caught within a short span of time and be hanged. Such a sudden turnaround of events is too confusing and leaves one wondering whether more words and pages should've been devoted to such critical situations. The reader rues too the missingdescription of Tess's and Angel's marriage as much as the incomplete pictored characters' change of notions.That the end of the novel is a befitting tribute, be it poetically just, tragic or sarcastic, to the three major characters is a Jack jumping out of the box. Alec's sin is too much for this world to bear and so he dies; Tess's life is too inundated with misery, despair, responsibility and uncertainty and so she meets with a tragic end; Angel's puritan perspective finds him a pure, genteel partner in the shape of Tess's younger sister Liza-Lu.What adds jewels to the crown are the dramatic effects installed into the novel to make the reader approach the chain of events with a sigh and regret. What if Tess's written confession pushed under Angel's door hadn't gone under the carpet? Surely the tragic aftermath could've been bypassed. Again, had Tess not overheard her husband's brothers' critical approach to her, she would've surely met with her in-laws and her life would've turned over a new leaf. But tragedy is always concentrated on inevitability and waivering of the obvious and so it is in the case of Tess, the \\"little fool\\".The fate of an unassuming girl \\"put to by an Enemy in the shape of a friend' and played from one court to another and back again like a shuttlecock isn't rare enough but what's rare is the quality of Hardy to paint a solemn picture about the essence of the issue. True, the book does often become a laboured read and provokes a deep pang of pain, anger, frustration, resentment, resentment and a rebellious intent,but the reader cannot help but fel that \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" is \\"a new kind of beauty, a beauty of tragic tone\\".SUBHANKAR MONDAL, UG STUDENT, BANGALORE, INDIA"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Probably Hardy's most famous work and definitely containing his most sympathetic heroine. Takes direct aim at the class system and gender roles and forces the reader to see stark differences between what is socially acceptable and what is socially ridiculed. Note how Tess is blamed for her past more than Alec is, when it's Alec's fault Tess ends up as she does. A final ultimate retribution does surface but of course, at the expense of Tess's future. She's heartbreaking here, especially when she writes to Angel, pleading for his love and forgiveness. You can feel every second of her plight , right down to the harsh outdoor work she's forced to endure in order to stay alive. All dust, sweat and fatigue... Supporting characters are as vivid as the main ones... This may be Hardy's most complete and upsetting story. He really puts the players (thus the audience) thru the ringer."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"it truly is an amazing story of love, strength, passion and second chances.

After reading newer stories, this took me back to a time when there was no description on being intimate in this story. Kind of nice to know it and not visibly read it. I enjoyed her honesty."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I had read this book about 25 years ago whilst a student in high school for A'Level Literature(Grade 11-12 - Jamaica, West Indies). Whilst reading the 50 Shades Trilogy recently, I noted the references to Tess in that book and it perked my interest in this book. I decided to re-read it as I really couldn't remember it much and wondered how I would interpret it now being more mature and experienced. Well suffice it to say that this book is devastatingly excellent! The language is hard to get at first (having not read a Thomas Hardy in a long time!).... it's a Thomas Hardy novel so you know he's very detailed and it's going to be tragic as he doesn't do happy ever after! The novel is set in Victorian England and features its heroine Tess a very poor country girl. It details her journey from innocent young girl on the cusp of womanhood to womanhood. It is essentially a love tragedy but not in the manner of Romeo and Juliett, its more, more real, more realistic. Its speaks to just how tragic life can be when the right man doesn't meet the right woman at the right time, about missed opportunities, and, depicts how the biggest of injustice and violation often happens to the most vulnerable and undeserving of persons. It speaks to how morals and society's beliefs can cause us pain and sorrow and often to punish those undeserving of same. But that was life then and its still so today. Suffice it to say that this book is 100 times better than the 50 Shades Trilogy and has impacted me so profoundly, I just can't understand how I didn't see the monumental tragedy it is when I was 17 years old. As a result I've taken to re-reading most of my literature books. This book is a must read for those who can manage."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Absolutely loved the story it's definitely worth reading through.

Descriptive words and never a boring section.

Besides the fact that it is a classic - and I think that every teenager or young person in one's twenties must read it - I learned that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a pretty controversial novel when Thomas Hardy first released it. As we know from history and from literature courses, the Victorians considered themes such as sex, religion, the condition of women or the lives of the peasants taboo subjects. Fortunately we are more open-minded today and we don't make a big fuss of what's moral or not in books such as this one. I guess that Thomas Hardy had the intention to open the peoples' eyes - though it is a fictional story - that unfortunate things were happening to innocent girls during that time.The story is very realistic and the characters are complex.Tess is a free-spirited girl until her destiny changes and becomes more difficult. Tess swings between strength and weakness, between reason and her heart. I admire her capacity of dusting herself off and decide to find another place to work, in order to help her poor family. Although Angel is far away, her hope that he will come back someday does not leave her. I didn't like the fact that she constantly blamed herself for the first bad episode of her life which led her to other complicated situations. She felt guilty for something she wasn't aware of or she wasn't taught to avoid.The book also gives us a glimpse of how were the lives of peasants, and the depiction of the landscapes will appeal to those how love nature.I won't say anymore because I don't want to ruin your reading.Therefore read Tess of the D'Urbervilles because you can enter in Tess' world and learn more about her troubles."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I must admit that this is one of the few classics that I have not read, so when I found a free copy for my Kindle, I immediately downloaded it. And the story does not disappoint. Hardy is a master of taking you to a time in place in the past and uses verbage and setting descriptions that put you right in the story. Hardy's characters are brought to life and you feel as if you could know someone with these same characteristics in the here and now. The ending of this story, for me personally left something to be desired, but I really could not put it down. If you have not read this story, yet, please do!On a side note, I would love to see a contemporary adaptation of this story and see how the characters would interact with each other, as social standing, money, love, and betrayal are certainly themes worth examining in this day and age."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Should not be made into an afterschool special.

Good read."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I enjoyed reading this classic tragedy. Tess is so sweet you want to know her more and more, which led to shock after shock. I appreciated the footnotes and explanations at the end of the book. I also enjoyed Hardy's colorful descriptions. I was surprised at how similar life in thenineteenth century was to today's life."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"The writing here is truly captivating. Hardy presents his principal characters in much the same way as other famous writers of his day; that is, the once nobled family,having fallen on hard times, now needs to be brought from the brink of disaster by marrying off one its daughters to someone of status. Tess does not dissapoint, in that she has spunk, principles, and a sense of duty. This story is filled with intrigue, unlikely loyalties, and an ending that will reward you for picking up this book.The bonus here is that I read the book for free on my Kindle!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I first read Tess in preparation for my IB high school exam (9 years ago). Thus, like many other of the reviewers on this page, I was &quot;forced&quot; to read. I must admit that at first the reading was quite tedious. It must have taken me two months to read through the novel. If I had written a review after this first encounter with Tess I might well have given the novel a two star (**) rating. I believe one of the explanations for this lack of enthusiasm is that I did not get along well with my English teacher and I felt that I could not allow myself to enjoy Tess, lest I let my teacher score an important victory.As the exam period itself approached I read Tess four more times with increasing enjoyment. The last few readings were truly enlightening. I knew exactly what I would encounter on the next page and yet I shuddered with anticipation, reacting to the words even before my eyes caught them.It seems clear to me now that the reason I enjoyed Tess so much was not only the familiarity bred by multiple readings but also the dissection of the novel in the classroom. I must confess that although we had problems getting along, my English teacher was excellent.The only advice I can give those of you who doubt Tess' greatness is to muster some courage and give the novel another chance. Tess is on my all time Top 10 list along with The Grapes of Wrath, which, incidentally, I was &quot;forced &quot; to read in my high school English class."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Not a frustration in the negative sense, but in fact, this was a book which I could hardly put down. The fact that I felt compelled to express my thoughts here perhaps point to it's even greater impact on me. A fabulous story, and of course, tragic in the end... And why do I feel frustrated? Perhaps merely for the fact of Tess ' rash action, almost one of self defence, which closes her tragic life. And the want or need for the story to extend beyond the final close to see her defence succeed and her life prevail. However, these are not the modern times, and the chasm seems wide. Tess is a beautiful person - innocent and with only the intention of good - and suffers as a result. While not a ground breaking novel, it's eloquence and true to life appeal allows it to become part of you.

This story was attacking so many different subjects in the time it was first published, which makes it all the better to read. I wouldn't recommend this book to just anyone, only people who can appreciate how the text of this book was written and how the Hardy wove many different ideas together to create a tragic life and ending for such a young girl. The impact of what happened throughout Tesses short life is what stunned me the most. Innocence or mentality? Only the author knows."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"What else can I say that the other positive reviewers havn't yet? It was wonderfully written and truly heart wrenching. It took a lot of guts for Hardy to publish it as well because it was was a very contriversial for its time and contains messages that can be carried over into today even. A perfect example of Victorian literature, which is 2nd to none except fantasy ;)"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess is just beautifully written. the language is poetry, and it is melodious. duty, fate, and destiny appear throughout the book. and they make the readers wonder about their own life. it is just an amazing book!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This novel, which I have just finished, is without a doubt one of the most incredible reads I have had. Immaculately crafted, beautifully written and profoundly moving. wow."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A masterpiece. It is hard to find the right words to express my feelings about this beautiful and tragic story. Tess, the lovely, tenderhearted milkmaid who, in the face of much adversity never gives up, is one of my favorite heroines in all literature. I could fully understand her dilemma, and that of Angel as well. It is true that there are times when Destiny is stronger than us, no matter how good our intentions."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a novel which focuses on the double standards of the Victorian era. It is a beautifully written novel about one wopman and her struggle to find love and her duty to her family.Tess was a child who sought to right her wrong by working for her &quot;cousins&quot; she hoped that by doing this she could become a productive member of the family particularly as the eldest child. She was required to take care pof most of the chores as her siblings were too young to help the family. As a daughter she was taught that it was her duty to marry wealth so that her family would not have to live in squallor. In her attempt to do this she was taken advantage of, but not raped, and she was made pregnant. She could not abort the child, and she could not properly carry the child to term without being married. She did the latter of these because she hated the childs father. Many times she wished that the child would die so that it would not have to live with the bastard lable. She felt that it was best that the child be taken from the earth to make her and her child's life easier.Tess soon finds that there is a doiuble standard for pre-marital sex in Victorian England. Her husband, on there wedding night admits that he has been promiscuous, Tess is greatly relieved by this because she thinks that he will be more accepting of her situation when she tells him, this is not so. Angel, her husband, walk out on tess and leaves her to fend for herself, an unloved and un cared for woman. This novel ends sadly with Tess' death after Angel comes back to her and they live happily for a number of days.This novel is an excellent example of social commentary in the form of literary art. This novel is a poinient dipiction of the life of a young woman in Victorian England. A well written novel with excellent character development one of the best book that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I am irritated and unnerved to see such poor reviews for Hardy's novel \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\". Hardy's style is not to everyone's taste; some argue that it is laboured and far too flowery, and this may be true in some cases, but the moral message and the profound nature of this novel far outweigh the archaic style of writing that Hardy chooses to adopt.The novel, as the title suggests, focuses on one woman in Victorian England. Her foolish and drunken father finds that he is the descendant of the ancient and landed family of the d'Urbervilles, and Tess is sent by her parents to meet one of her descendants in order to get some help from the family's financial difficulties. Alec d'Urbervilles then seduces Tess, and she is left, with illegitimate child, to deal with the consequences.After her child dies, she finds work on a farm and falls in love with Angel Clare. She feels that she cannot marry him because of her past, and, after his insistence, gives into her heart and marries him, although consumed by guilt. Eventually she confesses her past, and Angel leaves her, travelling to Brazil without her.This is not, as one reviewer described it, \\"like a bad TV movie\\". Hardy's novel is a comment on Victorian society. Tess is the ultimate victim, as many have pointed out, but she is not the victim because she chooses to be, but because society puts her in this position. Those who criticise her for being weak and being unlike any other \\"feisty\\" women in other nineteenth century novels forget that, unlike characters such as Emma Woodhouse and Lizzie Bennet, Tess was poor; and that, unlike Jane Eyre, Tess was raped. Tess is the perfect example of a blameless woman who cannot escape from the confines of society. Arguably the point of the novel is that Tess cannot change how people perceive her, and, because she has no means to support herself, she has to hide the truth and battle on with the terrible injustice that has been done to her. Victorian society would simply have ostracised a woman who had had an illegitimate child and not married the father, no matter the circumstances, so I find it deplorable that people feel that Tess was spineless when she was placed in such an impossible position.Also, any new reader, and, indeed, any old reader who hasn't accepted this point yet, should perhaps try to understand that Tess is suffering, throughout the novel, from terrible grief, guilt and depression, which is surely enough to earn anyone's sympathy, not their scorn. Hardy did not invent a \\"cocker spaniel\\" of a woman; she is a literary construct and is used in a wider sense to illustrate those taken advantage of in Victorian society; and the only reason she comes back \\"for more\\" punishment is because she cannot escape it, no matter how she tries.Additionally, it has been claimed that Hardy's characters are one-dimensional and contradictory. I take issue with this. Alec may be one-dimensional in some senses, but he is an unremittingly unpleasant person; it destroys the comment being making if Alec was an abused child, or in any way a redeemable person. And yes, Alec is turned into a preacher, but anyone who believes that he sincerely let go of his previous persona must not have understood his character properly. It is a perfect way of introducing him again into the story, and a perfect way to illustrate his own falseness, by comparing him with Angel's father, who is the Good Samaritan. It is the contrast between what Tess could have chosen and what she did - in fact, arguably, not meeting Angel's father is the only mistake that SHE makes (opposed to outside forces placing decisions upon her).Angel on the other hand is in no way one-dimensional. Although his opinion of Tess does change rapidly, it is not unbelievable on careful reading. He likes to think of himself as a maverick and someone outside of society's rules, but he is an excellent portrayal of how we all are constructs of our society. Angel, although he loves Tess, keeps referring to the fact that she is \\"pure\\", which she is not (through no fault of her own). This is a clear indication, early on in the novel, that Angel has painted himself a false image of his bride-to-be, and, for all his good qualities, he is as flawed as the next person. I fail to see how this is a shallow portrayal of a character.Tess is also not a nonsensical, weak being, but a beautiful, sad creation of Hardy's used to show injustices, and highlight practises that should be stopped. Besides that, in her own right, she is a clever, melancholy character who really should inspire the reader's pity.I have no objections with people who dislike this novel because they dislike the style or because they dislike some character development for sensible reason; but when people decide to abuse a novel because they don't seem to have bothered to read into it properly, I find it irritating to say the least. This novel requires people to put themselves in the place of another and feel sympathy with another person.One reviewer commented that the novel was ill-received when it came out, and should have stayed that way. The novel was considered offensive because of the implied sexual context and because of its criticisms of Victorian morals, but this does not make it a bad novel; this means that it encourages people to think, to question and to re-evaluate. Any novel that is so brave as to find an injustice in society and write a whole novel criticising it deserves our praise; and Hardy's writing, far from doing the idea down, only helps to elevate the moral: that society can be wrong."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Having just finished this book a mere few hours ago the pain of it is fresh in my mind, but I'm sure it will distract me for weeks, such is the intensity of this tragedy. The only other novel of Hardy's I have ever read - Jude the Obscure - was a good book, stable and interesting, though not compelling until it's heart-wrenching twist three quarters of the way through the book. It was, in essence, more a social commentary, so it was with some surprise that I absorbed the constant emotion and passion that was this book. The basic storyline is as follows: Tess Durbeyfield, a young woman of a poor country family, is sent to visit her rich cousin, Alec d'Urbeville, after learning of her (perhaps mythical) relation to the ancient family which bears his name. In the obscure randomness that fate casts over life, innocent Tess is then pursued by perhaps the only man she could never tolerate (Alec), who is as his most evil in the early parts of the book. At Alec's house Tess works as a keeper to the poultry and is assaulted by Alec's constant sexual attentions until finally (and this is suggested rather than explained), exhausted and numb, she submits to intercourse with him. She later gives birth to a baby, whom she names Sorrow, who soon dies; and then meets a man she had glimpsed once years before at a dance: Angel Clare. Working together at a milking farm, they become drawn to each other despite Tess's unwillingness to incite the attentions of any man. Their love for each other grows but Tess knows that she dare not enter into marriage considering her past and a society that is both ludcrously religious and prejudiced. The strength of her love finally wears her down and they wed. However, on that very night she confesses her past, and is cruelly thrown aside by Clare, who now begins to view her as an impure woman separate to the Tess he had always loved (despite his past containing a similar history). After suffering years of solitutde and hardship, Tess finally gives up on Clare and falls in the way of Alec d'Urbeville again, relying upon him for the care of herself and her family. Sick and wasted, Clare eventually realizes the mistake he has made in casting Tess aside and finds her at d'Urbeville's mansion: too late. This brings the story to its close where greater tragedy ensues.The book was brilliant in its emotive persuasion and its depiction of Tess, who is impossible to not feel for, and, indeed, love. The misfortunes of her life are never self-inflicted, and we are left to wonder at the end at the awful nature of a world that would bring such sorrow upon one person. Tess is wonderful, stoic, and pure in her unyielding love for Clare; d'Urbeville is horrible in his initial portrayal as the villain who will singlehandedly destroy Tess's life, though is perhaps a little less repulsive at the end as one understand's the depths of his feeling for her; and Clare is the one who holds in his hands the ability to restore all past wrongness and find joy himself, but tragically fails to do so because of pride and convention.Overall, there were only two problems I had with the storyline: the first being Tess's succumbing to Alec's sexual persuasion in the beginning - if we are to believe that she is repulsed so many times by Alec's advances so completely and bodily, how are we to believe that she so easily concedes in one (unmentioned) incident? Her strength is greater than that. And the second is one which has been mentioned by another reviewer here: the ending, where a minor, unimportant character is introduced as a means through which to resolve everything, where in fact she is incapable of doing so, since we know nothing about this character, and can therefore put no faith in her.Despite these minor quibbles the whole of the book, with its engaging plot and brilliant prose, is worth more than the sum of its parts, with the pain of lost love being the principle effect one experiences long after the reading is over. Tess is beautiful."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This novel, contrary to some of the other comments, is a wonderful piece of literature. Although not the most uplifting, it is a great example of Hardy and Deterministic and Naturalistic fiction. Despite Tess' best efforts (like Jude in the other Hardy novel), she is unable to escape the poverty and misfourtune which she attempts to leave behind. Although somewhat lengthy, the novel is one of the better pieces of British fiction to come out of the period."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is an intensely depressing but brilliant depiction of the connections between love, fear, and guilt. The vivid clarity with which Hardy draws Tess as a vulnerable innocent struggling, and ultimately failing to come to terms with the merciless world makes this a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES is well worth reading; it is one of Hardy's finest works.In the beginning of the novel, Tess Durbeyfield's irresponsible father is informed by a local minister that is a descendent of a noble family, the D'Urbervilles. Her parents (and especially her father) are greatly heartened by the news that they are, however distantly, nobility. Tess is therefore sent to her richer relations, the d'Urbervilles of Trantridge, to claim kinship and benefit from their superior finances.Upon taking her position as a bird-tender, Alec D'Urberville is captivated by Tess's natural country beauty and seduces her. Tess is an innocent, and she returns home to bear her child. After bringing shame upon her family, Tess must attempt to build a respectable life out of a situation that denies her every particle of respectability she once had.Hardy writes in a rather long-winded, flowery style. His vocabulary is rich, but it can become tediously melodramatic at times. The plot of this novel is full of coincidences that seem rather implausible, but it is a wonderful portrayal of the prejudices of society. Tess is an absolutely heartbreaking character, enduring trial after trial silently, feeling it is her due.TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES is a solid read, but be prepared to be thoroughly depressed and disillusioned with society at its finish."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another. Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"One of my friends recommended that I read Thomas Hardy, but she cautioned me: &quot;Thomas Hardy isn't for everyone.&quot; I discovered while reading &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; that what she may have meant is that Thomas Hardy didn't write light works to be read and then forgotten about. Through this book, Hardy addresses issues that society in his day didn't want to face: the fate of the farm worker in the increasingly industrialized society, predjudices held against minority groups, and the inequality of women. All of this is not to say that this is a dry or boring work -- &quot;Tess&quot; is gripping, riveting, and almost overpowering in its emotional appeal. One cannot read this book without becoming involved in Tess's situation. I have never been so angry with a character in a book as I was with Angel Clare at a certain point in the novel. So, in conclusion, &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; isn't for everyone. . . but it should be for every thinking person, everyone who isn't afraid to face issues, think deeply about them, and apply them to life."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Some great discussions come out of this book. Thomas Hardy has a very distinct style, and uses the environment essentially as another character, so it may be beneficial to at least have some familiarity with England before reading. No one can read this book without having strong opinions about the characters, especially the two main men. This is one of the standout pieces of literature of its time and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" describes the experiences of a woman who, through no fault of her own, falls outside of the moral code of the Victorian era in which she lives and suffers long-reaching consequences as a social outcast. Hardy's novel is carefully well-drawn, but the novel's content demands far more than Hardy could acceptably give it in the nineteenth century. For example, the rape scene is only is carefully stepped around, inferrable only from the fact that Tess subsequently has a child; Hardy also has to carefully frame some of the scenes, such as that of Alec d'Urberville's murder, in order to avoid too closely examining the psyche of the criminal. Hardy's writing is at its best in the scenes surrounding Angel and Tess's estrangement - a safe enough environment - when he can freely move within the minds of his characters. In short, \\"Tess\\" is the stuff of a twentieth-century novel written in the nineteenth, which leaves some of the emotion that modern readers are accustomed to lacking."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Even reviewing Tess makes me choke back tears. Hardy develops one of the most truely beautiful female characters in all of English literature; then, like an evil wizzard, slowly tears her to shreds and finally grounds her into dust.A modern young woman growing up now might find it hard to identify with Tess. She is a poor farm worker and a product of the cultural changes at the beginning of the industrial revolution in England. But there is enough of a study of basic human nature here to make her story valuable to just about any reader.Hardy's prose is gifted, deep descriptive narative and character development. You may end up loving Tess; it's hard not to hate Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the worst books I have ever read. I read this book in high school, though I am now in college, but don't discount this review because of that. Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end. I disliked all of the characters so much, that it made the book have not one redeeming quality to it. If you want to read a Hardy book, read Mayor of Casterbridge--it is much better!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Morality is subject to some rolling blackouts in this book. At the end, the law stepped in and made sure that the destruction was mutual. Law seems to be particularly inept in situations where a book is this hard on the reader, and those critics in the Norton Critical Edition who consider this novel almost a crime against literature have a point. If all the characters were being put on trial, instead of merely trying to live, the law would allow each of them to be tried separately because of the doctrine of mutually antagonistic defenses. There were parts of this book I enjoyed: Angel Clare sorting the cows for milking made a lovely theme. Hardy kept referring to the barnyard as a &quot;barton,&quot; but I'm sure he wasn't directing that jibe at me, personally, because this book was written long before I was born. I've been to barnyards that were as full of &quot;mulch&quot; as the &quot;barton&quot; described in this book, and Hardy is putting things mildly. I liked the part when Alec had been reformed and Tess discovered him preaching to the Methodists without thinking that he was any better for all the things he was trying to say. Somehow Alec getting on the other side of things was still Alec, and he would have preferred to be happy than to preach all the time. For me, the plot revolved around Angel Clare's need to find a place where he could get money without shame. Alec had as much money as Tess would ever need, and he wanted to give it to her in his own way. There is an early baby problem that Tess didn't tell Alec about until they had more problems than any novelist could make disappear. D. H. Lawrence tried to understand this book in unfulfilled male and female principles, and aristocratic principles which isolated Tess and Alec d'Uberville. I'm glad this book has been appreciated so long that I finally read it. It was an involvement that went further than just feeling like a barnyard."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is quite simply the worst story i have ever read in my life.It was depressing, LONG, and meandered its way aimlessly till the end. Whats worse, the book could have ended half way and still had the same impact. The character still meets the same fate, everyone would have felt the same way, and the reader would have been spared several chapters of agonizing reading had she made a different choice after confessing her secret to Angel.If you like reading a depressing story where it seems like the author is taking sadistic joy in tormenting the protagonist, this is the story for you. For everyone else, stay far far away."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I am sorry to all of you who like this book but I would never wish a single soul to read this. This book has the plot: a girl goes to a farm, falls in love and everything goes wrong. The book just goes on and on. The only reason I read it was because my mother asked me to. This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because there was maybe four parts that consisted of 2 pages that were mildly interesting. Take my word for it. This book should be skipped."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover.

Everybody found it boring and too descriptive. If you have a choice, do not choose this book! To make it worse, it is incredibly long and depressing. DO NOT EVEN TOUCH IT!!!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Having read a number of classics recently, I have come to the conclusion that many of them are \\"classics\\" because they are great books to study, not great books to read. I'm sure I could spend years dissecting this book and finding new allusions, hidden references, and coincidental parallels. In fact, I found myself forced to re-read and, in some cases, grammatically deconstruct such large portions of this book to \\"get\\" it that I could probably claim to have read the book twice with a pretty straight face.If the book had been just a little worse, I would have been spared a lot of effort because I could have just written it off as being bad. Unfortunately, every time I was ready to throw in the towel, Thomas Hardy would throw in a turn of phrase or new way of seeing something that made me decide to ride along just a little longer to see where this was headed.In the end though, I have to cast my vote with many of the low star reviews here. Thomas Hardy's characterization of the landscape, farms, and villages beats his character development hands down. The plot moves like a fault line (millimeters per year followed by sudden jumps) and, frankly, by the end I felt more sense of elation at having reached the last page than a sense of regret that \\"the President of Immortals had ended his sport with Tess.\\" For once, I'm guessing that the Cliff's notes would be a better read than the actual book."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"WHY are poor, innocent school kids forced to read this intensly dull text? It is enough to put anyone off English Lit for LIFE. If anyone in authority is reading this, PLEASE take this piece of junk OFF the sylabus...PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"There are many 1-star reviews for this particular novel and I have to admit that I am rather confused. Many people lament the fact that Tess is somewhat of a weak woman, not a strong woman, defying Victorian convention and fighting for the rights of women. I'm not entirely sure why Tess's tragic and weak personality has people so up in arms enough to say that the book is terrible and unrealistic.Personally, I found this to be one of the greatest books I have ever read. I didn't find the text to be as easy to read as some of the other reviewers, and I was an English Lit major in college! It is difficult to get through in parts, you will yawn every so often, but fight through it-- use your brain and you won't regret it!The story is tragic and offers very little in the way of an explanation for Tess's extreme punishment. So if you are looking for a book about a woman who fights convention and social injustice, go read something else. If you want a story that illustrates the cruelty of fate, comments on the injustices of the world, or a shows how, if one doesn't fight, one can be trapped by the past... read this book.I certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This was the first Thomas Hardy novel I read, and it is still one of my favorites. The hypocritical late 19th century society views, and the strains they put on the human spirit. Hardy had a keen eye for what went on around him, and he was aware of how the old ways were being replaced - Edwardian enlightment was on it's way but Tess is the symbol of land of Wessex itself, violated, forsaken, and like the wounded birds she finds, longing to be put out of her suffering, despite how she endures until her situation becomes even more unbearable. Christian versus pagan, rural versus urban, her true love's struggle from his family's religious views and the restrictions of society's rules, end up costing Hardy's herione more than himself. Young Tess Durbeyfield, daughter of a poor farmer, finds herself at the mercy of a ne'er do well scoudrel, Alec d'Urberville, thought to be a wealthy relative. The girls' parents, in their naivete and ignorance, put their eldest child on a disasterous path in an attempt to improve their situation and trade on the ancient and noble family name. Tess's situation makes her an outcast, after giving birth to the cad's baby son who dies not long after birth, but she never asks for pity, and finds work at a dairy farm, only to fall in love with a provinicial minister's son, Angel Clare, who cannot forgive her past. Tragedy ensues at nearly every turn.***some spoilers herein***I think both men were unforgivable, both were terrible to Tess in different ways. Granted, Angel was nowhere near the controlling cad that Alec was, and yes Tess loved Angel. Alec thought his wealth could buy Tess's affection and possession was love. For Angel, since Tess didn't fit his idealized version of her, and that she wasn't a virgin (never mind the fact that she was raped), he couldn't bear that and took to the hills like a coward. His hypocrisy is maddening, especially since he considered himself to be such a free thinker and more open-minded than his pious family. He did see the error of his ways, returned her and they had a few days together before she was executed, but too little, too late. Tess is the most extreme victim in the novel, with Alec next, being the cause of her hardship and downfall, and for being the villain. And yes, I did say that Alec is a victim, a murder victim, but not an innocent victim. He had no qualms about manipulating situations, taking Tess against her will and using her father's death, her family's destituion, her husband's desertion and her hardships to possess her. In a time when women had virtually no rights and the fact that he had taken her virginity and fathered a child with her gave him a totally wrong sense of ownership and his determination to get her any way that he could is what lead to his fate. Both characters are doomed, while Angel must live with the fact that his actions toward the woman that he loved led to this tragedy. Not that Alec had no part in it, if he hadn't violated Tess and impregnanted her, no doubt there would have been a different outcome to her life and to his. But of course, there would have been no story, and no commentary on the standards of the time in the novel if those events had not taken place.There can be no happy ending, as this is a Hardy tale. But it makes its mark, and was immensely popular at the time of its publishing, despite the brutal critical response it received. The aching misunderstanding of longing love, the loss of innocence and a herione victimized by the standards of her era.A timeless masterpiece of literature. Tess lives beyond the pages of the book, as though Hardy knew a girl who embodied his most famous character. Worth adding to your library."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Published in 1891, this book was Thomas Hardy's best seller, and has become a literary classic. This was why I chose to read it, and I must say that I really liked it.When the middle-class Durbeyfield family learns that they are genealogically related to the noble family of d'Urbervilles, they send their beautiful daughter Tess to meet them and possibly receive a fortune from them. Tess discovers the d'Urberville family is actually of no relation to the real d'Urbervilles, and simply bought their prestigious name while they made their fortune. Tess stays and works at the d'Urberville household, and gets to know Alec, their son, who, er, treats her quite badly. I won't give away any details, but Tess has to deal with the results of Alec's treatment, and tries her best, though unsuccessfully, to move on.Though I don't usually go for many of these sappy character dramas, I really like how Hardy brought forth this novel. One develops immediate sympathy for Tess and her plight, yet she can at times be a very strong woman. The character development here is fantastic. I also liked the way Hardy juxtaposes the issue of social class (I think there must have been a law in England that every book in the nineteenth century had to confront social class in some way). Hardy also brings in symbols regarding Christian sin as well as paganism in this novel.I can see why some people would criticize this book as being slow or dull, but those readers would also probably say the same about any piece of 19th century British literature. I didn't find it especially slow, however. If you like books like Pride and Prejudice, Middlemarch, and Wuthering Heights, you'll love Tess of the d'Urbervilles."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I love the story of Tess. Considering many of the classics I have ever read, I think Tess is one of the easier ones to understand. The work itself is a masterful story. However, I take issue with Penguin's version. The Notes are just awful- referencing back and forth from your place in the book to the back is a nightmare and many times isn't worth breaking your flow. Some of the Notes are helpful and even necessary to understand the sentence, but others are pointless and annoying. I recommend a different version, either without notes entirely or with more reasonable ones."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I think part of the reason I kept so interested is because I had heard some horror stories about not being able to get through the book.

I watched her character change drastically from beginning to end. It was fun to see that change. I will read more Thomas Hardy because of this experience."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"In today's permissive day and age, it may seem far-fetched that 'Tess' was received as a bit risque by the British readership of the time. To readers a century later, the tragic story of Tess is very moving, and the nobel heroine evokes extreme sympathy from us.The novel also artfuly portrays the dynamics of life in 19th century England. We are presented with a crude, colloquial variety of the English language then spoken, in stark contrast to the stuffy, self-satisfied brand of sophisticated English that modern authors and film-makers would have us believe is all- pevasive amongst the English, in contrast to the bland, pedestrian English spoken by their brethren overseas.Hardy artfully portrays the dynamics of rural life on an English dairy farm; life that, despite the industrial revolution, is here probably not so different as it was centuries earlier.His characters are beautifully portrayed, with signicant depth. &quot;Tess&quot;, like the &quot;Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, depicts the thoughts, hopes and dreams of those consigned to a rual existence; those who are peripherally aware that the industrial revolution and the opportunities presented thereby, are radically altering life only a hundred kilometers away.Both 'Tess' and the 'Mayor' are brilliant tragedies. The astute reader knows that tragic events will ultimately prevail, but the dynamics, twists and turns of the plot in 'Tess', make it more of a compelling page turner: an excellent piece of 19-th century British lit. (If I had been forced to read it in high school, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it immeasurably less, so I commisserate with those students who were undderwhelmed by the book- read it again ten years later!).A brilliant story of an admirable, virtuous girl, who can only withstand the castigation visited upon her for the sins of others, for so long.

Perseverance is Tess' strongest trait"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbevilles, by Thomas Hardy, is a wonderful novel, which tragically and poignantly follows the ill-fated life of its heroine, Tess Durbeyfield. Through his exquisite use of imagery, his reflection of Tess in nature, and the continuing thread of tragedy which he weaves throughout the novel, Hardy is able to present to us one of the most memorable figures in English literature. Despite her sincerity and integrity, Tess is forever destined for disappointment, and Hardy's immensely lucid and descriptive writing allows the reader to appreciate this. I would recommend this tremendous piece of fiction to any readers interested in reading the work of a brilliant Victorian author, or for those who appreciate the paradox of sadness and beauty represented in the figure of a strong protagonist."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"In Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy employs nature as a tool in helping him depict and develop the tragic nature of his protagonist, Tess. At least two aspects of nature are central to achieving this end: First of all is the establishment of a correlation between Tess's mental state and natural settings. Second, the use of natural phenomena as a prediction of Tess's own fate. Hardy has fully exploited the use of nature to illustrate that Tess is the victim of her uncontrollable and predetermined Fate.Hardy establishes from the beginning the notion that the world is a mere &quot;psychological phenomenon&quot; (Hardy 101). One can, therefore, deduce from this &quot;fact&quot; that nature, as it is seen through Tess's eyes, is only the physical image of Tess's inner emotions during a particular period of time. It is during the intercepting period between her devastating seduction by Alec and her encounter with her future husband, Angel, that Tess feels most deje! cted. &quot;The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it was then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary&quot; (Hardy 100). Indeed, Mother Nature is the only place where Tess can attain &quot;absolute mental liberty&quot; from all her worldly troubles (Hardy 100) and where she can find her peace of mind.After her seduction by Alec, Tess gathers her strengths, recollects herself, and starts a new life as a milkmaid in a quiet countryside at a farm called Talbothays. This is a deliberate attempt on Tess's part to avoid the possibility of the occurrence of another event on such a castatrophic scale. Now, working closely with nature (cows to be specific), she has succeeded in &quot;shunning mankind&quot; (Hardy 101), and truly believes that she is laying a new foundation for her future (Hardy 124). Surrounded by serene natural settings, this &quot;fresh and virginal daughter of Nature&quot; (Hardy 137) finds tranquillity in her surroundi! ngs despite the fact that she is in the midst of misery. In! Tess's eyes, nature is beautiful because it brings her joy-- and because it is where she belongs to.Angel comes from a very religious and educated family. Although he would never think of &quot;sacrificing&quot; humanity for religion (Hardy 284), he is in actuality a very convention-bound individual. The moral code and the &quot;arbitrary law of society&quot; (Hardy 297) that accompany religion are deeply rooted in Angel's thinking. His presence at Talbothays disturbs the natural settings with the social customs he brings into the village &quot;which had no foundation in nature&quot; (Hardy 297). Hardy introduces Angel into the novel in order to signal a transition in Tess's life. Unfortunately, it is a transition for the worse. From this point on, as Tess' and Angel's relationship grows, Tess's relationship with nature, which has come to symbolize all that is good for her, has declined in proportion. Tess has allowed her relationship with the society (Angel) to take prec! edence over that with nature (by falling in love with and marrying Angel).&quot;Nightfall, which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer, as a lover&quot; (Hardy 368). Angel's passion for Tess in the summer does not carry beyond its boundary. Tess's dream of a happy life is shattered into a thousand pieces when her worst nightmare comes true-- Angel is unable to accept her past. As Tess's mental state changes, so does her perception of nature. The beautiful scenery at her once cherished village of Talbothays is no more. &quot;The gold of the summer picture was now grey, the colours mean, the rich soil mud, and the river cold&quot; (Hardy 269). In the place which Tess had once thought of as a place of rebirth after her disastrous experience with Alec, she now sees only the dullness and helplessness of a dead winter. Tess's view of nature is purely perceptual. What should have been natural-- fallen leaves and bare tree branches-- have become depre! ssing and unpleasant. These natural phenomena are, in truth! , nothing more than physical manifestations of her sadden and broken heart. Nature has taken on a melancholy outlook not because it is indeed melancholy but because Tess is projecting feelings upon it. This is Hardy's so-called &quot;psychological phenomenon.&quot;Another important method besides relating Tess' feelings with natural phenomena is the use of imagery to mirror Tess's own fate. In two instances, long before the end of the novel, the stage for the final act of Tess's life has already been inauspiciously set up. In the first instance, Tess is symbolized by different animals being hunted down in a field :&quot;[U]naware of the ephemeral nature of their (the animals') refuge and of the doom that awaited them later in the day, when, their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they were huddled together... till the last few yards of upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and they were every one put to death by the sticks! and stones of the harvesters&quot; (Hardy 103).Hardy speaks of &quot;doom that awaited them later in the day&quot;; Tess knows exactly what awaits her. &quot;She walked in brightness, but she knew that in the background those shapes of darkness were always spread. They might be receding or they might be approaching, one or the other, a little every day&quot; (Hardy 212). Tess, like these animals, is unable to defend herself from the &quot;harvesters.&quot; Tess's attempt to escape her fate in her &quot;refuge&quot; (Talbothays) proves to be futile. Without any question, Angel and Alec are the &quot;harvesters.&quot; Although they do not kill Tess in a physical sense, they must bear the responsibility of forcing her into the &quot;horrible narrowness.&quot; What is this &quot;horrible narrowness&quot;? It is the only option left for Tess to liberate herself once and for all from her past-- the killing of Alec (Hardy 406). Tess has done just that; and this is the fatal act t! hat destroy not only her past, but also her own ephemeral e! xistence.In the second instance, Hardy presents to the readers, in a graver tone, an even gloomier setting in which Tess is symbolized by pheasants-- also being hunted down: &quot;Under the trees several pheasants lay about, their rich plumage dabbled with blood; some were dead, some feebly twitching a wing, some staring up at the sky, some pulsating quickly, some contorted, some stretched out-- all of them writhing in agony except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to bear more&quot; (Hardy 296).One must admit that this scene best reflects and symbolizes the horrible experience Tess has gone through in the whole novel-- her struggle for survival, her indescribable agony, and finally, her &quot;luck&quot; that nature is unable to sustain her painful existence any longer. Hardy notes that the hunter of these birds has a &quot;blood-thirsty light in [his] eyes&quot; (Hardy 296). He is, however, civil and gentle for most! of the year-- except in autumn and winter (Hardy 296). This is where the change of seasons takes part in Hardy's shaping of a predetermined fate for Tess. Angel is &quot;civil and gentle&quot; to Tess during summer; but one also must also note that his rejection of her comes during winter. One can fairly say that Hardy leaves his readers no other choice but to convict Angel as the killer of Tess. He presents the end of Tess in his bloody account of the pheasants. In doing so, Hardy has revealed the unshakable destiny of his protagonist.Hardy is able to make use of his materialization of both the mental and fatalistic elements in the novel through his clever descriptions of nature to draw a portrait of a great tragic heroine. In the face of unbearable misery, only nature testifies to the sad story of this simple country girl. The speechless speaks for the inside of Tess. And the readers have been given a chance to realize that what will come is predetermined and inevitable.!Reference: Hardy, Thomas. Tess of the D'Urbervilles. New!

From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness.

His style of writing is beautiful, but a little drawn out.One theme that can be found throughout the book is that of the hunt. Tess is a hunted animal, pursued by a cruel world and a society that can accept the evil of men, yet rebuke women for their mistakes.Tess (cause and effect):Because of her beauty she is pursued. Because of her sex she is helpless. Because of her helplessness she is captured. Because she is captured she is violated. Because she is violated she is ruined."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess of the D'Urbevilles is one of the true literary greats. It's heroine is a charachter that one can always empathize with and as you travel through the book you find your self lost in admiration for this strong, honest woman.It is ultimately a tragic novel, but never sinks into hopelessness.

When Angel finally repents and sees how he is wrong, it is too late. Tess has already fallen back into sin with the man who caused her to fall many years before. Once she finds out Alec has deceived her, she not only despises him, she kills him. I just thought it was a good way to say that there are always consequences for our actions. I kept wishing the whole book that she had told Angel about her past before she married him. It would have spared them a lot of grief. I think he would have handled it better and hopefully been man enough to forgive her. It would have saved a lot of the grief that came later. What was really bad was how hypocritical Angel was when he confessed his own sin, she forgave him; yet when she confesses hers, he cast her out of his life.

The fascinating aspect of Hardy - in this work, as well as in others is the manner that Charaters and setting intertwine. Relationships are seemingly established but what renders Hardy a literary tragedian is his capacity of substantiating the relationships into pre-determined moulds; the ending is somewhat predictable but the psychology leading to it and how it is developed is the interesting part. My only problem with Hardy is how he characterizes Brazil - Curitiba and then follows with him being in Rio de Janeiro. I would have liked to see more written about the actual experience there - but that is a minor complaint. PS - for some of the readers out there: Brazil is NOT just a rainforest.

He sends his older daughter, Tess, to live with the D'Urbervilles, unaware that the current family of D'Urbervilles are imposters.At the home of these imposters, Tess is raped by the eldest D'Urberville son, Alec. She flees and gives birth to a child conceived by the rape. The infant dies and Tess buries him in secret.In an attempt to escape her past and start anew, Tess takes a milkmaid job at Talbothay's Dairy where she meets and falls in love with Angel Clare. Angel is a beautiful man who loves Tess deeply, but when he proposes to her, she is torn between lying to him by omission versus telling him of her past with Alec -- a choice that would likely alienate him in the strict morals of Victorian Britain.After they are married, Tess breaks down and tells Angel of her shameful past. Angel can't cope with it and leaves Tess penniless to travel to Brazil. When both Angel and Alec return to her, she is faced with the choice between them and the disastrous consequences of her decisions.Overall, I was disappointed by the lack of theme. The story is just unrelenting bleak, which wouldn't have bothered me except there didn't really seem to be a point to it. A lot of the text is spent repeating things that really didn't need to be repeated, especially in the entire section devoted to the lead-up to Tess agreeing to marry Angel. We knew it was going to happen, so I quickly lost interest in all tension-building that didn't really build any tension.I guess it might have been about the tragic fate of principled people. Tess is a moral woman, she desires only to be happy -- and both lead her to nothing but tragedy. I realize this was a bit cutting edge in the late 19th century when people wanted their stories to have happy endings no matter what happened in the middle. But explorations on the unfairness of life are only realistic if they rest on the capriciousness of fate. Murphy's Law just doesn't kick the hell out of people like it does to Tess.There is the class confusion element; the \\"what constitutes a true gentleman?\\"; the critique of basing the aristocratic label on either blood or money. But, really, I'm getting burned out on the theme that poor people are just inherently better than everyone else. It's not realistic so it doesn't do much for the development of a class conscience.There isn't even any feminist theme. Men dominate Tess her entire life, but this isn't the factor that leads to any of Tess' problems. Her problems are shown to be entirely the work of cruel fate (who apparently has it in for her to an extreme degree).Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy the book. This is just what really prevented me from really loving it. I did enjoy the story and the writing itself. I just think there are better classics out there."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I did not lose any weight, however.

It follows the story of a young girl who, in an attempt to help her struggling family, makes a series of mistakes that result in a loveless affair, an unfortunate pregnancy, the loss of a child, an estranged marriage, and ultimately murder. I was so caught up in the injustice of it all, that I scribbled responses to Hardy in the margin. In addition, the beautiful descriptions of 19th century farmlife in Britain are amazing. At times, this book seems hefty and longwinded, yet it is one of those rare gems that you suffer through only to find at the end that you are surprisingly satisfied."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"** Major plot points revealed ahead **Having thoroughly enjoyed _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ and _Jude the Obscure_, both of which featured strong central characters and real pathos, I was somewhat disappointed with _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_. The novel starts promisingly enough: early on, Tess Durbeyfield's family learns that it is descended from the noble and ancient D'Urberville clan. Tess's father is so elated at this news that he drinks himself into a stupor, requiring Tess to perform his delivery route early the next morning. Unused to the work, she gets into an accident, killing the family's only horse, and is sent to a nearby D'Urberville homestead--which the family thinks belongs to a rich relation--to beg a replacement.Alec D'Urberville, the owner of the mansion, is a wealthy bourgeois who purchased the D'Urberville surname. He hires \\"cousin\\" Tess as a farmhand and attempts to seduce her. Eventually, she gives in (some reviewers wrote that she was raped; Hardy never spells out the nature of their sexual relationship, but various clues led me to believe it was consensual). Tess becomes disgusted with this way of life and returns to her parents, soon realizing that she's pregnant. The child dies soon after birth, however, and Tess leaves home once again to find employment.She meets and marries Angel Clare, with whom she believes she is mutually madly in love, but to whom she cannot bring herself to reveal her past relationship. Finally she does so, at the worst possible time--their wedding night--and Angel, being one hell of a hypocrite (he had just \\"confessed\\" to her that he once spent two days with a hooker) rejects her. Brokenhearted, Tess goes back to work, falling deeper into poverty while mourning the loss of her husband's love. By sheer coincidence, she runs into Alec D'Urberville again, who expresses real remorse when he learns that she had had a child by him and had been disgraced, and offers to marry her and legitimize their relationship. Although Tess dislikes Alec and holds out as long as she can, hoping for Angel to return to her, she finally accepts Alec's offers of assistance and security and elopes with him--right before Angel arrives to reconcile with her. Upon seeing her husband for the first time in years, Tess spurns him, then runs upstairs and stabs Alec to death. At the end of the novel she reconciles with Angel, then is executed for Alec's murder.If the latter half of the plot sounds a little silly, it is. Tess is not a wrongdoer or a \\"bad woman,\\" but she is utterly spineless, submissive, and slavishly devoted to her husband--himself a weak hypocrite who abandons his now \\"impure\\" wife. If you're looking for a Victorian novel with a protofeminist heroine who defies public opinion and really belives women's role in society ought to be improved (as in the works of Burney, Wharton, or even James), you won't find it here. The real tragedy of _Tess_ is that she victimizes and punishes herself as much as the society that condemns her. Oddly, the most sympathetic character in the novel is the villain, Alec, who, having destroyed Tess's virtue, feels genuine remorse and tries, in good faith, to make it up to her. Tess is a creature of such gutlessness--time and time again, she finds herself unable to assertively communicate with those around her even when it's imperative that she do so--that it's impossible to imagine her stabbing this fellow; one of the major faults of this work is the implausibility of the characters' development.As always, Hardy pens lovely descriptions of his famed Wessex as well as of 19th century farm living; as a travelogue, this novel can't be beat. But the story lacks any real conflict: Tess is so despairing and accepting of her fate that we can't hope she'll ever move forward, and she doesn't. The inevitability of _Tess's_ conclusion is its tragedy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess is typical of Hardy heroines, pathetic/victim.

It is captivating, spellbinding, and heartwrenching. Rarely do I cry while reading a novel, but I was weeping throughout this book. The incredible journey Tess goes on is unmatched by any other piece of literature to date."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I've not reviewed any books online, but after reading Mulcaheys review, and his note that the book was only rated three stars (average review) I am hoping my addition will push the book its proper place.Hardy is the master of off-timing between his characters, and the tone of the book (as one review notes - sad) should not weigh in when considering the place this book should hold in the history of English literature.It is certainly regrettable that he gave up novels for poetry after his early feminist views received a moderate amount of criticism. I wish he had a written a dozen more novels, even if only half as compelling as this title."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"This is truly one of Hardy's best books! The story is of a young girl (Tess) who's father finds out that he comes from the old great family of the D'Urbervilles. So the family sends Tess to one of their relations to ask for money but also Tess' mother knows that at the house where she is going to be staying there is a man named Alec and she hopes that Tess and he will marry. Alec is tempted by Tess and seduces her after she has been working at his house for a while. Tess has the baby which soon dies. Tess goes to a dairy farm where she meets Angel, a higher class well edgucated young man. These two fall in love and marry. On their wedding night he confesses to her a bad part of his past and she tells him about her child. Angel can not forgive her and leaves. I will stop here beacause I do not want to ruin the book for you, but I will say this it has a whollop of a finish and you will be surprised!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I purchased this book after seeing the A&amp;E move. I love this story passionatly. It is so easy to identify with Tess, hate Alec and be ashamed of Angel. I only hate that Tess has to pay for her wrong doing as it is so hard to sympathize with Alec or to find anything redeaming in him. I love some of the passages in the book that show Tess's ideals, compassion, and proud nature, like when she takes sympathy on the injured quails by puting them out of their misery. It is odd but it shows part of Tess's selfless nature and endears her to the reader. The story also has much to say about hypocrisy with out being preachy. It is one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I love Thomas Hardy's characters because he allows them to be fallible, allows them to be unduly influenced by the rigid thinking of the time in which they live. They make bad decisions, and suffer for them, and we suffer along with them. How refreshing!This book is incredibly rich, and there would be much to discuss in a class or book group. I actually think one of the most interesting characters is Alec d'Urbervilles. He is utterly contemptible, of course, but he goes through such changes in the book that he's fascinating to watch. A great bad guy.Not surprisingly, Tess's and Angel's theme, the Double Standard one, shows up all over the place. I caught 3/4 of Sweet Charity on TV last night, remember that one with Shirley McClaine? Great dance numbers. She confesses her past in a fit of passion, and guess what happens? A scene certainly as heart-wrenching as the one in the crumbling d'Urbervilles mansion.If you love classics, what are you waiting for? It's worth it, as are Hardy's other novels. If you are new to this sort of thing, reading it for a course or a class, you have a treat in store. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel makes a heroine out of a simple girl. Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of a nearly extinct noble line, leads a life of heavy responsibility where her impoverished family is concerned. At the behest of her parents, she seeks assistance from the D'Urbervilles who are, supposedly, relatives. This assistance yields disastrous results and Tess feels compelled to find work as a milkmaid where she meets Angel Clare, the son of an evangelical pastor, who is gathering experience in order to become a farmer.Hardy does a splendid job of illustrating Tess's strength as she goes from innocent girl to pure woman. Though she is not as educated as Angel, in terms of theory, her experience with Alec Stokes D'Urberville has given her a deeper knowledge of life and acceptance. Ironically, it is this experience which captivates and, predictably enough, repulses Angel.Hardy's narrative is a powerful one in this particular tale. It is clear that this is Tess's story and we, as readers, witness her painful journey. Through his subtle and understated use of irony, we come to realize the hypocrisy of Angel and wonder about the diabolical nature of Alec.What Hardy does emphasize in this novel is the unwavering hand of Justice which allows the novel to come to a bittersweet end and lets no one escape its strong, yet objective, sense of judgement."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"A beaute of a book to read.

You have to read this book!This is the best Victorian literature can get."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"Tess, a naive and young girl whose one night relationship with her cousin Alec ruins her life, is a great example of a woman in love who would do anything for her husband and nothing for herself.

I don't think Hardy had a thing against women, it's just the way he wanted this woman to be. A fatal lover, Tess proves to be stronger than one would think she would be. The short scene before her death at stonehedge just emphasises this woman's (how do you say) weakness? I can't describe how wonderful this book is.Tess of the Durbervilles is Thomas Hardy's equivalent towards The Ambassadores by Henry James. Both are flooded with metaphores. Both take time to read to digest the words.It's just sad to see that some people don't know how to appreciate a long beloved Victorian Classic. They should read it again, and hopefully understand it the next time."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I read this book soon after I had seen the A&amp;E mini-series.

Very good book overall."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"...when you're forced to read something this boring, it doesn't tend to sit well. The simple plot followed by confusing images, muffled transition, and the fact my Senior English teacher thought this was a very good book, well... I wasn't too happy with it. What did appeal to me was the imagery and the character of Tess, who was presented very nicely.

It was such a depressing story and reflects all of the worst things about the way women were treated in that time. I don't think this story had any redeeming qualities and very few likeable characters (even Tess was quite irritating at times with her pride getting in the way of asking for help to make her life a little easier)."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I picked up the audiobook (unabridged of course) at the library and gave it a listen. I couldn't put it down! (In a manner of speaking.) His characters are three dimensional and flawed in a way that makes you believe in them all the more for it. His descriptions of social mores and customs, as well as class structure, and pastoral England are well worth the read. There are some classical writers whose work I slog through, and some whose work I parcel out slowly so my enjoyment lasts longer. Hardy would be in the latter of the two groups. If you enjoy Thomas Hardy, I would recommend Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"For those beginning to read the classics this one is a great hook. While the characters are complex the story is linear and the allusions are simple enough to follow. One can't help but hope Tess's life will somehow turn out right although knowing it will not. The burdens she encounters seem to do little to stop her from moving forward. Life seems so unfair to her, but Hardy handles her masterfully; indeed it is safe to say Hardy loves her more than God does."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"If you're interested in a travelog, this is fine. But if you are looking for the essence of the aboriginal people, it falls far short. I learned a bit, but it was definitely not what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"In \\"The Songlines,\\" Bruce Chatwin shares his journey through the \\"arid scrub\\" of Outback Australia with Arkady Volchock, an Australian citizen originally from Ukraine. Chatwin's wit and intellect shine through. He spills secrets of late nights in bars, exotic women, and corrupt police officers.The novel combines fiction and autobiography to form a dramatic account of his adventures. The first half is prose but the second half includes quotes, notes and observations about nomadic people and the importance of travel. It would have been less choppy and easier to follow if he included these fragmented notes throughout his story when they related best instead of all of them at the end.It is important to note that during the time this book was written and published, Chatwin was dying of HIV/AIDS.These stories have extreme sentimental value, as Chatwin describes, \\"To lose a passport was the least of one's worries: to lose a notebook was a catastrophe.\\" He wanted to share his stories before he died.If you are looking for an informational book about Songlines and Aborigine beliefs, there are better options. Chatwin uses Australia as a setting to describe man's desire to preserve his history and defend his tribe instead of fighting for power.\\"The Songlines\\" is written in a simple and streamlined style, which makes it easy to read. Sentences are poetic yet to the point: the perfect balance.The plot was anti-climatic. As the book progresses, Chatwin deeply develops the characters and the reader shares their emotions. However, there is no real climax despite all of the build up.The reader should search beyond the book's literal meaning in order to learn about human nature and even his or herself."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"I'm an italian reader and i'd like to suggest this book to all the people that love to travel.

Never think you are better than a person is different of you."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"In &quot;The Songlines&quot;,Bruce Chatwin portrays his personal odyssey to answer the question, &quot;Who am I?&quot; and &quot;Why am I here?&quot; His narrative is funny,yet heart-warming, and touches one at a deep, emotional level. In his quotes - which appear very suddenly and seem out of place, to begin with - it slowly becomes very apparent that he is really seeking the elusive Golden Fleece. He follows the aborigines and their Songlines in the hope that they can show him the real reason why he exists. The quotes are very revealing as to the way his thoughts go. They tell us that he is a very sensitive and vulnerable man who is unsure of where life leads him. The book should be read slowly and carefully and seen as the author's search for answers about who he is. The book should NOT be read as a travel-book; that would demote the value of this story."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"It does not take an anthropology degree to gain great perspective from the refreshing glimpse Bruce Chatwin has given us into aboriginal Australia. His adventures and insights have deep meaning to those of us who profoundly love these people and the land of the Australian continent. It does not gloss over the problems and difficulties of the modern day, but charges head on into analysis of them, and I love and cherish this book. Bruce's writing style may seem unfocused only if you actually miss the messages--otherwise, an outstanding read and I am sad we have lost his voice to forever."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"He had this uncanny, indescribable ability to write in such a way that his words and starnge landscapes instantly embed themselves in your consciousness. The experience of reading him becomes, then, a sort of self-fulfilling deja vu... This is by far his best book. I guess Chatwin is an acquired taste, if only for the breadth of his thought, and I can imagine the less imaginative reader having a hard time of it. But I personally love the open space in his writing, the room he gives ideas to breathe, the notion or sentence or hypothesis like a solitary tree standing at the far end of an uninhabited plain... The investigation (from the last &quot;From the Notebooks&quot; section) into what might have been the primal trauma visited upon the prehistoric horde, with its unusual mixture of Freud, paleontology and climactic theory, was especially thought-provoking. His voice is missed..."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"The Songlines really captured my attention. Human ecology, cultural anthropology, human evolution, cultural imperialism, Songlines, Native Australians (\\"aborigines\\"), travels... this is a book with information about a people and a place. I enjoyed the flow and pace of the story, and I hope I learned the reality of Native Australian culture.However, Bruce Chatwin chose to use this book to publish assorted observations, quotes, and reflections from other travels. For me (me), they affected the flow of his storytelling, my ability to focus on the theme - Australia, not nomads - and the ending. Perhaps this is a style thing, and I don't know if Chatwin applies this style in his other books.Didn't work for me. I wanted a conclusion to his original story."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"In Alice Springs the narrator called Bruce meets Arkady Volchok, an Australian citizen who is mapping the sacred sites of the Aboriginals. Arkady is fascinated by them, by their grit and tenacity and their ways of dealing with white people. Arkady speaks a couple of their languages and he is often astounded by their intellectual vigour, their memory and their capacity to survive.It was during his time as a schoolteacher in Walbiri that Arkadi learned of the labyrinth of invisible pathways which meander all over Australia and are known to Europeans as Songlines - a way for Aboriginals to sing out the name of everything that crosses their path during their wanderings: birds, animals, plants, rocks, waterholes and so sing the world in existence.When a route is suggested for a new Alice to Darwin railway line, Arkady's job is to identify the traditional landowners, to drive them over their old hunting grounds and to get them to reveal which rock or soak or ghost-gum is the work of a Dreamtime hero. Bruce is happy to join Arkady and to spend some time \\"out bush\\".The reader of this novel learns a lot about Australia and the Aboriginals. The plot and the characters however are a bit thin. One finds it hard to sympathise with the Aboriginal figures appearing in the story. What they have to say and the way they express themselves amounts to practically nothing. It seems as though they need the white people to tell their stories and traditions."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"A story of a segment of humanity who have a commitment which confirms their identity as human beings in a global landscape. The aborigenes of Australia are not the poverty stricken dregs of mindless imperialism but a people who are aware of where they come from and where they are going regardles of what and who has sought to prevent them. The author has discovered this and reveals it to us in a way which will possibly, already now, be affecting the political consciousness of all original peoples. A mark in history which we will remember."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Well written, interesting subject. What more can you ask. I could hardly put it down.Anyone interested in Australin Aborigine culture should read it."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Part travelogue,part anthropology,part history,linguistics and philosophy, Chatwin tells of his time spent in Austrailia with Arkady-a Russian Austrailian-and the nomadic Aborigine tribes of Austrailia, and connects this experience to his notes on nomads for a book of a culture he couldn't find a way of expressing. He discovers their ancient 'Songlines';early trade routes connecting the far flung tribes where the vast tracts are mapped out by song; a map of Austrailia in song.Chatwin links this to earliest man and theorises that our many various languages devoloped in song and the differences in languages occuring as each song described the things the people saw;what exists in Greenland-with its countless words for 'snow' has no relevence to desert dwellers,hence the two different lingo's.In this truly thought provoking and fascinating book,Chatwin sees the decent into alcoholism and mindless violence of the Aborigines who have been forced to live in one place (civilization and progress!) as being a symptom of their having their instinctive and natural life of wandering denied them, and draws parallels with our own drug addled,violent societies in the West suggesting our being cooped up in large urban dwellings goes against our instincts and leaves our natural hunting genes with no other outlet than self destruction. (Cities-since Biblical times-have always been disasterous;Soddam and Gomorrah for eg) Chatwin argues that far from being the naturally murderous creature many anthropologists/psychologists would have one believe, our early weapons were for protection and survival from preditors. If we were 'naturally murderous' and wanting wars we would have been extinct very quickly. Mass murdering your own species isn't a good survival technique! Rather, these traits have come about via settling/organized religions and societies. The great paradox of 'civilisation'!I could go on for many pages! A book as profound as this provokes more discussion in a review than the routine A happened,then B and C and it was good/bad/indifferent.Do read this and expand your mind!"},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Part memoir, part philosophical musings, part travel writing. Chatwin gives us his impressions and interpretations of time spent along the boundary between Westen and Australian aboriginal culture. Along the way, he provides flash-backs to other travels which brought him into contact with nomadic tribes and to conversations he's had on the subject of man's nomadic nature. The Songlines got a lot of flak when it was first published because it was not 'accurate' (especially regarding songlines and Australian aboriginal religion/creation story/mythology/history) and reportedly not all true, either. But read this book as one man's impressions, recollections, and interpretations and you can thoroughly enjoy Chatwin's prose as he takes you along to places you may never see to meet people you may never meet. The introduction to this Folio Society edition suggest reading The Songlines as \\"a poem for those with itchy feet; not as a grand unifying theory\\", and this advice serves one well in reading this work.Chatwin's prose makes this an easy read. The second half of the book splits time between continuation of the lines set down in the fisrt half and an assembly of notes and quotes from his journals that he reportedly organized while holed up in a small settlement during a flood. At first, page after page of these journal notes seemed pretty self-indulgent, but it turned out for me to be a fascinating collection of thoughts and quotes loosely connected by the them of man's nomadic origins and tendancies.On the terms mentioned above, this becomes an enjoyable read, with some real gems of prose, introspection, and philosophy. Highly recommended.Os."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"This interesting and knowledgeable travel book left me wanting to know more about the subject of Aboriginal culture and customs.Bruce Chatwin describes in this book his journey into the Australian Outback, to find out more about the Songlines, which are part of the Aboriginal Dreamtime or creation stories. That this is not all as straightforward as it sounds becomes clear early on, as Bruce joins an Australian researcher of Russian descent, who is mapping the sacred sites of the Aborigines. As he travels with the Russian, Bruce talks to Aboriginal tribal elders, who tell him that every tribe has their own Songs, which they use as map to traverse the vast Australian Outback.Bruce's style of writing is entertaining. He manages to combine humorous dialogue with facts about the Outback and Aboriginal culture.Towards the end of the book he does digress a bit with quotes and short facts copied from his notebooks, about his thought on why people are nomads, but it does tie in with the subject of his book - the nomadic Aborigines.Even though The Songlines was written in 1987, it is a good read for anyone interested in Aboriginal culture and life in the Australian Outback."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"The Songlines is an amazing book: it's not just travel writing, although it's partly that. It's not just philosophy or social commentary although it's partly that. It's not just autobiography although it's partly that also.

Chatwin's basic tenet is that the human race has adopted a sedentary existence that destroys the creative process and fosters an agressiveness toward our fellow man. While his pitch is certainly difficult to accept, Chatwin writes beautifully and woven into the story are journal entries, observations and quotes Chatwin stumbled across all around the globe that stimulate an intense inner-dialogue. Ultimately, the book will appeal to people who love philosophical thought without the existentialist edge."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"I was expecting some real description of how the Aborigines communicate.

As a white Australian I don't profess to any special understanding of the Aboriginal, but I do know that it is wrong to try to measure their success or failure in terms of European cultural traditions. What matters is that Aborigines are honoured for what they are, for their own culture. I feel that I need to make the same effort with the Aboriginal culture but it is difficult since it has been dominated so much by Europeans. What exactly is the Aboriginal culture - one of the oldest isolated cultures in the world? We should not fall into the trap of assuming it to be a homogeneous culture across such a vast empty space, and one that lived in harmony with nature - always complimenting and never changing the environment. A great place to start getting some empathy with Aboriginal people is Josephine Flood's 'Archaeology of the Dreamtime'Chatwin's 'Songlines' is colourful and worth reading but to me it was also disappointing, seeming to apply a far too European explanation to what he 'observed' or, at least, interpreted. If it is your step into further exploration on the culture of the ancient race of the Australian Aborigines then read it by all means. My voyage of discovery with the Aborigines was triggered by finding a skull being excavated by wind on the dunes at the back of a lonely beach, but that's another story .....Recommendations:'Archaeology of the Dreamtime' by Josephine Floodaboriginal cave paintings"},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"It is what we, Homo sapiens, are made to do: to walk and wander, and to sing of what we see. In \\"The Songlines\\" the late Bruce Chatwin posits this and much more, reflecting on the nature of man, on instinct, natural selection, hunting, culture, and why babies cry.The book, which moved up the bestseller list when it first appeared in this country from Britain in 1987, tells at its core of the Aboriginal dreaming-tracks, the \\"labyrinths of invisible pathways which meander all over Australia.\\" It records Chatwin's encounters with the Aborigines who sing the land and its ancient history into existence as they perambulate over it.But the book is more, much more than a mere accounting of Chatwin's own protracted walkabout. It stands as a paean to our species' nomadic spirit, and draws from the author's own peregrinations to Sudan, Afghanistan, Timbuktu and Tierra del Fuego. Part travelogue, anthropological treatise, novel, history, and commonplace book, it moves from his Australian narrative to past travels to epigrams from Ghandi, Buddha and Meister Eckhart--and to the author's own search for the meaning of our migrations.Along the way we see Chatwin seek out Konrad Lorenz at his Altenberg, Austria, home and present to the renowned ethologist his own theories on human aggression and defensive response, rooted in a time, says the author, when Man was the hunted, not the hunter. To which Lorenz responds, \\"What you have just said is totally new.\\"Much of what one reads in The Songlines comes as something totally new, as a revelation. In it Chatwin synthesizes years of his own wanderings, both topographical and intellectual, into a compelling tour de force on what it means to be human. We are reminded of the myths--Cain and Abel, the prodigal son, and Odysseus--that expose the radical change in our lives when, after hundreds of thousands if not millions of years as wanderers, we just recently settled down to cultivate the earth.Reading it convinces one that our nature--like that of birds, fish, or wildebeests--lies in movement. We are walkers, with a four-beat rhythm to each step, which mothers instinctually recreate when they rock their crying babies in their arms, soothing them with the belief that they are on the move, not lying vulnerable to the creatures who stalk us."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"This is the kind of writing/reflecting many people do while travelling and is not a \\"how to\\" type of travel guide.

VERY nice writing, good thoughts, great ideas about humans."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"When Jimmy Buffett referred to this book in &quot;A Pirate Looks at 50&quot;, I immediately went and bought it. As someone who had avidly read Richard Haliburton's books and National Geographic magazines while growing up, I felt an immediate kinship with Bruce Chatwin. Only, he lived out these awakened hunger's of his soul and spirit and shared them in wonderfully crafted words that not only captured his experiences but revealed multi-strata knowledge in a way that gave wonderful depth and richness in an engaging, readable, unique style. It was a rare gift and shared by a rarer individual - someone that not only appreciated but also reveled in every aspect of life. A Renaissance man who wanted to share has given us infinite pleasure. He was the writer/traveler/person we would all like to think we could be."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Dying of AIDS and with Salman Rushdie, Bruce Chatwin made a lightning visit to Australia. The Songlines is the fascinating result of this terminal search for meaning.The good points are that Chatwin's considerable intellect and narrative capacities weave a story based on year's travel experience. The bad point is that he knew almost nothing about his subject and as such has written an Englishman's compassionate contemporary account of the colonies.I live and work on a remote aboriginal community near the areas Chatwin visited. Traditional Aborignal law is an amazingly complex oral culture so rich in history and symbolism that I have profound doubts about any whitefella ever properly understanding it, let alone a visiting foreigner desperately looking for something.This is a great book, but don't think by reading it you will get a terrifically accurate profile of what being an aborigine is, whatever that means. They are not, as Chatwin seems to deduce, another group of nomadic noble savages more fulfilled than the more sedentary post-agriculture communitites."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"This is a difficult book to describe: it masquerades as a Theroux style travelogue, but is anything but. I love Paul Theroux, but this totally transcends his travel writing. Chatwin starts out describing a trip to the Australian Outback. It starts out pretty conventional, in beautiful descriptive prose...but before too long you realize you are actually reading Chatwin's brilliant ruminations about the human race as a species, where we came from, and where we are going. The book is NOT really about the Aborigines, though they provide a number of terrific characters, and I suspect someone who really wanted to know more about the actual Songlines could be disappointed by this book. He very clearly sets up his own views against those of many important and popular thinkers. To sum it up, he makes a case that humans are not really an aggressive species at heart, and that evolution has not really programmed the human to fight for power but to defend the tribe. Not every will agree with this, but he makes a wonderful case and the book is beautiful and crystalline and should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"William James said that to &quot;learn the secrets of any science, we go to expert specialists, even though they may be eccentric persons, and not to commonplace pupils.&quot; It seems, Bruce Chatwin used the same method to shed light on what for him was the question of questions: the nature of human restlessness.The Songlines consists of the stories of the eccentric experts in the science of restlessness Chatwin met in Western Australia, and notebook entries ranging from Blaise Pascal's philosophical reflections to a meeting with Konrad Lorenz in Austria. Chatwin had originally intended to use these notebook entries for a book on nomads. He gave up the project but the entries reveal the man and his quest.In a way, The Songlines is Chatwin's own songline: a track which tells of what he found on his wanderings, and what he considered worth singing."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"This book starts out with a kind of nice, floating narrative about a meandering trip through Australia's outback. You get a candid look at Aborigines and their land rights movement in a way that's not at all preachy but rather funny. Unfortunately, just as I was starting to care about where the characters were going and what would happen to them, Chatwin treats us to page after page of &quot;pensees,&quot; his own and others', on the subjects of nomadism and other topics in cultural and physical anthropology. I was an anthropology major, so I enjoyed many of his ideas, but found some of his main premises to be preposterous... For example, pastoral peoples are notoriously anything but pastoral, being extremely xenophobic and violent as a rule. Chatwin seems to be trying to convince us that the Aboriginals are peaceful and sweet because they roam around a lot... well, maybe. But I don't know that I needed fifteen pages of one-paragraph &quot;thoughts&quot; to state the point. Honestly, I couldn't help skipping pages to get back to the narrative. I understand where Chatwin was coming from with his &quot;pensees&quot; format, but Pascal he is not. Still, if you want a little food for thought, you might enjoy it. If you're looking for a narrative, forget it. Unlike the aborigines, whose travels have purpose and wonderful stories, Chatwin's narrative just kind of ambles around in the dust."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"To really understand this book, of course, you have to understand that Chatwin knew he was dying of AIDS when he wrote it. Hence, (I think) the notes (which have raised so many pros and cons and head-scratchings among reviewers) tacked on at the end. He, sadly, was sinking fast and needed something to round out the book. The book, then, is not so much about the aborigines (which, as one reviewer has noted, it would be better to check out an Anthropolgy text on) as it is about the ailing Chatwin.-But who was Chatwin? I think he was primarily a) an erudite hyper-aesthete (He started out working for museums); and b) an unflagging disciple of Heraclitus, the pre-Socratic philosopher whose most famous dictum was &quot;Everything is fire.&quot; In other words, everything is in constant change. Everything is on the move. Everything is being consumed and reborn. Whether it looks that way or not. As the poet Delmore Schwartz put it, &quot;Time is the school in which we learn, that Time is the fire in which we burn.&quot;-This is why,I think the aborigines grabbed hold of his imagination at the end of his life, &quot;Aboriginals,in general, had the idea that all &quot;goods&quot; were potentialy malign and would work against their possessors unless they were forever in motion.&quot; And, like Heraclitus, he inveighs against the members of his own race, &quot;The whites were forever changing the world to fit their doubtful vision of the future.&quot;-But what was Chatwin's vision of the future? What did he expect to find out there in his dying days?-I think he gives the answer on page 293, the penultimate page of the book, where he writes, &quot;...the mystics believe the ideal man shall walk himself to a 'right death.' He who has arrived 'goes back.' In Aboriginal Australia, there are specific rules for 'going back' or, rather, for singing your way to where you belong: to your 'conception site', to the place where your tjuringa is stored. Only then can you become-or re-become-the Ancestor. The concept is quite similar to Heraclitus's mysterious dictum,'Mortals and immortals, alive in their death, dead in each other's life.&quot;---I'm not at all sure exactly what this passage means. But the basic idea, I think, is that you keep moving down your songline or metaphysical groove or whatever until you die where you belong and thus rebegin a ghostly cycle of reincarnation. Chatwin's tone in quoting the Aboriginal beliefs and Heraclitus give us no clue as to how much of this he actually believed...But we do know from his life that he was always walking, always searching up to the very end.-Reading the book with this knowledge lends to it (despite the jumble it is that caused my four star review) an almost heroic quality.-So read it and be inspired!"},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Bruce, an English guy, heads into the Australian outback to check out aborigines, as part of his life-long interest in nomadic cultures. Part of the book is travel writing - the wacko Australian situations and characters he meets are fully described - part the history/psychology/philosophy of nomadic living and human aggression, and part a poetic description of Aboriginal culture.The link between a human sedentary existance and human aggression has long been described; Bruce presents sedentary living as an unnatural state, and the nomadic lifestyle as cleaner, more beautiful and better. It's very convincing while you're reading it, and certainly deeply interesting. It's certainly a refreshing counterpoint to thinking about all those land-related wars and situations (Israel, for example), to all the nastiness of European colonization in America, Africa, and Australia, and it has a certain intuitive appeal - land belongs to everyone!I'm not certain how accurate Bruce's description of Aboriginal culture is, but I don't think it really matters. This is not a carefully constructed sociological or anthropological analysis, but rather a lyrical, and fairly romantic, description of nomadic life and a way of thinking. Most importantly, I think, the message is: the ways the Aboriginies think and relate to the land are powerful and beautiful and so different to what we're used to that it's very difficult for Westerners to appreciate them immediately.I strongly recommend this book, because it outlines a way of thinking about the human condition that is nice, and that lingers in your mind for a long time."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Nominally a book recounting the time Chatwin spent with the Australian Aboriginal tribes of Alice Springs, The Songlines in reality weaves together travel writing, history, and literary quotations to become a larger project about nomadism and evolution. It is as though what he found in Australia startled him into crystalizing a lifetime worth of disparate thoughts. More than classic travel writing or essay form, The Songlines captures the struggle to put this overarching thesis into words.The struggle of the Aborigines to preserve their traditional form of worship against disinterest, hostility and monied patronization is one of the central contemporary aspects of the book. Additionally, Chatwin draws from sources as disparate as Konrad Lorenz, religious myth, and Herman Melville to construct his arguments.I found Songlines largely successful. As someone who once walked from Holland to Spain I have a soft spot for discourse about the philosophy of walking. I also greatly admire Chatwin as a writer, so did not have any expectations that this would be a \\"normal\\" travel book. I strongly suspect that the method he uses (journal fragments and quotations interspersed throughout) may not work for many readers and it ultimately might have been stronger had he found a more integrated narrative form.In short, this should be a very strong read if you are interested in the ideas at the center of the work. If you have read this far in the review it probably goes without saying that this is not the book for a typical travel essay about life in the Australian bush. Look elsewhere if that is what you are trying to find. I find it an excellent addition to the Chatwin body of work-- a body of work that is far too small as a result of his untimely death in 1989."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"When I first migrated to Australia in 1983, I immediately started asking questions about the country's indigenous aborigines. For me, it was simple curiosity. New Zealand, where I'd come from, had imperfect race relations, but Maori dances, hakas, and creation stories were taught from primary level at every school. Like many &quot;Pakeha&quot; (white) New Zealanders, I had a part-Maori partner - whom I later married. In Perth, however, no-one I spoke to, including white journalists with whom I worked, could tell me what the &quot;Dreamtime&quot; spoken about in aboriginal culture meant. Their demeanour suggested the very questions displayed a lack of taste.Strange then, that it should have been a Briton who gave me my first insights - to have the boldness both to outline and celebrate the unique richness of Aboriginal cosmology, and to put it in the context of the great nomadic traditions of human life. This is beautifully written, wry and teasing; it respects aboriginality, but shows a lightness of touch rare in this particularly fraught field.Arguments have been made against this book on anthropological grounds, and on the grounds that no non-aboriginal person should presume to write about such matters. There may be merit in these points of view; I am simply grateful that Chatwin turned his brilliance to this subject. I find this book as illuminating and as life-affirming now, as when I first read it many years ago.Other books I can recommend, although more prosaic in style, are Geoffrey Blainey's &quot;The Triumph of the Nomads&quot;, Henry Reynolds' &quot;Frontier&quot; and &quot;Why Weren't We Told&quot; and the official reports into the so-called &quot;Stolen Generation&quot; and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.There is still a way to go."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"'One man's impassioned song' is how the Sunday Telegraph describes this rare jewel of a book and a more apt description of it couldn't be found. It is truly one man's, one great artist's swansong to eternity and like all great works it has something to say to all of us.Billed as a 'travel book,' Bruce Chatwin's 'Songlines' is that in name only. Following in the steps of other literateurs who were also originally pigeonholed as mere travel writers ie. Conrad, Greene, etc...Chatwin magically transforms a place, the Australian outback, and a people, the 'aboriginals,' into the characters of a majestic cosmic play. In truth, Songlines is really an accessible and persuasive treatise on the nature of man, hiding under the guise of a travel book.Chatwin's thesis is simple: that human beings are migratory--'nomadic' is his catchy phrase--in their most natural (read here, best) state. To support this thesis, Chatwin follows the ancestral songlines of the Australian aboriginals who believe the world and all its creations were sung into existence by their semi-divine 'ancestors.' To reaffirm their identity, their place in this world and the 'world' itself, today's Aboriginals retrace the routes their ancestors walked across the continent, re-singing everything back into life. In mapping out this moving creation myth, Chatwin enlists the help of aboriginal 'expert,' Arkady, erudite son of Ukrainian exiles. With vibrant color, humor and sun-drenched clarity, Chatwin recounts their memorable encounters with the sometimes freakish, always original, denizens of the Australian outback.To support his claim of man as migratory animal, Chatwin interrupts these gem-like anecdotes with a vast array of historical and anthropological aphorisms, facts and commentary. While their placement sometimes appears rather arbitrary, these tidbits spice up the whole and provide a pleasant balance to the stories that surround them.Songlines is hard to put down as the effortless, pristine style carries the reader along on a voyage all its own. Nicholas Shakespeare wasn't far off the mark in crowning Chatwin as the 'greatest stylist writing in England today.' Even if you don't buy the idea the book is selling, the writing itself is enough to recommend it. Especially for writer wannabes. Every sentence is a cut and polished gem. Terse, tight and clean, all the fat has been cut off, leaving the choicest morsels. And what morsels! Not only does Chatwin say it exquisitely, he also has something to say. That's not just fine writing, that's art.And if the writing isn't enough, the seeds of thought that Songlines plants are tough stuff and unlikely to blow away all that easily. Chatwin makes a strong case that when humans decided to 'settle' down---to civilize themselves---they actually caused more evil than good. Settling down meant holding onto things and marking out borders of possession. And because our natural restlessness became inihibited, we learned to covet more things and wider boundaries. Not only that, but by settling down we lost something profoundly important to our physical and spiritual makeup: our connection with the earth itself and with its other inhabitants, who, unlike us, seem content to take only what they need and then move on.Songlines' greatest message is that life itself is a journey. Therefore, we should live it as one, constantly moving, constantly growing to the next level of existence, learning to let go of that which was never 'ours' to possess.Those who are looking for such a journey into the human condition won't regret picking up Songlines!"},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Chatwin's Songlines investigates the essence of humanity's interactions and impulses in a accessible, storytelling prose. Chatwin has no difficulty in using the roots of the Aborigine culture as a stage to incorporate his far reaching notes and theories on the human species' instinctual needs. The concept that humans act with primordal instincts establishes the foundation for Chatwin's thesis that the interactions and social structures of nomadic or less civilized societies can indicate the needs people have for movement, defensive social agreements (companionship)for survival, and self recognition through knowledge of one's surroundings.Chatwin builds upon his discriptions of the Aboriginal culture with memoirs from his other interactions with different cultures to develop a universal message about the human condition. He further punctuates his message with anecdotes and notes that can be a slight nuisance to read while attempting to finish the story, but add fascinating background information and perspective from many of Chatwin's most influential sources.The Songlines is aproximately 300 pages, but is such a stimulating read it can be finished in only two or three sittings and easily within a week."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"The Songlines is unfortunately two books in one and they do not really gel. Each separately would of received more stars. It starts quite well as a narrative of his time in Alice Springs and the aboriginal culture he explored. This is very readable and quite educational (and would of scored 4 -5 stars). Unfortunely at about halfway through books he starts putting in little quotes in sequence often for 20 - 30 pages which interupts the story line of the other 'book'. He really should of pulled the quotes out and built them into a second novel. In the end though the book became a struggle to read because it no longer flowed"},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Bruce Chatwin was a travel writer of moderate talent. While most travel writers tend to try to write books which generate laughs by trading on the comic elements of travel and the ridicule of different customs Chatwin was more of a poetic writer.In this book he writes about Aboriginal Australians and suggests a theory. The theory is that the map of Australia has a number of inter connecting song lines which represent points at which Aboriginal people communicate with others and as a result &quot;songs&quot; are passed on.The reality is that no such thing exists and that Chatwin has simply made it up after a brief Australian visit. One of the problems of course is that now because the idea has appeared in a &quot;book&quot; some people now accept it.Aboriginal people in Australia have over the years suffered considerably by being pushed of their lands, being marginalised and suffering ongoing discrimination. However their culture is rich and vibrant and for someone to make up something which is not true does them no good and is another manifestation of white paternalism."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"I read this book along with several other &quot;travel books&quot; this summer and was startled by its genius.chatwin is a very captivating figure , a remarkable amateur traipsing through any number of disciplines en route, he hoped, to mankind's nomadic quintessence. Unlike other aspirant travel writers his books are clorful and detailed. He may have been wrong but he was brilliantly wrong."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"I wish I had read this book prior to our traveling to Australia.It would have added more value to our already wonderful trip."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"I read it because some people recommended it to me as \\"the father of travel writing\\".

He said the book was fiction but the publishers said it was non-fiction. Naturally enough the publishers won the battle. Hence, my local library has the book in the Australian travel section. Amazon does too. Chatwin is now emerging from culthood. This is a good thing because it means readers can read his work without all of the emotional baggage that was attached to Bruce Chatwin's life and lifestyle. The Songlines will endure."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Bruce Chatwin takes the reader on a delightful journey across cultures and through time and space as he looks at issues of creation, history, tradition, and the sacred. His \\"real time\\" journeys are delightfully laced with story telling, philosophical pondering and reflection, and humor. His reverence for life and indigineous people is clear. Songlines are sacred for the aborigines - and the book itself draws the reader into an experience of the sacred."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"I bought this book because I had heard that Chatwin's writing was lyrical. The first part of the book left me cold; oddly passionless, it was a fairly dull description of traveling under somewhat unpleasant conditions. The excerpts from his notebooks, however, were engaging and thought-provoking. I found myself much more involved in the latter portion of the book.It occurs to me that Chatwin had written his notebook entries long before his trip to Australia. Possibly the lackluster quality of the first half was due to his illness; the &quot;flashback&quot; portion of the book was much more dynamic and showed great vitality. Because of the notes, I'll work backward and try some of Chatwin's earlier works. I doubt, however, that I'll re-read the Australian portion of Songlines."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"The first half of Songlines is an emotionally engaging narrative of Chatwin's adventure. His characterizations of other people are brilliant, the writing delightful, visual, laconic, and powerful. Then something happens; he surrenders the narrative; the book becomes a a collection of not uninteresting impressions, notes, ideas. But these were a let down for me after the start, the story that was touching me, giving such pleasure; it was rather as if he became scared of what a great book he was onto"},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"The Song lines starts out as quite a nice book, you get involved in the characters and the place but then all of a sudden he comes in with pages and pages of endless quotes, almost as if to show off his knowledge of the world. I found this book boring and too segmented, if he wanted to write an interesting narrative about central Australia he should have done so, and if he wanted to write a strictly factual book about the nomadic existance but mixing theses two up simply creates a detached and boring novel."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"When you start reading \\"Songlines\\" you don't expect it to affect your view of the world with as much force and intensity as it does b/c Chatwin is modest in word, his prose refreshingly lacking the frilly embellishments that so many authors feel compelled to use. Brimming with insights on one of the oldest indigenous cultures of the world, \\"Songlines\\" - fact or fiction - has reawakened the politics of cultural hegemony in my consciousness."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"What a marvelous book. It draws you in and lets you observe aboriginal Australia in a seemingly detached and unemotional way, yet you find yourself there with him sharing every experience. This ability to avoid cliches and to stir emotions of pity or anger or even ambivilance is remarkable and is a demonstartion of Bruce Chatwin's legendary writing skills."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Songlines is both gutsy and beautiful. The narrative is compelling and just as you get used to the easy flow of Chatwin's prose he switches gears. The collage of quotes, aphorisms, non-sequitors that make up the middle of the book seems to mimic or mirror the pointellist style of Aboriginal paintings of the Songlines and Dreamtime. Chatwin PAINTS a book much in the same way he describes Aborigines walking the Songlines of the Dreamtime, from point to point walking out the story.Amazing!If you're a writer, then you must read this book. It expands the limits of what one thinks a novel can or should be."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"I was given a hard copy of this book for a school prize at just about the time he discovered he had AIDS. If I could write like this I would be a happy woman. I think the last commentator has missed the point. Chatwin doesn't spell everything out for you - what is a well crafted book worth especially given the Internet and the transience of the printed or spoken word? No, his ideas are still evolving and revolving around my head. I'm a resource investigator and I'm hungry for quirky details and love to connect seemingly disparate ideas into graceful patterns. That's how we, as a species, have survived - making sense of the senseless. This was not a book about aborigines but about curiosity and how movement enables us to continue to see the world anew. My father had died two years before I read this book which is long enough to become a cynical old sod - I really was very closed in and this book loosened me up a bit. Since then I've read every word Chatwin has written and every word I know of that has been written about him and I really wish that I had been old enough to get to know him. Such people are so precious - not because they are rare, although they are that. They are precious because they are far more influencial in their quiet way than politicians, media moguls and stars. They don't set out to be influential they are simply natural kings. Enjoy - but most of all be and do."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"This book by Bruce Chatwin is a rare pleasure, written by a man truly interested in all the peoples of the world including their culture, language, arts and metaphysics. This time Chatwin went to Australia to attempt to understand the very complex system of Aboriginal religious structures called songlines. As far as I can see from this book songlines are the connections in song of one part of the country to another part, each practised by the people who live there with neighbours sharing the &quot;song&quot;. Not only does this define their religion but it in fact recreates their land as well, a kind of pure ideality in the philosophcal sense.The first parts of this book concentrate on Chatwin's experiences with the people of outback Australia be they Aboriginal or white. He seems to find truly remarkable people, each unique and even wild in their own way. Typical of Australia, it is full of people from all the world, such as his friend Arkady of Russian extraction. Chatwin has a fascinating background with his experiences of other cultures often allowing him access to other more conservative people who are suspicious of the outsider. Using this technique he breaks down their resistence and writes with compassion and depth of his experiences. Unfortunately two aspects come to light which I believe are not advantageous to the reading of the book. The first is his tendency to both promote and justify the practise of travelling or the nomadic lifestyle which he himself practises. The second is the habit of filling out the rest of the book with too many quotations from others rather than making use of his experiences with their beauty and uniqueness due to the meeting of people as he travels and the sense of the land which formed the backbone and pure joy of the earlier parts of the book.Nonetheless an exceptional book and a joy to read. A very human book."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Chatwin's Songlines nods not only to the origins of humans but also to the contemporary manifestations of those origins and our corresponding innate instincts: the need to wander, communicate, understand where one has come from, the contemplation of where one may be going. Chatwin's ability to explore such profound topics within the confines of a travel narrative (albeit not a traditional one) is perhaps the book's greatest feat. In a style that reflects the very way that such revelations, discoveries, demystifications, and bewilderments occur during a long journey, Songlines has become a model for the new travel narrative, much to my delight."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"I'm an Aussie living in USA and it was wonderful to re-visit home via \\"Songlines\\" and garner an understanding of the first inhabitants of Australia.

No. Songlines is the story of the Dreaming. It is a book about all the above in no particular order. The story unfolds when Bruce, the author and narrator starts his learning about Australia and the Aboriginal people through Arkady, a Russian-born Australian with a thorough but not glamorous understanding of the Aboriginals. Bruce is searching for himself the true meaning of the Songlines. This is his Work. By listening to Arkady, he learns. By going to Australia, he understands, or does he?"},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Bruce Chatwin is considered to be a travel writer. However, he, himself, called this particular book a work of fiction.This is basically a journey of discovery. He wanted to learn about the Aboriginal and their &quot;dreaming tracks&quot;. As they walk about the land they sing the names of every plant and rock and these &quot;songlines&quot; are one huge maze that define their world.He describes the people he meets and his quest to find out more and more, and the book is full of these descriptions. However, it doesn't really have a coherent feel to it, especially during the last third of the book, where he diverts completely from the present and inserts pieces from his notebooks that he had been keeping for many years.Basically, Mr. Chatwin is a philosopher who is fascinated with the nomadic existence, and the reader is subject to many anthropological theories about animal and human migration and the nature of human beings. While these concepts are interesting, it just couldn't sustain my interest, and I found much of this part boring.The book did increase my understanding of the Aboriginal world however, and added another element to my understanding of Australia. I yearn to know more. And that is good. But it was just too meandering and wordy for me."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"The first sentence sounded promising:\\"In Alice Springs - a grid of scorching streets where men in long white socks were forever getting in and out of Land Cruisers - I met a Russian who was mapping the sacred sites of the Aboriginals.\\" And indeed what follows in the next thirty or so chapters is a very readable and insightful travelogue of a British (author? archaelogist? historian?) \\"going bush\\" with Arkady Volchok, trying to learn about the mythical Aboriginal songlines. Not understandably, then, the author throws in bits and pieces of the protagonist's notebooks, which all more or less anthropological citations and thoughts from very different sources. The concept reminded me a bit of the motif in \\"The English Patient\\", where Almasy carries a copy of Herodotus' The Histories with him, adding his own notes and observations. Fortunately, in Ondaatje's novel, this remains a motif which does not disrupt the plot itself. With \\"The Songlines\\", however, I found myself flicking impatiently through the interjection-pages in order to get back to the story."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"As i never wanted to go to Australia, i have to say that after reading this book i have not changed my mind, but it is not a point. It is not a book about traveling in Australia. It is more a book about walking, for example.

And so on...this book is highly recommended for those who knows what the word \\"travel\\" means. In present time many people travel, but just a few ones deserve to be called \\"traveller\\". Bruce Chatwin is among them."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"People seem to have strong views about this book &amp; about the late Mr. Chatwin. For me, it was a huge disappointment. Perhaps it is because the friend who loaned it to me had built it up so much that it could not match the expectations he had set.But at a minimum, I expected Chatwin to share personal experiences with the native people of Australia. Throughout most of the book, however, Chatwin interacts w these people thrrough an intermediary, a Russian/Australian. Very rarely does he actually speak to an aboriginal person. There are encounters with wild characters who seem to have had normal sensibilities baked out of them by the harsh Australian sun, which are sometimes amusing. As to the songlines themselves, however, he learns of them exclusively through his Russian friend. To top it off, the last 1/2 of the book is almost exclusively a series of notebook jottings collected over the years on the general topic of the nomadic life. Most are quotes from many other people, strung together. I understand Mr. Chatwin was dying of AIDS as he wrote this book, &amp; may have wanted desperately to make some sense of his own nomadic wanderings, indeed, his own life. But please, do not buy this book thinking you will gain some insight into the aborigines. You will be deeply disappointed by the scant interaction Mr. Chatwin in fact shares with the reader."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"The late Bruce Chatwin is regarded as a travel writer, a correct but limited view of his work. This is probably his best book and is only nomimally a travel book. The Songlines describes Chatwin's efforts to understand the central feature of Aboriginal life is Australia. It combines conventional travel narrative with Chatwin's reflections on wandering, nomadism, human nature, and a selection of relevant conversations and paragraphs gleaned from years of reading and traveling. The Songlines examines the clash between hunter-gatherers and industrial civilization, the possible evolution of humans as natural wanderers, and implicitly, the roots of Chatwin's own wanderlust. Chatwin does not announce his ideas but shows them in a series of subtle vignettes; apt quotations, revealing episodes in his travels, thumbnail sketches of conceptions of human evolution. Some of his ideas seem prescient, his suggestion that gathering roots and tubers may have been more important to human evolution than hunting is now being pursued vigorously by anthropologists. Other ideas, such as the crucial role of climate change in Africa at key points of human evolution were popular ideas some years ago and are now controversial. In any case, this is an original, stimulating, and very well written book."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"I first read this book when it came out in 1987.

Now it's 13 years later, Bruce Chatwin is dead, &amp; yet I still gain new insights into &quot;the Origins of Man&quot; every time I re-read this book.Altho ostensibly about the Aboriginal culture &amp; mythos, Bruce Chatwin simply uses that as a starting point for meditations upon what forces of pre-history created the creature that became us &amp; how those forces still impact our day to day lives. This may sound dry &amp; dull, but it's not! You will find yourself reading with a Hiliter in hand, the better to mark your favorite passages. If there is anyone else in the room, you will find yourself reading sections out loud, then having intense discussions. You will definitely want to read this book more than once!If you have any interest at all in what makes us &quot;human&quot;, then please, buy &quot;The Songlines&quot;; you'll probably see the world around you with new eyes once you've read it!"},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Ordinarily, I say it is difficult to single out one book as significantly above others when I've read a steady stream of good ones, but THE SONGLINES belongs in a rarefied class. It has immediately moved into the pantheon of my all time favorites.THE SONGLINES is a trip to central Australia, to Aboriginal country. In the 1980s, Chatwin found it to be a hardscrabble territory under an unforgiving sun, where the remote, sparse population mostly gets along in corrugated metal shelters. The sociological, political and economic condition of the Aborigines compares to that of the American Indian. Most of the white European locals don't quite seem to know how or why they have been plunked down in this weird, other planet. Hooking up with a savvier group of anthropologists and social workers, Chatwin looks for the songlines of an Aboriginal mythology, sacred paths spun out across the inscrutable terrain, each marked by a song that carries identity and connection to the prime movers at the beginning of time.Along the way, Chatwin includes portraits of the people he meets, historical notes and readings of anthropology, evolutionary theory, and philosophy. In this far away land, he finds the stimulus that helps him organize a lifetime of readings and memories that come together in a meditation on the human need to travel and to make and share meaning. Looking at the contemporary scene and people, he can see back to the very emergence of humans.Chatwin casts a spell you do not want to be broken. I suggest that if you do not know much about him, resist that strong impulse to start reading biographical notes and commentary on the book until after you have finished the book. None of what's out there will deny you its excellence; it just might poke a confusing hole in the reality it has created. The book is an exhilaratingly profound experience in the accessible guise of a pleasant, insightful travelogue. Ask why its author considered it fiction after you've read it."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Late on in the Songlines, Bruce Chatwin writes: 'Before coming to Australia, I'd often talk about the Songlines and people would inevitably be reminded of something else'. This sentence seems to sum up 'The Songlines'. The book begins as a travelogue of Chatwin's travels across Australia, written in a clean, crisp, pared down style - reminiscient of Hemmingway, one of Chatwin's foremost influences. He attempts to unravel the stories behind the Aboriginal songlines but does this in a roundabout way, largely talking to non Aboriginal experts such as Arkady, the son of a Ukranian exile rather than Aboriginals themselves.Approximately halfway through the book, the Songlines turns into a repository for a vast array of extracts from Chatwin's notebooks, chronicling his lifetime of travels. An enchanting jambouree of quotes from famous thinkers anthropological and psychological theories on the innate nomadic instincts of man, witty recollections of conversations Chatwin encountered with characters on the road and even what appears to be an alternative story of the fall of man, stemming from the Biblical story of the sedentary Cain murdering Abel, his footloose brother, thus setting in place the destruvtive history of civilised man, choosing to settle in one place rather than wander according to his natural instincts.The Songlines appears to be the filtered product of Chatwin's failed attempt to write a book on nomads. As he explains in one of his notebook entries, the following Chinese ode taught him the futility of this: 'Useless to ask a wandering man advice on the construction of a house. The work will never come to completion'. The result is a work of immense scope but rather limited structure and coherence. As if Chatwin towards the end of his life, exasperated with how to present the vast quantity of material he had accumulated on travel and wandering, decided to throw it all down at once saying 'here it is, make of it what you will'.Consequently, I am not sure exactly what to make of the Songlines. For more scholarly, coherent theories on the themes Chatwin explores in this book, I suppose it would be better to read the works of some of the gurus, such as the African archeologist Bob Brain, that Chatwin probed for knowledge throughout his travelling life. But for an interesting mixture of potted theories on nomadism and a well crafted travel journal that really brings out the dry heat and bush scrub of Central Australia, the Songlines is extremely entertaining."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"The Songlines is the best book that Bruce Chatwin ever wrote. Out of all his books none came as close as this to explaining his world-view.By examining the cultural significance of songs for the Australian Aboriginals Chatwin reveals his postmodern perspective, rejecting modern mankinds materialistic enslavement to possessions and urbanity-cum-insanity. Instead he favours a freer earthbound philosophy of living, a return to nature and to natural laws, and a more spiritual search for meaning in an essentially meaningless universe.Profound, extraordinary and richly evocative of Australia, this book contains some of Chatwins finest writing. It is about the evolution and origins of mankind and it is also a book about death. The Songlines was written by a man thinking about death.If you want to understand what Bruce Chatwins on about read The Songlines."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Although I enjoyed all of Chatwin's other books, I was put off reading this one for many months by the tens of pages of quotes lifted from other writers and dumped in large blocks in the latter half of the book. However when I read the book, I found the quotes added much to the text and gave Bruce's desert wanderings more direction and purpose. I was fortunate to visit Central Australia several years ago and Chatwin's beautiful writing awakened a lot of good memories of that time. The area is enchanting and beguiling and the book reminded me of some of my reactions to the area around Alice. People have criticised his dubious anthropological theories, his blurring of fact and fiction, the portrayal of both black and white people, etc. If you are a serious scholar please go and buy a worthy text book on aboriginal culture....but if like me you just want an intelligent, stimulating, thought provoking book by a wonderful writer for whom spinning a good yarn is more important than hiring a team of pedants to check his facts.... ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"The Songlines starts off as seemingly boring...Chatwin's narrative style is monolithic and virtually empty. However, as the book progresses, we learn of the Aboriginal culture, from Chatwin's point of view anyway. For anyone who has the remotest interest in Antropology, this book could be of interest. While Chatwin's analysis of the Aboriginals isn't nescessarily strictly accurate, it is the closest many of us will get and provides a compelling read. The book is somewhat biographical; most of the events described in the novel-like narrative of the book are, at least, based on truth. This makes it more astounding, because it's just not a figment of the author's imagination."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Chatwin brings an original and innovative way of thinking to issues concerning the human spirit and man's fundamental nature. His basic thought is that we were meant to be wanderers and only when settling began did the darker side of humans emerge. His views on human nature and our spirit are profound and original. His was a life and mind curtailed too soon. I resonated with this book as one of the hardest things I've done is to simply stay in one place."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Bruce Chatwin, a self-identified western &quot;nomad&quot;, spends some time in Australia, learning about the Aboriginal &quot;songlines.&quot; Chatwin is in the personal process of proving his life's thesis which is something along the lines of &quot;Man was meant to be nomadic&quot;, or &quot;it is biologically necessary for man to move&quot;. As part of the process, he spends some real time in the outback, travelling with the most bizarre humans to places in the Aboriginal land and the Aboriginal mind. The stories are dramatic, funny, and sometimes heartwrenching since they often run across the many reasons that a once beautiful and fascinating culture has become the alcoholic and violent bane of their neighbors' existences. As he relates what he is learning about how these people pass along their lives, their histories, and their environment in the geographically and historically accurate songs, we are shown a world of much greater self-awareness than most westerners can comprehend. The last third of the book is a collection of research and materials Chatwin collected in support of this thesis. Some of this information is a powerful incentive for mankind to get on the move and recognize that our history and our biology suggest this is the only way to live."},{"Title":"Songlines","review":"Prior to publication Chatwin had huge arguments with the publishers. He said the book was fiction but the publishers said it was non-fiction. Naturally enough the publishers won the battle. Hence, my local library has the book in the Australian travel section. Amazon does too. Chatwin is now emerging from culthood. This is a good thing because it means readers can read his work without all of the emotional baggage that was attached to Bruce Chatwin's life and lifestyle. The Songlines will endure."},{"Title":"Lulu Takes a Trip (Little Lulu, Vol. 5)","review":"I love having the chance to read this material in a new package. It's clever, funny, and well cartooned. Unfortunately, in this volume, two of the stories later in the book have pages printed out of order. Otherwise, I'd give it five stars."},{"Title":"Lulu Takes a Trip (Little Lulu, Vol. 5)","review":"I recently finished plowing through the collected paperback editions of the classic 1940s/1950s \\"Little Lulu\\" comics, and wanted to put in my vote... yes! yes! yes! True, it's a little disappointing that the strips are reprinted in black-&-white and not in the original color versions, but the real genius of these works is in the draftsmanship of artists John Stanley and Irving Tripp, and once you get onto their wavelength, even these half-size B&W reprints are a pure delight. They can say so much with such economy -- a single panel of Lulu's unbridled mischief can have you laughing your head off, and here, in this multi-volume collection, you've got a real treasure trove of some of the best graphic-art humor produced in the 20th Century. Great stuff, highly recommended, and major kudos to Dark Horse for making this artwork both available and affordable."},{"Title":"Is The Truth Out There?: A Journey Through Critical Thinking that Spans Man's History, Origin and Place in the Universe","review":"The intro and first two chapters serve as a handy guide that the readers can constantly refer to, even after finishing the book. Then the book applies critical thinking to a wide variety of topics, including history, environmentalism and religion.At @ 200 pages the book is concise, written at an accessible level. Much of the book focuses on science issues, especially science vs. religion. Gets to the foundation and basics of the evolution, creation and intelligent design debates. Has concise looks at the flaws of naturalism and young-earthism.A couple useful appendices add some additional info and the notes are full of sources where people can turn for more detail on the subjects that interest them.This is one of the best of its type: Concise, accurate, readable and logical. No atheist evangelism like Shermer or Sagan. No cryptic rules and technical treatises like you find in textbooks or many supposedly-lay reader books on critical thought."},{"Title":"Is The Truth Out There?: A Journey Through Critical Thinking that Spans Man's History, Origin and Place in the Universe","review":"The author Darrick Dean used to be one of my internet buddies many years ago when we both had similar web-sites, and when I discovered he had published a book, out of respect for him, I bought it but never actually read it, that is, until recently. His background is in engineering mine is physics, so there is some meeting of minds. As I have recently been involved in the creation-evolution debate, I found it especially pertinent as he critiques some of the young earth creationist arguments, he himself holds to Intelligent Design. Critical thinking is perhaps not high on the Christian agenda, but we are supposed to love God with our minds as well as our hearts.One of the most often neglected principles is to examine both sides of the argument, to examine only one side is a fatal mistake as I have discovered to my cost (e.g. the global warming debate, is it anthropogenic or did the Sun do it)? In chap 2 he introduces us to some of the logical fallacies in an argument, my favourites are the \\"straw man\\" argument, the \\"red herring\\" argument, I have fallen for that big time, and the other is the \\"ad hominem\\" argument, which he does not mention. In any debate it is important to recognise the type of argument being used; otherwise you can end up in a \\"blind alley\\", especially in the case of a \\"red herring\\", been there done that.Other topics covered are: Aliens, Environmentalism, the Big Bang, the Great Flood, plus of course the evolution vs. creation debate. All in all a useful book to get you thinking."},{"Title":"Is The Truth Out There?: A Journey Through Critical Thinking that Spans Man's History, Origin and Place in the Universe","review":"How can you take seriously a book that cites Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves as revisionist history? The first two chapters are a sparse, 12-page description of what the author claims is critical thinking. This is followed by a tour through history, science and religion. What becomes more and more obvious as you read is the entire enterprise is a thinly disguised arguement for Creationism, the Anthropic Principle, Intelligent Design, and Christian Theology. The author concludes with the claim that Christian theism does not violate the rules of Science.I was so hoping to find a book that actually dealt with Critical Thinking. I am still hoping."},{"Title":"Is The Truth Out There?: A Journey Through Critical Thinking that Spans Man's History, Origin and Place in the Universe","review":"This book was only just recommended to me, so I haven't gotten into it very far, but I am eager to see if it lives up to its title, which is amazingly ambitious. I am hoping it will discuss these topics on a fairly rigorous level, and not turn out to be some lightweight, quasi-philosophical nonsense like a lot of what's out there. If it does, I'll revise my review here accordingly. I give it four stars here for the benefit of the doubt, and because the author's heart (or mind) is in the right place.I am dubious though, although I can recommend Michael Shermer's book on the subject. He has a Ph.D. in philosophy and is the editor of The Sceptical Enquirer magazine. I don't know if this author has similar credentials but I will find out shortly.Speaking for myself, however, the concept of \\"truth\\" hasn't fared very well in human hands except in math and logic, where proofs are of course true if they're valid. Everything else is technically suspect, even in the hard sciences, although I don't expect physical and chemical laws such as the law of gravity to be repealed anytime soon. :-) But such laws are still based on empirical evidence that can be explained by a mathematical theory rather than logical proof in the mathematical sense. We believe such theories are \\"true\\" for several reasons, but perhaps the most important is because they can make previously unknown predictions about the real world that can also be shown to be correct--and that we wouldn't have known otherwise. But again, technically theories aren't true; they're simply valid explanations of the empirical evidence that have received considerable experimental confirmation.For those of you well-read in the philosophy of science you will recognize the influence of Karl Popper's falsifiability criterion here, which is that nothing in science ever gets proved--things are only disproved by further experiment-- producing a science that gets at the \\"truth\\" by means of successively greater approximations to 'reality' (whatever that is). :-)And as for areas like typical journalism and paranormal phenomena, rigorous notions of the \\"truth\\" have already gone way downhill by the time we get to those areas. And even in analytical philosophy the theory of truth hasn't done well, and all the proposals I know of have failed--for example, the correspondance theory of truth--which failed because the theory's idea of facts being true propositional statements linked to a real world observable worked well for true statements but not for statements that were false to fact.Anyway, just a few comments on the checkered history of ideas about the truth, and which gives you some idea of how I'd like to see the subject treated. After I've read this book, as I said, I'll redo this review in the light of this new information--assuming it's worth it."},{"Title":"Why does it rain?

It delves into his defense of the post WWII navy against the politics of those who would have depleted our country of a means to secure the seas with anything less than nuclear deterance and how his continued defense of our Navy may have cost him further promotions. It touches on his struggle against alcoholism. Best of all, it shows how this hero handled the problems of his various commands in war and in peace. This was an excellent book."},{"Title":"Admiral Dan Gallery: The Life and Wit of a Navy Original","review":"This is an excellent read. It's a well written book about one of the founders of Naval Aviation. Admiral Gallery was an amazing man who stood behind his beliefs, willing to buck authority to support his men and do his job.

I can say from personal experience that this is the most factual and accurate book available on what goes on in a cavalry unit. It also hits home about how we felt while doing our assigned jobs. For those who never experienced combat, this novel will take you there as no other book has to date."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"I have read a few books about the Vietnam experience and most of them, I feel, are embellished some what. Bruce has not done this. This book is excellent reading for anyone who is curious about the real life of a Vietnam helicopter pilot, especially if they want to understand about a scout helicopter pilot. I was not involved with many scout pilots in my tour but now I understand better what kind of life was endured by most. It was a dangerous undertaking but pilots like Bruce did their job without worrying about the consequences. This book describes that very well. Anyone who reads this book will have a different outlook about scout pilots and a high regard and respect for guys like Bruce."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"Bruce Carlson has written a memorable and realistic rendition of the Air Calvary Troop experience in Vietnam. Being a former Executive Officer of an Air Calvary Troop, I can attest to the accuracy of much of what he describes. I was not a Scout pilot, but I witnessed each and every event he describes. Written as fiction, Mr. Carlson accurately describes the daily event's of an Air Calvary Troop ranging from the individual fear's and loneliness of the young crewmember to the act's of extrodinary heroism. Mr. Carlson tell's a tale only thinly veiled as fiction and most likely borne of his own experiences as an Air Calvary scout pilot in Vietnam. Though focussed on the experiences of an Air Calvary scout crew, this is a book that is relevant to all Vietnam experience. It is written in a manner that any Vietnam veteran can relate to and any family member of a Vietnam veteran can gain better understanding of the experience of the vietnam veteran. A particularly appealing aspect of this book is that (while I am somewhat biased, being a Vietnam veteran myself), I believe this is a book that is so engaging and so straight forward, that any reader will gain new insight's and appreciation for the experience's of Vietnam veteran's. I have read many books about the Vietnam experience written by Vietnam veteran's and other's, but none so poignant and family oriented as this. Mr. Carlson has done a magnificant job of translating what I believe to be his own personal experience into something I can be proud to share with a younger generation of American's. If I had a child coming of age in America today, with which I wanted to share my Vietnam experience, this is the book I would select to begin with. Hand salute to Mr. Carlson for an admirable work."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"If you ever had the slightest interest in Army Aviation in Vietnam, this is a must read. Whether you have been there or not, it's a personal account of the trials and tribulations of the helicoptor war at it's finest. With very little imagination on the readers part, it brings one to the forefront."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"I agree with all the previous reviews. This is a wonderful book from which I learned a great deal about aeroscout operations. However Mr. Carlson desperately needed the help of a professional editor before going to print. With some help he might possibly have had a national best seller or an aviation classic ranking alongside \\"The Blue Max\\" and \\"Twelve O'clock High\\"."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"Too much fluff and perspective. Very poor editing, misspelling and hence technical errors are rampant. Would be a good book if there wasn't so much fluff and author had stuck to storyline. I was there (B/7/17th)and take exception at anti-war digs embedded in story."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"I highly recommend this book. I liked it because it is honest,and does'nt try to be pretentious of what happened there. This book is long overdue to tell the truth about an unpopular war,the young men who fought it. Their ideals about it and the reality of the misgivings that came with it. For anyone who was there it will make you remember things you forgot. For those who were'nt there it will shed new light on what Vietnam was all about to the men doing their duty. Everyone can learn from this book."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"As a former crew chief with an assult helicopter company,I can relate to the experiences, both physical and mental, of the author.The book shows a lot of insight into the day to day life of a helicopter pilot in the highlands of Viet Nam. Although our personal experiences differ in perspective, he a pilot, and I a crew chief. The view is pretty much the same, fear,doubt, excitement,death and honor. These are things shared by all the flight crews, regardless of what seat you sat in as you flew your missions. It's an excellant read. I highly recommend it.

Although presented in the genre of fiction, the experiences of young Kevin closely parallel those of author Bruce Carlson as he makes the transformation from a young &quot;Newbie&quot; pilot into a highly skilled Scout. Get into the flight helmet and truly experience the joys of flight, the taste of fear, the intimacy between a pilot and his &quot;bird&quot;, the pain of conflicting views of those &quot;back home&quot;, the camaraderie of those who must put their lives into each others' hands, and the unspeakable loss of a dear friend. Red Bird Down is to the Vietnam War as All Quiet On The Western Front is to World War I."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"Red Bird Down is a living story of life in an air cavalry unit in Vietnam. Bruce Carlson brings the young men and boys who fought the helicopter war to life. The characters become flesh and bone and the reader is drawn into the daily life of the crewmembers as they come to grips with their fate. Doing their job and 'staying alive'is their goal. How they did their job will keep the reader on the edge of his seat.The main character's development into an experienced scout is intense and will bring back many memories of anyone that flew in an air cavalry unit. It will be even more intense to anyone that did not fly in the air cavalry.You will not want to put this book down. You will feel different when it is finished."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"I enjoyed this book, it brought back memories of when I was in Vietnam. I was in 7/17th Cavalry when Bruce was, only in a different troop. I was in maintenance and repaired the red birds. I have flown in LOH during this time and can relate well to the book. Bruce is very colorful and there is no bad lanquage I would let my wife and daughter read this book. Bruce is very detailed as to the actions of combat. There is some sad parts when people died. But combat involves death. The end of the books deals with some political problems faced by the troops.

I had the honor of serving with the author in C Troop 7/17th Air Cav and his book has helped me to see what we all endured. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in how the Air Cav worked in Vietnam. This book is a very effective tool to help with the healing many Vietnam Vets need. If you read no other book about the Vietnam war, read this one. Pray that our fighting men and women never have to endure an experience as this again."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"Author Bruce Carlson has written a real action packed novel about the air cavalry and aero-scouts in Vietnam. It will take you across the skies and the mountains and the rivers of Nam as you are transported back to the Vietnam helicopter wars of late 60's. It brings you all those colorful aviation characters that feel and sound like real people. In fact, the entire book's story line is based loosely on Bruce's old outfit and his own tour of duty. So it has that realistic sense of place and time that only a pilot could have written.In the story, you see this idealistic young officer who has visions of changing the world and helping the South Vietnamese people get a democratic government arrive in-country. In short order, his real education begins to reshape his outlook on the war and the country he is sent to help. In time, he becomes a hardened veteran whose goal is get everyone back safely and alive if possible.The reader will find that this story is well told and full of action.

For you that weren't there it's a chance to see what it was like in country."},{"Title":"Red Bird Down : A Novel about Air Cavalry and Aero-Scouts in Vietnam","review":"This book is an excellent and accurate portrayal of air cavalry operations in Vietnam. The men who flew the outrageously dangerous air cav aeroscout mission, men like author Bruce Carlson - Kev in the book - did things face to face with the enemy few have ever experienced and, unfortunately, few will ever really understand. The story not only describes the situations they encountered - hovering around in the trees deep in enemy controlled territory, looking for signs of the Viet Cong and NVA, intentionally drawing fire in order to initiate a contact, risking their lives to save others - but also explains the psychologocal impact the mission had upon, and the emotional toll the mission exacted of, the young men who flew the little birds in combat. Anyone who has seen or expects to see, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" should read this book. For one important fact omitted in the movie is how General Kinnard, commander of the First Cav, knew where to insert Mel Gibson's (LTC Hal Moore's) battalion. It was as a result of two weeks of recon operations flown by the 1/9th Air Cav Squadron - conducting the same kind of close-in recon described by Bruce Carlson in \\"Red Bird Down.\\" In real life it was the 1/9th Air Cav and its aeroscouts, such as Kev and his crew, who found and engaged the NVA unit near the base of Chu Pong Mountain and kicked off what became the battle of the Ia Drang Valley.

I had been an Air Calvary pilot and it brought back a lot of memories. At times it was hard for me to remember it was just a novel.

This book not only gives a great deal of information about life during the first ten years of Detroit, but also brings it alive for the reader. I thoroughly enjoyed the author's story, its presentation of Cadillac, and attention to detail. This is fun reading for anyone who wants to get a flavor for Fort Pontchartain."},{"Title":"Cadillac and the Dawn of Detroit (Michigan)","review":"Something that so many folks don't realize or maybe never thought about is the fact that Detroit, founded in 1701, was every bit a colonial village at virtually the same time as Boston, Hartford, Baltimore, or any other town in the original 13 colonies. Unfortunately, Detroit never (or VERY rarely) celebrates this part of its history, and that's a shame.This is a well written novel that has brought together, in under 300 pages, all the historical facts and details that are presently available about the founding of this once great city, and then jamming all of that historical data into story form. After reading this wonderful book, one feels that they know Cadillac as a person and not just as some fabled guy from the past who had a city and car named after him.The descriptions of the land and river before and after the fort was built are impeccable, and I can see how it all looked clearly in my mind; the original Ste. Anne's church, the Cadillac home, the storage facility...I can envision the complete lay out of this Village By the Straits all due to the words written here.And the author has a way of bringing out the personalities of those long dead pioneers.The telling of little known facts of these first 10 years really made this book stand out to me. For example, the frustrations that Cadillac went through to keep his fort alive, to prove its worth, was something I never knew about, and the man did go through quite a lot to keep this tiny village going.I recommend this for Detroit history buffs as well as social history fans. The author does an excellent job of bringing the past to life, and I commend her."},{"Title":"Cadillac and the Dawn of Detroit (Michigan)","review":"Sure, I've enjoyed very kind hospitality at the author's house, and have a personally inscribed copy of this book, but I can still maintain my professional objectivity.This is a great book about early Detroit.What with meticulous research in primary sources about Cadillac and Early Detroit, as well as &quot;improving&quot; upon the facts to better portray the drama of 1701, this book is a must have for students of early Detroit, or for those interested in French exploits in the early 18th century.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"WOMAN BATTERING (Creative Pastoral Care and Counseling) (Creative Pastoral Care & Counseling)","review":"Introduction: Woman-Battering in Christian Congregations?

Mark Barlow provides a wonderful view of Jujitsu as an art form that will take time to learn and master, gives realistic views of Jujitsu as a sport or a self defense system, and shares with the reader history, basic techniques, and what to look for in different teachers.This book will be an excellent addition to anyone who is interested in expanding their Martial Atrs literature."},{"Title":"Jujutsu: Legacy of the Samurai","review":"I liked the combination of history, philosophy and techniques.

Holds are judo, Jujutsu was a method of war to be utlized on the field of battle to cripple and kill the enemy as quickly as possible, chokes take too long, holds take too long- in feudal japan they rushed each other , you didnt go to the ground unless you were ignorant.

Who could get away with convincing you to eat a dog treat, if not your best friend? So when Steve comes to the clubhouse with a $2.50 time machine, Max isn't surprised. He doesn't take it seriously, but he's not surprised at all. After some explaining, he agrees to go with Steve to the year 1250... even if the contraption doesn't look like it's going to go anywhere. When Steve thinks Max is getting cold feet, he flips the switch before Max knows what's going on and they find themselves in the bodies of Sir Robert, a medieval knight, and his horse!Stunned that it worked, thrilled with their success, the boys learn how things work in the Middle Ages. From quack doctors with potions to romance with an Earl's daughter, they're enjoying themselves quite a bit. Now all they have to do is hope the time machine brings them back before one of them is killed!This is the kind of book that could easily translate into a series, with the boys traveling through time.

But Young-Bruehl and Bethelard use Freud's solid ground of insights into the human mind to set sail on a voyage both east and west, ancient and modern. They generously take the reader along on their journey, gratuities included in the ticket price. Cherishment is more than a pleasant read. The book is an adventure for the reader/explorer interested in the ways in which we think about love, intimacy, dependency and primary needs. Voyagers meet an assortment of other pilgrims like Michael Balint, Akhilleus and a little known Japanese psychoanalyst named Takeo Doi. We learn to consider language and the ways its usage forms our understanding of our world. We eavesdrop on some patient sessions and are allowed in to some of the authors very personal dreams. Most interesting is the dialogue between the authors who challenge and compliment each other to advance an idea about our primary need to cherish and be cherished."},{"Title":"Cherishment: A Psychology of the Heart","review":"This is one of the most elegant explorations of psychology, philosophy, classics, literature, and more that I've read in a long time. This is a beautiful contribution to scholarship, though it fits less into scholarship per se. Its argument--that \\"cherishment\\" is a fundamental need for humans--meanders through history, literature, philosophy, psychology without relying excessively on any one field's theories or frameworks. It is part self-reflection between two colleagues/friends and part academic study. The authors do not get hung up on \\"arguing\\" their point as much as offering their ideas and intellectual and spiritual journey to the reader to contemplate. Reading this volume was a refreshing and inspiring."},{"Title":"Cherishment: A Psychology of the Heart","review":"I was disappointed in this one...I found Cherishment to be a disconcerting and frustrating mix of technical jargon and rambling stream of consciousness. I'm big into self-discovery and learning about how psychothereapy works these days, and certainly understanding the role that cherishment (or lack thereof) plays in the individual and in society at large sounds valuable and interesting, but the authors make you work too hard for too little. The only interesting parts were the segments on the author's patients where they got into some real concrete discussions and examples about the effect of lack of cherishment on these individuals."},{"Title":"Eclipse of Reason","review":"Despite its compact size, Max Horkheimer's Eclipse of Reason is a potent manifesto against the instrumentalization of Reason in the Enlightenment, which led to a culture in which the most barbaric of acts - the Holocaust, with all of its mediatized manipulation under the Nazis - could take place. At points a whirlwind tour through some of the major trends in intellectual history since Plato, The Eclipse of Reason can be as dense as it is potent. It will reward only a close and careful reading.\\"Progress threatens to nullify the very goal it is supposed to realize - the idea of man\\" (v). This sentence, contained in the Preface, concisely states the main concern that animates the entire book. The Enlightenment comes in for heavy critique throughout these pages, for in separating reason from religion it \\"retained God, but not grace\\" (11) and effectively killed metaphysics. Having cut itself off from any notion of a grounding worldview, it finds its ultimate expression in the development of the American worldview, as best expressed in the only philosophical movement to have ever grown up out of America's own soil: Pragmatism, which Horkheimer writes \\"reflects a society that has no time to remember and meditate\\" (30).The lack of time and transcendence - the lack of any fundamental notion of Truth, which is fundamental to American liberalism - helps undermine any and all notions of beauty as a revealing of Truth. The reduction of everything to mere practicality robs humanity of something fundamental to it, which is contained in the work of art: seeing something beyond ourselves, outside of ourselves. Practicality reduces everything to a mere tool: and this is the essence of totalitarian violence.Digging deeper, Horkheimer reaches back to the very origin of modern thought on the individual: Socrates. This individualism grows with the Reformation, and then the Enlightenment; against this rise in individualism is itself the huge shifts in Christianity that began in earnest with the Reformation: a Christianity that, like Hamlet, has lost its Christian faith but not its Christian soul (93). The collapse of the medieval worldview and the loss of the Church as the central authority meant that the Christian conception of self - and individual made in the image of God, thus invested with infinite worth and given the opportunity of moral choice - would continue without the Christian concept of authority. This individual would, however, even lose its cosmic worth as technology progressed; the individual would eventually become nothing more than an economic unit.In the end, all of this leads to the death of philosophy, meaning that \\"irrationality still molds the fate of men\\" (106). Thus, Horkheimer's conclusion is worth quoting in full: \\"If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate - in short, emancipation of fear - then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service reason can render\\" (126)."},{"Title":"Eclipse of Reason","review":"Horkheimer's book, Eclipse of Reason deals with the concept of &quot;reason&quot; within the history of Western philosophy. Horkheimer defines true reason as rationality. He details the difference between objective and subjective reason and states that we have moved from objective to subjective. Objective reason deals with universal truths that dictate that an action is either right or wrong. Subjective reason takes into account the situation and social norms. Actions that produce the best situation for the individual are &quot;reasonable&quot; according to subjective reason. The movement from one type of reason to the other occurred when thought could no longer accommodate these objective truths or when it judged them to be delusions. Under subjective reason, concepts lose their meaning. All concepts must be strictly functional to be reasonable. Because subjective reason rules, the ideals of a society, for example democratic ideals, become dependent on the &quot;interests&quot; of the people instead of being dependent on objective truths.Horkheimer is writing in 1946 and is influenced by Nazi power in Germany. He is outlining how the Nazis were able to make their agenda appear &quot;reasonable&quot;. He is also issuing a warning against this happening again. Horkheimer believes that the ills of modern society are caused by the misuse and misunderstanding of reason. If people use true reason to critique their societies, they will be able to identify and solve their problems."},{"Title":"Eye of the Serpent (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Module UK5)","review":"I have one primary campaign i run, centered around the Passage of Slerotin in Greyhawk, and a second campaign i run in Eberron, beginning in Sarlona. I like to start the groups out in ones or twos the occasional trio as well), and give them an adventure or two under their belts before bringing them together. I like using this adventure as the first adventure for a two person group. I find it is just challenging enough to make them really start to care about their PC's and also encourages them to begin developing their PC's personalities quickly as well. I dont really think this is the best written adventure ever, but it really does serve the purpose i have assigned to it like a champ. As a rule, you can find this one for less than $5 (unless you are looking for a collector's copy), and it really makes the initial stages of your campaign a bit easier. You can easily incorporate it into any game world (for me, that is the Yeomanry and Adar). I definitely recommend it.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Eye of the Serpent (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Module UK5)","review":"Just finished playing this one... You can download the PDF for about $ from the tsr site. Don't expect to find many hardcopys lying about... Anyways, the scenario is that the PC's (lvl 1-3) are captured by Rocs and deposited in their nest high in the mountains. It's up to the brave adventurers to make their way down the mountain and investigate the strange 'eye of the serpent' that can be see from the mountain top. It's quite a good intorductory game, deliberately written for first level monks, rangers or druids, but any mix of players can easily play it. It introduces some good monsters for the PC's to get used to, but suffers a bit in that there is no option but for the players to go where the writer wants them (what's new!). Not a heap of roll-playing as most of the encounters are with animals or monsters with low intelligence. But definitely one worth giving a try for introductory groups rather than playing 'the keep on the borderlands' once more."},{"Title":"Eye of the Serpent (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Module UK5)","review":"CONTAINS SPOILERS!!I just finished playing this module as a player. If your player character is a Druid, your DM had better be prepared to hand out XP bonuses for role-playing. The reason I say this is because most of the monsters are only worth between 4-32 XP and the only monsters that ARE worth some real XP are sylvan NPCs, notably a Bloodthorn. There's no way a druid would destroy those, yet it was worth 2795 XP, almost the same XP as all the other creatures combined for the entire module. There's not much coinage in the module either, in fact coin-wise the mission is a loss compared to the PC and NPCs starting monies, although the loot may also balance that out (we haven't had it appraised yet). Also, the DM should be advised that the module just dumps you out into the forest at the end, so be sure to have the start of your next mission already planned.Bottom Line: As a druid I felt constantly forced by the module to choose between my morals and advancing the plot. The module is so close-ended that there aren't often options to get around doing things that don't make sense for your character, and in the end you get very little for it. That all added up to three stars. For other PC classes I suspect this would work much better."},{"Title":"Eye of the Serpent (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Module UK5)","review":"I love this adventure. It is the first one that I ran as a DM many, many years ago. I'll admit that it is not open ended with regards to which way the characters go down the mountain, but for 1st level guys who may not have played this before, that isn't missed.This is definitively an adventure for low level characters and/or those who are new to this type of game (WOW does not count). The choices of which paths to take are limited as well as the interaction with NPC's, but there is enough story to hold players' interests for the duration.If you are interested in old modules and have not played this one, it is worth picking up."},{"Title":"A Penny a Copy: Readings from the Catholic Worker","review":"Born in 1951, I was a child of the JFK generation. The Peace Corps, the growing Asian war, the idealism of a few good politicians, protests in the streets greatly influenced my upbringing. All of this was a jumble until I met Dorothy Day and then read A PENNY A COPY. My encounter with Miss Day was very brief, but I do remember the intensity of her eyes. And that intensity flowed into her writings from the Catholic Worker which are contained in this book. The desire to be Christian was burned into every page. Because of this book, my great heros became and still are Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day. In great part I became a Catholic Priest because of A Penny A Copy. Voluntary poverty, Community, and communicating the Good News is what I have sought now throughout my life.

The books have a number of chapters with a very brief essay on a time period, followed by many photographs with descriptive captions. These books are quite informative and have few substitutes.The Marina District edition by Dr. William Lipsky is nicely done and gives a good idea of the development of this neighborhood on the north-central coast of the City. As someone who was raised in the Marina District, I took a special interest.The area started as a sandy beach and lagoon area, little developed and used originally as a place to wash the clothes of the soldiers at the Presidio and to Gold Rush-era inhabitants. In 1864 the Harbor View resort became the most prominent development, although there were a number of industrial developments too in the 19th century. In 1915 San Francisco's Panama Pacific Exposition took up essentially the whole neighborhood after filling in much of the land. After the exposition was cleared away, the modern neighborhood sprung up. The architectural style continues, even after the devestation of the Loma Prieta Earthquake in 1989.The first section, \\"Sand Dunes and Salt Marshes,\\" discusses the pre-Exposition area (31 pages). The second section, \\"Tragedy and Triumph,\\" deals with the 1906 Earthquake and construction of the exposition (26 pages). The third, \\"The City of Two Domes,\\" covers the exposition (38 pages). The fourth, \\"A New Neighborhood,\\" takes the reader from 1920 through the present (25 pages). I spotted no errors.The book series is of relatively standardized size; so some choices should be made. The exposition story is the most spectacular and gets by far the most space. This book does a very fine job of it. The offset is that the modern neighborhood gets too short a shrift.I would have liked a few additions. First, comparative detailed maps of the roads and streets and landmarks of the pre-exposition, exposition, and modern district. Not everyone recognizes the local names. Second, there should have been a note on how Lobos Square changed to Funston Field and then to Moscone Park; this is the main park outside of the Marina Greens and the Palace of Fine Arts. Third, the current San Francisco ballot mentions the fieldhouse in this park as a monument deserving of preservation. If so, the book should say something. Having a photo and caption of the Marina Branch of the library, the former Winfield Scott Elementary School, the yacht clubs, and the lighthouse area at the yacht harbor would have added understanding of the major current landmarks.Still, for the early history and the exposition, the book is very concise and good."},{"Title":"Theory of recursive functions and effective computability (McGraw-Hill series in higher mathematics)","review":"I looked long and hard for a reference in recursion theory and this was the only one which was acceptable. Luckily it is also quite good.Most books in the subject either introduce the material in their own non-standard notation which, while suitable for a survey course in the material is of little help when attempting to actually read papers in the field. These books are also usually very basic ignoring things like the arithmetical hierarchy. Other books in this subject seem to mostly be advanced texts and don't cover, or cover very briefly, the important theorems.This book starts at turing machines and recursive functions. Going through the basic results like the halting problem and rapidly moving on to more advanced topics like creative sets, cylinders and hypersimple sets. Posts problem(with Friedberg's solution) and the fixed point theorem are covered as well. The final part of the book covers degrees of unsolvability arithmetical hierarchy and the analytic hierarchy.While the book does cover recursive fucntions and turing machines I would suggest previous experience with them before reading as the coverage is brief and doesn't give the reader a feeling of how these systems work.If you are taking a class in the subject or want to understand modern recursion theory this is a wonderful place to start."},{"Title":"Theory of recursive functions and effective computability (McGraw-Hill series in higher mathematics)","review":"The definitive book on computabilty and recursive function theory. I remember reading this book in preparation for research in complexity theory. I found it very stressful reading the book, but it was a good kind of stress. The kind that forces you to think deeply about what the author is writing about. In addition to the main text, the author provides numerous thought-provoking problems whose study could make a coure unto themselves. I read this book as a 3rd-year graduate student inmath. If you are an undergraduate and are interested in computability theory, I recommend Nigel's Cutland's book on the subject."},{"Title":"Theory of recursive functions and effective computability (McGraw-Hill series in higher mathematics)","review":"There are a lot of good introductory books on computation theory,but after reading them you may be left asking &quot;okay, what doI read next?&quot; Well _this_ is the book. If you're looking for something in between the undergraduate intro books andthe research-level articles then this is for you. It develops recursive function theory in a succinct, mathematically mature manner that is freed from the details of any particular formalism. You should have previous exposure to turing machines and undecidable problems, an appreciation of the defense and use of Church's thesis, and familiarity with basic mathematical logic. Just to be clear, this book is NOT:-a computer science, programming, or algorithms book-an introductory book-a book about automata or weak models of computation (such as regular languages or context-free grammars)-a complexity theory book (no time bounds or np-completeness etc)"},{"Title":"Theory of recursive functions and effective computability (McGraw-Hill series in higher mathematics)","review":"If there's a better book on recursive function theory, I havent seen it.

I think the success is due to its stock of valuable material rather than the quality of writing. The style is dense, descriptions are overly brief, and explanations are poorly laid out. Proofs are brief and sketchy. Overall, it is just poor writing. Take a look at Odifreddi to see recursion theory from someone with a talent for readable prose.It says no previous logic course is assumed, but you actually need set theory and basic logic from the beginning. Also, coverage of the basics is cursory, so it would help to have done something like Cutland."},{"Title":"Theory of recursive functions and effective computability (McGraw-Hill series in higher mathematics)","review":"Very difficult to read...very difficult exercises...and some have been proved wrong over the years...But, although its difficult i think is the best introduction to the subject for the time being..."},{"Title":"Reversing Fibromyalgia: How to Treat and Overcome Fibromyalgia and Other Arthritis-Related Diseases","review":"Dr Elrod, is a down to earth and gets to the root of this frustrating depressing disease.

Following his advice on &quot;Returning to Restful Sleep&quot; I saw major improvement in the first night and by the third night was really SLEEPING!

But the physician put me on many medications such as anti-inflammatories, 2 antidepressants, which knocked me out for 2 days at a time, and pain pills. The pain continued and I only felt disconnected. Getting out of bed was a major task due to pain and a drug-induced state. I recently 2 months ago saw this book and had some hope. I immediately went to GNC the next day with my husband and bought everything Dr. Elrod suggested. At first I thought, &quot;How am I going to take all of this stuff&quot;. But I divided it up in 4 doses a day and within 3 days I was sleeping all night and my pain was almost completely gone. I had the stiffness due to lack of exercise, due to extreme pain. But now I am doing stretching exercises and walking and I feel better and better each day. I have incorporated eating more nutritious meals and not only do I feel excellent, but my mind is sharper (because it is not focused on pain and exhaustion) and I have more energy and not to mention, my complexion is 100% better. I look healthy again!!! I am back to doing the things I enjoy like working out in the yard. My husband is thrilled because he gradually saw the life completely &quot;zapped&quot; out of me and has now returned. Words can not express how grateful I am for this book.

His manner of delivery is superb -- easy to understand, accurate, practical, and compassionate. There are many books about fibromyalgia on the market, but, unfortunately, most of them dwell on how rough it can be and leave you to wait for your next flare.

I think a lot of people with fibromyalgia need prolotherapy as well as following the advice on supplements, sleep, etc. outlined in this book. I recommend that people suffering from fibromyalgia also read &quot;Prolo Your Fibromyalgia Pain Away&quot; by Dr Ross Hauser.I followed a similar protocol to this a few years ago when I thought my fibromyalgia was very bad. I was a strong believer that you could overcome the condition with nutritional supplements and exercise and that the key was to take responsibility and work very hard to restore your health. I got significantly better, but still had pain and restriction. The condition worsened again, despite my efforts and determination. This time the pain and weakness were so severe and debilitating that I could not manage to exercise any more. This was bound to happen because the cause of my fibromyalgia had not been determined or treated. In my case, the cause was lax ligaments. Apparently, this is a common cause of fibromyalgia. The muscular pain and tension was the result of my muscles overworking to stabilise my weak joints. I am finally on the road to recovery after receiving prolotherapy.If ligament laxity is the unknown cause of your fibromyalgia, then the treatment protocol recommended in this book will probably work for a while, but then your problem might come back worse. My condition became so bad that I could no longer perform any activity I needed to do or enjoyed doing (like reading because of severe eye pain).If you suffer from fibromyalgia, the advice in this book is worth taking into account but please also look into prolotherapy."},{"Title":"Reversing Fibromyalgia: How to Treat and Overcome Fibromyalgia and Other Arthritis-Related Diseases","review":"There is nothing new in this book.

I started getting Fibromyalgia over 5 years ago. This insidious condition robbed me of my successful career, I lost my home, my health...was racked with pain. I also have Osteo Arthritis and Thoracic spine disease. Pain, Pain and more pain. The doctors tried every medication on me... they all made me sicker and fatter. Finally I said &#34;No More&#34;.... I am going to try the natural route. I went through my kitchen and threw everything out that had anything in it that was un-natural in it. I eat Old Fashioned oatmeal with hot water poured on it (then I drain it), with banana, blueberries, walnuts, Sunflower Seeds and pumpkin seeds (mix and match) for breakfast, I got a Nutri-bullet and I drink a full glass of veggies and fruit with some protein powder for lunch, and fish or chicken and veggies for dinner. Snacks are almonds or fruit. I also now make kefir, make nourishing soups and add miso when it cools down and eat Kim Chee (all these are natural Probiotics). I also have incorporated many of the supplements. I decided to look at my food like medicine...it does not all have to taste good. After a few weeks... I am liking a whole lot of things I never ate!!I can't tell you how much better I feel then when I was on the medications. My IBS has cleared up almost completely. I have only been on this &#34;clean&#34; diet for 2 months and I notice a huge difference! Thank you Dr. Joe. Your book is the only one that gave me hope by saying &#34;REVERSING Fibromyalgia&#34;!

But in this book, he wasn't trying to be.It's clear that he is an incredible intelligent man and he has done amazing research on this subject, but I think he's tried to pack too much information into one book. I just kept on expecting him to be funny all the time.However, if you have ever wanted to know why American's say sidewalk and zuchinni instead of pavement and courgette, then you might find this interesting."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"In a past life, I was a language teacher, so this was a fascinating study of our language: interesting, informative and funny. The opening chapter was a bit of a slow go and I am just now finishing the last chapter. This author makes all his books instructive but with so much humor, one might not recognize the learning that goes with it. If you love language, this is a book to savor at your leisure."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I teach English at the college level and have just had this book approved to teach next semester. I happened to pick it up at Borders because I liked A Walk in the Woods so much, and wow! The chonological arrangement of the chapters makes it easy to follow, and I appreciate all the research he must've done. He really chose words that the everyday citizen can relate to, but also peppered the text with words even I had to look up--so I think it will appeal to many levels. I decided to use it in my English class because my students have a hard time understanding that WE create the language and its rules, not some nerdy grammarians in a think tank somewhere. Also, it is an interesting trip through our history showing how we define ourselves through language. Looking forward to reading it over and over again to prepare for next semester."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I had read several of Bryson's magazine articles and enjoyed them. This book, while full of fascinating information and facts, was a little too much of a good thing under one cover. Fortunately, the chapters were easily devoured in one sitting and the book could be returned to after several days without losing track. An enjoyable, easy read."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Bill provides an excellent insight into the American psyche as well as indepth research and profound knowledge about almost every aspect of the American society. His book is a great source to enhance the understanding why American is the way it is and why Europeans and other 'outsiders' will have such a 'love-and-hate' relationship with the States. I recommend this book to everyone, who seeks more background information on American history, culture, economy, and arts. Besides being eloquently written, it is thoroughly amusing."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This is the first book I can recall reading where the closer I got to the end, the slower I read because the thought of it ever ending was just too painful!Bill Bryson has an incredible skill with the anecdote, and I learned more of the everyday and trivial aspects of America's history in this book than in anything else I've ever read or thumbed through.Anyone who finds entymology fascinating or has a penchant for history will count their pre-Made in America days empty and wasted and will be forced to start counting their birthdays over again from when they began at page one."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This book is packed with information presented in a most relaxed narrative style. This is a paperback Encyclopedia Americana Lite. The sheer energy and enthusiasm of the book makes up for some minor irregularities (like, the original Mercedes was Daimler's daughter - she wasn't). Mr. Bryson carefully avoids professing his own political beliefs (whatever they are). Nor does he offer theories; with a genuine sense of humor, he will rather let the reader decide what to make of the facts."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"A reader approaching Bill Bryson's \`Made in America' might well have conflicting expectations. Knowing that it's about language, the potential reader might expect the delightfully funny explication of English found in Bryson's brilliant \`Mother Tongue.' On the other hand, the fact that Bryson here treats language in America, specifically American culture, might make the reader wary after Bryson's 1989 dark hatchet job on his birth country, \`The Lost Continent.'I'm happy to say that \`Made in America' is more like \`Mother Tongue' than \`The Lost Continent.' It has the former's lighthearted, ironic treatment of language development with little of the bitterness that made \`The Lost Continent' a psychological study of the rejection of one's origins. Bryson, of course, cannot resist the temptation--in fact there's no evidence that he ever tries--to make fun of certain aspects of American culture, but it seems fair. He is most illuminating in those chapters dealing with colonial America, business, food and drink, television, and sex. I think it's because he either knows the scholarship on these subjects better or simply has immersed himself in them.It's not a book without flaws, however. Bryson has done no original research himself, and one could argue that he would be less funny had he done so. But then, he might have noticed that he claims on one page that the term \`department store' is not found in print until 1893 and that, on the very next page, he says the world's first permanent safety elevator was installed in the Haughwout Department Store in 1857. He may have read a book that says the word \`limey' for a British sailor dates to the late Victorian age, but clearly that is late by several decades. Likewise, the \`smart bomb' is a term from the Vietnam, not the (first) Iraq War, and Bryson seems unaware that the \`mother of all [blank]' phrase originates with Saddam Hussein. On the other hand, Bryson's usual declaration of his political beliefs is generously absent, other than an identification of Margaret Sanger as \`the esteemed birth-control activist.' Ugh.Overall, a must-read for Bryson fans or for anyone interested in how the English language was molded by the American experience."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"An enjoyable book about the origins of words in the United States. Bryson's style is entertaining, and this does not read like a scholarly book (which it really is!). There's so much information here, starting with the arrival of Pilgrims on the Mayflower to modern times. I really liked this book, and learned a lot, without being bored in the process. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I was disappointed with this book, not so much on its merit but because it was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a more scholarly history of how the English language developed in America. This is really more like a loose collection of historical anecdotes that explain how certain words or phrases came into American English, the kind of \\"and that's why we call it _____\\" stories. Some of these stories are interesting bits of Americana, but this book does very little to explain how or why American English differs from British, Australian, or New Zealand English. Not a bad book, just make sure it's what you are looking for."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This book is far less a book on language than it is a social history of the United States as expressed in the langauge of the American people. As such it is a fascinating look at the history of some of the more mundane or overlooked aspects of American history - the good stuff, the juicy stories, the stuff you don't learn in history class. Written in Bryson's peculiarly witty style, and from his particular perspective (that of an American who had spent just about his entire adult life living and working in Britain), this book is a uniquely entertaining read. My favorite of Bryson's books."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Bill provides an excellent insight into the American psyche as well as indepth research and profound knowledge about almost every aspect of the American society.

I blame the many lists of words that are present in the book (I occasionally skipped pages at a time) and the fact that this book caters for an American audience, not a general audience.A pity. This is Bryson's only book that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed, nay, loved!"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"It's hard to know how to take Bill. He's American yet her seems too have an odd prediliction for criticising and belittling America. He writes well, is very funny and interesting yet after reading any of his books about America you are left with a strange (sour?) taste in your mouth. I've always been suspicious of Americans who go to live somewhere else and then decide to criticise their home country. All that notwithstanding the intelligent reader will sift the dross from the gloss and find this book an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"The book is a decent read. I found myself laughing out load on multiple occasions while reading it. As is typical with Bryson books there are a multitude of obscure facts and ironic tales. Good book but I was not drawn in enough to give it a full 5 stars."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"OMG...... It's ok but I did t expect so much...... Well ....... Not sure how I feel .... I started reading & gave up....."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This popular history of the American version of the language is better written than most of his other books -- even though, as usual, he spends half his time in digressions. First, there are several chapters about the early history of North American settlement, with language covered almost as an afterthought, then several chapters on our early national history, then on the westward movement, then on the effects of immigration on the development of English, and so on. Later chapters cover the influences of politics and war, of technological change, and of advertising and the movies. All this is interesting, in a anecdotal way, but those reviewers who touted this book as \\"scholarly\\" are dead wrong. He scatters lots of words through each chapter but seldom discusses their provenance. There are a great many footnotes and a lengthy bibliography, but not one bit of originality."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I believe Bill Bryson did a magnificent job in his book Made in America with outlining some points in history that we may not have as much of the whole story as we think we do from school. While he illustrates some untold truths of people and events we have for so long put on such a high pedestal his main point is to analyze the English Language in the United States. It is interesting how he manages to tie these to points together and helps one understand how the book flows and the history. My family has always taught me to think for myself and to keep an open mind because history is written by the victor and may not always be the whole truth. I do not think most people grow up with that kind of support and idealism and I think Bill Bryson points this out to many who seem to think that what they learned in school is the God spoken truth even if all the evidence in the world and common sense point otherwise.I found that my theory of this seemed to be true on many occasions on where I had to interact and converse with my fellow classmates. Many had a hard time believing that there could be anything bad about certain historical figures that have been for so long up on a pedestal that they didn't believe that the people could have even errored. These historical figures are looked upon as Gods, not flawed humans. I noticed a conversation of two of my classmates on Thomas Edison, I believe, and they couldn't believe that all his inventions weren't his. They refused to believe that he could have even possibly have stole the ideas, and the reason for their disbelief, and I'm paraphrasing here, \\"Because I've never read anything like that in school\\" apparently they didn't realize that this class includes this book and is school, and \\"I didn't know him, so I'm just going to go off of what I've been told, and he's good in my book.\\" It seems that people can be confronted with almost unlimited evidence and still say the sky is green.However, this wasn't the first time I have experienced such things, my Grandmother makes a common example. She refuses to believe even under, again, almost unlimited evidence that Columbus was a bad guy. I have told her he was evil, and she gives me a cocky \`I'm not going to believe anything you say because I'm older and know more' smile and says \\"Why? Because he discovered a country\\" And that is word for word what she said. Then I try to explain to her why he was evil, and all I get is her shaking her head and saying \\"Well, I don't believe that. I've never even heard of anything like that.\\"Of course, after taking a year of psychology I understand why all this is. It is hard for a human being to let go of great ideology of someone after being indoctrinated for so long. I myself have done it; I love my grandfather and for the longest time thought he could do no wrong, and I wouldn't listen to my mother when she tried to warn me it wasn't true. I found out the hard and very disappointed way that he is a racist. But I was a little surprised about my classmates' reaction. You see, the law of psychology in this case is that it is nearly impossible for a human being to let go of this kind of ideology after being indoctrinated for so long, so I expected it with my grandmother, but not young people who were still learning and were still supposed to be open minded.In school we are often taught just the more wonderful things of the past and our often filled with lies to make everything seem golden as well. A good example of this was the story of one of my favorite professors, Professor Loewen. Professor Loewen was a college professor for American History at a state college. With his first lecture he would ask all the students a bunch of questions and every year he would get around the same statistics of about only an 11% minority being correct. The questions would mostly be on the false superiority of the white man and the opposite of the black man. Well, he began to wonder how they were all getting this false information. It turned out that the textbooks used very old data, and were not much younger themselves, and contained the false information. Well then, he set out to make a new high school text book that would be more accurate. He was very proud of his work and sent this text to the school board for approval. He was turned down 4 to 2. There were four white men on the board and two black men, guess who voted what. In the end he went to court because they wouldn't say why it was turned down. So when the judge finally asked the board why, the board turned to a certain page of a very old, very blurry photo and not very graphic photo of a lynching of a black man. The Boardman said he was afraid the picture would start riots in the school, and it happened so very long ago, why bring it up? The judge decided to answer the question and said \\"Well, it is a history book, and our state has had more lynchings than any in the country.\\" Professor Loewen won his case.Bill Bryson did a great job of tying language and history together, but he also tied in psychology, whether that was planned or unknowingly done I don't know. Either way, however, knowing the language at the time of the events gives us some clues into the minds of the people living in the times. He starts all the way from how a nursery rhyme will stay within a culture long after it's meaning has been forgotten all the way to the almost present day America where we are the richest country and European descent is quickly becoming a minority but far from this being a bad thing and most immigrants believe that if you live in America you should speak English (in other words, like everyone else) and become a productive citizen no matter what.Bill Bryson points out tragedies of the past and almost present, but he all presents the hope in both. Yes, there were things that we shouldn't be proud of in the past, but it doesn't mean all of the past was bad. And yes, even in recent times we've done wrong, but that doesn't mean all our people are bad or the world is coming to an end. Bill Bryson simply points out that there were good things in the past, there were bad things in the past, there were things in between, some even comical, but this doesn't change who we are. It does change our perspective on ourselves and our nation though, in a sense we are no longer glorifying ourselves and godlike, but we are flawed and real. As long as we acknowledge the past we can move forward and we can progress individually and as a nation, because now we are no longer ashamed and we no longer hide. You weep for the victims of the past and you smile unto the survivors, but the most important thing is to not forget their story."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Bryson is a great author and I am looking forward to reading more of his work!"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I guess I'm going against the grain here, 'caus I'm being critical of the style of this book.Being a fan of Bryson's travelogs, I eagerly began reading this work. OK in the initial chapters there were numerous sprinklings throughout of ...'this word derived from this Spanish term ... and was first used in 1782' and such like. Alas as the chapters wore on, (and they did) this fixation continued and increased with the result that the story was continually derailed and sidlined by constant (and wordy) passages about hundreds of American word origins - UURGH.By around page 120, I adopted the approach of simply overlooking great chunks of text where the italics warned of another impending word fixation.Between this stuff, was an intersting and obviously very well researched work about the development of the Americal nation.Couldn't the editors/publisher have taken a firmer hand here and purged this book of all this frilly and distracting 'word bog'?As I say, perhaps I'm in the minority here - but this style spoilt an otherwise good read."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Bill Bryson's zest for life is made manifest in the books he's written on pretty much whatever catches his interest. This admirable quality has resulted in quite a lot of enjoyable reading, as he's educated himself on distant places, science, etymology and such, and produced books about them.This one, sadly, is disappointing. It is a rote run-through of American history, of the \\"cherished myths debunked\\" school of history writing from the Sixties. He's read his Howard Zinn, and it shows. This dated approach is too, well, too dated to give the expected pleasure to this new Bryson fan.Politics intrudes most in the final chapters. For instance, the pages on the Cold War could have been used to introduce a lot of useful terms, such as \\"peacenik\\", \\"peace offensive\\", and \\"red diaper baby.\\" But the liberal Bryson instead renders the contest with Communism as an idiotic greedfest for big business, and dwells on military double-speak from the Vietnam war. More oddly, he defends the early 1990s wave of political correctness, and its assault on the language he professes to love. Tepid, euphemism-ridden, colorless, and self-pitying pc-speak was never an invention of humorists, as he claims at one point, though it was satirized in a couple of books he claims are the source of the outrage. Strange...Hey, some books should best be left to the pros. Simple as that."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I started this book yesterday. Today I tossed it across the room in disgust. Mr. Bryson's bias for things English and against things American once again rears it's ugly head. If he ever gets over this malady he would have something useful to say. Circumlocution, as Ambrose Bierce said, is a literary trick whereby the writer who has nothing to say breaks it gently to the reader. Mr. Bryson has added nothing of value with this book. Everything he had to say on the topic was in Mother Tongue. If you have any interest in this area stick with Mother Tongue, it's the much better choice."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Bill Bryson once again writes a book that is supposed to be funny but just isn't. In Made in America he apparently tries take selected historical events in American History and then dig for any negative information about it that he can find. The only person he had anything good to say about was Benjamin Franklin.There are a few slightly amusing facts about word origins and advertising. But for the most part it is just a bunch of negative trivia."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I am so sorry I hadn't taken the time to read the customer's reviews of Made in America and The Lost Continent, prior to buying them. Frankly, I'm not sure which of these two books is more disappointing. The only thing I was able to take away from them was the idea that Bill Bryson thinks hammering and bashing anything North American (USA only) is considered extremely good fun and humorous."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Having read Bryson's The Mother Tongue several years ago, I was delighted to find Made in America was going to explore the American variety of English with much the same humor and insight. As a teacher of both British and American literature, I've always tried to include a brief foray into the development of our language on both sides of the Atlantic. I have been able to spice up an otherwise pretty solid lecture presentation with Bryson's witty tidbits and elevate it to the level of the captivating (in my opinion, of course). Next year, I plan on assigning Made in America to my single honors American literature class; I have this suspicion that they will learn more lasting American history from this book than their regular text. When I had read a couple of chapters of the book, I bought an additional copy and sent it to my son, a history major at Notre Dame, who is currently studying in London. He called a few weeks later and was brimming with enthusiasm for the book and told me that he had not only finished it (before I had) but also that he was making all of his friends read it. His roommate read it in two days! I heartily recommend Made in America to anyone who is interested in food, travel, health, movies, history, or just about anything else. If all history and language texts were written with Bryson's flair for the interesting, our task as teachers would be significantly eased.This last section is added in August 2004: I did, indeed, use the book with my junior class in my last year of teaching in Ohio before &quot;retiring&quot; and moving to Tennessee. It was very well received by the advanced readers and less so by those for whom any book assignment is, well, an assignment. Nonetheless, I'm back teaching in TN and am considering using the book again this second semester. (D.R. Powell at Hendersonville HS-since I didn't intend to make the original review anonymous)"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I love language and all its peculiarities and variations. Scholarly works like David Crystal's Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language are great reference books. So is this, in a very different way. Not only is it a good &quot;people's history&quot; of some aspects of US history, it is one of those books you reach for when your 'favourite' language pedant starts waxing on about how terrible it is that noone speaks's proper any more, or &quot;the kids of today...&quot; As an Australian, and therefore being trilingual (British, American and Australian English) I love to be able to stop some fool in their tracks with the information that some 'vulgar Americanisms' are actually much older forms of English that were transported and survived, at the same time as English mutated in its homeland. The Grammar Pedants won't have it that English is a living language, that usage, spelling and grammar 'rules' change ... this book shows how it does and also demonstrates how some of the most common words we use to deal with life in our age were once US-invented neologisms or even slang. All this (and more) delivered in Bryson's wry and ironic (read witty) tone."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I'm not a student of the English language, though the history of words does interest me, therefore I've tried to read William Safire's books but with little success. I picked up this book only because of Bill Bryson. The book is not what you think, &quot;An Informal History,&quot; describes the book exactly. Bryson fills the book with more historical antidotes than a formal study of the English language in the United States.Bryson takes you along for a history of the United States and how our language has changed from English into its current form today. The other half of the book contains chapters dealing with specific topics such as names, the movies and cooking. Each of the subjects deals with the words and phases that entered the language at the time or involving the subject.There are some reviews that question Bryson's accuracy on some of the items, and this book is not filled with Bryson's usual humor, but the writing is enjoyable with just the right amount of wit throughout. Make sure you check out the chapter dealing with Puritan morality!"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"After reading \\"The Lost Continent,\\" Bryson's often whining and largely overrated travelogue on small-town America, I hesitated before picking this one up. However, this is a very enjoyable book. Ostensibly a study of American English, its development and impact on the English language in general, this book is more of a compendium of linguistic facts and historical trivia that cover the entire scope of U.S. history from the colonial period to the present. Bryson quite unabashedly plunders the works of historians, other scholars and writers who dealt with the same subjects, so what he offers here is hardly new. But the presentation and organization are impeccable. While informing us of the origins of many words and expressions common to American English, he also provides a wealth of particularly useful information on things like American cuisine or the origins of America's highway system and car culture (one of my only criticisms is that he failed to mention the origin of quintessential car-related Americanisms like \\"rumble seat\\" or \\"to ride shotgun\\"). Bryson's engaging writing style and dry humor keep the book moving, so it is never dull and always very amusing - it seriously lives up to that old clich&eacute; about how learning can be fun."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This book is a wonderful and very witty look at the English language and how it has evolved in America. Did you ever have an English teacher that lectured you about the use (or more likely misuse) of a certain word? Forget all of that! (Or at least loosen up about it!) This book is a testament to the fact that language is alive and a reflection of the culture that uses it.Bryson walks you through American history as he presents story after story usually leaving you laughing and often simply just amazing you with how some word came into common usage. As he tells his story of the English language in America, you will probably learn more about American history than you ever knew before--and all of it is very entertaining.Don't miss the amazing story of Squanto, the Indian who helped the Pilgrims survive at Plymouth, Massachusetts. There is more to Squanto's story than you think and it is just one of hundreds of gems that Bryson has uncovered.This is a fast reading, educational, and very fun book."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Bill Bryson's book, &quot;Made in America&quot;, is thoroughly enjoyable on many levels. First, he blithely debunks many of our folk legends - legends which we learn as schoolchildren and carry with us through life as if they were fact. Things like: the Puritans actually landing on Plymouth Rock; the ringing of the Liberty Bell on independence day; Patrick Henry's famous death-defying words about liberty or death, just to name a few. If these anecdotes are as true as he claims, then our school history textbooks seem canned and artificial by comparison.Second, by saying aloud the early American pronunciations that Bryson describes, the reader can clearly grasp how 18th century colonists sounded in speech.Third, Bryson's wry style gives the reader a good laugh on just about every page - a comparable textbook on early American language would never do that.However, it's very important to keep in mind the word 'informal' in the book title. Several geographical errors in the 'Names' chapter led me to realize the potential number of inaccuracies in such a thick book. For instance, in that chapter he mentions the towns of Ipswich and Agawam as being quite close to each other in Connecticut. In fact, the two towns are in Massachusetts, on opposite sides of the state. One quick glance in an atlas by Bryson's editor would have cleared that up.So read this enjoyable book for its humorous take on history, and not as a scholarly work."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Brilliant, funny, informative...and extremely interesting. Read it for detailed research on the history of American English or just read it for fun. You will be amazed at the background and origins of so many of the words we use on a daily basis."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I have just finished Bryson's &quot;Made In America&quot; and came away both thrlled yet annoyed. Bryson certainly writes in an enjoyable hand but I must question some of his conclusions. There are phrases and catchwords which other writers credit with different origins. So be it. Everyone is allowed one's own opinion. For instance,&quot;bought the farm&quot; I believe came from the trenches of WWI whereby soldiers were given an insurance policy by their governments and in the event of their death, their beneficiaries would have enough money to purchase said real estate. Also, the term &quot;so long&quot;, as I have researched, was a New England nautical term from the 18th or 19th century; when a sailor on land recognized a sailor friend on ship heading out to sea, the former would hold a rope between his hands over his head to plaintively ask how long the latter's voyage would be. In response, the seaman would likewise hold a rope and indicate time by the distance between his outstretched hands. The book is completely enjoyable. But,I recommend that the Gentle Reader should have a grasp of American history before being entertained. Bryson, I believe, has made some careless errors, to wit: Curtiss began his aviation experimentation in Hammondsport,NEW YORK, not Hammondsport, Connecticut. There seems to be a problem with the quality of the book, probably not attributable to Bryson but, rather, to the publisher. I must have counted at least 30 typos in the text; obviously an error by the publisher's proofreaders in not studying the galleys closely! Still, I do highly recommend reading this book for its entertainment content. But, be careful if you plan to quote from it...."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Bill Bryson's Made in America is a joy from start to finish. The only problem is that it may be slow reading as you will want to call all your friends after every page to say, &quot;Did you know ...&quot; (A brief warning: They will begin to be annoyed if you do this too often but just try and stop yourself). The book is more than an informal history of the English Language in the United States (as per the subtitle) as it covers all of American history, both political and social, in the author's delightful style. One story will lead into another and you will have forgotten where you began but the ride will always be worth it. Before your very eyes he will dispel many of the myths of America and build up America with some solid truths. An wonderfully funny and smart work."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This book was an ejoyable read. My only warning is that it is much, much less a book on the history of American English than an excuse to write up a laundry list of hilarious anecdotes relating to our cultural heritage. Very few of them have anything to do with language. The first chapter or two is a real historical exposition of sorts on American English. After that, Bryson weaves through several chapters on topics from fast food to air travel, each of whose only credential as a piece of linguistic history is randomly interspersed mention of when words relating to that particular topic were first coined. Telling us when &quot;hamburger&quot; or &quot;airplane&quot; was coined actually starts seeming tangential to the story and merely obligatory on his part. If you want to purchase an amusing and informal account of our nation's history, then you'll like this book fine. Just don't expect you'll read a real history of our language."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"More about history than bills usual banter. Not impressed at all. I did not get very far with this as was very slow going"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"As usual a wry and amusing look at his subject, America. Useful too as a layman's guide to the USA."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"But I will grant Bill Bryson has done his homework. He goes into the weeds from my perspective a number of times, but I found many parts quite interesting. Items like how word choices were made for the Declaration of Independence, how the pilgrims managed to find an English speaking Indian and many, many more insights."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I learned soooo much. I bought it because I like anything BB writes, but this and At Home blew me away. Huge amount of research and fascinating details. Who'da thunk?!"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I have Bill Bryson's entire series . He is a hoot. and wanted to share with a friend the laughs and information.Very pleased!"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Book came in as described, had a good time reading it.Also very educational for non-native english readers / speakers"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I've been reading this book, and while it is a good book of opinion on how certain neologisms and Americanisms came to be, I've found enough inaccuracy to make me question the rest. No major city named after Jefferson? A state capital (Jefferson City) doesn't count? Bryson warns readers at the beginning that this is a ramble through his topic, and so it is. Enjoyable, and often true, but I wouldn't quote it as sole-source gospel."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I have read all of Bryson's works, beginning with \\"A Walk In the Woods.\\" Somehow I had missed this one - it is highly entertaining at the same time, teaches so much history. If all teachers could teach like Bill Bryson, there would be NO dropouts!!"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Like all Bill Bryson books I have read, and that is most of them, this is delightful. American English, as many have noted, is a thing apart. Bryson, enjoying his every word and sentence as readers will, tells us how it got that way. History plays a large part, as it must. Readers will learn much, and learn it painlessly. There are hearty laughs along the way as well as amused smiles; his partial list of place names in the U.S. is good for a guffaw. Have you been to Bugscuffle, Tennessee, or Jerk Tail, Missouri? You will learn that Oatmeal, Texas is named for a Mr. Othneil. Bryson also comments on sexual bias as seen in pairs of words like master/mistress, pointing out that the masculine word denotes power, the feminine form, submission.Bibliography and index."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"As an Aussie who LOVES traveling within the USA, I marveled at the insight that Bill Bryson has about American culture that outsiders see, both the wonderful and the cringe worthy. It also gave me lots tips of places to visit on our next visit, such as Autumn (OK Fall !!!) in New Hampshire."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Most of the 3- and 2- star reviews cover what I would say, in general. This book really doesn't give that much etymological information as opposed to \\"debunking\\" what Mr. Bryson calls myths. As one other reviewer noted, he relies rather heavily on Howard Zinn; so, if you agree with Zinn's People's History, you will enjoy this book more than one that doesn't subscribe to that particular viewpoint. Even though there is much humor to be enjoyed, it is obvious that the author does not care for religion or religious people at all. This leads to many simple errors such as conflating the Puritans and the Pilgrims over and over again. Not to mention that he equates those that can't read a box of cornflakes with those that prefer the Bible to unscientific philosophical materialism. His leanings are transparent only after you get into the book. If you are expecting some type of objective look at the uniqueness of American English, I believe that you will be disappointed. To his credit, he does recognize the dangers of the PC movement. I wonder how he feels today (2009), 15 years after he wrote that, to see the harm that has come from it."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I can truly say that I read every word of this delightful, well-presented informal history, and as a former Scot, was debunked of many myths and misconceptions I'd held about America, so much so that I'm noticing a new awareness, enthusiasm for and understanding of my chosen country after 32 years here. This book is so full of interesting detail, written in a way that no one group of people is the loser (i.e., we have all contributed), that it is impossible not to read it all the way through with enjoyment and to feel regret when one reaches the last page. This is how history should be taught to our children. Captivating in its scope and interest (the humanitarian, humorous and charming underlying voice of Bill Bryson throughout is an endearing presence), this great little book contains everything to enrich our awareness, and encourage reflection while providing a handy rationale (e.g., the reason for Levitt's building of tract homes to provide affordable housing -- equipped with appliances -- during the 50's). The chapter about the Wright brothers was so compassionate in its understanding of Orville and Wilbur that I was reduced to tears."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This is by far my favorite book by Bill Bryson. I bought this for my wife who is a devotee of word derivations, but found that it sated my interest in history, and also provided a multitude of fun, and interesting, facts about popular culture.Unlike most of Bryson's works this is a serious scholarly effort, but is written in an entertaining rather than academic fashion. Also, unlike other Bryson works this is less opinionated, and uncharacteristically celebrates the many fascinating and admirable factors in the evolution of a distinct American culture.While his typical sardonic humor comes through it is more understated, and not at all unkind.A fun and educational book that you will want to leisurely enjoy a chapter at a time, and not necessarily in sequential order."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"No, it's not really about the American language, but if you're apprised of the fact going in you shouldn't feel swindled. It IS a gossipy history of highly selected and often little-known facts about politicians, inventors, robber barons and ad men, and it reads as if Bryson had spent 20 years doing the research and couldn't wait to get it all down.
