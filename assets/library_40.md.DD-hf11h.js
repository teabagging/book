Jane is treated less as a part of the family, and more of a servant in her aunt's household. Dragged into the room of her uncle's death, for fighting with her cousin John Reed, and suffers a mental breakdown. Doctors suggest that Jane be sent to the Lowood Boarding School for Girls. The school proves to be of little comfort to as she finds that the conditions there, under the brutal Mr. Brocklehurst, are barely an improvement on her living conditions at home. The school embracing the poverty as way of life and the girls barely getting by was completely under the thumb of Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane's only relief from the burden of hardships at the school is her dear friend Helen, a kind young girl, who imprints in Jane a measure of Christian patience for the pain, which she has endured in her childhood. An outbreak of typhus prompts many of the girls to leave, but Jane to remain as a teacher at the Lowood School. To expand her horizons, she accepts the position at Thornfield manor, caring for the sweet, French ward of the dark and brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite her best efforts to the contrary, Jane falls in love with her employer. What secrets lie in Thornfield manor? Why does Jane often feel like she isn't getting the whole story? As Jane begins to realize that things aren't as they appear in Thornfield, she is forced to leave the manor, her young pupil, and Mr. Rochester behind. But can she stay away from her true love for long?Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who was born on 21 April 1816. In 1824 Charlotte and her sisters were sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge. Within a year her sisters died of consumption and their father removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. The critical depiction of the school at Lowood in Jane Eyre drew on Charlotte's experiences at Cowan Bridge and her eldest sister, Maria, was the inspiration for the character of Helen Burns. In 1847 she published Jane Eyre under the pseudonym of Currer Bell. In 1854 she married Arthur Bell Nicholls and died shortly after due to complications with pregnancy.Jane Eyre is definitely a book everyone should consider reading. It helps define some many things including: love and independence. The entire time Jane pulls you on the emotional roller coaster of life. You go up and down with her through her love of Rochester. This book brings you into it so quickly that before you know it you are crying at the end too! And that's the kind of book you want, the kind that makes you feel like there is nothing quite as beautiful as the relationship between the characters.

While the first couple of chapters are somewhat boring, after that the pace never flags, despite the 500-odd-page length. Many chapters in the book are very intense and moving, and it is not too hard to feel for Jane. I thought she might be a very righteous, prim-and-proper person, but was surprised and delighted to discover that she's very flirtatious with Rochester once they declare their love, and playfully delights in her hold over him. Their conversations are fascinating and very revealing. It is always clear that she is passionatly in love with him and no one else, but still more than willing to leave him once the &quot;terrible secret&quot; is revealed. While not quite as strong and feminist a character as I expected, she nonetheless does show an iron will and desperate desire to do what's right more than once. When someone in the book was talking about a Mr. Rochester and made it sound like he'd died, my heart literally stopped for a minute until I (and Jane) realized the man was talking about Rochester's father. That was near the end, and by then I'd become so caught up in it I really couldn't put it down. It is not just a romance novel for women; I'm a 13-year-old boy and I enjoyed it immensely.

(I'll get to him later, though) This is only the second novel I've read that has a main protagonist that is quite similar to me in personality, which is refreshing in itself. (Most novels have spirited, strong-willed people as the main character--not that it's wrong, it just gets boring after around 500 readings.) I identify with Jane because in many ways, for she acts and reacts as I would in her situation. And Mr. Rochester....I fell in love with him with the first chapter I read (which was Chapter 27; I cheated) and have not stopped since. *Sigh, Giggle*These characters are so brilliantly drawn out--no other classic has done a better job of making me feel as if these characters are dynamic people.The prose sparkles--especially Mr. Rochester's, who I find has the gift of turning me into a pile of mush.In short, this is the best classic I've ever read, and the only one that I will definitely read over again and again and again.....(The only one that came close was Pride and Prejudice) No other story has made feel as this one did--this gothic story of passion and love captivates me and will continue to do so.P.S. The only problem I had with Jane's character is when my darling Edward is singing to her, and she is fairly unaffected. I was sobbing on the floor and yelling at Jane at why she was not doing the same thing. Any one else feel the same way?PPS: Some people might say that she is strong and strong-willed, but she is not. Rather, she is strong-principled. She does not have to have her own way, but when it comes to God's way, she is more spirited about it.PPPS: And I am not Dwight Rhodes. I'm his daughter.

I even seem to recall an abridged comicbook version of Jane Eyre. I read the novel when I was 12 years old and was so inspired by it that I read it over many times that year, and never, never forgot it. Interestingly, I am now reading it for the first time since. I have little to add to the other reviews here, but recommend this book to everyone! The author develops Jane's tremendous character, childhood to young adulthood, with economy and care. The early chapters of the book are both painful and lovely to read. The love story that follows is passionate and terribly hard fought. Told in the first person, much of what I experience reading this book, due to our author's skill, is not written on the page, but felt as my own experience. And Mr. Rochester is, if possible, a more brilliant revelation this time around. He is completely compelling and magnetic, humorous and desperate, and sympathetic. The book also provides a portrait of how life was at that time, by the aristocracy and the common man. I have edited this review to add my advice that if you have never read the book, whether or not you have seen any of the film versions, choose an edition without an added \\"forward,\\" or save comments for last, so that do not encounter spoilers and can form your own impressions.Reader, .... read Jane Eyre!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte did a wonderful job of creating a strong female character, the strongest I've read, with a good heart and unbreakable morals.

Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I gather this is required reading at a lot of high schools these days, and I'm sure that a lot of today's high schoolers do indeed think of it as a drag. It sure doesn't have to be, though, if you read from a larger perspective.To fully appreciate today's world, it helps to understand the attitudes and experiences of the past, and JANE EYRE is one of the novels that helps us understand.The book takes an orphaned girl taken in by an unloving aunt, and follows her into an unhappy school experience and ultimately into as good a career as a woman of that time and station could hope for, that of governess.Well, this is one of the earliest gothic novels and true to the genre, you know the girl's going to fall in love with her employer who, unfortunately, has a deep and dark secret.There's tragedy of sorts here and there's triumph, all told against the mores of a bygone era. There's much to learn and to enjoy here if you open up to it. It is dated, and not 100% relevant to today's life, which is why I give it four rather than five stars.It may be helpful to read and compare JENNA STARBORN to JANE EYRE. The former pales horribly by comparison, but by setting the story in the future, today's reader may gain a better understanding of the original story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I will be honest, the first fifty pages of Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; are tough to get through, the story moves slowly as Bronte sets up the plot and introduces us to many of the major characters. I will get back to this in a minute...&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; tells the story of Jane, who is orphaned as a child and must live with her terrible aunt, who decides to send her off to Lowood School in order to learn discipline. Jane is unlike other girls, she describes herself as plain and boring and after leaving Lowood, she decides to take on the job of governess at Thornfield Hall.This brief synopsis is all that happens during the first part of the novel, but after this, Bronte creates a story that is mesmerizing and full of intriguing symbolism and a surprise plot twist at the end that was completely unexpected. I loved Bronte's play on names: Jane Eyre, Helen Burns, Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield Hall, etc. The scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester are at once heartbreaking and romantic, including my favorite scene in the garden (the details of which I will not give away).It's easy to be tempted to give up on 'Jane Eyre' because of the slow beginning, but once Jane begins her job as governess, the novel comes alive as Bronte weaves the intricate plot that is full of joy, sorrow and bizarre occurrances."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"A true classic, I found an old copy in my mothers house and devoured this book one hot summer. It has been made into several motion pictures, the most recent of which being in 1996 starring William Hurt.The heroine of the novel, Jane Eyre, ends up in a strict boarding school after her parents die and her only living relative, and aunt, can no longer stand her 'wickedness'. She endures hardships at school, and the school mistress tries to dampen her passion and opinions.Jane does not lose her spirit, she merely hides it behind her plain face and grows into a proper lady of her station. She graduates from school and takes on a position as a tutor for a young French girl, the ward of a Mr. Rochester. She is given a room in his large house the likes of which she has never seen in her former spartan existance. She falls in love with the little girl as well as Mr. Rochster.Rochester is hiding a tragic secret however. One that he kept from Jane and everyone else for many years. The truth is finally exposed and Jane is heartbroken. This, however is not the end of our tale. Their love does not die, and the end of the novel is poignant and romantic. I guarantee it will have you in tears.Charlotte's writing is beautiful, moving, and descriptive. She is unmatched as a mistress of character development."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte created quite an admirable heroine. Jane Eyre is, without a doubt, one of the most unforgettable heroines of all time. Also, the love story has a modern quality that tells the reader that this book was ahead of its time.As a penniless orphan, Jane Eyre had to endure many adversities in order to secure her status as a governess in the home of Mr. Rochester, a temperamental man with a dark secret -- a secret that could destroy the powerful bond he'd had with Jane Eyre.This novel has revolutionized romantic fiction; it has influenced many writers. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite heroines; I will always admire her courage and independence. I applaud Charlotte Bronte for having invented such an unforgettable character.

Well here's one! I am 23 years old and have just finished it for my literature class, but it's not unprobable I would have read it otherwise anyway, sience it is a classic. Anyway, I first of all think it was very well written with a fluent language. The main reason why I enjoyed it so much, though, is because of the way the writer seems to understand and symphatise with her characters (which are all very real), even for the ones that have faults she condemns. You might think I, being a man (or a boy), could not identify with Jane, but in many ways I could. Maybe because Charlotte Bront is so superb in making her literal world coming alive, that I almost feel I'm there myself, or maybe just because Jane Eyre is the kind of person you'd want to be."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a plain woman in looks, but her intelligence, strength, and feistiness make her a heroine who I think gives much-needed justice to women of her time. She is a spitfire who makes you want to know her and hear her story, and she tells it in a clear, first-person fashion that makes it an easy story to read.Orphaned at a young age, Jane is sent to live with her aunt and cousins, who abuse Jane physically and mentally for ten years. Eventually ejected from her aunt's household on false charges of thievery, Jane is then packed off to Lowood, a charity boarding school whose conditions were deplorable; students were scarcely provided with food and clothing (think Oliver Twist), and were regularly terrorized by the school's cruel headmaster. If that weren't enough, Jane's only real friend at Lowood dies during an outbreak of Typhus.Fast-forward eight years - Jane, still nearly penniless after a two-year stint as a teacher at Lowood, ventures out to make a life for herself as a governess. Her charge is a precocious French child named Adele, with whom she develops a fast friendship. But the real story of Eyre lies in her relationship with the child's foster parent, Mr. Rochester, the dolefule, aloof, yet passionate and somewhat mysterious master of Thornfield. Despite their differing castes and the 20 years separating their ages, their feelings for each other grow deep, and they decide to marry. But it doesn't go exactly as Jane had planned - their wedding ceremony is stopped when it is revealed that Mr. Rochester is already married - to a madwoman whom he has kept locked up in one of Thornfield's bedrooms for years!Horrified, Jane flees Thornfield, ending up a beggar on the streets because she spent her entire savings to leave. Eventually taken in by a clergyman, St. John Rivers, and his two sisters, Jane makes a new life for herself as a teacher. During this time, Jane finds herself the sole heir of her father's estate. Soon after, St. John proposes marriage to her repeatedly, but Jane finds his cold demeanor lacking in comparison to the man she truly loves, Mr. Rochester. (She also finds out that St. John is actually her first cousin - a staple of this genre, it seems.) Prompted by hearing Rochester's voice calling her name during a prayer for guidance, Jane returns to Thornfield, only to find it burned down, and Mr. Rochester blinded by the fire his wife set before killing herself. Naturally, Jane and Mr. Rochester live happily ever after, but if you think this is merely another sappy love story (which I am no fan of!), you would be wrong. In Eyre, Charlotte Bronte shows us a depth and realness of characters which you would be hard-pressed to find in any other novel.Do yourself a favor by reading it - you'll understand why it's considered one of the finest examples of English literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's fine novel has been ill served by its thousands of formulaic romance imitators over the decades. Though it is the model for many a successor novel with an innocent heroine, a surly ugly-handsome hero with a secret, a big house with a monstrous creature in the attic, it confounds them all by having more substance and staying power than any.The love story at the heart of the novel must be founded on real experience, the depiction of the growing attachment between Jane and Rochester is so specifically poignant. The emotional crash and long period of recovery Jane suffers before she reunites with her beloved is also heart rendingly real to anyone who has ever suffered through such a loss. The gothic trappings of the story heighten the dreamlike intensity, but it is the solid reality at the foundation that make this novel stay and stay and stay.There's nothing cheap here about Janes sufferings and something magnificently strong about her victories. She does not just 'get her man.' She lives to be fully her best SELF. And this makes her triumph wholly honorable and beautiful.When I was 12 or 14 and first read this novel, I thought that I could never have forced myself to run away from the man I loved into the starving unknown. Jane's integrity -- not, by the way really principally a religious integrity, but rather an integrity of self -- knows that the man she loves truly would have come to despise her if she agreed to be a mistress. Author Bronte shows us this when she shows Rochester fantasizing taking Jane off to live with him 'on the Moon' . . . he knows himself that his project is merely a fairytale he's spinning to take himself away from his unpleasant reality.This very kind of confrontation between the integrity of self and the demands of the world she lives in--sometimes as a helpless child, and later as a strong willed but penniless runaway, and later still as a woman of independent means--tell the real under story of Jane Eyre that makes her a great heroine and the story a great novel and not just a cheap bodice ripper.Jane revisits every single scene of abuse, defeat and humiliation in her past, and through the strength of her own character, triumphs. Her cruel Aunt Reed, still a difficult and unkind woman on her deathbed, she quells with forgiveness; she outlives her miserable existence as a deprived child in an ill-conducted school, to become a teacher in that same school, reformed; her dark night of the soul and self-exile from her love is a time of utter destitution that she manages to turn into a home, worthwhile work, an inheritance of fortune and family, and another proposal of marriage from an unexceptionably moral man. When she has achieved all this, NOT because she knows anything has changed back at Thornfield Hall, she feels free to obey her deepest self--the self governed most by love- and returns to see what is become of Mr. Rochester. Only when she really truly acts solely from desire and not from need, only when she has a place of her own to stand firm in the world, does she hazard her return. None of these scenes, the ones that I hurried over as a teenager to get to \\"Reader, I married him\\" merit a slurring glance. Jane is growing stronger all the time. She never, from first to last, changes a bit from that deep essential person who loves intensely and desires love returned more than anything. But she becomes clearer and more secure in her ability to live out that self, as she heals and strengthens the other wounded parts of her life.As it's a novel, there are grand coincidences that make it all work out. Read it through once and notice the role played by her Uncle John Eyre, who never appears in any scene, but operates, like Providence, from afar. He's prevented from helping her in time to ensure that she must seek her living as a governess, his vigilance intervenes when she's about to be falsely married, his benevolence finally comes through with an inheritance and relations just when she needs them most.This is a wonderful story, and even as I get older, it does not 'get old.'"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"\\"It is best to be yourself, imperial, plain and true.\\" Robert BrowningAnother chick Brit classic that I had been eluding since my teen-age years and finally got around to perusing this past month. In all fairness to our fellow reviewers who panned this one, I wouldn't have enjoyed this when I was in high school (nor even in college for that matter) either and would have needed a dictionary along with a barf-bag if I was required to read it back then. I have no idea why teachers continue to shove such classics as this down their student's throats when the great majority of their budding brains, inexperienced hearts and raging hormones make it virtually impossible to fully digest at such an age. However, that is a topic better tabled for another time...To describe this beautiful work as simply a love story would be doing it a grave injustice. While it is arguably one of the greatest love stories ever known in literature (I actually prefer \\"Jane Eyre\\" over her younger sister's classic \\"Wuthering Heights\\"), it is so, so, so much more than that. This 1847 masterpiece is an important history lesson as well on what it was like living in provincial England way back when. It touches upon such common themes as morality, religion, gender relations, Social status, friendship, education, etc... A story such as this can relate so much more about the past than most text books will ever tell us, while at the same time making the whole learning experience a joy as well.Of all the past heroines I have had the pleasure (or sometimes the disdain) of being introduced to through my literary travels, it is almost impossible to think of one that possessed a bigger heart and more passionate soul than C. Bronte's Jane Eyre. I found her to be much more interesting and even brighter than James' Isabel Archer, without the latter's pretentiousness. She is way more down-to-earth and less judgmental than Austen's Elizabeth Bennet. She is much more grounded and has a much stronger backbone than Hardy's Tess. However, what really separates her from all the other heroic belles of invention is simply her burning, incessant quest to find love and to be loved in return. Not just romantic love, like Flaubert's Emma B. and Tolstoy's Anna K. but REAL sustaining love, the kind that brings value and a sense of belonging. The sincere kind that comes from not having to sacrifice (as the above mentioned did) one's own principles and ethics. It is this noble and true love that never dies or withers, because it is genuine and magnanimous, without any kind of contrivances whatsoever. Jane never sold out and held steadfast to her beliefs and values, and in the end, well... you'll have to discover that on your own!You don't need me to rehash the book's plot. You can read other people's reviews to do that. All you need to know is one thing - if you haven't had the pleasure yet of meeting Ms. Eyre and you love literature, then please do yourself a favor and order this one today. If this isn't a five-star classic, then I'm afraid I don't know what is!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is an excellent novel written with much emotion and strength.

Her cousin John, who is the master of the house, always harasses her. Jane leaves to go to school, and then she put an ad in the newspaper. A lady named Mrs. Fairfax comes to take her to where she works so Jane can live with them. Jane is a governess who teaches a little girl named Adele. When the master of the house, Mr. Rochester, comes and Jane starts to like him. Jane is eighteen when she went to live at the house in Thornfield.After Jane has been at the Thornfield house for so long she gets a letter saying that her aunt is dying. So Jane goes to her aunts house before her aunt goes and stays for a little bit until she has to get back to work at Thornfield. After that she leaves Thornfield and found a nun who knew her parents. Jane heads back to Thornfield and falls in love and almost marries. But then she finds her self-alone and penniless, then Jane finds that she is rich. The book is good and exciting until the end because of what happens to Jane in the novel.The book has a lot of mystery like when Jane had to put out a fire in Mr. Rochester's bedroom, and romance. In the book in the beginning there is discrimination against woman's rights when master John hurts Jane with his bare hands, this book does have woman's rights in the beginning and in the middle of the book. This book is interesting because it was very expressive of how a teenage life is through this book. The reason why it is so expressive is that the book drags out a teenager life of how problems come and go around. When they explain what is going on in the story with Jane the author explains the weigh she takes the problem in the novel.This book would be really good for people who like love stories and mysteries all in one.

The musical nor the movie will never ever return the stirring of emotion that I felt for Jane's character while reading it from the creative and romantic mind of Charlotte Bront? I did cry when Jane witnessed the death of her very best friend, Helen Burns, in Lowood School. I felt bitter and angry when Mr. Rochester did not tell Jane about his first wife, but I also felt relieved when Jane and Mr. Rochester rekindled their love to face a new life together.If there is one novel that will ever touch my heart, look at my life as a woman, and respect the heroics that women of past ages have undergone, this is the novel.Jane Eyre: this will be a novel respected for ages to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Humbled Jane Eyre(pronounced air) is turned out of her aunt's house after being accused of throwing a gobblet at her master's 16yr old son, then sent to a boarding school for girls.

Sometimes she makes what I thought were foolish choices, but she remains true to her character. She also maintains trust in God, and I was surprised how many references there were in the book to both Bible concepts and characters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Nope, I've never read this book until now. Can you believe it?! One of my goals for 2011 was to finally read the classic Jane Eyre and I am so glad I did! I get nervous reading classics. Alas my concerns were for naught because I thoroughly loved this book and I would highly recommend that everyone read this classic novel if they never have before (or re-read it if they haven't read it since high-school)!Having enticed my book club to join me in reading it since the movie adaptation was coming out in March as well, we had Jane Eyre as our March book pick, so with that I settled in for a classic read. Every time I sat down to read this book it would take a few pages to get back into the language but once I did, it didn't bother me and I totally understood everything that was going on, I just let it wash over me.Jane, how I loved you. You were strong at a time when many women were not. Your life sucked! If you are ever feeling down about yourself, pick this book up because it will make you feel better about your own lot. Poor little Jane did not have an easy start in life but she dealt with her hand and got through it, becoming quite the young little lady.Then she met Edward Rochester. Oh my goodness, brooding, ugly (as defined by Jane), kinda mean to his ward Adele, hiding crazy wives in the attic, Rochester. And guess what, even with all of this against him? We still kind of love him! Jane wants Rochester and Rochester wants Jane, but there are twists in the plot to keep them apart so will they be together? Oh so much angst and pining in this book will be had!Like I said, I am so glad I read it and would heartily recommend it to others. Everyone in my book club really enjoyed it as well, some more than others, and all seemed glad they read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I thought I would never read Jane Eyre.

Bronte and Thackery both admired the enormous capability of women even if not recognized by nineteenth century society.

And she outwits nearly everyone. While they are different types of people, both are strong women who take the initiative.Jane Eyre exposes the narrow mind of the dogmatic evangelical. He wishes to serve God. However he doesn't care much for people. On the other hand, Jane in her own loving and simple way, seems to be a much better person.

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is, in my opinion, the best book ever written. It is a classic that combines mystery and romance effortlessly, in a writing style that is beautifully unique.Jane Eyre is not a heroine, at least in her own opinion. She's orphaned, but educated; penniless, but not without family: just none that would claim her. She accepts a job as a governess to a young French girl named Adele, a Mr. Rochester's ward, who may or may not be his illegitimate daughter.Thus begins the epic romance between the young, plain governess and her grizzled, older employer. But the question remains: can the overcome the greatest obstacle of all - Mr. Rochester's best-kept secret?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I loved this book. I can say that the begining was a little boring but as you keep reading you feel captivated by all the obstacles that Jane has to overcome in life. It is a beautiful reading that promotes real love and not just superficial love, the characters are not beautiful or perfect and even thought they are described as ugly, you can not help but to fall in love with them and cry or laugh with them. In general a great reading!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Somehow I managed to get through high school and a minor's worth of Brit Lit credits in college (including a Victorian literature class) without ever having to have read this book or seeing any of the movies, numerous as they are. Oddly enough, a facebook quiz is what prompted an interest in this book that I knew close to nothing about beforehand.This book really captured my attention and it has been years since I have loved a book such as this. I usually don't take an interest in novels where love is a major theme of the book, but this is a fine exception. The author captivates the reader so thoroughly through the titled character it is like being told a story with a literary painting. The style of Charlotte Bronte's writing is beautiful, and despite predictability at times, it does not withhold any suspense.As for the edition of this book, the illustrations in both black and white and in colour from artist Darcy Dame made this a great edition. I really can't say how much I loved the illustrations. There is something dark, haunting, and paranormal to these illustrations which is so fitting of the Victorian era, well-known for their high interest in the occult. When I saw this edition in a store, I knew immediately that this was the perfect edition for me, as I love interesting pictures in books. I also have a certain love for ink drawings, so the images within the pages are very welcome as well. This certainly beats many of the dreary looking versions of this book. Yes, I know, don't judge a book by it's cover, in it's most literal sense, but an interesting exterior never hurts a good novel.As for other aesthetics of this edition: the paper is good and the colour illustrations are printed on glossy paper. This is of course in paperback, but it is very nice for paperback and I'm surprised that it did not cost more. A typical edition of Jane Eyre seems to be in the 300-page mark, but this one nears 550 pages due to the slightly larger font which is very welcome when reading heavier works."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the most fabulous book ever written.

Then you go back to it years and years later and find that not only does it maintain its quality, but it reveals an even further message you might have missed the first time- almost like a whole different story that just helps to illuminate the story you gleaned from it the first time you read it. While I don't find it \\"gothic\\" in the traditional sense, I do see those elements, but most predominate is a story that can be believeable and one which people can relate to on some level with one character or another in today's world. That is why its still a favorite for me after all these years. I consider it a romance novel told through the eyes of a character who does not want to speak about romance; just experiences it.

Once of the strongest female characters I have ever read - loved it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"As a caveat I must say that I am not a huge fan of the \\"Regency\\" novel. And this novel is so typical of that style of 19th Century British Literature. There is a different view of virtue in the Regency novel. In some novels, virtue is defined as heroism in battle, in others virtue is fidelity to one's morals and integrity. In Jane Eyre, virtue is defined as fidelity to one's class or station in society. And this woman, an orphan and governess by profession, is at the bottom of rural English aristocratic society.The character Jane Eyre is best described, at the risk of being crude, as a doormat. Her only concern is to do whatever is necessary to please those around her. In this heart breaking story, Jane goes from being a student in a school for orphaned little girls to being governess to a Mr. Rochester, who is a rude and self-centered man. Rochester takes a liking to Jane because of her never-wavering devotion to his comfort and ego, so he asks her to marry him. And on her wedding day, she finds out that Rochester already has a living wife, a woman who is chained up in his attic because of her madness. Despite the fact that Rochester already has a wife, he asks Jane to live with him as though Jane were his wife. To her credit, Jane does not agree to this. She has enough self-esteem to run away at this insistence, although she takes nothing with her and is impoverished in her flight.So Jane ends up as a pauper on the doorstep of a random rural English family, only to fortuitously discover later that this family are actually her long lost first cousins. They accept her as family after requiring her to spend a cold winter night asleep outside on their doorstep. Ultimately the young man, who is a parson at the local church, asks Jane to marry him. Jane refuses, not because he is her first cousin (interesting how family relationships were viewed so much differently in 19th century rural England than they are today), but because he thinks of Jane more as a colleague than as a romantic partner. Despite her refusal to marry him, she agrees to travel with him to India as a fellow missionary, but he refuses because he wants her as a wife. She is willing to give up her life in the service of a man who wants only to use her, but then this is the same attitude she had toward Rochester. It is definitely a trend in Jane Eyre's life.In the meantime, Jane learns (also fortuitously) that she is the sole heir of a foreign fortune left to her by a long lost uncle. The fortune would elevate her to a member of the gentry, but Jane, being true to her station and her self-identity as a doormat, splits the fortune with her undeserving cousins. However, at least now she is not destitute. She returns to Rochester to discover that Rochester's crazy wife has escaped her chains, burned down the house, killing herself and blinding him. His future is bleak, but this only makes him more attractive to Jane Eyre. She marries him and rebuilds his house and estate. And, at long last, Rochester sees her as more than a tool. It is a nice ending, I suppose, at least as good as it gets for the Regency novel.It is difficult for a 21st century American to relate to the kind of self-degradation that Jane Eyre not only endures but actively works toward in the face of the prospect of a better life. Perhaps it is a tale of true love, unconditional in the face of adversity. It is also a sad commentary on the social values of a bygone era. If nothing else, Jane Eyre offers an answer to those silly nostalgic people who see 19th Century rural England as some sort of golden era. We can be thankful that, in our era, these kinds of values of self-debasement are no longer acceptable."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"THIS IS ABOVE ALL A GREAT AND GRIPPING STORY.

(I didn't read much at all for that matter.) And now as an adult I have the fortune of visiting some of the great works of literature for the first time. Jane Eyre was a challenge for me initially because I believed I wouldn't identify with the character much. The more I allowed myself to become immersed in the story, the more I was impressed by Jane's courage of character, even as a young girl.Jane Eyre has an intellectual confidence, noticeable from a young age, which she draws from in order to challenge those seeking to place unnatural limits on her. Her aunt Reed emotionally abused her as a child, and still Jane had enough perspective to fight for her own justice. When she was sent away to a boarding school (with only slightly better conditions than before), Jane suffered further emotional trauma but also learned to thrive in spite of everything. Her negative experiences informed her towards a life of seeking goodness.When Jane finally crosses paths with Mr. Edward Rochester, she faces choices of both heart and mind that few women of that time would be prepared for."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child.

I was just expecting a sort of Gothic romance, but this is so much more. There may be some spoilers in what follows, but I will try to stick to general, thematic terms rather than disclosing specific plot points.Jane Eyre is, above all, a novel about the unity, versus the duality, of mind and body, reason and emotion---or, as Bront puts it, \\"judgment and feeling\\"---particularly as this applies to the Christian religion. Christianity is, of course, committed to dualism, but Bront, though paying lip-service to religion, rejects this, depicting its evil in many of its manifestations. Some of the devout Christian characters she paints as blatant hypocrites, but even those whom Jane respects or even admires, when it comes right down to it, she does not emulate. Jane seeks happiness in this life, here on earth, while even the \\"good\\" Christians are doomed to seek it only in the next, and that by sacrificing it in this one.The basic story idea brilliantly demonstrates Bront's theme: Jane is given the choice of a loveless marriage, or unmarried love. The latter situation may seem a bit contrived to the modern reader, and indeed it seems as though Bront herself feels this on some level, as the passionate appeal of Jane's lover is much more convincing than her reason for refusing him---namely, that the laws forbidding both divorce and adultery must be in place for *some* reason. (That may be generally true, but they clearly don't apply in this case, or make an exception for it.) Even when she is finally able to follow both her heart and her mind, it is only after these Christian principles have resulted in the horrible crippling of her beloved, which damns those principles all the more.In short, Jane Eyre is a book about a woman's struggle to stay true to her whole self---heart and mind---against Christianity's attacks on both fronts. I don't think it was Bront's conscious intention to write a novel condemning Christianity for sundering our hearts from our minds, but only what she viewed as corrupt interpretations of it---yet that is what she did, and it is brilliant. Both her heart and her mind were clearly much more dedicated to this life than the next, as Jane Eyre powerfully demonstrates. This is a novel way ahead of its time, in many, many ways."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The story Jane Eyre is a classic romance novel. This story was written in in 1847 by Charlotte Bronte. As you can image the story is very influenced by the social norms of that time. But in essence that is what make the story so believable. Jane Eyre is about a young girl who was orphaned and made to stay with her cruel rich aunt. In Jane's younger years she gets verbally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins. One day Jane fights back and is eventually sent to a boarding school for girls. The life style at the school is harsh and dangerous. The girls living their have very little clothing, food, shelter, and people willing to take care of them. Because of these bad circumstances illness strikes. After that occasion the climate in the school changes to one where the girls are provided for. Jane is able to get a wonderful education, and when she graduates she decides to become a governess. She puts an add out in the paper and is contacted by Mrs. Fairfax to become the governess to Adele Varnes. Jane goes to live at Thornfield Manner. She spends many happy months there. Until Mr. Rochester comes to visit. He is Jane's employer and the guardian of Adele. Mr. Rochester confuses Jane in ways that no one every has. Love sparks between the two of them. But this love is tested by secrets from Mr. Rochesters past!I found all of the characters in this story to be believable and realistic. They seemed like people you would meet on the street. Well, minus the fact that they have the mannerism of someone from the 1800s. In particular I love Jane Eyre. She is a strong woman. That any female could relate to. It surprised me when I first read the book that she was so strong, since this book was both written in the 1800s and took place there. Also, the emotions that Jane has are very realistic. While she was at the girls boarding school she lost a friend and it felt really real when it happened. I will admit to shedding a few tears when it happened. I think that the bases for a good book is if the story can touch the reader and for me this book did.I did really like the story. The plot and characters where both interesting and well thought out. At times the book was very slow and my interest was lost. It could get a little boring if you don't have a lot of patience and determination. My favorite part of the book was the ending. The ending was happy and a good solution to both Jane and Mr. Rochester's problems. It left me satisfied and I didn't have anymore questions. My least part of the book was the middle. There wasn't enough change in the story and Jane was too caught up in her own head. There needed to be more action there or even a new character. The middle just didn't do it for me.I would recommend this story to someone else. Probably an adult or a teenager. Like I said before you need a lot of patience and determination to get through the book. So, for anyone under the age of 15 it would be a very difficult read. To really enjoy this book you have to love history and a good romance. To really get this book you have to understand the motivations of people in the mid 1800s. It really wouldn't make to much sense to someone who doesn't have a grasp on history. I would give this book 4.5. The plot and characters in this story are amazing. However the plot sometimes is somewhat slow. Overall I believe that Charlotte Bronte did a wonderful job writing this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Similar in some respects to other Victorian era novels, this one is more exciting than most. Things happen. There is mystery and intreague. Even so, it's difficult at times not to get fed up with the flowery, laborious, self-aware banter that men and women of the day seemed required to engage in. Some of the prose is very clever, and that's always fun to hear. But there are times when you want to just shout: GET TO THE POINT, ALREADY!

Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I cannot say what has not been said by earlier reviewers here.

Having first read the book at such a young and impressionable age, I think Jane Eyre has always been my inspiration. Her courage and spunk are qualities that as a little girl, I most deeply admired and wanted to emulate. It is a wonderful book for young women to read to for its strong willed heroine who nonetheless exhibits all of the compassion and femininity that women must also possess. So much what we teach young women today is, be masculine and ruthless to get ahead in this world. Women should be proud and not afraid to be feminine.

Your eyes cannot read the enthralling story fast enough. In your frenzied haste to know more, you grip the book tighter and bend it back, cracking the binding.Years later when you pick the very same book up again, you can tell the scary, happy, or sad parts of the book by the location of the creases. Jane Eyre is such a book. It is one of three or four books who contentend for the multiple-crack champion.I was assigned to read this book for an AP English class. Although I love to read, class-assigned books had a dubious history with me. Most, I felt, were boring or too pessimistic to find favor with me. I had heard many people talk about the book favorably after having read it in middle school. I put my hope in their past experiences and began to read. Although the first pages did not entirely confirm the praises the book had recieved, the book so far surrpassed my expectations that I finished the book in only a few days time! I would have read non-stop if it had been within my means to do so. When I did get the chance to read, I read as much as I could to the exclusion of food and family sometimes!You may be wondering what about this book could make me such a fanatic. Well, I could give you deep literary criticism about the symbolism, the metaphors, or the imagery, but that doesn't really help you enjoy the story more, it only rounds out the meaning. Instead, let me tell you why you want to read this book.This book combines passion and logic. An odd combination that don't often go together. Jane Eyre starts out in life full of passion and emotions, through torture and schooling, she learns to control her feelings and be ruled by logic. As she moves through life she struggles to find a balance between what her emotions tell her and what logic demands. Logic helps her through times when she feels abandoned and emotions guide her back to love when the tables are turned.This book skillfully combines elements from nearly all genre and is sure to please anyone. It has action, romance, comedy, suspence, even the supernatural! This book is sure to put cracks in YOUR binding"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"---In Charlotte Bronte's classic JANE EYRE, the title character is a strong willed woman who undergoes many hardships and trials, but eventually comes out triumphant. This book is a mixed one for me. I appriciate the classic nature of this story, and I like the heroine, but there is just a self righteous tone to the entire book. ---- Jane Eyre was raised by her terrible and cruel aunt who cares not a wick for her. This was possibly her earliest hardship, yet she persevered the tough childhood years, and becomes even stronger when her aunt puts her in a terrible boarding school. Eventually, she takes a position as a nanny in the house of a rich man where she finds what it is to be loved.------ The problem I had with this story was the &quot;love&quot; between the rich man and Jane Eyre. I didn't feel that the Rochester and Jane loved one another at all, but rather had a need to have control over another person, and they provided one another with this powerful position. They both seemed ver"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is by far one of the best books I've ever read. The plot is interesting and is written in a beautiful fashion. However, if you plan on buying it, don't get the Penguin Classics edition. Towards the middle of the novel, there are strange spelling mistakes: half of Jane's name becomes Janet, which is not even a character in the book. It gets very annoying after a while and doesn't occur any of the other editions. I definitely recommend this book, but just not this edition."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I was disappointed. I found it to be verbose, going on and on for long passages where nothing much changed or happened - just repetitious. In addition, it is profoundly and deeply Christian, to the point of preachiness. This last may not be a problem for you if you happen to share the author's views.However, if you can live with its faults, it is otherwise well written. Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester are well drawn characters, interesting and unexpected. The plot has sufficient twists and turns to hold your interest. And the ending is satisfying, a big plus for me.In summary, it is more dated than, say, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (a personal favorite), but it is still worth reading.(This review is of the unabridged audio version of the book.)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is surely the best book from the Bronte family. Out of any of the books that they have published, this one is by far the closest to being interesting. A lot of neat stuff happens if you pay close attention.The reason why I give this book a three is that I don't see it a as a great work of literature. The are many other books out there (my favorite: the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo) that deserve a five. I couldn't bring myself to even give this a four.In all I see Jane Eyre as an ok book. However, it does become very dull at times and you won't pick it up and read it again if you make it to the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"When I was 12 my aunt gave me a copy of Jane Eyre. It was a favorite of hers as a young girl. It quickly became a favorite of my own. It encouraged me to seek out other books like any one of Jane Austen's great novels, Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. So I am eternally grateful to my aunt who handed me a small paperback that opened my mind to a world I never knew!

I looked at the beautiful cover and said, this looks interesting. I know you are not suppose to judge a book by its cover, so before I got it, I read the first chapter. I was instantly in a world of my own which only inhabited a young girl named, Jane Eyre. I got it out as fast as I could and started to get far away from the world, in this book. I read it constantly, not wanting to put it down. I was surrounded by mystery and passion and thrills all at the same time. The characters were so life-like that I felt like I was standing right next to them, observing them from every angle. It was the most, thrilling experience I've ever had from a book besides 'Little Women.' The writing, it's so creative and follows the rules of realism and describation and the beautiful flow of language. I just couldn't believe that the whole story was fiction and was made up in the author's mind. It seems that it actually happened. This book is a classic and if you haven't read it yet, you are just missing out. I would like anyone who wants to be inspired to write read Ms. Charlotte Bronte's words. Since I'm a writer, it has helped me so much. But, if you are not a writer, I would still recommend it to readers who like to be immersed in books. Everyone should read this!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"While I do admit that I did not read this book of my own free will (It was on my summer reading list), I really liked this book.

It really wasn't that hard to understand once I got used to the language. This book may be more appealing to females than males due to the female heroine. I honestly couldn't put it down and breezed through it in less than a week. I even read it twice!

Homely girl entices rich man with innocence and natural beaty. Rich man dumps blond for homely girl. I'm not going to pretend that every word in this book kept you wanting more, it actually took me close to 200 pages to get interested, but its well worth the wait!!!! Jane is sent from her aunts house to live at a boarding school. She is brave and outspoken after living with her aunt after her mothers death and is not quite welcomed with open arms at her new home. Her only friend dies a short time after Jane's arrival and life isn't everything Jane wanted. She completes school and stays for several years to be a teacher herself.

Reading it the second time not only helped me to understand it more, but to like even more. Jane Eyre is a wonderful book that comes from out of the blue. To me when I first heard I had to read it as a freshman, it was just another one of those classics that they made you read. However, as the stroy progressed I really enjoyed learning about how Jane delt with everything. Not only did I begin to dislike the people that Jane disliked, but I began to start looking at everyday situation and wonder how she might handle them. Overall, it was a wonderfully written book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I am a 15 year old freshman who was required to read this book for an honors class. At first I was annoyed at the lengh and appearence of &quot;another boring classic&quot; that I would hate. Once I started to read Jane Eyre I was immediatly drawn in. The descriptions of seens, though long and tedious, were magnificent. The story line itself realy touched me. I found myself dislikeing all the characters that Jane disliked and having a grudge against all the characters who were unjust to Jane. I found jane to be a kind of idol. Her courage to speak up for herself and never let anyone walk all over her was really encouraging to me. By the end of the book I was in love with Mr. Rochester and felt my own ties with Thornfeild, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, and all the others. I encourage people to read this book! What I thought was going to be a boring assignment turned into a pleasure. Me, a person who really dislikes reading, found myself reading every night. I hope kids and adults alike read this book and enjoy it. It was somewhat of a challenge for me, but it was well worth it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charolette Bronte never seces to amaze me. she seems to bring her characters to life, as they jump off the page and into you head. After reading Jane Eyer, you will find yourself constantly wondering how she is doing. This book will follow you wherever you go, and unconcesly haunt you mind. It is an ultimate classic that everyone must read! What makes this book so great? Charolette Brontes wonderful skill, of making the characters so real, is what makes this book a classic. She describes Jane in such a way, that everyone can find a bit of themselves in her, and often can relate to her thoughts, and her feelings. Her inocence, just seems to surround her. She has such a pure love, a pure want, and yet she is so inocent, that we long to be like her. Her inteligence and pride, add to her, and make her a prominent figure in our minds. With out Charolette Bronte's wonderful depiction of Jane, this book would not be near as powerful as it is now. The romance in this novel, makes you wan to reach out and hug Jane. You wan tto tell her that everything will be all right, and with the hard life that she had suffered through, when she finds love, you want to cry for her. As the Climax of the book arrives, you find yourself reading, with a tear sliding slowly down you cheek. You feel you eyes fill up as you want to weep with her. YOu want her to know you are there. with out the romance, that touches your heart, this book could not be the same, and would not touch the heart in the same way. The simplicity of theh plot, helps to make the book a hit. If this book were not simple and plain, it would become a bore, but it is nothing more than a young girls life, as she grows, her terrible treatment from her aunt, her schooling, and her first love. This book is so simple that it is almost amazing.Clearly this book is wondeful. You will find your self reading it over and over again! I suggest it to all of those who enjoy a good romance, with lots of love and hope!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter.

Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end.

She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India.

This is the cloth bound version or the book with the lovely attached ribbon bookmark. This is a very lovely version of this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the story of a young girl who grows up and is forever contrary to her society. The book foreshadows the penalties that society gives for such opposition, but Jane still remains opposed to the role society wants her to have. In Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte uses foreshadowing, symbolism, and conflict to show her society how a woman can overcome the conventions of her society to live a happy and full life.An example of foreshadowing comes during Jane's engagement. First there is the splitting of the chestnut tree (page 226), soon after Rochester and Jane become engaged: \\"Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.\\" This event foreshadows how the upcoming wedding between Jane and Rochester will divide the two, sending one away, because they are not ready for marriage. It is not until Jane and Rochester both overcome the conventions of their society that they can have a happy marriage.The most dramatic example of foreshadowing comes right after Jane's dreams. After waking from her disturbing dreams, Jane sees a light in her room and finds a grotesque female figure standing over her (250). The figure is Bertha Mason, who came to terrify Jane out of marriage. After rending Jane's veil in two, Bertha leaves and Jane collapses. The rending of the veil foreshadows the obstacle still in front of Jane's upcoming marriage, and it is not until this obstacle is dealt with that Jane can marry.Aside from foreshadowing, Charlotte Bronte uses symbolism, mostly of birds, to show how Jane's society confines her. For example, Jane's surname comes from the word for a bird's nest, aerie. Rochester gives an additional example of the bird symbolism on page 232 when he says \\"Jane, be still, don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.\\" Rochester says this when he is trying to convince Jane that they can be married. At this time Jane is struggling with the barriers that her society places on their union. Jane is the bird that society traps in a cage, keeping her away from the man she wants to marry. Eventually, Jane does find a way to overcome her cage and obtain happiness with Rochester.Bronte also uses people to symbolize certain aspects of her society. Mr. Brocklehurst, for example, is the epitome of hypocrisy, as shown during his inspection of Lowood. While surveying the girls in the school, Mr. Brocklehurst condemns one for having naturally curly hair, a vanity of the world in his opinion, and yet Brocklehurst goes so far as to buy curled wigs for his wife and daughters. In addition to this, Brocklehurst manages the funds of Lowood and never allocates enough money to keep the girls sufficiently warm or well fed. Instead of teaching the girls to live pious and frugal lives, he leaves them weakened in front of the onslaught of winter illnesses. These characteristics of Mr. Brocklehurst make him a symbol of the typical man from Jane's society. Jane's ability to overcome the wrongs he does to her shows her society how to rise above society and obtain a happy life.Throughout this book, Jane clashes with the conventions of her society until she rises above them. The greatest example of Jane's opposition to her society is in her successful marriage to Rochester. \\"Reader, I married him,\\" Jane says on page 397. Jane does not say that they were married, or that Rochester proposed to her again. Instead, she states that she took the active role and married Rochester. Such assertion from a woman went against the standard role of women in Bronte's time. Jane opposes the role that society has established for her and rises above it, obtaining the thing that truly made her happy.Charlotte Bronte focuses on overcoming the conventions of her society by having Jane Eyre oppose and surmount them. Foreshadowing shows how society will react to such opposition, such as when Jane and Rochester are initially engaged. Symbolism also helps to illustrate the confines of convention; they cage Jane just like a bird. And the various clashes between Jane and other characters, even her society, further illustrated the limitations of conventionality. But opposing and overcoming the conventionality of society can lead to true and lasting happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte discusses one the most important issues we face today in our society--namely a girl's struggle to be loved but also to be socially and mentally independent. Jane Eyre is a lonely, miserable child, who finally becomes a happy, satisfied wife. She does so only after struggling and suffering as a child and later as a young woman. Although the content is very interesting for most, I believe that Bronte could have fitted it in 280 instead of 480 pages.Jane initially maintains her romantic relationships superficial since, according to her, they will result in her lack of independence. Jane's romances with Rochester and St. John are not essentially based on true love, and thus, do not flourish. Rochester is interested in Jane because of her intelligence and piano skills; however, Jane believes that the great social differences between her and Rochester make her unworthy of this relation. A marriage would mean abiding by a husband's orders and the household's chores, which definitely is not her connotation of love. Jane's undeveloped romantic relationships fortify her desire for independence and romance simultaneously.Only by becoming socially and economically equal to Rochester does Jane finally seek a deep, lasting romantic relationship, fulfilling Bronte's assertion that a rational balance between emotions and desires is required to become happy. Jane's acquaintance with her cousins provides her the emotional support she seeks throughout the novel. An added support is Jane's inheritance of her wealthy uncle, which makes her not only socially but also economically equal to Rochester. Now that Jane is economically, socially, and emotionally autonomous, she can accept Rochester's proposal.In Jane Eyre, Jane discovers the secret of having a happy life through rationally balancing her desires for independence and her emotions towards Rochester and St. John. Nowadays, many young women struggle to achieve this balance. Therefore, I greatly encourage any who face that same problem to read this book. Maybe you will find your solution in one of the pages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is a pretty good book, as far as it captures Jane's character and tells a decent story of romance. Although i have to say that the plot isn't really the tightest, the righting and foreshadowing is very fine, and the play between the narrator describing herself and others.Like Jane herself says, she is not really an angel, and really is more of a woman's woman than otherwise, just by the way the plot turns out. On the one hand she defends her virtue, and her \\"station\\", in a reasonable sort of way, but the narrator of course is the character, and she gets a bit self-righteous and indignant at times without much good cause. The \\"idea\\" of love kind of turns out to be just what will make the best story. Of course a good story is hard to write, but this is why I say it has the feel of an indignant biography.Other than that I wouldn't knock this book too much. The opening 10 chapters and Helen Burns are very touching and you'll see the character, try to survive and lose all of the sweetness that a Helen Burns has over time, which is kind of sad in a way. The book is good though b/c it shows the reasons for her emotional decline from Helen's sort of pure beautiful spirituality into a real sort of adult. I'm not a historian of this period or anything, but it seems like this book is pretty good."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read it for the first time when I was studing english and loved the book.

Defenseless. Powerless. This is the reality of Jane Eyre, a young orphan girl forced to cope with the callous world around her as a child. After the death of her parents, Jane is forced to reside with her cruel aunt, Mrs. Reed, who despises her, and consequently sends Jane away to Lowood, a boarding school with little resources and poor housing conditions. Despite malnutrition and a harsh atmosphere, Jane strives to make her mark at the school, eventually becoming a teacher. Before she realizes it, Jane tries to escape from her old life and embarks on a new journey as a governess under the employment of a secretive and guarded gentleman. As Jane falls in love with her mysterious employer, she struggles to safeguard the little confidentiality she has left to protect herself from the secrecy and ill-will of others. Although Jane cautiously guards her heart instead of exposing her soul, a revelation of truth eventually catches up to her, causing more harm than the wrath of the deepest secrets. Jane finds herself trapped between truth and lies as she faces her past, her situation, and herself in a world where all odds are against her. Jane Eyre has remained a classic in literature because Bront illustrates the necessity of secrets in life, therefore supporting the tendency of human nature to occasionally slip in a guilt-free secret or two into one's life."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"From the novels of this type (the romantic classics) that I have read, I would say this is one of the better ones. Her other book Wuthering Heights (that I read few years before this), left me baffled at the notion that that was a love story. Jane Eyre, however, is a true love story. It is beautifully written, and Bronte does a wonderful job in developing the character: Jane. By the end I felt I knew her.The book is quite lengthy, which is its only fault. There are many places in the book that could have been shortened. I tried to read the book a second time, but I managed to get only a third way through.It is a lovely story.

Family, love, relationship, friendship, on one hand; and on the other, backstabbing, scheming, rivalry, heartbreaks etc. All such things apparently do not lose their meaning and value over time, unlike technology, social establishments, cultural distinctions and class differentiation, to name but a few. The author masterly describes human nature in its various negative and positive aspects, thus subtly inferring the moral of the story, filled with action, tregady, drama, struggle, romance, affection and ultimate achievement. The main characters, who eventually fall in love through loads of trouble, are heroic in their development, however, realistic, emerging and aspiring, unselfish and memorable; whereas being quite natural modest and sincere since the very beginning.Overall, there is a lot of wisdom and sense in this lovely book. Something for anyone who is truly interested in personal improvement, good manners, real feelings and emotional intelligence, and last but not least, immaculate language and style."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It was incredible to have access to a novel our children are required to read. Thank you for making it free! appreciate it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"One thing I appreciate about reading old classics on e-books such as the Kindle, is the ability to immediately look up archaic words within. Plus the fact that along with this ability, these old classics are available for free (at least for the most part).(Spoiler alert)I would say that with a few of the old english titles now under my belt, the authors of the time leave a lot to incredibility in order to advance their plots. In the case of Jane Eyre, this came up with a majorly coincidental meeting of a man and a letter in the town of Maderia (or some such spelling). Also, of a rather psychic lament being heard by the story's protagonist. Also of a chance meeting of the protagonist, on the verge of dying of starvation and privations; finding herself on the doorstep of some long lost relatives.Guess they had a lot of faith back then that God's will, will out. Otherwise it did make for a nice story. Just a bit too much of \\"Deus ex machina\\" for my tastes."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I love Jane Eyre, I have read it many times and even though I know what happens, the writing is so wonderful that I can't put it down."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's a classic read.

Easy to read for teenage and enjoyable for adult readers"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's easy to see why this novel is regarded as one of the greatest of all time. If you love classic English literature, Charlotte Bronte is unsurpassed in her command of the language. She delves into the depths of feelings of her characters which must have been especially gripping to her audience in the mid-19th century and indeed today. Well read by Juliet Mills."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Many people consider Jane Eyre to be Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece (with a minority preferring Villette). I have to agree- Jane Eyre is my number one of her novels, by far.We all know the story by this point. A governess falls in love with her employer to find out he has a dark secret...dun dun dun! It's very much a Romantic as well as romantic novel. It's very different from anything Jane Austen ever wrote, that's for sure! (Charlotte was not a fan of dear Jane, by the way).The first time I read this book, as a freshman in high school, I didn't get into it until after Jane got to Thornfield. I found the parts with Jane as a child draggy. Now I get sucked into the story right from the beginning. Young Jane is a fiery, passionate creature who's not afraid to speak her mind. Lowood makes her take on a more controlled, reserved front but she never loses her inner passions. I find Jane so strong and still a realistic character- I just love her.It's not a totally perfect book but it's close. It's only little nitpicks that bug me- like all the coincidences. Rochester isn't exactly my favorite character but I totally get the connection and the love between them and on a literary level I do like him. On a personal level, I don't- but it works in a book. I appreciate how he has to suffer for his sins and really has to earn his happy ending."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"A good, solid transcription to Kindle.

So buyer beware."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I had to read this novel for my IB English class and I couldn't even imagine reading this novel as it was one of the longest and thickest book I have ever seen; not to mention that this book is a \\"classic\\" (aka a long boring book with bunch of long weird words). As if to add on to this little personal hell, my teacher made us mark and annotate every single page in this book and I knew that this was going to make me hate this book even more. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I love it! Without a doubt it was my favorite book of the year and I would even consider it the best book of my high school career. As with most novels, it took a bit of time to get into, especially with this book as it is so long. I wouldn't necessarily describe this novel as a \\"quick read\\" but that only adds to the magnificent effect of the novel. This novel combines a heaping of drama, a dash of romance, and a pinch of Gothic horror. I think that there is something in this book that appeals to all reading Connoisseurs out there. Although I would consider Jane Eyre herself plain I definitely would not consider this novel that."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The main character in this novel is Jane Eyre, a normal woman with a troubled path who decides to change the course of her life by becoming a governess at Thornfield Hall, a mansion shrouded in mystery and mastered by the strange Mr. Rochester. Her time at Thornfield is spent governing her sweet student, befriending fellow staff, searching for the source of mysterious sounds that she can hear throughout the night, and getting closer to Mr. Rochester. Though it was written during the era of classic romance, Jane Eyre has a twist that I never expected when first reading it.

Jane Eyre is an inspiring character -- a strong person unwilling to accept the mistreatment that came with the \\"bad hand\\" dealt her at infancy.

Put your finger on a word, and you're taken to the word in the dictionary -- so convenient, especially when reading a classic novel written with some antiquated words!

I am just sad it took me so long to read it. Very well written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read this years ago and have seen several movie versions. I like watching the movies but reading it is the best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a classical literary work that encompasses a variety of genres from mystery to romance. The novel is told from the perspective of Jane Eyre, a young woman orphaned as a child, who struggles to find her place in the world. Traveling among many occupations, Jane finds herself as a governess and begins to develop feelings for her employer, the rude mannered Mr. Rochester. However, Jane discovers that his country estate holds frightening secrets among a mysterious past.This Gothic romance encompasses many themes that are relevant to society today which not only makes the novel relatable, but also intriguing. The reader becomes wrapped in Bronte's descriptions as the story unfolds and takes unexpected turns and twists. From the beginning, Jane struggles to find those who love and accept her as a human being. Throughout her life Jane is oppressed by others who tell her that she is not good enough and is constantly put down even when she tries to change her situation. She is told that she is too ugly, too poor, and ultimately too powerless to overcome obstacles, but she tries regardless. In every situation presented, Bront touches on relationships with people. As human beings ourselves, we are able to relate to these struggles and the ways which we attempt to survive difficult moments within life.Jane Eyre represents these themes and continues to affect readers even today. This novel presents the emotions and desires of everyday people while also including an exciting, thought provoking plot. Jane Eyre is one of those novels that will travel with you over time. Personally, rereading the book at different points in my life has allowed me to read with a different perspective which I may not have considered before.I would also recommend reading Wide Sargasso Sea if you enjoyed Jane Eyre. This other novel written by Jean Rhys tells the story of Bertha and defends some of the judgments that could be made of Bertha in Jane Eyre. The novel also questions whether Bertha's mental state was altered before even arriving at Rochester's estate. It is a very interesting companion book to read after having read Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"What can you say about this book that hasn't already been said.

My English teacher gave it to me as a present and I have cherished it since. I still have that copy, in good condition. The novel was wordy and yet not boring. The book to me was not only a classic but beyond what words can describe. I'm in 11 grade and I've read it about five times. I still cry whenever I read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This classic (yes I coin the phrase out of my own true feelings about the book - not because it is old) sincerely touched me and found me out to be a romance reader after avoiding such themes as much as possible. The book, extremely unique in style, speaks across all time and place - THAT is why it is a classic. One of my favorite tools that Bronte uses is the way she adresses the reader as 'reader.' It gives the uniquivocal sense that you are sitting in the room with her as she tells this tale to you of a little orphan girl (or could be boy) who seeks out her destiny in fortune, misfortune and fate. The only fault that she perhaps could have avoided is in editing. There are a few strange grammatical quirks and there are many lines that could have been shortened or cut out entirely. However, I highly recommend it to any reader of any age with an open mind to start and finish a true CLASSIC."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Erye, by Charlotte Bronte, is an excelente book. The characters are very well developed. Jane, for example, expounded upon the world her naivity and youthfullness. Her character was that of a dew-kissed lilly-- clean, pure, and forthright. Mr. Rochester was very similar to a bull dog. He had a surreptious character that leaves you wondering about his motives. His growling countenance intimidates and frightens the reader. This book contains numerous metaphors for life-- hardly ostentatious, so the reader must infer to discover these valuable lessons to life. A classical must read, Jane Eyre is not a dustcollector for any bookshelf. You will read it multiple times, appreciating it more as you get older._________________________________________________________________*Note: There is a slight part which may put the reader to sleep. Still, it is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is my next favorite Austen after &quot;Pride and Predjudice&quot;. Beautifully written.

Though Jane and Mr. Rochester differ in age...They fall in love and are to be married. But fate intervenes.This has got to be the best book in the world. Jane is a wonderful woman with strong character and a inquiring mind. She reminds me slightly of myself.Many people seem to shun this book because it is so old and speaks in a slightly different English than we are used to. It is not a hard read at all. Once you get into the book, everything makes sense.

Though she loves Mr. Rochester, she refuses to lower herself to adultrey. As life becomes unbearable there, she sets off to find herself and to seperate herself from her love.She soon finds that no matter how many miles she puts between herself and Mr. Rochester, she cannot forget him."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is as a great romance and a clever book. It is marked by an intelligent pessimism as opposed to a silly optimism which is also a marked point in most of Thomas Hardy's work. You go through the psychological struggles of Jane Eyre, an orphan first with the oppressive regime at the Lowood School and later with her employer Mr. Rochester and her cousin St.John Rivers. It is strong in the depiction of the environment in which the novel takes place and it also succeeds in making an argument about colonialism and psychology. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I put off reading this book for years - it was sitting on the dusty shelf in my schoolroom, by the Austens, Dickens and Shakespeare and looked like the driest book in the world. However, like those other books, Jane Eyre has stood the test of time, and there's a good reason for that. So 10 years after I left school I finally went ahead and read it, and was delighted to find that it is one of the best written and romantic stories you will ever read. Jane is orphaned at an early age, has a sad and lonely childhood, finds a job and a chance at romance, only to have it all dashed away and she is apparently left destitute....but it's not over yet. Treat yourself to this book, curl up and enjoy the wonderful descriptive prose and you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is probably one of my top ten fave books of all time. The love story in it was (in my opinion) very intense a lot of the time (the part where she comes back just kills me every time). I can understand how you would not like this book if you don't like cheesy love stories (and, trust me, the ending is VERY cheesy) but it's just a wonderful book in all. The parts where Jane is not with Rochester can be tedious sometimes but, fortunately, since I've read it, I can skip those parts and just read the good ones. When Jane leaves Rochester, Bronte describes it in such a way that it makes the reader feel as if they were leaveng their one true love. The only thing that gets me is the age difference between Rochester and Jane but I don't stress over it. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good romantic pick-me-up."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Wonderfully narrated and very alive. Definitely recommend it.

Written in the first person, the excellent writing of the author Charlotte Bronte is both beautiful to read and gripping in its story telling power.What I found of particular interest was the moral character of Ms Eyre. There is a sense of absolute honesty about her, an honesty both to herself and in her sense towards other people that makes her truly stand out. For instance, Jane went through extreme hardships to do what she thought was morally a right thing to do, including relinquishing her lover. And then, when she has barely come out of extreme poverty, she finds out that her rich Uncle has left her a lot of money. She shows her character here by willingly sharing her inheritance with her newly discovered cousins.And the way that she loves Rochester is simply too beautiful for me to describe here in words. Read the book, and let Charlotte Bronte describe it to you in her eloquent and heart rendering prose."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This was an adorable little book that was very affordable.

Enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is so much more than a love story, although reading about the love story in &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; is exciting precisely because it is from a time when courtesy and appropriate behavior was so highly valued. Some may compare that kind of behavior with today's much more open and free male/fremale relations and not understand the impediments to verbal and physical demonstration of your love back in those days. However, I think that added so deliciously to the sexual tension.Mostly, I find this to be about a particular female who has an incredibly admirable personality. Independent, clever, modest yet feisty, she sets a great example for true feminism to come. We need to pay attention to the hardships she faced, and the ways in which she handled them. It sets an example for us to be better people and to face our own modern day challenges with ethics and fortitude.The characters were clearly delineated and we would have no trouble identifying them if they were to come to life. Bronte handled the English language in a most eloquent fashion, which I enjoyed very much. It is fascinating to see how a language grows and changes over time. It reflects the society it is expressing information about.

So what? Jane Eyre is still a very good book. Its main attraction is the superb description of Jane's problematic life and the character's in the book. A good story must draw the readers into it, making them feel like they're witnessing the action firsthand, and Jane Eyre does it beautifully.

From the very beginning, the story sweeps you up and holds you captive. On the first page, Jane is sure to win you over, and keep you on her side throughout the entire book. Told in elegant English, the story feels real and the characters seem to leap out of the pages. When I read Jane Eyre, I felt the lonely misery of her childhood, endured the sufferings of Lowood School, and shivered in the dark as strange noises issued from the attic of Mr. Rochester's house. I too rejoiced at the prospect of marriage to Mr. Rochester, and was filled with dark despair when the secret of the locked third story room was revealed.

We read it in the in the English lesson. Sometimes it was hard to understand, because English is a foreign language for us. Jane is a courageous person and we could understand some of her emotions, because it's the reality and some of us know some of her feelings. We think it is a good book for young and romantic people, because the story tells of love and problems between men and women.

All what she had passed in her live, turned us on to make thoughts. We find it very force from her that she had returned to Mr Rochester after all that happened and after his great change. We both found or find it still a very good book, and we can recommend it all people who have a sense for true love and dramatic.

The reader is usually wondered what will happen later. But the story isn't very realistic. Sometimes it is like in a fairy tale, so we can sink into clouds of dreaming. And it's relaxing to read it. All in all we would recommend it everybody. Erika and Drusilla"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre- a book with a story of live. I first saw the film, and that was good for understanding the book better. The book was like the film, natural, sad and a bit romantic. All this experiences whitch Jane had had in her live are written in this book very honest. I think that the writer of this book is a person who knows and understand the problems of people who have a special live. The end and the beginning of this book were very hard and difficult to understand for a normal person. I think the film was better then this book, but it wasn't bad."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre was a very well written book. The book is written by Charlotte Bronte. The book is written in the third person and the author's style is wonderful. Jane is a girl in the beginning and is about five years old. The book explains all about Jane and all of the good and bad events throughout her life. When she becomes a woman, her life gets very exciting and full of adventures.I don't want to give away anything more about the book. I highly recommend Jane Eyre to any young person who has a large vocabulary or has very good dictionary skills, or any adult, so they can understand it. This is certainly a reading challenge, but if you ask anyone who read it, they'll say they loved it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre has always been my favorite story. The relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester is the most intensely moving love relationship I have ever read in a novel. I doubt I will ever come across any as lovely and meaningful again.Jane is an inspiration to many a modern day woman and I would recommend this book be read in high school and it's messages be studied as to their relevance to today.So wonderful a story- so many lessons. I have seen several of the movie versions- my favorite being the A &amp; E version from 1997. The actor who played Mr. Rochester caught his essence perfectly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I loved the movie but this gave so much more to the story than the movie and a deeper explanation of Rochester's character.

Too much French in Villette."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I recently saw the movie Jane Eyre and was tempted to read the book. The movie was beautifully done, but did leave out some very important events that were described in the book. Overall it was a bittersweet love story... A tale of burning down walls figuratively and literally; of allowing ones self to accept truth and love regardless of station; and of knowing ones self above all. Though Bronte does get a bit wordy in her writing (I'm more partial to Emily's writing vs. Charlotte) this is a rewarding story of strength of heart and perseverance of the spirit."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.

The older I get, the more I like it. A real classic. Everyone should read, or 're-read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The first time I was introduced to this book was in college. Back then, I had the attention span of a gnat, so rather than give Jane Eyre a try, I opted for Cliffs Notes. (Yeah, I know ... sacrilege)Anyway, fast forward to now. I finally read it, and my God, what a beautiful piece of literature! The first part outlining young Jane's struggles had me flipping the pages till one in the morning. Then when she got to Thornfield Hall and Mr. Rochester, the page turning didn't stop till at least 3 A.M. I savored every paragraph, every word. It was like crack to me. lolI was so enthralled with this story that I wrote a post on it when I hadn't even finished reading the book! I'd reached a section that moved me so much I had to write about it because of its beauty. It showed the core of just who Jane was as a heroine. Here's a snippet:WARNING .... SPOILERS.........Last night, I read something that really moved me, so much that I must've re-read it three times. It was an introspective passage that poignantly demonstrated the beauty and complexity of Jane's mind. Oh, how I wish my heroines were this self-aware and confident!In discussing her opinion of Blanche Ingram (the gold-digging skank who Mr. Rochester is using to make Jane jealous), our heroine goes into great detail about why she cannot bring herself to be jealous of Miss Ingram. Jane isn't a character in denial. She's a strong, logical, thoughtful and methodical woman, one who knows her own mind. After reading this passage, I realized that although I was over halfway through the novel, I never really knew Jane until that moment.Anyway, while this may be a long excerpt, it's well-worth the read:---------------------------\\"I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me-because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once turn his eyes in my direction-because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady-because I read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her-because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.\\"There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;-the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her.\\"Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character-watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity-this guardedness of his-this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects-this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever- torturing pain arose.\\"---------------------------.....Jane's pain came not from any imagined self-deficiency ... because as far as she was concerned, the pretty Miss Ingram was an empty satin dress---not worthy of jealousy or anything else. Least of all Mr. Rochester. Hence Jane's pain. The mere fact that he would go for a vapid boob like Miss Ingram was the root of Jane's torment.Hard to be jealous of someone you feel is intellectually and spiritually beneath both you and the man you love. This is why I love Jane as a heroine! While not a raving beauty, she has a quiet and unshakable confidence that's very appealing. No wonder Mr. Rochester fell for her.Writers, if you want to see how to create a compelling heroine, look no further. The lesson is in this book!Suffice it to say, Jane Eyre is my all time favorite heroine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I have loved this book every since I first read it back in high school.

I have a collection of old books. I buy them for the age and cover art and then read them. I've heard of Jane Eyre, but have never read it. Its an amazing book. I read it in two days and have been thinking about it every day for the last three weeks.Reading other people's reviews is interesting, but if I hear it's a \\"woman power\\" feminist book one more time I'm going to scream! I'm sorry, I think it's way more advanced and classy than the tired old 1960s woman's movement stuff. If Jane Eyre was a modern feminist, she'd be spending her time trying to knock Mr.Rochester out!If you enjoy Jane Eyre, you should also read 'First Violin' and 'Forever Amber'. They aren't well known, but feature similar gut-wrenching romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I confess it. I bought this copy of Jane Eyre for the cover art.I have always loved the story of Jane Eyre since I was a teen. Everything interested me - the gothic atmosphere, the dark and brooding Mr. Rochester, the mystery of what exactly was locked away in Thornfield...Most of all, I loved Jane as a character. She's not blessed with beauty or wealth, but she is determined to be independant and live her own life. She overcomes hardships, abuse, and grief to live on her own terms. Best of all, she finally does find love. Naturally, that road doesn't run smoothly, but the ending is as it should be.Yes, I have loved Jane Eyre from the very first reading, but never managed to hold on to my own copy. Finally, I decided that I needed to add it to my shelves and started to search for a copy to call my own. One thing that did irriate me were all the various covers of this book. Yes, Jane Eyre is a classic, but I really think all the portraits of women in period garb was overkill. What happened to giving the novel a regular, uncomplicated cover? Honestly, this book is too good to have people turn away because of the \\"classic\\" look. Let's face it - people do judge books based on the covers. Honestly, all the covers I saw of other editions of this novel just flat out annoyed me.I saw this cover and loved it instantly. Superficial? Sure. However, this edition is worth the extra money in my mind. I often loan books to friends and they never want to read the \\"classics\\" because the covers look too old fashioned. If it is old, no one really wants to give the book a chance. Jane Eyre stands the test of time. Not everyone can overcome the sight that is on the surface, so this edition works. (And since the popularity of the Twilight series, other classics have been reprinted with pretty coveres with lovely flowers to draw in younger readers - i.e. Pride and Prejudice and Romeo and Juliet - It is only fair that Jane Eyre gets an upgrade too!)The cover is beautiful and captures the eye. I already know and love the story, but I hope this cover will draw in new readers and create new fans of Bronte's work.I realize many may not really agree with my opinion, but I do get pretty bored of all the classics having to have certain covers that commiunicate the fact that they were written in times past. If a novel stands the test of time, why does that cover art have to be stuck in the past? This particular cover isn't overly modern, but not too period in appearance.I saw the cover, thought it was a beautiful fit for Jane Eyre and had to have it. Now I will concentrate on enjoying re-reading this classic over and over again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I wanted to read Jane Eyre since a long time but couldn't make myself do it. Firstly, because I find classics really difficult to read. Secondly, it's too long. The 490 pages copy I have has very small font and everything is kind of crowded with the next chapter starting on the same page the previous one ends.So when I picked up the book to read I was expecting a very difficult read. But the first 100 pages were a breeze.*contains spoilers*Jane Eyre is an orphan who is living with her aunt, who is not a very compassionate woman, nor are her cousins. She suffers a lot in that house. Jane is a spirited girl, she believes she should be treated fairly and even knows there is injustice in the way her Aunt and her cousins treat her. She also believes in speaking her mind.The Aunt gets tired of her and sends her to an orphanage school at the age of 10 where she spends the next 8 years of her life.' I loved the life she described in the school. This section I found very similar to Anne of green gables. Not that there was anything similar in their circumstances but I found their natures quite similar.\\"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.\\"Jane works for 2 years as a teacher in the same school before she gets bored with the monotony and decides to explore something else. She applies for the post of a governess and gets a letter from Mrs. Fairfax. When Jane reaches there she finds out that Adele, her pupil is Mr. Rochester's ward and Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper.Mr. Rochester is the hero of course. As romance builds up, Rochester proposes to her and on the day of their marriage she finds out that he is already married, albeit to a lunatic. She leaves the house the same night without informing anyone and loses touch with him. She builds a life for herself as a village school teacher and in the end returns to find Rochester blind and his wife dead.What I really liked about the book was that the author seemed to talk to the readers directly. She addresses the readers pulling them into the story very quickly.I found the book a little too descriptive and the language, although very beautiful, very tedious a times.At the very end, when Jane learns of Rochester's ill fate from the manager of the Inn, she decides to go and meet him. I was so excited at this point, I could hardly stay still. I wanted to find out what happened instantly. But again, there were so many descriptions of the path and of the house, I was really irritated.I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.I mean hello? At this point I wasn't really interested in reading about whether there were flowers in the path or not. I was way too impatient and I admit I skipped a lot from that chapter.*****end spoiler******And Rochester? I think he spoke too much. At one point I wanted to say, \`Oh stop talking already'. I thought he was selfish and manipulative. I realized that I will love the book more when I read it for the second time. As I already know the story I won't skip anything and I am sure I will appreciate the language even more.Although I loved the book and although it's supposed to be one of the greatest love stories, Pride and Prejudice is still on top of my list. And Darcy is still the yummiest of all the literary heroes."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"These clothbound Penguin classics are even more beautiful in person!

It is no wonder this tale has been dubbed a classic and remains in popular demand today. It is a wonder to be taken back to a time where people actually stood for their morals and what was right, although this lends to the most frustrating element of the story. The plot between Jane and Mr. Rochester, at its core, is one that subsequent love stories of our time try to emulate (dare I say even the Twilight series borrow from Jane Eyre's sorrow, struggle, and passion). As an avid book reader, this one is placed at the top of my list and in my heart!A true must read for all women!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book is currently my favorite novel. I suggest it to anyone and everyone. Jane Eyre was always so interesting and absolutely never boring. Each part of the novel was so enjoyable to read because I got to experience Jane's experiences and adventures with her simultaneously. The whole novel was so youthful and vivacious. I always was yearning for more. And the characters in the novel were so complex, yet identical to the complexity that each individual possesses. This novel is definitely a classic that is entertaining and well-written. Bronte exhibits a sense of expertise with her writing. I adored her writing stylistically. All of her words flowed so fluidly, which I think was conducive to my strong liking for this novel. In the end, I think that anyone would really find this book as an incredible read. I STRONGLY suggest that this novel is read immediately!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The story is the same, but Dame Darcy's gothic illustrations provide a unique perspective on the characters and scenes, making another read through the timeless Bronte novel a must. If you're a Bronte fan, a gothic fan, or simply a fan of the classics, this book won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's true this book, Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, is extremely boring for the first fifty to seventy pages, but the plot line needs that much set up because it is so difficult. Once one has made it past those pages, hold on for the ride of a lifetime because it is a complicated and complete novel. Charlotte Bront&egrave; is an extremely effective writer. Her explicit detail is apparent after the first page. She carries this aspect of writing throughout the novel in describing both her surroundings and the people she meets. Because of her writing style, one learns more about the characters in this novel than in most modern novels, this enhances the enjoyment and knowledge gained from this book. The detail used in this novel helps make it easier to relate to the main character Jane Eyre. Since this book is written in the first person, it is very important that one is able to connect with the main character who is also the narrator.This novel's plot is so complex that one almost never wants to put it down after those first fifty pages. The setup, though boring, is completely necessary to the rest of the novel and the rest of the plot. The most important parts of the plot are often right after a slow spot in the book. I believe this is just to emphasis these points. Included in a way such as that is the portion near the beginning where Jane stands up to her aunt who she is living with. This part is the beginning of Jane's strong headed and straightforward attitude, which was very uncharacteristic of a woman at the time this novel was written.Also, the time at Lowood Academy when Jane's friend Helen dies of consumption is one of the points in which the novel starts to slow down and an important item is introduced. Jane goes through many changes in atmosphere throughout the novel, some by choice, some not. This gives us more opportunity to relate to her because throughout our lives we all will have to deal with changes in location, surroundings, and relationships. The ways in which Jane reacts to her changes will in one way or another affect us for the rest of our lives. The plot has many different places where it is so entangled both by Jane's feelings and the actions of the other characters. This is to represent the times in our lives where things seem complicated.It is easy to relate to the main character, Jane Eyre, which makes it a good novel to represent our life and take advice from. This is a classic because it has survived the trials and tribulations of time and is still considered an excellent book to take advice from and to learn about what has happened in the live of people of the past. Each of us can step into Jane's shoes at one point or another and see things as she sees them. It makes one feel connected to the novel and understand what is going on much better than a novel which does not have the first person interpretation and emotions in it. Because the narrator is a young girl growing up it is harder for males, such as me, to relate to portions of the novel, though it is just as easy to relate to other portions. Also, because of the difference in time periods, it is harder to relate to exact problems, though the problems can be generalized so as to be more relevant.Overall, this novel is a great work in which many people can receive hours of enjoyment and thought. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is thought to be \\"mature\\" enough to read it with full comprehension because it is a novel that has bearing on many issues both of the mind and of the world."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The day after I watched the 1983 BBC Version of Jane Eyre on video, I went to the library and borrowed the book.

However, it is the dramatic turn in the story that touches the reader most. What does happen in the end to these oh-so-real characters? At times, it seems very unpredictable. The story is worth the time of reading the book. It is unlike any other!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Few people probably need an introduction to this novel, given its popular appeal and long circulation. But some words are needed to explain its importance.At a simple level, the novel is the archetypal 'soap opera'; indeed, one can see virtually every plot found in 'Days of Our Lives' or something similar flowing through this work. But Charlotte Bronte's genius makes this wonderful work so much better than a mere one dimensional soap opera.The protagonist displays a keen intellect, a penetrating psychological understanding of those around her, and amazing powers of description. Whether it is the depressing institution of Lowood, or the passing away of Jane Eyre's childhood friend before her eyes, the scenery, the atmosphere, the emotional power, and the raw beauty of the language shine through.Bronte also makes use of the 'Gothic' element in her novel, particularly in the mysterious, mad wife of Edward Rochester, 'Bertha Mason', a sinister figure who is mad and tries to kill Rochester at every opportunity. The atmosphere in the novel is dark, spooky, and has a strong hint of the supernatural; Eyre's descriptions of the Moon often come into this.The characters themselves (apart from the caricature of Bertha Mason) are also psychologically and morally complex. Eyre pursues her career as a governess and eventually Rochester himself often using dubious means, and Rochester himself is far from a heroic figure. Who is good, or evil? Even the end offers no resolution of this (though Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea suggests Rochester is the nasty one).Although Gothic romances are not my favorite literary genre, this book is worth recommending simply for the sheer genius of the author.Charlotte Bronte, one of the finest novelists in the 19th century realist tradition,"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"When I first read Jane Eyre, I (and I think many others) was taken in by the odd combination of romance and ominous overtones that makes Jane Eyre such a unique book. Of course, the Victorian-era writing and social commentary also made an impression.But upon reflection, underneath all of this is a story of people with difficult lives learning to find and accept each other and hopefully coming to peace and happiness despite long odds. Maybe my second reading just comes from a twenty-first century mind reading things into a nineteenth century book that just aren't there. But to me, the book does have the feel of a modern story of hardship as well as a Victorian story of people trying to overcome their backgrounds to find love.Jane Eyre tells the life story of an orphaned girl sent away to a harsh boarding school by a cruel aunt. Despite the harsh nature of the school, Jane thrived at the school since she is finally out from her aunt's crushing dislike for her. She graduated and took a job as a governess for a girl in the care of a mysterious man who spent much of his time traveling abroad, Mr. Rochester.At first, the two do not like each other. This is compounded by the fact that Jane thinks she is plain looking and not worthy of his company. But the two develop a peculiar friendship, and there are many signs that their feelings are deeper. But Mr. Rochester is busy courting other ladies at the time. Mr. Rochester also seems to have a secret that he will not divulge to Jane but may have serious consequences for her.Jane's job as a governess and the friendship that develops make it seem that the book will quickly become a Jane Austen book (which of course, would not have been a bad thing) in which the man and woman from different classes find love with one another, but from the point of the friendship blooming, Jane Eyre takes a few remarkable twists and turns that I had not expected and that make for real page-turning.But it is as much the quiet desperation of both Jane and Mr. Rochester and their struggle to find each other despite this that makes Jane Eyre a book truly worth reading and treasuring."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read this in order to compare it with JENNA STARBORN, and there's no doubt but that this is the true classic with its Gothic overtones and its portrayal of a strong and independent woman in times not supportive of such strength and independence in women.Many will have difficulty with this book, because it's rich in detail and rich in mood. Today's readers may need patience and understanding to enjoy this. If one relaxes and accepts the book as a portrait of the thinking of the era in which it was written, one can relate it with today's society.Basically, this is the story of a woman guided by her inner values. As such, it's not really a book for guys. On the other hand, it tells of a style of life far from that led by today's high school girls, and therefore takes careful reading.It's classic, and if accepted as a Gothic romance that reveals the thinking and attitudes of the time when written, it's a timeless story that speaks to all."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I have read this book over and over! It is a wonderful novel on the human condition. It gives hope to any who desires to rise above thier station in life. Bronte does a wonderful job depicting each and every one of her characters.

I smelt the musty, stale pipe smoke, observed the dimly lit room, and heard the russle of the ladies starched skirts.For my first attempt at such a novel, I wasn't let down, in fact I was disappointed when the book ended, wanting to stay in the life of Jane Eyre.

While not an especially plausible story, it is moving and thought-provoking. I certainly think it would make for required reading for all teenagers; it delivers an excellent message (IMHO) contrary to what seems an obsession of young(er) people of money, good-looks, and &quot;independence at all costs&quot;.As a slight demerit, Jane Eyre isn't the best written novel. Some of the characterizations are weak, and the novel lacks the powerful prose of the works from George Eliott. And the story is a bit wobbly in the beginning.

Even though the vocabulary is somewhat challenging, it was worth it (even if you need a dictionary:)! I enjoyed reading it because it was well-written. Charlotte Bronte has a way of writing descriptions of characters and dialogue with humor. It's also nice to read a book and to be able to say it was worth reading. It doesn't have unpleasant surprises or unnecessary details of violence. It doesn't dwell on violence, either. Though Jane has a rather depressing time in her early life, she doesn't dwell on being unhappy (She kind of reminds me of Cinderella).

While I fancy myself well read this is one of the \\"classics\\" that I had ignored until my high school age daughter performed the role of Grace Pool in the musical. It so interested me that I decided to read the book and once I started I literally could not put it down. What a fascinating story! Themes of abuse, bitterness, friendship, betrayal, disappointment, integrity, forgiveness, love, etc. The story is full of intricate plot lines and wonderful and memorable characters. By the end of the book you know these people and you are rejoicing, empathizing, laughing and weeping with them. If you have not read \\"Jane Eyre\\" do yourself a favor, turn off the TV, and settle down for a enjoyable and poignant reading experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I ordered this book along with Pride and Prejudice. They are more beautiful in person that in the pictures. Very well made and durable and the paper is thick and high quality so they will hold up even if you read them over and over as I do with my favorites. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite novels. The story is such a wonderful mix of classic romance but with splashes of the dark and supernatural. I highly recommend these gorgeous penguine classics to everybody and I can't wait to order the rest of them for myself."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"On October 16th, of 1847, \\"Jane Eyre: An Autobiography\\", edited by Currier Bell (pseudonym of Charlotte Bront) was published. It created some controversy at the time, as many believed it was written by a man. The novel was very popular when published, but critical reaction to it varied. Today, it is clearly a classic, the development of a young woman, who does not fit into the stereotype of a nineteenth century woman. She is not submissive, and she struggles to avoid being dependent on others. The original publication was in three volumes, but this Penguin Classics edition is based on the third edition of Jane Eyre, and it is the last edition which Charlotte Bront edited and corrected.The story covers Jane's life from her childhood until her marriage. The childhood chapters can be split into two sections, those where Jane, an orphan, was being raised by her Uncle's family, but her uncle has passed away and her aunt does not like her, but was forced to promise to take care of her. The key parts of this section are Jane's being rejected by the closest thing she has to a family, her morality, and her independence, i.e. her refusal to conform. The second part of her childhood is when she is sent to attend a charity school, called Lowood, where the pupils have to make do with substandard food and clothing. Here Jane finds one teacher who treats her, and the other students, well, Miss Maria Temple. One of the key things in this section is the difference between religion and morality, symbolized by Mr. Brocklehurst a clergyman who is mostly responsible for the appalling conditions at Lowood, and Jane and Miss Temple on the side of morality. Also key is Jane's witnessing her friend, Helen Burns, dying from a typhus epidemic, in spite of her goodness and her submission to the standards imposed by Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Scatcherd, a teacher as cruel as Miss Temple is kind.The story then picks up many years later, with Jane in position as a teacher at Lowood, but looking to move on. She advertises for a position as a governess and is hired by Mrs. Fairfax. She is to take care of Ad&egrave;le Varens, a girl who is being taken care of by Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield Manor where Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. This section has a lot to do with class, as well as morality. There is the difficulty of Jane falling in love with someone of a different class. There is also the looking down on Jane as being of a lower class, by Mr. Rochester's peers. The morality questions are here to, in the comparison of the higher classes verses that of the lower class. Even Mr. Rochester's behavior is in question, in the events leading up to Jane leaving. Jane also finds out that she does have family left, and when it appears that she is to have everything, she sends a letter to her father's brother. It is this attempt to reconnect with family that causes her to lose nearly everything as it destroys what she thought she was about to have.The next section details Jane's life after leaving Thornfield Manor. Here she loses almost everything, and is on death's door when she is on the doorstep of Moor House. The Rivers, St. John, Diana, and Mary. It is from this state of having nothing from which she recovers almost everything she could want. Here she recovers her health, she is employed again and regains much of her independence. St. John is in love with a woman, but he will not ask her because he is driven to devote his life to religion. He does find out Jane's true identity though, and this results in Jane learning she has family, and wealth that she didn't know she had. She is pressured by St. John to marry him and join him in his missionary life, but she knows that he doesn't love her. She rejects St. John, and instead goes to find her one love, Mr. Rochester. She now has wealth and family, and she learns that tragedies in Mr. Rochester's life have made what was once impossible possible.It is a long and winding road which Jane travels in this novel. Probably best classified as a gothic romance, it deals with numerous issues and the strength of Jane's character serves as a good role model for young women, and for that matter anyone. The Penguin Classics edition is filled with supporting documentation as always. There is a wonderful introduction by Stevie Davies, along with a Chronology, suggestions for further reading, notes on the text, opinions of the press, and wonderful textual notes which enhance the reading experience and understanding of the reader."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Never being a great fan of the Victorian period of English literature, I have always steered clear of the sisters Bronte, Jane Austin, and others of their ilk. It is amazing how much we miss when blinded by prejudice. I not only liked Jane Eyre immensely, but was very impressed by the literary abilities of Charlotte Bronte and regretted that I had not read the novel sooner. Although Bronte did not have the formal education and did not share the literary traditions enjoyed by some of her male colleagues, she grew up in a household in which storytelling was prominent and understood that the first task of any writer is the ability to tell a good story. Jane Eyre is a wonderful creation, a story that keeps the reader's interest from the first, and one in which Bronte introduces to the reading public one of the first truly modern heroines.Charlotte Bronte's novel is a complex and structured work and contains within it elements of romance, picaresque wanderings and a preoccupation for the Gothic themes of mystery and the supernatural. But to describe the work simply as a very good Gothic novel would be to ignore the remarkable characterization that Bronte achieves in the creation of the character of Jane Eyre. Bronte's character is quite unique when compared to other female heroines of the era. Jane is not beautiful and does not enjoy any of the privileges of wealth or social position, and it is clear from the beginning that if Jane is to make her way in the world she will have to do it with a combination of hard work and intelligence, and not be afraid to question accepted social conventions. The decision of Bronte to narrate the tale through the eyes of Jane bonds the reader and the main character together creating an intimacy that is first rate. We share all her hardships and experiences from Gateshead to the final reunion with Mr. Rochester, and sympathize with her moral dilemmas and her indignant stand against religious hypocrisy (a feeling strong enough to have her expound more fully in the preface to the second edition of her novel: \\"[The world] may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose - to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it - to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but, hate as it will, it is indebted to him\\").Although the creation of the character of Jane is Bronte's greatest achievement, she is possessed with the talent to write a story that is exciting, mysterious and ultimately rewarding - in other words, a pure classic. Bronte may not possess in full the literary style of some of her contemporaries, but she writes with assurance and surprises the reader with some extraordinary passages, beautiful examples that combine nostalgia, religious mysticism and poetic rhythm into a wonderful prose. The influence of the book is still alive over a century later. Jean Rhys uses the novel as the point of departure for her Wide Sargasso Sea, and groups as divergent as Marxists, feminists, and Horatio Alger types all use the book as part of their lexicon."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Let me just be out with it: I love Jane Eyre. It is my mom's favorite novel of all times and definitely in my (constantly changing) top 5. The Dover Thrift Edition is a wonderfully inexpensive way to get wonderful literature into people's hands, so I am pro-Dover, all the way. But to speak to the novel itself, it's a classic that's been remade into films so many times because it is a great story artfully told. Jane is one of my all-time favorite literary characters, and almost definitely my favorite female one. If you hate romance novels which have the prerequisite of a jaw-droppingly beautiful heroine, let me introduce you to Miss Eyre (though if she were alive today, she might insist on Ms.) Jane is described as \\"plain\\" throughout the novel, and this not-terribly-flattering adjective applies to her on several levels (her appearance, her plain-speaking manner, her direct way of dealing with problems). Because of the first-person narration and the abundance of details of her early life, the reader is drawn into a close relationship with Jane, and to know her is to love her. Here is someone I readily admire with her pluck and nerve tempered by a healthy dose of humility. Jane seems like such a real person as we get right inside her thoughts and see her deepest longings, doubts, and fears. To me the most telling scene is (hopefully not too much of a spoiler) when Jane unfavorably compares herself to Mr. Rochester's presumed sweetheart, the beautiful Blanche Ingraham. To cure herself of any flights of romantic fantasy she may be tempted to indulge in over her boss, she forces herself to make two very realistic drawings, one of herself and one of Blanche, and study them closely, hoping to cure herself of the foolish notion that a man might prefer her to gorgeous Blanche. Wow, what a woman! How many of us have the strength of will or character to study our weaknesses in as strong a light as possible in order to disabuse ourselves of notions we fear may be dangerous? Jane certainly doesn't suffer from the too-common (modern?) disease of self-importance, and we see how this, combined with her certain moral compass, guide her to do the right thing(s) even when they are not in any way fun or pleasant. Pick up a copy of Jane Eyre if you haven't read it before and give one of British literature's most interesting creations the chance to win you over."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Some modern readers may find it hard to believe that this little Gothic novel created quite the scandal in its day. The novel is based on an orphan by the name of Jane Eyre, who is raised by her aunt, the cold-hearted and cruel Mrs Reed. Jane's early childhood is one marked by violence and neglect. Early on, however, the readers learn that little Jane Eyre has a fiery spirit that refuses to become a victim of its oppressive enviroment. She boldly lashes out at those who mean to demean her and constantly remind of her station in life.When Jane fondest wish comes true, she leaves behind her wretched existence at Gateshead House and arrives at Lowood school. Jane's life at the orphan boarding school proves just as trying as her time at Gateshead. Behind the walls of Lowood, Jane suffers many privations and witnesses many acts of cruelty. She remains at Loowood for eight years, first as a pupil then as a teacher. Jane's urgent need for change prompts her to seek a position as a governess. She finds such a position at Thornfield Hall, the home of Edward Rochester, who the narrator falls deeply in love with.The character of Jane Eyre is extremely modern. Readers today will have little problem identifying with her thoughts and wishes. Although of low social standing, Jane speaks her mind to those who mean to subdue her. She reminds her aunt of her promise to look after her when she abuses her as a child. She defies the teachers at Lowood. She refuses to become Mr Rochester's mistress. Jane choses her own happiness over what is expected of her, not a very attractive quality in women in Victorian society, but one modern readers can sympathize withCharlotte Bronte used several personal life experiences as inspiration for this novel. Like Jane, Charlotte attended a boarding school, where she experienced many of the tribulations Jane suffered. The death of Helen Burns at Lowood from tuberculosis was inspired by the death of her sisters Elizabeth and Maria, at The Clergy Daughter's School from the same disease. Jane Eyre is one of the best classics. It's dark and tragic, yet emotional and even amusing at times. Definitely one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"JANE EYRE is a novel of destroyed conventions. At nearly each and every turn within its pages, there is some rule, some assumption of character and plot destroyed. In JANE EYRE, women fight back against tyrannical husbands, governesses \`look above their stations', mothers are absent and men are punished for their subjugation of women. Not content to only poke at society through the safety of a fictional character, Bronte also confronts literary conventions, constructing JANE EYRE as a Bildungsroman about a WOMAN, and an UNATTRACTIVE woman to boot. Is nothing sacred? NO. And this is what makes JANE EYRE such a wonderful read. Looking for just great wit, nascent feminism and in general a pretty good story addled with a few boring inanities about day-to-day life? Go buy a Jane Austen novel. JANE EYRE is nearly the antithesis of orderly Austen, a passionate display of feelings and emotions that would have made Austen's EMMA blush, a full-blown rebellion against the societal constraints upon women.\\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties...they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves...\\" Within these few scathing lines is contained almost the entire sociological crux of the novel. For Jane, though outwardly calm as \\"women are supposed to be\\", is often raging inside at various acts of injustice perpetrated upon her. Sometimes she releases her feelings and vents, other times she swallows it \\"as women are supposed to\\" do. At this period of time, women in the upper class were mostly ornaments. When men spoke of their accomplishments, they meant things like a woman's ability to speak French, or her grace while playing a piano. Her business acumen would most likely not be counted an accomplishment, but a detraction, a manifestation of too spirited a personality, or too lively a mind. Hopeful mammas made sure that their little girls learned all the correct dances, could play an instrument and sing, or embroider, NOT complete ledgers. Bronte is urging that her fellow women not be confined to the pursuit of such activities, but allowed to exercise their minds and emotions in whatever direction they might want to...and in 1841!It's a wild ride that never ceases to be entertaining. Don't miss JANE EYRE."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. I mean what more could a girl want out of a book. ...

Her reading voice is pleasant and natural-sounding and she conveys just the right amount of emotion. She also manages to vary the tone of her voice just enough that can differentiate between characters but not so much that she sounds foolish.The only drawback to this audio book is that it is recorded on two tracks. That means you have to listen to each tape twice, setting it either to the full right or full left speaker of your stereo. Although this does cut back on the number of tapes, I didn't like having all the sound come from one side of my car."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"In, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; it is obvious to tell that the author, Charlotte Bronte is the sister of Emily Bronte. The dark tone and twisted love story are all to analogous traits of Emily's Bronte's story, &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; Much like Charlotte, Jane is an unattractive girl, who grows up in a school for girls where the accomidations are all but comfortable. She grows to be very inteligent, however, is not the most sought after girl in England. She becomes a governess for a man named Mr. Rochester. Jane is in love with Mr. Rochester, but his dark secrets and overbearing temper are almost too much for Jane to live with. Of all the Bronte books, Jane Eyre is among the finest. The relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester is interesting and encapturing, but the life of Jane, and her triumphs are far more compelling. Jane Eyre is a classic, that should be read at least once, if not more, by every girl who is searching for a place in this world. The expierences Jane has on her road to becoming a woman are a very interesting reflection of Charlotte Bronte's encounters. Perhaps this is what makes the story so interesting?!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"To be honest, I haven't read many classics, but this is by far my favorite book ever. I was assigned to read it for school and am now completely obsessed. I have three different copies of the story, but my first copy was this cover.What makes this book endurable and able to plow through for the first one-hundred-thirty pages and then keep reading for the next three-hundred-forty-one is the characterization. You love Jane, you hate Mr. Brocklehurst, and I don't know about anybody else, but I loved Mr. Rochester, Helen Burns, and Diana and hated St. John Rivers and Mrs. Reed. All characters stir feelings of either love or hate in you. This truly is the first, and the best, soap opera in the world!I was told by some that they thought the ending lacked - ha ha! The ending couldn't have been better in my opinion. I, personally, didn't see it coming. When Jane was actually contemplating marrying St. John Rivers, I openly yelled \\"No! No! You can't marry him! You love Mr. Rochester whether he's married to a lunatic or not! Don't marry the moron! He's forcing you into it!\\"This book evoked emotions from me I've never gotten before while reading a book. It evoked emotions I never even got watching a movie. Well, maybe it did, only they were excrutiatingly amplified. It was painful to read of Jane leaving Thornfield, even more painful to watch this self-respecting woman beg for food, and yet uplifting to read of her scorning St. John's idea of love and Mrs. Fairfax's label of \\"beggar.\\"All in all, whether you're assigned to read it or not, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is overly well worth its 461 pages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Dear Anti-Bronte readersI beg you, don't review the books that you read in English class. I noticed that you tend to get to be prejudiced against the book... What do you mean that it's a child's foolery? What do you mean that the author had nothing better to do? Do you know that Bronte was very ill from the beginning of her life and the literature was the only thing that could keep her going up to her short life? Do you know that her beautiful symbolisms and enormous passion for life, let aside the unique plot and attractive characters, reflect her deep understanding of history and literature? She is a thoroughly educated and intelligent author. Her conversations are deliberately yet unconsciously designed. A choice of a word, a sentense is one by one patient, full of love, and &quot;complete beauty, like a Greek statue of Apollo...

I just decided to buy it on impulse really, not knowing what I was getting myself into. I opened the book and was immedeately swept into Jane Eyre's world. My mind played out all of the scenes as I read, only a truly masterful piece of work could create images so strongly right from the start. Charlotte Bronte creates a masterful work of art on the pages of this book.When the book begins, you are taken into Jane's childhood, and given a sense of what it's like to have no love, and no hope of the future. You can actually see the pain on Jane's face. Then at Lowood, you learn with her, and grow with her. Finally, on the night she arrives at Thornfield Hall you are overcome with anticipation for Jane. What is this life going to be like? Then when Edward Rochester appears, you hate him. You can't believe that he talks to her that way. After a while though, things soften, and Miss Bronte introduces a new feeling. Love. The painting seems complete when Jane and Mr. Rochester confess their feelings, and you wonder, what could possibly be better than this? The ending,(which I won't give away)is absolutely breathtaking. I cried for a half an hour when I read it. It was at four in the morning mind you,(the book was so good I could not put it down.)The characters in the novel are whole, they seem like real people. Charlotte Bronte uses her pen to paint a wonderful picture, one can not help but be engulfed in the color. The book has lasted almost 200 years, I see no reason why it could not last forever. If you ever want to read a classic love story that defines the power of women in literature, then Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is it. I'm 16 years old, and if a teenager can be moved to tears while reading, it must be quite a piece of literature. I walked away feeling like I had taken an amazing journey, and found a new friend in Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic of English literature and, although it's easy to see why, I do feel the author missed some opportunities to make this very good book even better.The character of Jane Eyre is a very believable and sympathetic protagonist. No, she's not perfect, as a child or as an adult, and this is all to the the good. She is warm and caring with a tremendous capacity for love to which, understandably, she's afraid to give free rein.Jane's years as a child, both with her relatives and at school, are interesting, but only to a point. They seemed to drag and I was so glad when she finally graduated and the story &quot;really began.&quot;It was during the middle section of the book, during Jane's time in Mr. Rochester's employ, that I felt Bronte missed several good opportunities to &quot;up&quot; both the suspense and the reader's interest. For example, we learn too quickly who Mrs. Rochester is and why she does the things she does. I think Bronte should have built this section up more slowly.After Jane leaves the Rochester estate, her meeting with her &quot;new&quot; family is extremely far-fetched. I know, readers weren't as demanding in Bronte's day as they are now, but still, I thought this was the weakest section of the book and the least interesting by far.Overall, I think &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that clearly showcases the class distinctions of the times. This is particularly evident in the early chapters, when Jane is still a child and in the chapters that take place during her employment in the Rochester household.&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that's dated, of course. Times change and reading tastes do, too. If one keeps this in mind, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; should prove to be both a memorable and enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Have you ever wanted someone to notice your personality instead of focusing on your outer appearance? If so, then you can relate to the title character in Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte. Jane, a plain but spirited governess, falls in love with her arrogant employer, Mr. Edward Rochester.Alas, Jane has a bitter rival, the beautiful and accomplished, Baroness Blanche Ingram. As Jane teaches Adele, Mr. Rochester's illegetimate ward, she gains the notice of St. John, a missionary. This classic takes you through her life- from governess to heiress.If you like a challenging read, you will definately enjoy Jane Eyre. This book is highly recommended to young adult readers. This novel is full of advanced vocabulary and even French conversations! But you don't have to be bilingual to love this remarkable story.This classic has an emontional and romantic voice. Jane is very much in love with Mr. Rochester, as you can see by this quote: &quot;[He] was becoming to me, my whole world; almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.As you can see, Jane Eyre is a complicated novel, but worth the time it takes to read it. This classic, once published under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, will make an excellent addition to any young reader's personal library."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Oh, how Jane Eyre was such a boring read!

I was always waiting for something exhilarating to occur, but itnever did. If Jane Eyre does seem interesting, I suggest renting themovie, it isn't half bad because many of the tedious parts of the novelwere cut out.

Charlotte Bronte makes ghosts seem dull and spirits and fairies positively mind-numbing. All of Jane Eyre's encounters are couched in a style thats drier and staler than moldy bread. Fire? Murder? wild spirits? its all here. But none of it is the least bit worthwhile to read.In the end, we have a heroine that has wandered from place to place and eventually settles down ith her past love, Rochester, once he has 'redeemed' himself by his courage in trying to save his mad wife (in the attempt he loses his sight and an arm).In typically fairy tale fashion, Rochester gains his sight back. I have a suspicion that he would have grown another arm if we gave hima few more years.The book that Jane Eyre reminds me most of is 'The Scarlet Letter'. If anything, this is more boring.This dull, mind-numbing book is about as entertaining as watching fungus grow. The fact that its riddled with 'deep symbology' makes it not one bit more interesting."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Excuse me? Is this edition a joke?I enjoyed Jane Eyre quite thoroughly, and I will not summarize the plot here. It has been done elsewhere. This review concerns this particular edition.Perhaps I might be harsh, but it looks to me as if Dame Darcy paid a fifth grader to do the illustrations in this book. She could use some serious formal training. Perhaps she was attempting to capture some type of gothic element in her illustrations, but these poor, poor drawings do not enhance (in fact they serve as a detriment to) the beautiful language of charlotte bronte's work. They really are quite terrible, heavy-handed drawings; Darcy really should bruch up on her pen work.Perhaps they were executed under serious time constraints? Perhaps all she had access to were cheap bic pens and a half used crayola water color set? Perhaps Penguin books was looking for an illustrator to do these illustrations for dirt cheap and she?

This novel was one of the finest of its time and what made it all the more incredible was that it was written by a woman. Charlotte Bronte and her sisters, the Brontes, were British women who grew up in Yorkshire, the English countryside. To kill time when they were bored in the domestic and boarding-school ambiance, they wrote great works of literature. It's a must read for young women, but also for men and young males (preferably in the high school or college level) Jane Eyre is ultimately a literary novel and only a literary-minded intellectual can truly enjoy it for the masterpiece that it is. It ranks among the greatest works of English fiction, taking its place with the other male greats- Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. Curl up, warm up some tea or coffee, put on some mood music and read this incredibly engaging book. In this edition, we get commentary and preface by noted scholars.Jane Eyre has been scrutinized time and again. It is understood by many that the heroine Jane is Charlotte Bronte herself. It's partially autobiographical in some portions- Charlotte Bronte did grow up in lowly conditions and was in boarding school that was cold and freezing. Charlotte did love a married man who was older than her, though nothing came of it of course. Jane Eyre, a feisty, spirited young orphan, is taken away from her home where her wicked aunt and cousins mistreat her. She is taken to a boarding school for girls until she comes of age. She lands a job as a governess for the eccentric and mysterious Mr. Rochester, who is hardly ever at home and takes care of his daughter Adele, teaching her to read and write, etc. But the mystery surrounding Mr. Rochester's past becomes a present reality in Jane Eyre's own life. Furthermore, Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre fall in love. A novel that is inspired by Gothic fiction, it is strewn with Gothic, supernatural and suspenseful atmosphere and symbolism. The tree that is struck by lightning is a warning for Jane Eyre to leave Mr. Rochester's mansion, the strange cries in the attic later turn out to be Mr. Rochester's first wife, the crazed Bertha. A fire destroys the mansion and Mr. Rochester ends up diabled and blind. Bittersweet though the ending is, Jane Eyre and the blind Mr. Rochester marry and live happily, after much water under the bridge. This novel is a long read and should take up at least a whole summer, but it's very worth reading. It's a classic. Time and again, it will appear on the list of reading material for high school and college courses. And a bit of advice- dont' just read it to pass a class, get into the story. You will score even more points."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The novel is about a cheap gal called Jane Air who is out looking for the perfect guy to marry, one with a tonne of cash.

If you are confident in yourself and your abilities, then you will succeed in carrying out a happy and successful life much like Jane Eyre.

The \\"I heard your voice in the wind\\" stuff is a little hard to swallow. (Sorry if that was a spoiler! Still read the book because there are some true heart-pounding moments!) Jane Eyre was actually quite enjoyable to read and I'm glad that I took the time to read it. I like her character: She's not beautiful, but she's a solid and determined woman and I like that her inner beauty overcomes her physical plainness. She's a role model for young girls! She overcomes adversity with strength and determination and has an accurate moral compass. She follows her inner voice and she's rewarded for it.

When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Jane Eyre. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I went between applauding Jane's high morals and commitment to yelling at her for being such a doormat.As I was reading the story, I asked my husband, \\"Was it really like this in Europe back then? Super rich people and super poor people and no in between?\\" It makes for a good story of a girl thrown into a charitable facility/orphanage, going out on her own, falling in love, and staying true to her feelings. The ending was warm and fuzzy.The gist of the story is girl gets abused, sent to an orphanage, succeeds as a teacher and when she turns 18 ventures out to be a governess, falls in love, is gilted, ventures out again, finds relatives, and then . . . well, I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's a good read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I decided to read the book after seeing the 1996 movie version. I heard that the 2011 rendition was great and I wanted to have more insight before reading it. After seeing the movie and loving it, I didn't think the book could get any better.The book starts out with Jane Eyre in her youth. She lives with her aunt and cousins. Unlike families should be, they mistreat her and are abusive to her. Her aunt, claiming that she is a wicked child, sends her to a catholic school. If you thought things were going to get better, you thought wrong. She is still mistreated and shunned by the residents of the school. Jane Eyre grows to be a woman of strong opinions and independence. In adulthood she does not grow to be a woman that is handsome, in fact she is very plain. But she believes that intellect and personality are what really make a person. When she advertises as a governess, she is immediately answered. She arrives at her place of occupation and begins well enough. There are strange things that occur in the house however, for instance, strange laughing and disappearance of objects. It's troubling, but she hardly minds it. After some time, Jane begins to become closer to the master of the house, Mr. Rochester. He's mysterious and different. But in the end, will it be for nothing?The narration and the way the character conducts herself is what really makes this such an incredible read. It's a very unique style in which the book is written. The words are very fluid and it wasn't at all a difficult read. I was stunned with the beauty of the book and how much I loved the book.

The romantic in me was just spellbound by the intensity of Rochester and Jane's love for one another.

This book doesnt fade, the magic doesnt get dated, the story is never old, and oh my goodness--I STILL hate her aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"\\"I need not sell my soul to buy bliss\\"Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \\"Gone with the Wind\\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read this book in junior high school and, like so many other girls, fell head over heels in love with Mr. Rochester; after all this time, the book is still a terrific read. The first part is classic Cinderella with an interesting twist. Jane is an orphan who is abused and mistreated by her rich and evil stepmother and her nasty cousins; unlike Cinderella, Jane stands up age age 10 and fights back. She is promptly shunted off to a school for girls from poor families, where she spends the next eight years. Needing a change of scene and environment, she answers an advertisement for a governess and enters the household of Mr. Rochester. Rochester, however, is no Prince Charming; he's 17 or 18 years older than Jane, hard, bitter, cynical, selfish, and, unknown to all but a few, encumbered with a wife who is the prototype of the \\"mad wife in the attic\\". Rochester is a romantic at heart, however; he is captivated by Jane's innocence and simplicity.Many years' distance from junior high school has led me to re-think the entire creation of Mr. Rochester. When all is said and done, he's a very curious romantic hero. In fact, this guy is a world-class jerk. What kind of \\"hero\\" would deliberately try to trap an innocent young girl into a sham marriage? He makes all kinds of rationalizations to himself that his Maker will understand and approve of what he's doing, but come on, now, who is he kidding? Imagine an alternative plot line midway through the book: Jane doesn't write to her uncle in Madeira, so he remains ignorant of the planned wedding. He doesn't send anyone to England to prevent it, so the wedding goes off as scheduled. Five years and two or three children later, Jane finds out about Rochester's first marriage. Can you imagine how she would feel? Her marriage is a sham and her children are illegitimate. What would she say? How would she react? And how would Mr. Rochester feel knowing he had brought this calamity on her by his own selfishness? I don't know about war, but all is definitely not fair in love. Mr. Rochester is a selfish ess-oh-bee.Anyway, the alternative never happened an we all know how the book really comes out so there is no sense in rehashing the plot; suffice to say that Bronte is a marvelous storyteller. The one problem I really have with Jane Eyre is the same that arises in Bronte's other books, and that is her stifling insularity; she seems unable to find value in anything that outside her own narrow, English Protestant frame of reference. However, this is a small caveat in this book. \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a classic romantic novel that has entranced generations of readers and looks good for generations to come, flawed hero and all.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I first read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; when I was entering my sophomore year in high school. I was so fascinated by the beautiful language, expressing the love between Jane and Edward Rochester. I love Edward so much, because he is human. He is depressed with his life, and wishes for another. He searched for another, taking any and every risk he needs to...even adultery or bigamy. His love for Jane is deep and real, as is her love for him. This classic hasn't lost it's details, details about hope, love, and dreams, in the some 150 years since it's been published. I still enjoy it, even after reading it about 100 times!!~ I consider it the greatest love story ever written.....a story that defies the stuffy rules and regulations of 19th century England. It just shows that love can be more powerful than anything. With that, I give this story 5 stars....only wishing I could give it all the stars in the world. Why? Because it deserves that!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Come along all you romance readers and enjoy the best love story by the greatest writer of all time. Powerful and realistic characters that will take you on a journey to a special place and time. All women should read this heart tugging story and dream of such a romance for themselves. Loved every word of Jane's book!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read this book in high school because 'I had to', it was required reading. I hated it. But when I got older, and could read at my own pace and place, the book is one of the best mysteries ever written. I can't imagine going to a horrible school like Lowood, but perhaps that was preferable to living with her Aunt Reed, a most disagreeable person even unto her death. I cried when she and Mr. Rochester could not get married because of the 'house secret'. She seemed to have such a hard life anyway, that was icing on the cake, or de-icing if you will. The book flowed smoothly and I even managed to get past the 'true English'. I've always had trouble reading English writers, but Charlotte Bronte is an exceptional writer. I like when she addresses her audience, &#34;Reader, you would not believe this but...&#34;, etc. As I said it's a great mystery, and autobiography, but I don't want to say more to spoil the story! Chance it to say, if you've only read the book because, 'you had to', read it again in a new light. I'm taking all of the books I read in my English classes that were 'necessary to read', and giving them a second go-round. This one was definitely worth it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is a classic for a reason. I had trouble putting it down. I highly recommend it. A wonderful story.

The novel Jane Eyre has withstood the test of time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Concerning on English classic novels \`Jane Eyre' has a special place in my heart. This was the very first classic novel that I ever read in English. As I needed that for an exam, and didn't have enough knowledge for reading the original I was supposed to read an abridged version. And so I did. And I loved the book.Years later, I decided to read the real thing, the original novel. Much to my surprised it turned out to be highly accessible, and as entertaining and a nice read as the abridged version. Moreover, in the original book I could find all the details, and were able to savor Charlotte Bront's language.Written more than 150 years ago, \`Jane Eyre' reads as fresh as a XXI Century novel. Bront's use of language is vivid and remarkable. Her descriptions bring the book into life. We cannot forget that the book is the social portrait of the women in the writer's society. It shows how they struggled --and failed most of the time-- to reach a respectable position in the society.Jane didn't have any attractive that was required in her time. She wasn't rich or even beautiful, although smart. But smartness wasn't a good thing for a woman in those days. She is even punished for having brains. She ends up being a governess, and end up having a humiliating experience, being forced to change places and even name. Ms Eyre is only noticed when she receives a heritage and becomes rich. And she does not let all she has suffered affect her.\`Jane Eyre' is a novel ahead its time. This book is about feminism much before the term was created. When Jane speaks to her aunt about her rights --can you imagine a girl speaking about her rights in that time-- she is doing what other women would do years later. Charlotte Bront has managed to creat a strong and sad girl, who is trying to find her place in the world. With that, the writer made a book that will be read for generations to come --even if they read an abridged version before reading the unabridged book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book, like my title says, was hard for me to put down. I just became so inthralled in the book and its characters.You become, early on, compassionate to Jane's pain, hopeful with Jane's encounter with Mr. Rochester, afraid for her when she meets with a ghastly face, and so on and so forth.At times I almost didn't want Jane with Mr. Rochester, but in the end he won me over. Their love is unique, it was very nurturing and longing, but love nonetheless.I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story with a little suspense all throughout."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I have read this book several times, on differentoccasions, and ech time I've enjoyed it immensely.This is one of those classic stories that will stay with youforever. It appears simple on the surface, but underneath itare well-thought out passages.Bronte is a superb artist, weaving her two main characters, each suffering in their life, into a tapestry of love. Each so different from each other, yet each needing the otherdesparately.I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"First of all, I would just like to say that Jane Eyre is most likely a good book for all those bookworms out there. I am postive that you will not be disappointed with this book if you like classical and dramatic novels. Yes, the novel may seem to be a little long, but it keeps you interested and guessing to the very end. Don't get me wrong, it is not some book that is a mystery. Although, the end is very unpredictable and I had no idea which path Jane Eyre was going to take.When I opened the first few pages of this book, I must admit that I was questioning whether or not this was going to bea dull and drab story. It seemed as though this might be a challenging book to be able to finish. Although, after some questioning, the plot took a turn for the better. The story really started to pick up as I began to enter the life of the orphan, Jane Eyre. The uninteresting beginning was well worth reading because the story was really good.This story begins with Jane Eyre living with her mean Aunt Reed and cruel cousins. She goes through awful torments like being locked up in a dark room all night. The beginning of the story kind of reminded me of the enchanting story of Cinderella. Jane is then sent off to school all alone in the world to become a well-educated lady. She thinks she begins to find happiness there, but some awful things happened. She then goes to Thornfield Hall to try to be a teacher. She actually ends up falling in love with her master, Mr. Rochester. Jane once again begins to feel that everything is going well and that she actually might have found true happiness. Jane and Mr. Rochester are then about to be married when an awful secret is revealed about Mr. Rochester. Jane then has to figure out whether to stay with her one and only true love or just move on to a different life and forget that all of this happened. Jane then does take a small journey away from Thornfield to find out where to go from there.I found that this book contained mystery, drama, romance, andeverything else a person could ask for in a book. This book is the type of book that you would want to take and curl up in bed and just keeping reading it to the very end. There was great detail about the life that Jane Eyre and all the feeling she felt were revealed to the reader. I seemed to really be part of the story and sometimes forgot where I was. There were also some amazing twists in the story that kept me guessing about who did that or why is that women so suspicious. There was also many characters that kept the story alive and interesting. Although, once and awhile it did seem as though the story was confusing. Things were being said and I was not quite sure who was saying them and places I was not quite sure what was going on. Although, with some of this negativism, everything else made up for it. All and all, it was a really good book. For me, it seems to reflect back on today's life. All Jane was doing was trying to find acceptence, love, and happiness. It seems at this day an age, that all people are trying to do is find true love and someone to be there. For this reason, I think that many of you would really love this book and read it. The novel is well worth the reading. I am sure that once you began the story that you will just want to keep reading it to find out if Jane really does find what she is looking for and if she finds true happiness. Now it is you turn to go to your library and check out this great classical novel that you are just going to love.The grade I would give this book would be about a low grade A because sometimes it was confusing. Highly recommended for people who like drama and romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Reading Jane Eyre for the first time, I was engulfed in the novel itself: the characters, the plot, and the setting completely draw the reader's attention and make it difficult to put down. The second time, I read it slower, paying special attention to the characterization, something Charlotte Bronte is terrific at, and the various details that I may have overlooked originally, but which add to the general enjoyment of the novel. The third time, I read Jane Eyre for the language - Bronte's style is captivating: every word, every sentence has a beauty within it that a reader wouldn't want to miss. I read it, again and again, because her words made everything seem new and exciting no matter how often I read them. The explicit descriptions, the prolonged narration, the time she takes to develop the charaters - everything creates a novel that one can read over and over. This truly classic work of literature appeals to so many different emotions and strikes the fancy of probably anyone who can appreciate great writing."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"A love story that will never change.

Mr. Rochester, a sardonic, bitter man, accepts Jane as governess to his ward; from there their feelings begin to develop for each other. Mr. Rochester is not the conventional hero (one might even imagine him to be an ugly man), which makes the tale more believable (and thankfully steers it away from bodice-ripping romantic territory).All in all, this is a great book with the usual plot twists, reversals, and character revelations one would expect from its genre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"After reading this story, I feel safe and sound, a large genuine feeling. Because this story is so sweet, not only from the love story of Eyre and Rochester is delightfully fresh, also I learn a lot from Eyre, she is strong, brave, independence, honest and friendly, I think she is a public notice of nowsday's women.Eyre is a orphan whrn she was a child, but she never give up herself, I think many of Hong Kong people must study from her strong and face to their life, after reading this book, they might have some encouragement.The most touching part of the story is the love story.I think it is wonderful! Eyre and Rochester have many of wave, althrough their love is not allow from those common people and Eyre once wanted to give up her love, but Rochester still love her deeply, I feel thouched after reading this book.This book tell us what the true love is, I have learn a lot from it and I really love it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book stinks.

Jane Eyre is a great character."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I have reread this book countless times, starting after I first discovered it as a teen. It is a masterful piece of storytelling and the classic romance novel. I hope purists aren't offended by that classification, but Bronte's novel has all the traditional elements of a romance novel -- the meet, the attraction, the obstacles, the Black Moment, the reunion, the HEA (happily ever after) -- wrapped in beautiful writing and characterizations.Although this book has been popular through the ages, it seems to fall in the shadow of the other Jane today. That is, the author Jane Austen, whose works are told and retold in every conceivable way. I sometimes wonder if Austen gets a lot of glory today because she is perceived as a more intellectual read while EYRE is a big, fat, juicy Gothic romance. So unfair if that is true. Bronte's story is clever and intelligent, but also passionate and emotional.If anyone's interested, I've written a book inspired by JANE EYRE but set in old Hollywood.

This book shows a wide range of human experience. I do not think that Jane has to prove anything simply because she is &#34;plain&#34;. I also don't think that Charlotte Bronte had anything to prove.

I wanted someone to love me like that one day!I love how she was able to stand up for herself to Mrs. Reed her cruel aunt, the evil Mr. Brocklehurst, her self-righteous and controlling cousin St. John, and even her beloved Mr. Rochester when he would have her go against her moral fiber.It was wonderful to learn more about Charlotte and her life and how much shows up in her novel.

Susan Ericksen narrates the audio book and the listening experience was something I looked forward to on my daily commute. The narrator had an excellent speaking voice and sounded just like what I would have expected from Jane Eyre. Her characterizations of the other characters were not as dramatic as I would have liked, though she did a good job with the \`master'. I'm getting used to good characterizations since it makes it easier to follow who is speaking. Overall, I would rate the audio book at 4.5 stars instead of 5 due to the characterization issue.The story itself is wonderful. The main characters are very likeable despite their flaws. It's fun to see the main characters be rather homely instead of amazingly good looking as is common in many novels. It is a beautiful love story and shows strong integrity in Jane.

Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \\"Gone with the Wind\\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator (Josephine Bailey) was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S.

I truly cared about what happened to her which I haven't been able to do with books I've read. Rochester's and Jane's love was deep and pure and I loved watching them go through the process of falling in love. It wasn't an OMG-I-don't-know-anything-about-you-but-I-love-you-like-crazy thing that I've been reading lately. It was slow but sure and so very sweet. Their difference in age was strange to me at first, but as time went on I found myself not caring. Love really knows no bounds.I love this book. It is definitely near the top of my favorite books.

Jane Eyre, orphaned at a very young age, suffers at the hands of her aunt and cousins when her maternal uncle dies. At the age of ten, she is sent to a charity boarding school, where her life is also filled with privation until an outbreak of typhus exposes the austere measures imposed by the manager of the school. At the age of eighteen, she leaves the school to become a governess to Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester's ward, Ad&egrave;le. Here, Jane seems to find happiness: beneath Mr Rochester's moody exterior, there appears to be kindness and perhaps even love? But further events may destroy her chance at happiness.The use of words that seem to be nowadays obsolete, such as: unclose (doors etc); undraw (curtains); undeceive; benignant; show how much can change in a language in a mere 200 years.

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield.

Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood.

It is arranged for Jane to be sent to Lowood School, a boarding school fifty miles away. At Lowood, the food is scarce, living conditions are poor, and they have no coats or mittens to keep them warm. Typhus plagues the school, killing Jane's only true friend, Helen. Jane's academics thrive, and after six years she takes the place of a teacher. Two years later Jane places an ad in the Herald, which is answered by a single letter. Jane travels 16 miles to find that she is the new teacher to Edward Rochester's foster child. By the second month she is there, Jane comes to be quite fond of her pupil, Adele Varens, and she is beginning to be aware of how she cares for Mr. Rochester. As she spends more time at Thornfield, Jane's affection for Rochester deepens, as he pursues Blanche Ingram. Jane leaves Thornfield shortly to visit Mrs. Reed, her dying aunt. Mrs. Reed confesses that John Eyre, Jane's uncle has been trying to locate her, but Mrs. Reed discouraged him. She then dies, unloved by even her daughters. Jane returns to Thornfield and is immediately proposed to by Rochester. During their wedding ceremony, Mr. Briggs stands up and proclaims that Mr. Rochester is already married. Jane is then shown to the third floor of Thornfield, where Bertha Mason Rochester, Rochester's wife is locked away. Jane flees Thornfield and uses all her money for transportation. She finds herself reduced to begging and is invited into the home of St. John Rivers, a minister. She recuperates from the trauma in her life under the care of him and his two sisters Mary and Diana. Jane accepts a job as a teacher in a local school. She soon discovers that John Eyre has left her with 20,000 pounds, which she openly shares with St. John and his sisters. St. John proposes to her but Jane repeatedly refuses; she does not love him. In turning down St. John she realizes she is still in love with Rochester. She gets news that Bertha Rochester jumped off the roof and killed herself during a fire that blinded her husband. Jane heads to Ferndean, Rochesters present home, and they reunite and plan to marry. The next time we hear from Jane again is ten years later. Rochester has regained sight in one eye and they have a newborn son. This book ends on a happy note with Jane telling us how contented she is with her present life.I found this book to be extremely thought- provoking. We see the trials and tribulations of a young girl who goes through so many hardships yet comes out a better person each time. I gave this book a five star rating because it expressed the life of a truly amazing young woman in a truly amazing way."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I was shocked to see that many of the people who reveiwed this book gave it one star. It took me two days to read this book. I could'nt put it down! Jane is so down to earth and she refuses to feel sorry for herself, and do what she wanted to do the light of what others would suffer if she did. Her devoted love to Rochester was touching. When she discovered his sad secret, she did not follow her own fleshly desires, but left for the good of her lover, heartbroken, yet triuphant in knowing that she'd done what was right.

Unlike other books Jane Eyre is a book about intelligent decision making and moral. I feel that this book deserves another look at I hope that others will enjoy reading it as much as I do. By Heather Beers"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the most beloved books ever written. Before I had read it, I attributed this to the many movies made of the plot, because I did not think a novel written in formal style by an author often paired with Jane Austen would appeal to the general public. I read it. It was as formal as expected, but different. There was imagination here, like a butterfly on a string, and the contents were Truth. Real Truth is interesting and thought-provoking no matter how presented. The style is a lot like Jane herself: a passionate, creative, romantic young woman, though shy and refined, introspective, rather plain, well brought-up and having strict, if select, morals. This may be in part due to the fact that the novel is written in first person, with Jane narrating. Jane is an incredible character; every word, every action, every thought makes sense, enhances and makes more real her being. All of the characters in Jane Eyre are this detailed, and all are completely different from the others, lending comparison essential to the reader's opinion of each, and of what Jane should do. Although some find the dialogue a bit improbable and fancy -- that no one speaks that way in real life -- I only had problems with that when acting it out. Admittedly, dialogue is at times long and too polished to be spontaneous, but the content of the spoken words makes up for it, and this type of dialogue does not dominate the entire book. Rapid, witty exchanges are just as common.The plot is original and dramatic; keep in mind that Jane Eyre in Ms. Bronte's day might be like Stephen King or Danielle Steel in our day. Jane Eyre is, essentially, a masterpiece soap opera, though a very elegant and refined one. It is a story of characters afflicted and tortured by the rules of society and the self-deprivations of morality and piousness. It is melodramatic and emotional, but not to the point of sogginess; crisper, tenser parts balance the sentimentalism. Suspense begins right away, but continues with something of a snowball effect, reaching its height near the end -- but this is only my opinion; many disagree with me. The one fault with the plot (I had no complaint, but it is my way to accept everything in a good book as Law) may be the frequent coincidences. Giving examples would spoil it for those who haven't read the book, but all contribute majorly to the plot, and all just cross the line between probability and unlikeliness. Critics have softened their accusations with the fact the Ms. Bronte believed in her coincidences, and had likely seen them happen.As a writer, Ms. Bronte is an virtuoso. She uses nearly every tool of the trade: extensive foreshadowing, including prophetic dreams, false suspects, symbolism, effective tense shifting, character analysis from a single point of view, and so much more. It is no surprise that the manuscript of Jane Eyre was accepted and published overnight, and became an immediate success. It is still a success a century and a half later, and as fresh and tangible as it always was. Reading Jane Eyre is an experience you cannot deprive yourself of. I would begin today."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a beautifully written masterpiece! Bronte uses eloquent language to convey a timeless love story.

If you say &quot;I read that in high school&quot;I urge you to read it again - this time by choice - and Iassure you, you'll be as swept away as I was!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"At first glance, this book seems like the story of a lower class woman winning the heart of a rich and of a higher tier man. However, there is much more to the book than just a passionate romance. In addition it has been linked to have influenced Henry James, the author of The Turn of the Screw, also about a governess falling in love, but with some messed up consequences... sorry for the tangent. Anyways, Jane Eyre really is good, as Charlotte Bronte mixes Gothic elements with romance and focuses on a dynamic character who undergoes a bildungsroman and matures at the end of the book.Set in London, England, a stereotypical place for love, Charlotte does well in establishing the imagery of the fire between Mr. Rochester and Jane. She constantly uses colors to set the mood and uses it to set off feelings. Mainly, she appeals to our sense of cold and hot, to paint Jane's emotions, it is wonderfully aesthetic and should be a good read to those who enjoys language.Not only is her plot above average, and her literary devices superior, she is able to meld the two together flawlessly for those who love to read for storyline and those who enjoy a good analysis on what they read. By now one should get the tone from me that Jane Eyre is not your average romance novel. It is more than that. It also speaks of moral responsibility. This centers around the two protagonists love, as Rochester is still married, and kept it hidden. When Jane finds out, she is caught in a dilemma between her principles and her feelings. Unable to figure out a compromise she runs away. Only when Rochester redeems himself by trying to rescue his wife from a fire is he then able to prove to Jane that he has changed and is a candidate for her love. Conveniently, his wife dies in the fire, and Rochester is left crippled, but not permanently. This represents his forgiveness; he has repented for his sins and is now able to be married. The story ends with their marriage and Jane Eyre's epilogue.Charlotte Bronte is a very good author, able to appeal to both kinds of readers. With her brilliant use of figurative language, making Jane's decisions seem ever more desperate, and diction, which contributes to the overall gothic mood of terror, most readers will be enchanted by her work. However, it is also this aspect that makes the book lack it's wow factor, because it appeals to both, it does has to divide it's attention between plot and device.I would recommend this to anyone who has not read the book yet, so what are you waiting for?

After years of being emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins she was finally allowed to go to school. However going to school didn't improve her standard of living much. Jane began to feel that there was something else out there for her so she took a job as governess at Thornfield Hall. Everything was going well until she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester.Jane Eyre is one of my absolute favorite books. I just really love all the characters and the dramatic plot twists. A lot of people who read this book just think it's a romance novel. While it is true that Romance plays a large part, the book is much more than just your run of the mill romance. People who are able to get the \`just a romance novel' idea out of their heads will see that the book is more about a woman trying to find a better life against great odds."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre may seem at first to be a boring 19th century novel, but in truth it is a fantastically rich book. There are so many great aspects in the novel. The characters are developed very well. Even though the author was limited in her knowledge because as a woman she was limited with education, each of the characters is portrayed well enough that he/she becomes real in the reader's mind. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the women characters are more developed and are more various than the men characters. The men in the book are shown to use women and they are not as diverse, but they are still interesting and realistic. Another great aspect is how well the author intertwined themes of social and financial classes, feminism, and faith and philosophy. Some of the ideas are easy to see without having to think about them, such as how money creates the biggest separation of classes. However, some of the philosophical ideas in the book are much deeper and harder to see and comprehend. The ideas are also not from our time period and are, therefore, harder for us to understand than they were for the readers of the author's time period. For example, the idea of how nature protects us and watches over us to make sure the right things happen to us at the right time is a intricate and remarkable concept.Jane Eyre does have one major flaw, though, and that is the plot. It is an interesting plot and easy to understand, but it is too much like a fairytale. Everything works out almost too perfectly, and seems to be coincidental. The plot helps the theme of how nature makes sure things happen, but it is too planned out. One almost expects to see the all too typical line, \\"And they lived happily ever after\\" at the end of the book. This flaw with the plot would only be seen by readers of our time because we are use to reading books with multifaceted plots, whereas in the time the book was written, people were happy just to read such a developed novel. Even with this flaw, still, it is a great book. While Jane Eyre won't go on my favorites list to read again and again, it was definitely a novel worth reading."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Set in England of the 1600's Jane Eyre's life story is told through her own perspective, aging throughout the novel. Her thoughts and feelings from early childhood through where she is in life writing the book are told with a grace that comes only from life experience. Jane Eyre is from the time of her earliest memories an orphan. In this book she finds love, acceptance, and herself. Charlotte Bronte's talent for bringing out all sides of a character is shown well in this book, she leaves nothing to be desired as far as rounding out her characters. Such characters as Mr. Rochester who first shows Jane true love, Mrs. Fairfax who helps her to understand her equality to others, and Adele Varens who helps her remember childlike wonder as she goes through her life changing experiences, all play a part in Jane coming into herself. This book is an inspiration and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story.Attention was drawn to the dramatic separation of the classes during the time the book was set it. Jane Eyre is an orphan, and therefore frowned upon by all as a dependent and a burden, almost no one expects her to do anything valuable with her life. This remearkable young woman pushed for the right to be sent to school, then ater her graduation stayed on as a teacher, after a mentor and only tie to the school left she advertised herself out as a governess. This was by no uncertain terms a grand achievement for someone born of such a position in the world. Although a governess was not the highest position during her time, she made due with the job and eventually found another window of opportunity. She fell in love with the master of the house and was asked for her hand in marriage. Certain events delay this already unseemly arrangement before true happiness is found.Many readers and critics alike have compared this story very closely to Cinderella. The plots are similar, however, they are not quite the same. Jane Eyre, born an orphan, falls in love with her version of &quot;Prince Charming,&quot; coming to her in the form of an employer. This idea of romance found in hte most unlikely of places with the most unattainable of people is a common thread through many modern works. This kind of fairy tale is appealing to a broad audience and almost any age. However, the level of reading that Jane Eyre is written for would suggest an age group of 12 through adults.This novel left me both uplifted and very impressed with the style of writing that Chalotte Bronte has. The novel's use of separation in social classes to cause a stir and engage the reader's attention to the romance of Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is brilliant. Most people would say that the book is a basic take off of the age old tale of Cinderella, but in all actuality it is a beautifully mastered knowledge of the romantic ideals of many young women. I would remcommend this book to the age group of 12 through adults, this novel is also geared mainly towards women, although it would be a wonderful read for those men in the world who have a taste for this genre. Over all the book was a success, a literary masterpiece that has forever more left it's mark on our society as a classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I've never been a reader but I joined a book club and this was the book of the month. I was very sure that I would never be able to read one of the classics and that I would be bored to tears. To my delight and surprise, this novel far surpassed any expectations I ever had. I was hooked from the beginning and looked for any opportunity to get away to read the book. It is not a fast read as the language was a big difficult at times but I learned to overlook the things that weren't so important to me and get on with the story. I have read two more classics since this novel and although Jane Eyre was my favorite, I am now a full fledged reading junkie."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen wrote the romantic stories. Dickens did the rags-to-riches heartwarmers. Mary Shelley added the supernatural, haunting yet human Frankenstein. Bronte's Jane Eyre pulls elements from all of these works and ends up... something entirely, refreshingly different.What's really great about this book is that it is so rich. The plot moves and moves well, making it an enjoyable and propelling read. While it is mostly romantic-love interest based, it is not as sappy or predictable as, say, Pride and Prejudice. Jane's journey to marital bliss is a bit more pock-marked -- and even drawn into question -- than in most romantic comedies. I enjoyed the fact that, indeed, she questions whether she even wants to marry or should marry -- and refuses to marry, not once but twice, because doing so would compromise who she is.Which brings me to the real reason I like this book and consider it a cut above most. Jane herself is so interesting. She is a very complex character, and the author has clearly taken much time and energy to draw in fine detail the map of her psychosis. This book is re-readable because there is so much to contemplate and reflect on within this finely drawn character. Is she afraid of happiness? Tied to duty? Was it right, or misguided, to leave Mr. Rochester? If it was right, were here intentions right? Was it right to return to him? What changes that allows her to refuse St. John, and return to Rochester?I think Ms. Bronte did us a great favor with this book. She took familiar ground and tweaked it -- taking the romantic comedy formula, so mastered by Austen and Thackeray, in which the tension entirely surrounds marriage, the meeting and mating of two people, and the point of the novel is resolved when the marriage(s) occur. Working within that framework, Bronte brings us a character novel -- in which the tension is only resolved once the character has found a way to be fully who she is, and thus happy and fulfilled. Surely this work broke ground for some of my very favorite works, in which plot becomes a somewhat secondary consideration and the eccentricities of character, the stuff of humans, becomes the focus and point of the novel.

As she had great afflictions in achieving her dreams as a published writer, so did Jane Eyre in finding happiness in a cruel word. Jane Eyre is a novel which one must read to experience its emotional power. Jane's life was full of unhappiness from birth, she finally finds love with Mr. Rochester. I cried like a baby when Jane was torn between Mr. Rochester and her values, and intended to leave. Then again, I cried in Tarzan so I'm more emotional than most.

I would recommend this book to anyone who want s to get lost in a story"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"If I read it in high school, I don't remember it. I do remember reading Wuthering Heights ~~ but that was in college. Jane Eyre is much more romantic than Wuthering Heights ~~ it is a Cinderella Tale with a happy ending too!Jane was orphaned at a very young age and was raised by a cold-hearted aunt and terrible cousins before being shipped off to an institution. Jane makes the best of her lowly lot in life and decided to take a chance of living life to the fullest by taking a governess job for Mr. Rochester. Little does she know how much life would change because of that decision!The trials and tribulations that beset Jane are those that every woman can identify with. The joy and fear of falling in love with Mr. Rochester (Edward) is inspiring. The tragic secret that Edward failed to disclose to Jane ~~ sending her away is so sad. Jane finds herself again in a town many miles away from her beloved ~~ and finds her family after all these years. Only the unrequited love for Edward was the mar on the beautiful paradise she has found. She does find love again and grows into this splendid woman who is strong and independent ~~ and yet, still very feminine.I strongly believe that everyone should read this classic as Charlotte Bronte wrote a thought-provoking novel filled with description and conversations. It is a moral book ~~ designed to make the reader think of what is right and what is wrong. Jane stood up for her belief at the cost of her love ~~ though it was one of the hardest decisions she has ever had to make. And love finds her again.This is a book that makes you believe that if you have faith, things will come right and true for you. Even if it wasn't already a classic, it should be. How many books have withstood the test of time? This one is a golden treasure to add to your library!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The free Kindle version is fine if you aren't reading the book for study purposes and if you know a tiny hint of French. In fact, I'm of the opinion that reading 160+ year old books on Kindle has the distinct advantage of access to the built-in English dictionary. You can look up archaic words immediately without losing your page, thanks to the 'back' button. I didn't mind the fact that there were no page breaks between chapters as one previous reviewer did. In fact the novel was so gripping and compelling that the very fact that there were even chapters to break it up left me feeling somewhat impatient!The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 probably has more to do with Kindle books in general rather than this book in particular. It reads as easily as any other book I've read on Kindle. But it's the kind of novel where you want to flip back to a certain section and re-read a portion just because of what is currently being said by the characters, and there is no way to do that. As for the French passages I had mentioned earlier, they are really very few in number and even if you don't know any French, don't let it stop you from reading this novel. They're all things said by one character or another, often repeated in English. (Thank you, Charlotte Bront)! None of it is important to the plot or to the characters themselves.Charlotte Bront shows herself to be an incredibly masterful writer in \\"Jane Eyre.\\" There were times when I just stopped to admire the style with which she conveyed something and the techniques she used. She is also incredibly insightful into human nature. The main character is an introverted person and all of her thoughts, beautifully laid out, make her into one of the most compelling characters in literature. Although it may be difficult to see this, I do think that the author was showing her feminist colors, such as they were in those days, when she conjured up Jane Eyre.Thanks for making these classic books available for free on Kindle!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"As much as I know this is a classic, and I feel a review a tad redundant, I've just read the magnificent Jane Eyre for the first time, and I'm so utterly enamoured, I simply must wax poetic about it a while!Where to start. I've just finished reading Charlotte Bront's Gothic masterpiece for the first time, and I feel a mixture of breathless and speechless.Chronicling the life of the orphaned Jane Eyre, the novel begins with a truly upsetting account of what can only be called horrific child abuse. We encounter Jane as she strikes back at her childhood tormentor--her cousin John--for the first time, after quietly enduring teasing, beating, and the hatred of her only family (her dead uncle's wife, and her 3 cousins) for the whole of her short 10 years. As punishment, she is confined to the 'Red Room', the room in which her uncle died. As the sun sets, and she's left in darkness, the terrified child has a panic attack, and her aunt advantageously uses the event to have Jane sent away to Lowood School--a change of scene to save her nerves.We watch Jane grow into a passionate young woman, develop self-respect, a distaste for injustice, and her own strong sense of right and wrong. After completing her education, and working two years at Lowood as a teacher, Jane hungers for a new situation in life, so advertises in the paper, and is invited to take up a post as governess for a child, at a wealthy, private residence. Here we experience part spooky mystery, part love story, and see the world of Thornfield Manor through fiery and fascinating Jane's eyes.Jane Eyre is many things--a journey of self discovery, a love story, and a surprisingly progressive tale for its day. It holds some strongly feminist ideas, or perhaps more than feminist, ideas about justice, class systems, and equality. It's Jane, a relative 'commoner' who shows more backbone and self-respect than many of her high-bred 'superiors'. Social standing, graces, and superficial manners all come second to intelligence, self-respect, actually having character, and one's own mind.It's mentioned--and constantly reiterated that neither Jane, nor her suitor, are physically much to look at. The idea of true beauty coming from within, and beauty being in the eye of the beholder is another strong theme here. Jane as a character is in strong contrast with others, such as the beautiful, yet shallow and capricious Georgiana Reed, or cruel and superficial Blanche Ingram. Where these women are admired in the highest regard in their upper class society, despite their lack of character, Jane is despised, but she is the better human being. I love that she KNOWS it, also.We're also presented with a wonderful array of unique and colourful characters, very few of whom seem black and white. Rochester, most obviously, struggling to justify his actions before God and society, every bit as much as to his own self; wanting to be good, wanting to be a better man, but really--let's be honest--failing. He's resigned to the fact he can't be better without outside influence. We have a role reversal here: rather than our male hero being a knight in shining armour to a damsel in distress, Rochester views Jane as his saviour. Then characters like Bessie: sweet, but with a temper that will turn as quickly as the wind. She's neither good, nor bad. The adorable, but admittedly vapid, Mademoiselle Ad&egrave;le, and above all Jane, who lives by her own rules and sense of morality, rather than those of society... and really, who's are better, here?. There are still clich&eacute;s here, though. The lunatic wife, the wicked stepmother and stepsisters (In the shape of aunt and cousins)... But at the time, were these clich&eacute;s at the time this was written?Amidst all the romance and wonderful characters, it's easy to forget the wonderful gothic thriller/mystery at the heart of Thornfield, and for anyone new to the story, its heartbreaking conclusion. And the romantic tension between Jane and Rochester? It's as palpable--if not more so--than any modern romance I've read (here's looking at you Twilight), but for once we're dealing with a girl with backbone. This is nothing like a Jane Austen love story. We're not dealing with manners and moving within the bounds of acceptable society--this is unrequited love, people.On an aside, for those who've readA Room of One's Own (Annotated), and Wolfe's criticism of both Charlotte Bront and Jane Eyre, it's interesting to see parallels between the two works: that a woman doesn't need a man to define her; that having one's own means is essential for any woman who wants to create (or maintain an independent mind); that it's the value of human being's heart and mind--not outward appearances--that is what gives them value (I'm thinking about Judith and William Shakespeare, here). Jane is every bit as good as Mrs and the Misses Reeds, the Ingrams, and indeed, a number of the men of this book. She is the intellectual equal of Rochester, and perhaps superior of St John, regardless of her sex.Despite the time since it was written, Jane Eyre is not hard to read. I often struggle with older novel but it's far easier than Dracula, which was an effort for me, though not necessarily a good comparison. It's hugely entertaining, in parts absolutely heartbreaking, and there is a good reason why it remains popular, and a 'classic' over a hundred years later. It's an extraordinary work of fiction, beautifully written, and with just as much to enjoy now as it did when it was first published."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, a girl of no importance and the daughter of an unapproved match, lives a troubled life for her first ten years under her aunt's roof. Her parents died when she was a baby and she was left as Aunt Reed's charge with no other living relatives that she knew of. When her aunt can no longer stand Jane any more, she sends her to a boarding school where the rules are strict and the headmaster is every bit the tyrant Aunt Reed was. But Jane conquers, becomes a teacher, and then wishes to become a private tutor. After her ad is received and her application accepted, Jane finds herself in the home of a mysterious and strange man, Mr. Rochester, who has put his ward, Adele, under Jane's tutelage. But then Jane finds herself falling deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, who she could not imagine would love her in return. This, and the strange happenings in Thornfield Hall, give Jane cause to doubt her future. And when Mr. Rochester's dark secret reveals itself, Jane must question her love and discover what she must do with her life before she can find the happiness she never had.____________________________________This is one of those \\"Can words describe?\\" books. And while I feel there aren't very many words that do an adequate job, I will try my best.Can you believe that I haven't read this book yet? I can't. For years, people have been telling me, \\"Sierra, you have to read this book.\\" \\"Sierra, this is one of the best books I've ever read.\\" \\"Oh my GOSH! You haven't read Jane Eyre?!\\" \\"What are you waiting for, you, the reader, of all people?\\"So here I am, having read (devoured) the long awaited book that has been loved, cried and giggled over by hordes. And I'm here to tell you people who have not yet read this book - \\"What. In the world. Are. You. Waiting for?!\\" (I know...I'm one to talk...but now I know how everyone else feels! haha!)Throughout the course of the book, I got choked up. But there was too much ahead to slow down, stop, and actually cry. However...when I got to the last chapter, I lost it. Tears came and the two-year-old little boy I was babysitting put down his yogurt and stared at me, head cocked to the side, probably completely confused as to why I was smiling and crying at the same time. After all the heartache and sadness, and even the little bits of joy in between, the happiness of the end just overwhelmed me. It was just too beautiful to not feel that way - there was so much emotion in my heart that I felt it would almost burst.Jane is a character I look up to - I want to be like her. Her decisiveness, her courage, her resolution, her faith...it amazed me, and amazes me still, even after the book has been set back on the shelf. She knew what she had to do and she did it - no matter the cost. And the way she loved everyone so unconditionally - especially Mr. Rochester - continually surprised me. Her kind heart, her gentle but firm manner, and her intense love... Wow. I also loved her close study of human nature and how she described and saw people - why she was intrigued by them.Mr. Rochester himself is quite a character. Going into this story, I was NOT expecting him to be the least like he was - physically ugly and mentally independent. He was strange, but yet so perfect for the story. In all my travels through literature, I've never met a character like him, and I doubt I ever will again. That character will always be embodied by Mr. Rochester alone. I easily fell for him as Jane did; her love for him was pure; she never once judged him for his faults; she loved him all the more for them. The reader cannot help but feeling the same. I loved seeing his pride break down, slowly but surely, and the way he described the experience after. It was just amazing.As far as the story line and the writing... Both were equally magnificent. The story captured me from the first, especially when I expected the novel to begin when she was older. But I loved every bit of it - every second was glorious, and painful and lovely. I cared for Jane so much that it didn't matter what she was doing - I wanted to read about her. And Mr. Rochester and St. John and Adele and everyone else. The writing was incredible, down to the very last word. I loved how she wrote most of the time in past tense, and then sometimes slipped smoothly into present tense, showing the reader exactly what it felt like, to be doing instead of remembering. I'm actually not a huge fan of present tense, but this was so perfect I just couldn't resist liking it.Favorite character: Mr. Rochester because of his originality...and how much I loved his character within the first few pages of his introduction.Favorite aspect: DUH! The love story, of course! Totally intriguing the way it was played out, the intensity of Mr. Rochester's secret hanging over it part of the time, the rest being Jane's own doubts about Mr. Rochester's nature or her sadness over him being engaged to a woman who would not and could not love him - and who he had no passion for either. Oh my gosh this story had me in its clutches and didn't let me go!!!There are no single words to describe this book. Magnificent and heart-pounding and gut-wrenching are about the best I can do. They are true - as true as true can be - but there is something about the book that can only be felt and understood by reading it yourself. It's not anything that can be described - it's an experience. One that I can't wait to relive again and again and again!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I remember watching the movie as a young girl and how the story never really left me.

I'd give it 3.5 stars. I think it is a well written autobiography of a poor, plain but fiercely independent girl. You do feel sympathy for that girl and her moral and emotional struggle. However, there are some elements in this book that I do not like:1. The author's constant addressing of the \\"reader\\" is just peculiar. Most part of the book is written in first person voice, but every now and then she felt the urge to pause and remind the \\"reader\\" (thus switching to second person), this rather takes the reader out of the flow of the narrative. I personally do not like this.2. The two main male characters are wholly unlikable, even repulsive. Rochester comes across as a rude, sullen, selfish, deceptive and manipulative character. On the last point, I am referring to the episode of him, in order to arouse Jane's jealousy, pretending to have fallen in love with another prettier girl. And of course much can be said about his deceptiveness and selfishness. It is indeed hard to understand why Jane would fall for this guy, except that he is really the very first male person she encounters in the real world. As to St. John Rivers, he is simply a religious nutcase, all he talks about is his missionary work, showing no human compassion to even his own sisters. Yet, although Jane eventually rejects him, the author pains him in a saintly aura.3. The constant references to scripture is really irksome.Nonetheless, I do think the personality of the main character is believable and depicted vividly, that's why I would give it 3.5 stars (good but not great).Now on the introduction and notes by Michael Mason, I think they are atrocious. First in the introduction he arrogantly suggests that the general reader cannot \\"get\\" serious literature, only professional critics like him holds the canonical interpretation (I paraphrase). Here's news to Mr. Mason: we have a brain and we can think for ourselves too, thank you very much. But if the introduction is mildly annoying, the notes are just ridiculous. There are chunks of conversation in the book in French, but he never bothers to translate them; however he *constantly* FORWARD-references plot elements. For example, before we find out who Rochester's maniac wife is, he already mentions her name and what she's going to the next day; at another point when Jane had a dream about Thornfield on fire, he says something like \\"considering what happened next, this is so accurate that it is like a 'second vision'\\" (I paraphrase again). This is called \\"RUINING THE BOOK\\", as some other reviewer said (I believe he or she was referring to Mason's notes), this is like an annoying friend constantly telling you what's going to happen next when you watch a movie. This is so frustrating at times I wish Mr. Mason was standing next to me so I can whack him with the book (and shove his \\"canonical view\\" of serious literature down his throat)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the subject of many AP required reading lists, perhaps strikes discontent to those who read the novel in high school. A better appreciation for this classic will probably be gained reading it later in life.Bronte seemed to have modeled the character and conditions of Jane Eyre around her own life, so the novel has some biographical elements. Jane Eyre, after a difficult childhood quite Dickensesque in nature, eventually lands a job as a governess of Thornfield Hall as she approaches adulthood. Jane works here for awhile, and begins to adapt to her new station in life. Her employer, Mr. Rochester, comes and goes from Thornfield, but eventually news comes back that he is to marry the beautiful but snobbish Miss Ingram. As time wears on, however, there is an indication that Rochester marrying Miss Ingram might only be a ruse for him to actually find the secrets of Jane's heart. Jane struggles back and forth between her feelings for Rochester as her employer, and him as a man. Eventually Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but he has some baggage in his past that he is able to keep from Jane until the moment they are to be married. Jane then discovers the truth: Rochester is married to a woman named Bertha, who is insane and resides locked in the basement of Thornfield. Jane knows she cannot marry now, and leaves Thornfield to pursue a new life. Romanticized in nature, events suggest that this is not the end of Rochester and Jane, and that they will cross paths sometime later. How and under what circumstances you discover in the book's second half.One theme Bronte explores is the importance of equality within backgrounds and classes. Jane changes her station by beginning in poverty and living as a governess only to eventually be able to gain a sense of independence. Jane, despite struggles, is often conscientious and fair to others, which is juxtaposed by Miss Ingram and her family, who loathe the site of governesses, thinking them to be unintelligent and worthless.There is also a sense that Jane, although first seeing herself as lower to others, builds self-confidence and understands herself as equal to others, especially Rochester: \\"I was an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.\\" When she discovers and matures, this gives dimension and depth to her character.Perhaps Jane Eyre has as much to do with illustrating a heroine's ability to be a free thinker, independent, and even a bit brash at points, which could be viewed as atypical of female protagonists during this time. We experience Jane's introspective outlook on all things by the first person narration, and Jane displays a depth to her character, especially when she is skeptical about Rochester's first proposal of marriage, which seems too \\"fairy tale\\" to be true. She doesn't give in because it seems like the proper thing to do, or the easiest. She refuses to marry Rochester earlier in the novel out of principle, and despite his pleas, she sticks to her guns, even though she knows it will be a rough go in life for both her and Rochester.Character depth is illustrated in both Jane and Rochester's change from beginning to end. Rochester has moments of \\"blindness\\" in the novel. First, he is \\"blind\\" to humility and life responsibilities in the first half of the book at Thornfield Hall. Later in the novel, he is physically blind after the tragic accident that leaves Thornfield a ruin, but, has learned a sense of sympathy and humility that he didn't have earlier. Jane also undergoes a transition from her outlook on life: she believes and knows by novel's end that she is equals to her peers.While a bit overly romanticized at points, Bronte's novel has fantastic character development. The scene when Jane battles with her conscience while leaving Thornfield is epically captured by Bronte: \\"He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge..\\" Although Jane feels a sense of tragedy at this moment, she is not afraid to stick to what her intuition tells her is right, and she uses her faith as her instrument to guide her fate.Over all, Bronte captures a powerful and moving story of a \\"plain\\" girl who overcomes difficult moments to find faith and healing in life. I felt that it was a strong story, but tended to drag during Jane's stay at St. John's after leaving Thornfield. The story seems to get \\"stuck in the mud\\", and many moments of Jane's narration become repetitive. However, it doesn't detract from an otherwise powerful, impressive classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is book #6 on theThe Well-Educated Mind's list of must-read novels, and it immediately draws comparison to the two prior selections,Pride and PrejudiceandOliver Twist. Both Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre were written by female authors and feature strong female protagonists. Elizabeth Bennett and Jane Eyre are both very feisty and committed to finding romantic love in a time when that wasn't always the basis for marriages. The major difference between the two books, though, is that Pride and Prejudice is far more subtle, with the \\"action\\" taking place largely within the lead character's thoughts and emotions, while a whole lot of exciting, external action happens in Jane Eyre. That's not to say one is better than the other, only that they are different in this way while being somewhat similar in overall theme.Like Oliver Twist, Jane Eyre is an orphan. \\"Luckily\\" for her, though, she wasn't abandoned to a work house but adopted by a well-to-do uncle. I say \\"luckily\\" in quotes because the uncle dies when she's one (this isn't a spoiler, I promise) and she's then left in the care of her hateful aunt, who shows her no love or mercy for the ten years Jane lives with her. Jane is the victim of vicious beatings at the hands of her older cousin John, too. But the difference between her and Oliver Twist is that she fights back -- she's spunky, not just a miserable sad sack like Oliver (I hated that character and the entire book). When her aunt says that Jane is unfit to associate with her cousins, Jane shots back \\"They're unfit to associate with me!\\" When asked by a preacher what she needs to do to avoid going to Hell, Jane says, \\"I must keep in good health, and not die.\\"The level of abuse young Jane suffers is far less onerous than that of Oliver, and therefore more believable. She inhabits a world of realistic characters, not stereotypes. I felt bad for Jane; I just rolled my eyes and said \\"Oh brother\\" whenever Oliver was absurdly mistreated.But Jane doesn't stay a child in the story for long -- soon enough she's an adult young woman with new kinds of problems. And of course, she falls in love... The love-story component of this book is probably the best I've ever read, and there are a few chapters composed solely of dialog between two lovers that are absolutely beautiful to read. This IS, however, an action-oriented story, and the plot is both believable and engaging. The story is well-paced, too: Twice when I felt things were just beginning to get a bit tedious there were abrupt changes of scenery that kept me tuned in. I loved this book! While not quite as good asGulliver's Travelsor Pride and Prejudice, this might just be the third best novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book. i must admit they have some pretty BIG words! but it aint nothing a dictionary cant fix. i never did use a dictionary though and i got by well.the story in this book is just amazing! i have NEVER read a book like this before and i have read a lot of books. if u read this book u will not be disappointed!in fact you'll probably want to read it again. after i was through i basically read it again just looking and comparing stuff. its so beautifully written. i've never read any other charlotte bronte books but im planning on it.if u get this book u will definitely enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currier Bell, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has definitely become a timeless classic. Even now, over 150 years after its debut, Jane Eyre's popularity amongst scholars and avid readers has not wavered. However, nowadays, its use of old language and portrayal of a time long past has made it less appealing to the general public.Jane Eyre, the protagonist of the story, is an orphan cared by her aunt, whose whole family views her as an onerous responsibility pushed upon them at her uncle's deathbed. After a few incidents with her taunting cousins, Jane is shipped off to Lowood, a school run by a hypocritical minister. Despite the hardships she had to endure at Lowood, Jane graduates and eventually leaves Lowood to become a governess. At Thornhill, she meets and falls in love with her master, the cold and mysterious Mr. Rochester. However, when it seems that happiness is finally within reach, Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's dark secret that puts a halt to their relationship. But of course, due to her high morals and strong determination to stick to them, all ends well for Jane and Mr. Rochester.While this piece is a story of finding love and happiness, Bronte utilizes Jane's experiences (which are based partly off her experiences in school and as a governess) to criticize the inferiority with which women were viewed at the time. Although Jane is more educated, well-mannered, and morally superior to her master, her status is still considered far beneath his. The Rivers sisters is also representation of how Bronte feels women should be: poised, knowledgeable, and talented.It is no wonder that Charlotte Bronte is known for her ability to make characters and situations come alive. Bronte's vivid and lively narration makes Jane a loveable and relatable character. Through the details of her narration and the fitting syntax structure, her readers are able to clearly grasp the struggles, decisions, and dilemmas that Jane faces constantly. When Jane fought hunger and the cold at Lowood, when she choose to leave behind her ticket to \\"happiness,\\" when she came into inheritance at the Rivers's home and returned to Thornhill, Bronte took us with her. The imagery is also plenty and a great aid in visualizing the setting, especially the mysterious Thornhill.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jane Eyre. Maybe it is because I am just a sucker for romances or maybe it is because I generally love historical fiction, but I did not agree with my peers when they said that the story was boring. I admit, the plot does become a bit dragged on at some points, like Jane's time at Lowood and her stay with the Rivers. Overall though, I still say that Jane Eyre is definitely one of my more favorite ones that I read last year.If you don't mind historical fiction and can get your head around the archaic diction, then I highly recommend Jane Eyre. Especially if you are a sucker for romances like me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. If you love a good romance, this is a must read.

Then just when you think it would never happen, Jane Eyre finds true love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"You know all those 'classic' novels you read in high school? How many of them do you actually remember? Well, if Jane Eyre was one of those long-forgotten books, pick up a copy. To read it as an adult is a joy: it's a sweeping, disturbing, intense, thrilling, very romantic gothic love story, written in the voice of a very intense, almost claustrophobically self-aware young heroine. Jane is no Ophelia - she's a complicated, remarkable character, and a very strong female character in a genre that usually draws women as beautiful victims at best.There's something for everyone in this book: Windswept castles, difficult and neurotic family members, dark secrets about tragic former lovers, good triumphing over evil, all that good juicy stuff that makes a great romantic story. What elevates Jane Eyre is Bronte's remarkable style & skill and her sharp and complex characterizations.Trust me on this: If you don't remember it from your teens, you should give it a try now. Here is one novel that more than lives up to it's 'classic' status."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I first read \\"Jane Eyre\\" in eighth grade and have read it every few years since. It is one of my favorite novels, and so much more than a gothic romance to me, although that's how I probably would have defined it at age 13. I have always been struck, haunted in a way, by the characters - Jane and Mr. Rochester. They take on new depth every time I meet them...and their's is a love story for the ages.Charlotte Bronte's first published novel, and her most noted work, is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story. Jane is plain, poor, alone and unprotected, but due to her fierce independence and strong will she grows and is able to defy society's expectations of her. This is definitely feminist literature, published in 1847, way before the beginning of any feminist movement. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the novel has had such a wide following since it first came on the market. It is also one of the first gothic romances published and defines the genre.Jane Eyre, who is our narrator, was born into a poor family. Her parents died when she was a small child and the little girl was sent to live with her Uncle and Aunt Reed at Gateshead. Jane's Uncle truly cared for her and showed his affection openly, but Mrs. Reed seemed to hate the orphan, and neglected her while she pampered and spoiled her own children. This unfair treatment emphasized Jane's status as an unwanted outsider. She was often punished harshly. On one occasion her nasty cousin Jack picked a fight with her. Jane tried to defend herself and was locked in the terrifying \\"Red Room\\" as a result. Jane's Uncle Reed had died in this room a little while before, and Mrs. Reed knew how frightened she was of the chamber. Since Jane is the narrator, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the child's feelings, her heightened emotional state at being imprisoned. Indeed, she seems almost like an hysterical child, filled with terror and rage. She repeatedly calls her condition in life \\"unjust\\" and is filled with bitterness. Looking into the mirror Jane sees a distorted image of herself. She views her reflection and sees a \\"strange little figure,\\" or \\"tiny phantom.\\" Jane has not learned yet to subordinate her passions to her reason. Her passions still erupt unchecked. Her isolation in the Red Room is a presentiment of her later isolation from almost every society and community. This powerful, beautifully written scene never fails to move me.Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane away to the Lowood School, a poor institution run by Mr. Brocklehurst, who believed that suffering made grand people. All the children there were neglected, except to receive harsh punishment when any mistake was made. At Lowood, Jane met Helen Burns, a young woman a little older than Jane, who guided her with vision, light and love for the rest of her life. Jane's need for love was so great. It really becomes obvious in this first friendship. Helen later died from fever, in Jane's arms. Her illness and death could have been avoided if more attention had been paid to the youths. Jane stayed at Lowood for ten years, eight as a student and two as a teacher. Tired and depressed by her surroundings, Jane applied for the position of governess and found employment at Thornfield. The mansion is owned by a gentleman named Edward Fairfax Rochester. Her job there was to teach his ward, an adorable little French girl, Adele. Over a long period the moody, inscrutable Rochester confides in Jane and she in him. The two form an unlikely friendship and eventually fall in love. Again, Jane's need for love comes to the fore, as does her passionate nature. She blooms. A dark, gothic figure, Rochester also has a heart filled with the hope of true love and future happiness with Jane. Ironically, he has brought all his misery, past and future, on himself.All is not as it seems at Thornfield. There is a strange, ominous woman servant, Grace Poole, who lives and works in an attic room. She keeps to herself and is rarely seen. From the first, however, Jane has sensed bizarre happenings at night, when everyone is asleep .There are wild cries along with violent attempts on Rochester's life by a seemingly unknown person. Jane wonders why no one investigates Mrs. Poole. Then a strange man visits Thornfield and mysteriously disappears with Mr. Rochester. Late that night Jane is asked to sit with the man while the lord of the house seeks a doctor's help. The man has been seriously wounded and is weak from loss of blood. He leaves by coach, in a sorry state, first thing in the morning. Jane's questions are not answered directly. This visit will have dire consequences on all involved. An explosive secret revealed will destroy all the joyful plans that Jane and Rochester have made. Jane, once more will face poverty and isolation.Charlotte Bronte's heroine Jane Eyre, may not have been graced with beauty or money, but she had a spirit of fire and was filled with integrity and a sense of independence - character traits that never waned in spite of all the oppression she encountered in life. Ms. Bronte brings to the fore in \\"Jane Eyre\\" such issues as: the relations between men and women in the mid-19 century, women's equality, the treatment of children and of women, religious faith and hypocrisy (and the difference between the two), the realization of selfhood, and the nature of love and passion. This is a powerhouse of a novel filled with romance, mystery and passions. It is at once startlingly fresh and a portrait of the times. Ms. Bronte will make your heart beat faster, your pulse race and your eyes fill with tears. The Best!!JANA"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is about as unprepossessing a heroine as one could hope to find. Not only is she an orphan, she's extremely plain, her manners are stilted, and her relatives hate and bully her. Jane's one chance at freedom is the charity school her aunt sends her to. After buckling down, she finally manages to scrape up enough accomplishments to take on a position as a governess. What she finds as governess, though, is a mysterious manor and its even more mysterious owner, Mr. Rochester, who takes a strange fancy to her. Will Jane find love at last? Or will the secrets she reveals destroy all hope of happiness?\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most well known gothic romance classics, and for good reason.

However, this version of Jane Eyre has millions of footnotes so you are forced to constantly flip back and forth to see if the footnotes are saying anything useful.When the character Adele is speaking paragraphs of French, they don't bother translating it for you but they will gleefully tell you what's going to happen one-hundred pages later in the book.Reading this version of Jane Eyre is like watching a movie with an over-enthusiatic friend who keeps talking through the whole movie and telling you what's going to happen. If you're going to read Jane Eyre, I would reccomend different version"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"There is so much to be said for this novel that it's difficult to know where to begin. It is a superb evocation of a time and place; it is a complex, detailed character study; it has a believable and compelling plot; and, more than anything else, it is a magnificent love story.Of course, love stories are the common denominator of human existence and have been the subject of literature since mankind first put charcoal to rock, so the fact that Jane Eyre is a love story is nothing terribly significant. No, what makes this novel so special is the thoughtfulness with which its narrator, Jane Eyre herself, documents her love affair. She is extremely intelligent, she carefully analyzes her feelings and actions, and she is scrupulously honest with both herself and her reader. This is what sets it apart: it is the depth of these thoughts and feelings that make the novel interesting. Beyond that, though, it is the character of Jane, slowly revealed, that makes the novel a delight.The plot is Jane's story. Orphaned, she is sent to live with her cruel aunt and cousins. At the age of ten she is sent away for good to a charity school, at which she gets her education, but which is run in such a miserly fashion that many of the students there actually die of disease and starvation. Jane survives, and at the age of eighteen, is able to secure a position as a governess to a child in a great house of England: Thornfield Hall. It is owned by Edward Rochester, the man who will become the centerpiece of her life.How the two begin to slowly realize their affection for one another, how they then cautiously begin to act on their feelings, and how they must then surmount the obstacles in their path--both societal and self-inflicted--are what make up the bulk of the novel. There are at least a few surprises along the way. The strong-willed Jane's moral code requires that she respond to these difficulties in certain ways. It is to the novel's and the author's great credit that these decisions are never simply made; Jane agonizes over them in heart-wrenching fashion. As in life, the standards one chooses to live by can be difficult to maintain.This defining tension is what drives the novel, but that it is delivered in such a skillful and assured way is what raises it to its lofty status. The dialogue, particularly, is fantastic. It is the stuff of an actor's dream: much of it can be interpreted in several different ways. Jane describes Rochester as being moody and tempestuous, and he often is, but at the same time--particularly after Jane agrees to marry him--he is hilariously wry and bemused. Jane comes across as being earnest and pleading, but she can be very playful and is often flirtatious. As mentioned above, these are deep, achingly human characters.The setting is also very evocative. The English countryside, class system and moral understanding were obviously familiar to those who read the book in Ms. Bronte's day, and probably familiar to many of us in this day and age. Nevertheless, Ms. Bronte took the time to document these things carefully. The descriptions of Rochester's home, the lanes in front if it and its orchards and fields; the destitute and grimly cold school for girls; and the small country town where Jane makes the acquaintance of a small group of benefactors towards the end of the novel are all a testament to life as it existed at this distant time and age.The novel is looked upon as a classic and should be. Ms. Bronte not only created a beautiful piece having to do with the nature of love--personal to her but universal in nature--but did so in such a spectacular way that she actually makes the reader feel this love, both for her creation, and for her."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This turned out to be an exceptional book though I didn't think so in the beginning. By what seems the hundredth page, I had decided it was a feminine version of David Copperfield but not as interesting. By the hundred and fiftieth page, I was completely discouraged and was sure it had turned into the very romantic mush I detest (a lot of what she feels about him and what he feels about her, and so on). Somewhere soon after that, I fell in and was absorbed. It became a tremendously good book with a fantastic plot and a good pace. I read for hours and hours at a sitting enjoying every single minute of it and only stopped when something absolutely forced me. Excellent, excellent!Jane Eyre is an orphaned child under the guardianship of her maternal aunt. Not liked by her aunt and not able to get along with her cousins, Jane is sent to Lowood School for the children of the poor (it is a charity school) to be taught the fundamentals and, more importantly, to be conditioned for a life of poor expectations. Lowood changes the strong willed, impetuous Jane into a woman of uncommon restraint. When she accepts a post as governess to Adele at Thornfield Hall, she attracts the attention of Mr. Rochester, the master of the house, who has the desire to reclaim himself from a sordid past. He comes to believe that Jane has the power to transform him and help him to realize himself in the better light that he has not heretofore been able to achieve on his own. But his secrets are not far away and peculiar events at Thornfield make the reader question his advances. Sworn not to ask about who or what is in the room on the third floor, Jane's iron resolve begins to falter with the dreamlike romance and the reader begins to trepiditiously hope for her happiness. When Mr. Rochester is unable to keep his past under wraps, however, Jane is forced onto a path that will require all of her internal resources to survive but will ultimately put her in the position to make choices for herself rather than just choose among available options. The question is, with her conditioning, can she lead with her heart instead of her head?My only legitimate greivance, and given only in the vein of humour, is that is seems like Jane would have taught Adele some English. The child speaks only in French and myself not being able to read French, I did not understand anything the child ever said. Luckily, her exuberance and intent still comes through and the reader can develop a softness for the child without understanding her dialogue."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I will agree that this performance is given with sensitivity to the voice of Jane Eyre and of Charlotte Bronte, but alas it's an abridged version. The above listing does not give any indication of this, consequently I was very disappointed when it arrived. I personally have no use for abridged books. When I pick up a book (print or audio) I want to experience the entire book. Abridged books always leave me feeling cheated, wondering what did I miss?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I first read this book when I was ten and reread it every decade as a special treat to myself. It is one of the great classics of English literature. It is, essentially, a Cinderella story, and I STRONGLY recommend it as an andidote to the Woman-Hear-Me-Roar (or is it &quot;Girl Power&quot;?) stuff being pushed on young ladies nowadays as a means to making the sex strong. The story begins when the heroine, Jane Eyre, is a young orphan of about nine, and follows her through school and her career as a governess in a wealthy but mysterious man's home. She falls in love, learns of an impediment to her immediate gratification, does the right thing and suffers for her pains, but in the end is rewarded for her suffering. Very irrelevant to the late twentieth century, obviously. Charlotte Bronte (the author) is frquently encountered around the same time in life one encounters Dickens--youth--but, like Dickens, she most definitely wrote for adults. Therefore, the book is probably a difficult read for all but the most tenacious middle schooler, but as it begins from the very real, very painful point of view of a powerless child, it has a good hook to draw in the young reader. Its literary style is Romantic, with the liberal use of semi-colons, inverted sentences, and detailed descriptions. This book is a MUST for all well-educated young ladies--the next step after Little Women and before the Jane Austen novels. And sorry for the gender stereotyping; I'm sure there are boys and men out there who read this book and loved it, but I never met one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I recently saw a preview for a Jane Eyre movie soon to come out... and after having just gotten a Kindle, I thought I would read the book before I see the movie.

This is a wonderful story--- more about overcoming horrible tribulations and finding peace and love through perseverance.The first page or two kind of threw me, as this novel was written in the mid 1800's. I was worried the language would make it too difficult to comprehend, but I was wrong. By the third page I was hooked, and hardly put it down the next 3 days until I finished it. This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go, even after you've finished it. It is definitely one of those novels that leaves you wanting more of these people.

Actually, I wrote it several months ago. However, I found one review that disturbed me. The reviewer said, and I quote, &quot;Thank the gods for Jane Austen, I say. At least her heroines were role models well worthy of attention by impressionbale female readers.&quot;Okay, now here is my opinion on that statement. I have read Jane Austen and I absolutely adore all of her novels (Mansfield Park I cannot speak for, I have never read it.) However, I find that her heroines are not to be admired. Take for instance, Anne Elliot in Persuasion who spends 8 years in a state of depression and makes her self ugly because she made a mistake. Or Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, who is much to prejudiced to even hear Mr. Darcy's side of the story. And don't forget Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey who almost scares herself to death romantizing every little detail in an old house just because she has read too much. Then there is Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility who is so concerned with dying for love that she can't see that the man of her dreams is right in front of her face and she falls in love with some jerk. And last, but not least, Elinor Dashwood, Marianne's elder sister, who closes up her emotions inside and because of that eventually snaps. Jane Eyre, on the other hand is a heroine to be admired, for she shows us all that even in the worst situations of life (which she experienced) you can still be strong. Jane Austen's characters may live the fairytale &quot;happily ever after&quot; life, but they do not prove as strong as Jane Eyre in the least."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is my absolute favorite book!

I have read it five times and ask you to read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"No one reads JANE EYRE for the plot or for the fine sense of irony that her sister Emily Bronte showed. They do read Charlotte Bronte for how she overcomes an admitted use of heavy-handed Gothic romanticism that includes all the traditional trappings of gloomy castles, Byronic satanic heroes, crazed prisoners, and even a shrieking telepathic message. If JANE EYRE had no more than these Gothic trappings, then it is not likely that I, or anyone else for that matter, would be discussing its literary merits. What sets Jane EYRE apart for its earlier and more heavy-handed predecessors was a sense of palpable realism that rings true with events that harken back to Charlotte Bronte's life that ran parallel with that of Jane Eyre's. This realism stems from experiences that Charlotte had in a school that was perilously close to Dickens' school in NICHOLAS NICKLEBY and Jane's school in Lowood. Further, the mistreatment that Jane underwent at Gateshead Hall must have originated from similar such savageries in her early youth. It is a tribute to Charlotte Bronte's realism that she could make her readers feel the pathos and sentimentalism of an outraged childhood.When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a powerful story of struggle and of love. Jane lives a difficult early life, and struggles to find a place just right for her to settle down. She starts out living with an emotionally abusive aunt and cousins who do not understand her. From there she is shipped to boarding school, where she is a student and later becomes a teacher. Here she is always hungry, and living conditions are not the best. Jane then becomes a governess for a little girl in a home called Thornfield Hall. It is here where she begins a somewhat strange and unconventional relationship with the master of her house, Mr. Rochester. The love that develops between them goes against all of the conventions of their time, and is almost lost. The last part of the book is beautiful and well fitting with the rest of the story.Charlotte Bronte uses amazing, flowing language that in itself makes the book terrific. Her story is full of a wide range of emotions. It is not a difficult read, but really gets your mind thinking. This is a classic, timeless novel that will have people engaged for ages. Have your pen ready to mark some of Bronte's beautiful passages that will be unforgettable!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This summer, as I was searching for a free-choice book to read, I stumbled upon Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. I chose this book because I was curious to see if it was anything like Wuthering Heights (a book I rather enjoyed) writen by the other Bronte sister.Jane Eyre is a conflicted love story. It follows the life of, surprisingly, a woman named Jane. She lives a harsh childhood, first in the hands of an unloving aunt and her abusive son and then later in the confines of the deteriorating Lowood school. She resides at the school for 8 years and realizes that she wants to experience more of the world outside of the Lowood school. Jane then works as a nanny at a place called Thornfield where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester.This love story is complicated and conflicted in that the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane is forbidden on more than one level.Jane Eyre was much more than I had expected. Although I enjoyed Wuthering Heights, I found Jane Eyre to be much more engaging. At many times, while reading this novel, I found myself completely frustrated yet intrigued and eager to continue at the same time. Bronte evokes such emotion in this novel, from the harsh realities of Jane's childhood to the whirlwind romance between her and her master. I found Mr. Rochester's courtship of Jane to be the most entertaining. I found Jane's confusion and reluctance to be frustrating, yet thought-provoking. And I found the separation of the two to be vexing and upsetting. Ironically, I found the ending to be strange, yet fitting in a story of constant ups and downs. It was an overall great read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I never thought myself the type to write a review for a book, but Jane Eyre presents itself as an exception. After reading the review below by a \\"teenager\\" I felt I, also being a teenager, must add a good word for this book, and for the teens out there who don't whine to their teachers when they try to share something great. I was 11 when I read Jane Eyre for a school book report of our choosing and was the first \\"real\\" book I ever read. It is the book that changed my gaze from the television screen to the written page. To this day, I prefer a book over a TV show any day, and I am 19. If it can do that for an 11 year old, I'm sure you will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read Jane Eyre for my AP Lit. Class in the 12th grade. I figured, oh just another boring book. WOW! was I completely mistaken. ALthough long, Jane Eyre could have been 1,000 pages and I still would have read every page, with joy. The growth Jane Eyre, the novels main character and Protagonist, goes through throughout the novel is amazing. Born into an unloving world, with rejection and anger at every corner, Jane is forced to keep herself company and therefore, her only friend is herself. Adopted by her uncle, who soon dies, Jane is forced to live with her aunt Reed. I dont want to summarize about all this stuff, I am going to get down to the nitty-gritty. The novel mainly centers around Jane and her love for Rochester. When Jane becomes eighteen, she is hired to govern at the mansion of Rochesters, and to guide and teach his daughter, Adele. The marvelous love story between Jane and Rochester is as intense as anything you will ever read. At times while reading the novel, I would have to put the novel down and take in what I was reading. The passion and heart exhibited by these two characters was at times unbearable. If you want to read a true novel, full of power and emotion, read Jane Eyre- the best novel ever written. :-)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I chose to read this novel over my spring break and it turned out that reading it was about the only thing I could do. Upon picking up the gargantuan book I was a bit wary of the read, but after reading the first paragraph I was enchanted and further lured on. Bronte did a wonderful - no - fascinating job of creating such a strong, honest, and demanding character as Jane Eyre. Even as an orphaned child, in the care of her abhored aunt Reed, Jane displays such an immense amount of passion and creativity. These characteristics are further refined and blended with a touch of integrity as Jane suffers through the ill-treatment and neglect that she receives at Lowood, a charity school that Mrs. Reed sends her to so to be corrected of her faults. After having spent nearly eight years enduring the ghastly conditions of Lowood, Jane leaves her old life behind so to fill the position of governess at Thornfield Hall. During here stay at the mansion, she is confronted by something she has been completely ignorant of before - love. Her dark and strong, though not handsome, master, Mr. Rochester, causes a hearty seed to implant itself within the unmoving foundation of her soul. This seed of love flourishes and intertwines Jane's emotion's with those of beloved Mr. Rochester. Though love is said to withstand and conquer all, a mysterious and horrifying obstacle challenges the bond that has developed between Jane and Mr.Rochester. As the battle is carried out, Jane's soul and destiny are both tried and tested, thus forming a truly moving and unforgetable novel. Charlotte Bronte's writing is one of intense passion - not just the violent emotion of love, but that of faithfulness and devotion to ones' self and to others. As you travel from page to page of Jane Eyre's life, you will be forced to take into consideration your own character and moral values. Although it was a rather extented read, I do not regret for one moment the time I spent indulging myself in this enticing piece of profound literature. I sincerely believe that all who take on the task of reading this novel will benefit by it in one aspect of their life or another."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I cringe as I read the reviews here that were written by children who were forced to read this in school. I can imagine feeling similarly if I had to trudge through this very long, mature novel with its outdated language and flowery descriptions as a teenager. However, as an adult, I loved the book. I do think it is overly long and could have done without some of the passages that describe the scenery. The best parts of this book are in Jane's elaborate, vivid thoughts and her interactions with the various people she meets. In a book that is less good, I would've taken away a star for the excessive scenic descriptions, but the best things about this book make up for that.Since there are already hundreds of reviews up here that go into what the story is about, I won't bother. What I will say is I am not generally a sentimental nor easily moved person, but I found this story very moving. I don't know if I'd recommend it to many men, and I'd probably not recommend it to anyone under 24. As an adult woman who spends much of her time lost in thought and doesn't always follow the most obvious path, I found it to be an excellent, engaging, and emotional read and am very glad I stuck with it until the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"There are many excellent books written about the human heart, but few writers master the artistry needed to combine both thought and dialog into a free flowing story that, filled with mystery and torment, capture the imagination as does Charlotte Bronte's tale of love and desire struggling upstream against the elements of life station, society's pressure, and mistakes made in youth that never lie in peace no matter how much time passes.Such is the novel Jane Eyre. I knew it was a Classic, and acknowledged it; I had seen several versions of the movies made of it, but did not recall having ever read the book as an adult. Written in 1847, it seemed something to watch on film, but not explore in the written word, as many such novels are difficult to read. Nothing could have been farther from the truth, and I was given an extraordinary literary experience once again by chance. It is particularly interesting given that this book was written by a woman at a time when license was thin; she managed not only to pull it off, but gave up nothing in the process while taking the reader to the smoldering destiny of what she intended to deliver.Jane Eyre is a hauntingly beautiful tale of a plain but highly mature and intelligent girl, shunned and unwanted by her family in her youth, much like the fairy tale of Cinderella. The reason for this travesty is finally delivered in the epilogue, yet it's integral importance yields completely to the unlikely romance that she finds as a result of it.She, frightened and alone but possessed of a courage and confidence that she will somehow prevail against her odds, is arranged a position as a governess for a mysterious, often absent gentleman of means who needs a tutor for his little girl. Upon arriving, she immediately senses there is a sinister intrigue surrounding the big house and it's inhabitants, but is too conscious of her place to be too inquisitive; beyond that, her sense of honor and integrity prevents any covert investigation on her part. But it is a place to flee from on occasion, and one night she leaves to send a letter out in the next town, which is a long walk through a dusky, cold winter's evening. There, on a lonely bridle path, she unwittingly meets the owner of the Estate, Edward Rochester - as he returns homeward, although in no glamorous way to be sure, as he has fallen off his horse and sprained his leg, all within her immediate vision. She come to his aid, helps him to his feet; and the first of the fateful encounters between a world-weary yet vital man and a much younger, guileless, yet very capable woman has come to be.The author waxes splendid in her descriptive paragraphs of the countryside and surroundings; of the morning mist shrouding the walks under the cherry trees in the old gardens surrounding the mansion; of moonlight shining in windows at night adding visuals as if by magic. But that's the periphery; the undercurrent of something else is running dark and deep. There is a secret hidden on the upper story, one that is closely guarded, yet threatens to expose itself continually, with the potential to destroy not only Mr. Rochester himself, but any chance for happiness he may decide to take.Rochester senses something out of the ordinary in the governess he has inherited by chance to educate and care for his child. The flighty little girl is the irritating and very tangible link to his past that brings him continual reminders of his \\"error\\" - yet has somehow been the vessel that brings about his emotional emancipation - through the hiring of Jane. And as Jane becomes acquainted with her benefactor, she realizes that despite his eccentricities, he is above other men in many, many ways, for even in her protected environment she has noticed his encouragement of equality for her; encouragement to speak her mind and reveal her thoughts to him. She is reluctant to do so, because she is wary of the differences in station between them, and realizes he has ultimate and enduring power over her. He cleverly attempts to seek out and determine ahead of time each of his moves toward his desires so that he may emerge to the next level unscathed.The idea flow is exquisite; articulate without a misstep anywhere in connecting her intricate plot with the characters and the moments that filter unerringly down to create the mood and the sensuality between the two unlikely lovers that are caught up in the vortex. The night the Gypsy arrives unbidden to the big house is a perfect example.The scene Jane endures with the \\"gypsy\\" in the parlor is truly one of a kind; I don't believe I have ever read anything quite it's equal for astonishing originality. The depth of emotional insight, passion, and fear of rejection and/or discovery is intensely woven into this particular part of the story in an unforgettable exchange of dialog and mental dueling; a subtle, ingenious breaking of barriers, of discovery without risk.Turn charlotte Bronte loose with word software on a computer with the literary license of today and one can't help but wonder just what form it would have taken. For certain though, it could not have been more masterfully written than was the \\"original.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I've seen meritorious film adaptations of JANE EYRE but never got around to actually reading the book until now. What I found was a strong-willed story that moves like a high-speed freight-train even in some long-winded passages. In the tradition of the best 19th century English fiction, the book possesses a sharp social eye, tinkers with narrative technique for great effect, endows settings with a character all their own, and deploys verbal and dramatic irony with abandon. It tells a whopper of a romance between two extraordinary people from the perspective of the title character, who survives every kind of hardship life has to throw her way but who never loses herself, even when she falls for Mr. Wrong-and-Right-at-the-same-time.This book must have knocked the socks off early Victorian England. Our heroine goes to great lengths to establish that she and Mr. Wrong/Right do not conform to the beauty standards of their world, and yet they are most attractive characters. Jane insists on being the captain of her fate, no subserviance to men, not even the one she loves. Mr. Wrong/Right who is no angel is still sympathetic. Probably the most startling theme Bronte sounds countermands her generation's zeigeist: don't marry for money, security and respectability, go for the soulmate no matter the cost. This is pretty bold stuff for the daughter of a clergyman.I won't get into the plot because the danger of spoilers lies in every twist. I will say that one of its climatic points bequeathed me a nightmare, such is the writer's spell. The film adaptations by their very nature cannot convey the written voice and by necessity they must conflate some characters and events to accommodate the flow of action. Watch the Orson Welles or the recent PBS version, both of which are nifty, but don't substitute them for the book, especially if you have to write a book report or pass a test on it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is an old friend by now.

Even though this was written so long ago - you can see how Jane is an equal match for modern women, who do not think that they need others to take care of them. The prose are beautifully written and even though I have seen three of the films, many times, the book is even better. The story takes you through Mr Rochester and on to her finding herself.

The narrative proceeds with great pace, just right, not too slow nor too fast. She'll take you to those great houses....those \\" Halls \\" ...

The young inexperienced girl had to earn \\"life out there in the real world\\" before she can actually be on the same level , (somehow) as Mr. Rochester.

While all the people associated with Christianity are shown in a negative light, Jane's search for freedom and willingness to forego comfort for truth inspired me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is an age-old book that remains a favourite.

Yet Jane Eyre transcends the thrilling parts of the book to become one of English's greatest novels.The novel is not without weakness; the entire St. John section is a bit overdramatic and somewhat contrived; yet it is essential to the novel not only for the symmetry but also to contrast a life that would only satisfy the flesh and sacrifice the soul (Mr. Rochester's proposal) versus a life sacrificing the flesh entirely for the sake of the soul (St. John.) Jane Eyre never falters from her conviction that, to be whole and true to oneself, both the spiritual and the carnal sides must be fulfilled. This was a daring proposal in Victorian England, and Jane Eyre was labeled \\"coarse\\" by one critic. Even more daring was that this philosophy was espoused by a woman writer, which is why Charlotte Bronte wrote the book under a gender-neutral pseudonym (Currer Bell.)Why should you read this classic? Initially, Jane Eyre can be enjoyed for its well-told and enjoyable story--very romantic and exciting. What makes Jane Eyre an enduring classic is that you can read it and re-read it many times over for the perfection of its structure. I have a hard time choosing between Jane Eyre and Eliot's Middlemarch as \\"best English novel.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is as perfect as a book can be. It's the wonderful, multi-layered story of a poor orphan who falls in love with a man of the British upper class.Jane Eyre is a fully-fleshed out character who is, in many ways, more modern than her nineteenth century counterparts. She is definitely a character to &quot;fall in love with&quot; and one that is truly unforgettable.Although some of the events in Jane Eyre are more than a little far-fetched, the plot is so enjoyable we can easily forgive Bronte a few minor faults. The pages simply fly by as we want to learn more about Jane and Mr. Rochester and their ultimate fate, both together and apart.Jane Eyre is a classic in every sense of the word and extraordinarily enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"but definitely for the more educated. If you don't appreciate literature, I would say...don't read it, you won't like it. I love it...it is my favourite book of all time, hands down, but from what I have read and heard from others, it seems that the a person merely looking for a feministic book, or something easy to read that dosn't take much intellect, would not like it at all. As far as the content.... Charlotte Bronte had such a grasp of the wonderful pathos that love can fill a person with, it's incredible. The characters are well-portrayed, and you really get to know Jane and Mr. Rochester, which is more I can say than many works of it's day. I would say that Jane Eyre is one of the ultimate triuphs of literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The search for freedom is a common underlying theme that can be found in many novels. Charlotte Bronte really emphasized this theme in Jane Eyre. This novel illustrates the path a strong young woman takes in her search for contentment. As she travels from place to place it becomes obvious that she is seeking a true home. The repetition of bird motifs throughout the novel is a device that accentuates the theme of freedom. In paying close attention to these motifs one can see that Jane is actually equated with a bird. Like a bird Jane Eyre is constantly in flight in search of her dreams. Her \\"spirit followed on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to and ideal Heaven\\" (333). The comparison of Jane to a bird, when understood, is very important to the overall meaning of the novel. At the time Charlotte Bronte wrote the novel her ideas were pretty radical, considering that it was unheard of for a woman to be independent and free willed, which are the key aspects of Jane Eyre's character. The romanticism and feminism of this novel is inspirational. I strongly recommend Jane Eyre to any woman who is not afraid to follow her own dreams."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"As an orphan, Jane has no money and no one to care for her. After enduring hardships with an aunt who doesn't love her and struggling at a strict boarding school, Jane has come to a place where she may be able to find happiness and love. This novel starts out slow, but the action picks up, developing the romance and the mystery in the novel. Charlotte Bronte uses imagery and numerous allusions in the novel. The most notable allusion is the bird allusions. This bird motif suggests freedom or independence, specifically, the independence of Jane. This theme, on a broader scheme, suggests women's independence, a subject that is not uncommon, but unorthodox at this time period. Another common allusion is a biblical allusion. These set a religious tone in the novel. Not only does Bronte allude to the Bible, she also uses religion to play a role in the development of Jane, most notably the religious boarding school and St. John Rivers. These things seem to have a negative effect on Jane, which cause her to sometimes stray a bit from religion. Even though she is negatively effected by those two elements, Jane still has religious morals that are found in the novel. Jane is honest and is not afraid to speak her mind to anyone. One can find many elements that make this book enjoyable and well worth reading. Even though starting out slow, the action intensifies with plot twists and suspense that make one rush to finish this novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Don't let the title of this review deceive you. I really enjoyed this book, very much. It does, however, follow a strikingly familiar formula, as do many of the &quot;strong heroine&quot; novels of the nineteenth century.Jane Eyre is a girl orphaned at a young age. She endures a very Dickensian treatment at the all-girls orphanage she is relegated to by her less than sympathetic relations, after being branded a trouble-maker, and having a bad character, and a deceitful dispostion.She survives the orphanage, only to be enlisted in the employ of a Mr. Rochester, as tutor and nanny to his charge, Adela. She is at once intrigued, if not a bit repelled by his brusque nature, and yet finds herself falling in love with him.Jane is caught up in the mystery of the 'tenant' on the third floor, a dangerous, diabolical person who places Jane's life, as well as Rochester's, in jeopardy, as Jane goes about her duties, all the while growing more and more amorous of Rochester.Eventually the identity of the 'tenant' is revealed, and Jane must chose between love and sense of duty. Being the forthright person that she is, she of course chooses duty, much to the heartbreak of both herself and Rochester, who has grown as enamored of this plain, headstrong creature as she has of him.Jane Eyre plays out in a very formulaic manner, much like many novels of the same ilk, but it is a wonderful read. The characters are engaging and entertaining. The story holds a few twists and turns, and delivers a very well-realized conclusion.For anyone who had this book thrust upon them in their teens, give it another try. For those who did not, it is well worth a first look."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Reviewers may say that as an author, Charlotte Bronte does not quite equal the best classical writers, or that her plot is too contrived, or that her dialogue is too stilted. None of these things matters, because in Jane Eyre, Bronte created a character whom I believe has no equal in fiction.Jane Eyre is a survivor in an age much more merciless than today. Condemned and degraded as a little girl by adults she trusted, she never loses her grip on her self-respect. Although she is reviled by her guardians and boarding school authorities, she retains not only her belief in herself but her innate goodness. Instead of returning harsh treatment with bitterness, she develops a character containing equal parts of toughness and kind benevolence.Her integrity is perceived by an employer whose deepest need is to recapture his own integrity, which he believes lost. Jane's guarded response to him forms much of the book's plot. Jane emerges quietly triumphant in a world in which she encountered hostility and love and ignorance and enlightenment, and met it all head on."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"...and that's saying a lot coming from me. I read about 2 books a week but none has captured me the way &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; has. Many of the reviewers here have said that the vocabulary is difficult but this is what makes Charlotte Bronte such a fabulous writer. She was a poet before a novelist and all of her dialogue is written in prose. I've seen the Orson Welles version of this movie but a movie couldn't possibly do justice to this book. Ms Bronte not only relates us to Jane Eyre but with the prosaic descriptions she allows the reader to feel what Jane Eyre feels. Also, the book is timeless...unrequited love, jealousy, rage, passion..will never go out of style which is why even readers 100 years from now will still be unable to put this book down. I've recommended this book to my daughter as my mother has recommended this book to me and as her mother recommended to her. I know this book will continue being passed from generation to generation and I plan on reading it a second time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I have previously reviewed Jasper Fforde's The Eyre Affair and stated that although I had never read Jane Eyre, I enjoyed Fforde's take on it. I had also prided myself on never having read recreationally anything that could be considered literature that wasn't required for school. I started Jane Eyre with the attitude that I'll read it until I get bored, then stop. I didn't get bored. Charlotte Bronte created a masterpiece that kept me enthralled from start to finish. There was crime, passion, mystery and women's rights rolled into one effort. For the era in which it was written, Jane Eyre was an amazing book showing a woman of intelligence and strong character. Now I have to reread The Eyre Affair to really appreciate it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The first time I had ever heard about Jane Eyre I was a senior in high school, and no it was not required reading. I feel as though more and more the school systems are moving away from great literary classics. I for one did not read very many, and as an English major in college, I find I have to do a lot of catching up on my classics . . . but that's a totally different topic.I saw very early on in Jane Eyre a sort of Cinderella story unfolding, and it turned out to be very close to the story, however it was by no means exactly like the Disney version everyone knows. I loved her struggle, independence and stop-at-nothing-to-be-happy-and-fulfilled drive to change her life. At first I was angry with her for leaving Rochester, but then I felt respect for her because she was just standing up for her morals and values. Plus, it all turns out happy in the end!The one part of the novel I was unhappy with was when she runs off into the country side and coincidentally discovers her long lost cousins, the Rivers. This part of the book is very dry and dull in my opinion. It also gets creepy when her male cousin St. John tries to marry her. Yuck! But, going through that section makes the ending that much more enjoyable and happy. Some men may not like the end, but it is very beautiful and romantic. Cinderella gets her prince. This is a great feminist novel as well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I had never seen any of the movies before I read the book, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about since the newestJane Eyre [Blu-ray] came out.Jane Eyrehas now become one of my favorite novels. It's great literature, written very beautifully and in which every sentence, every chapter is important to the events in the book. When Jane Eyre begins telling the reader her story, you're immediately drawn in. The book wasn't that difficult for me to read--I occasionally had to look up some words on my Kindle's built in dictionary and I know absolutely no French (some characters speak sentences/words in French, but it's very minor), however this didn't take away from the beauty of the book at all.The whole romance between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is amazing. It's definitely not trashy...it's classy and sophisticated...it's romantic.Charlotte Bronte evens manages to weave in a deep mystery at Thornfield Hall, done VERY successfully. I love mysteries and I had my own hypothesis of \\"who-done-it\\" and why, and was WRONG. I love that.I don't want to give anything away, if you're a new reader like I was. The movies do not even compare to the book (I went to compare as soon as I finished the book); the book is so much better, it's a delicious classic to read. I was very sad to finally put the book down when I was finished. Jane Eyre is a must read, and definitely a re-read. One of my top favorite books now.For Kindle readers: There are little to no errors in the Kindle Edition ofJane Eyre. Reading on the kindle definitely took out the anxiety factor of reading a thick book. No TOC. The only thing that slightly bothered me was instead of having the whole name of a city/town/county that ended in \\"shire\\" it was presented as \\"---shire\\". But not a huge dealbreaker considering it's free. I'm not sure if this is how it was supposed to be presented or not."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I have to say I am truly surprised. This is the third time I've read Jane Eyre, and yet the first time I've found anything positive about the experience. I read it once as an 11/12 year old because my mother bought me a lovely red leather-bound edition (apparently she loved the book and thought I would too). I hated it- too hard to read, too much philosophical rambling, no action, annoying heroine, etc. I read it for the second time as a freshman in high school because it was required. I no longer found it hard to read, but I still found Jane annoying and unsympathetic, and I still hated the book.Fast forward to this year and my decision to revisit the classics, including giving Jane Eyre one last try before forever consigning it to the \\"I just don't understand how people can like this book\\" pile. All I can say is thank goodness I gave it that one last try because the book is a masterpiece. All the philosophical rambling that bored me before is now a central element to the text, superior in many way to the storyline itself. I see now that there is a lot of action for a book of its time, and Jane is certainly not annoying so much as she is inspirational. I mean, she is still a bit pious for my taste, but even so she rebels strongly against the conventions of her time to try to live a life that she finds both emotionally and spiritually satisfying.All of the things that annoyed me when I read this book as a child are the elements that resonate most strongly with me as an adult. I read this book too early, and was too dismissive of it at the time. Like with Anna Karenina, I saw everything in black and white with the merciless clarity of a teenager; I now understand how wonderfully shaded with grey life (and good literature) often is. If you haven't read Jane Eyre since high school, I highly recommend giving it another try- definitely a 5 star!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I remember that I read Jane Eyre back in high school... This time, it was completely different!! I can only guess that, as a teen, I was impatient for action, and skipped over large parts, not taking the time to truly read the book.This is a very absorbing tale! Yes, it is clear that it was written from a very non-modern outlook, and that it is not completely timeless. However, it is also clear just how different this character is from the norms of her time. The characters and their personalities are clearly drawn, and it is easy to see that they broke the mold then, and that they still break the mold now.I ended up re-reading the book immediately after finishing it. It remained fresh and fascinating. What a great book! No wonder Jasper Fforde chose this for Thursday Next's first adventures..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I have just finished reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte for the fifth time in my life. I find that every time I read this book I learn something new or interpret a scene differently. I have read this book during all different phases of my life and I find that through every reading I am completely affected with the story even though I know exactly what is going to happen.The premise of the book everyone knows, our story is about the life of Jane Eyre through her childhood living at the home of her aunt who doesn't love or want to keep her to her adult years as governesses for the ward of Mr. Rochester of Thornfield Hall. Jane develops a relationship with her employer that soon blossoms into a fierce love but Mr. Rochester has a secret that he is keeping from Jane that threatens to rip everything apart leaving Jane utterly homeless and alone.This book has been talked about time and time again and I think one of the main reasons it stands the testament of time is that Charlotte Bronte creates a heroine who is so easy to sympathize with and Jane's connections with her audience is felt throughout the entire book and begins on the first page. This to me is the best thing about the book because we know exactly how Jane thinks, and feels and we come to love and adore her for her plainness, intelligence, and spirit. Of course it also helps that our hero Mr. Rochester is so attractive with his brooding, temperamental personality but he is one of my favorite male characters in all of literature because he is so developed I can picture him perfectly in my mind. Every young woman dreams of meeting their Mr. Rochester because he loves Jane with a passion that is hard to believe could exist. So I highly recommend reading this novel because I think it deserves all of the attention it gets. Charlotte Bronte is a master storyteller and uses such elements of horror to create a timeless gothic romance novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Though it took me a while to find the time to read this lengthy tome, I am so glad I did, because I absolutely adore this novel. I loved the story, the characters, the blend of romance, mystery, and gothic elements--in short, I loved everything about it!The story is a fictional memoir, which narrates the life of Jane Eyre from the age of 10 to about age 19. We follow Jane from her miserable childhood living with an aunt and three cousins to her sojourn in a charitable boarding school for girls, and then to her station as a governess (at age 18) in the country estate of Mr. Rochester. I will not spoil any of the plot twists (if you don't already know them), for there are several and they make the story truly compelling. Jane herself is an immensely likeable protagonist, right from the start. Even at the tender age of 10, she is full of spirited passion, which makes her real and believable. She grows up before her reader's very eyes, and for me, it was a pleasure to watch her development as a person and character.It has been a long while since a \\"classic\\" work has so absorbed my attentions and thoughts. Once I found the time to read it, I raced to reach the book's conclusion, and then I was sad when I finished the final page--which to me is always the mark of a truly great book!

At first glance, some people might think this is a cheesy love story, but it's not. It is very much a love story but actually a REALLY GOOD one!! I love the main character Jane Eyre and how she's able to be humble and respectful, at the same time growing in the story and speaking her mind when she needs to, standing up for herself. The story flows soooo well and takes you on a journey that is brave, devastating and beautiful all at the same time.Charlotte Bronte, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't written too many novels, but she didn't even need to. This book stands on its own and I can call her one of my favorite writers of all time, solely based off this one book.

This novel was written and published in the 1840's, well before women were conceived to be \\"gifted\\" enough to command an audience. In fact, all the Bronte sisters published under male pseundoyms (Currier Bell, Acton Bell, etc.) in order to be considered serious writers.This novel is a story about enduring character and its ability to strive for the unattainable and inconceivable. A poor orphan raised by an aunt and uncle, Jane is schooled in a loveless environment of neglect. She graduates from this dreary environment and is hired by Rochester to tutor his ward, Adele.The employer-employee relationship between Rochester and Jane grows into a solid friendship. From there, it graduates to love. Unfortunately, there is a shadow over this relationship that precludes a happy ending and Rochester's past comes to haunt him. Fortunately, Jane's strength and enduring character help Rochester surmount his painful past.

It was extremely difficult to get through the book because not only was the plot an absolute bore, the characters also contributed to that boredom.After reading the book twice, trying to comprehend what was the point of the story, I still have yet to understand why Charlotte Bront even bothered writing this book. From what I can interpret, Jane Eyre is a girl who is lonely and dejected but finds love in a man called Mr. Rochester. Everything that happened in the middle is not significant. The story is extremely boring because it is too sentimental, too dull (just like Jane Eyre), and too long for a story with that plot line. What the characters say or do have no lasting effect in the reader's memory- it just blows right by. The characters are basic and have superficial, unoriginal motives. They do not do anything exciting or significant to help add to the plot. I kept skipping pages or rereading the same stuff because each and every page seems identical content-wise. The entire book has absolutely no memorable moments, proving how insignificant the work of literature truly is.

Going to college after all of these years I have to watch my pennies."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is the first book I have read by the Bronte's, and I have heard that it is the best. I certainly thought that it was very good. The main character is not like any other heroine which I can think of. She was not beautiful like most, nor extremely cunning. Somehow Bronte manages to develop her personality perfectly, and gets you to like this Jane Eyre, though she is probably the only one in the story who you will like. Bronte makes all of the other characters extremely one sided in their personalities, all dominated by a fatal flaw of some type (the domineering spirit of Mr. Rochester, the extreme sacrafice of emotion by Saint John, the extreme simplicity of Mrs. Fairfax, etc.) This was both good (in that it helps one to see that nearly any character trait can be taken too far and become bad) and bad (the characters were rather stiff somehow).The only other complaint that I have is that it was a bit long and drawn out. Somehow it should have been about 50 pages shorter, though I am not quite sure where the 50 pages should be cut from. It seemed almost like too little butter scraped over too much bread."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read this book in high school and liked it a lot..

Her mixed life mingles between feeling sorry for her orphaned self and trying to be a romantic wife to Mr. Rochester. The novel, Jane Eyre, is an excellent work of Charlotte Bront not only because of the work itself, but because it is a relation to herself as an autobiography. Charlotte Bront was not that much different than the main character, Jane Eyre, in that they both lived without parents and they both know what loss can be like. The book flows eloquently from start to finish and contains many life morals concerning pride, love, and what it takes to live in this world. Jane Eyre shows how one can mature in to the person that they will be for the rest of their life. Because of this book, my life has been enlightened with good morals and I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book is about Jane who is an orphan. When she grew up she found a job as a governess at Thornfield and fall in love with Mr. Rochester, who kept a terrible secret.Maybe it's because I'm only 10 years old,but I found this book rather [odd] and not very romantic at all"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The book Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte is about a girl who is about ten years old, and she lives with her aunt, cousins because her parents had died when she was young. Her cousin John, who is the master of the house, always harasses her. Jane leaves to go to school, and then she put an ad in the newspaper. A lady named Mrs. Fairfax comes to take her to where she works so Jane can live with them. Jane is a governess who teaches a little girl named Adele. When the master of the house, Mr. Rochester, comes and Jane starts to like him. Jane is eighteen when she went to live at the house in Thornfield.After Jane has been at the Thornfield house for so long she gets a letter saying that her aunt is dying. So Jane goes to her aunts house before her aunt goes and stays for a little bit until she has to get back to work at Thornfield. After that she leaves Thornfield and found a nun who knew her parents. Jane heads back to Thornfield and falls in love and almost marries. But then she finds her self-alone and penniless, then Jane finds that she is rich. The book is good and exciting until the end because of what happens to Jane in the novel.The book has a lot of mystery like when Jane had to put out a fire in Mr. Rochester's bedroom, and romance. In the book in the beginning there is discrimination against woman's rights when master John hurts Jane with his bare hands, this book does have woman's rights in the beginning and in the middle of the book. This book is interesting because it was very expressive of how a teenage life is through this book. The reason why it is so expressive is that the book drags out a teenager life of how problems come and go around. When they explain what is going on in the story with Jane the author explains the weigh she takes the problem in the novel.This book would be really good for people who like love stories and mysteries all in one. This book is a good for maybe teens to high school or even the beginning college students that what a adventure or two with the love and passion in the novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok and it was free so not too bad"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Now this was a real surprise - a &#34;classic&#34; that was worth reading.

Never had to at school, like so many people I know, so I had a totally open mind. I love Wuthering Heights, by sister Emily, and I was sort of expecting something of the same calibre. Maybe it is because Jane Eyre is more from the romance genre... I am not so sure. I certainly don't think that Charlotte's writing is anything near her sister's. I also find that there are two stories in Jane Eyre - the main one with Mr Rochester, and the second one with St Johns, and I found them slightly disjointed. Don't get me wrong, it is a classic, and I can see why it has so many admirers - but it is definitely not my favourite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I don't know how I missed reading Jane Eyre before this, and fully expected to love every moment of the book.

The Penguin Classic differs slightly from the Norton Edition (which was assigned), so I found myself looking in the text for further detail, but it is the same story.

I have only read one of the books (Wuthering Heights) and I liked it. I was planning on giving these as gifts, but now I am going to keep them! My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more \\"vintage-y\\" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I found this book shoved under my bed last week...it's been there since I was in high school (apparently it never got returned to the school...)I remember starting to read it 6 years ago and only got about five pages in before I lost interest and tossed it aside. However, I started it again a few days ago and completely fell in love. I love the prose, the plot, everything. I just can't keep myself away from it. Bronte's writing style is so poetic and beautiful that the story itself could be absolute trash and I would still love this book.Thankfully, though, the novel is not a load of tosh and the story itself is engaging beyond belief. Jane is left with her uncle's wife when he forces her to care for her when he dies. She's cared for about like Harry is at the Dursleys and escapes to school. Unfortunately for Jane, Hogwarts does not await her, but a rather dreary school. She remains here for 8 years, first as a pupil, then a teacher. She later gains employment for a gentleman who pays her twice her wages at Lowood and there she meets the love of her life. Unfortunate events prevent them from marrying and she continues to seek a happy place and make her way. I won't give away more.If you like Austen you will love this book. It's got the characterization and insight of Austen's books with the adventure of a more modern novel. The average young male probably won't appreciate this particular book, but I advise women at least 16 and older to read it. It is absolutely fascinating and much better than the current pop-literature pumped out today."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre was long, wordy and old. It was a recipe for instant dislike. While I didn't love the book, I certainly enjoyed it. The character of Jane Eyre was upstanding and brave. She showcased many qualities women strive for and find hard to reach even today. Mr. Rochester was both off-putting and strangely likable at times. The mixture of drama, romance and a bit of mystery was engaging. While I often put the book down, I never once thought of not finishing it. A deserved classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's incredible to think or imagine that, of the two most intense, passionate heroines of 19th century literature, both would be written by sisters of the same family. But this is, indeed, the case. With Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, you are drawn into a personal narrative that from the start is compelling and becomes more disturbing and troubling. Many things have been written about Jane Eyre as a character, but to me there is no doubt that her intense character compels you to understand very specific and certain imperatives (nowadays described as feminist - then, Bronte was alone in imaginging it).The 19th century was a deeply moralistic society, at least on the surface, but one within and beneath which women as such had no identity or power beyond certain circumscribed roles (governess, wife, spinster, etc.). With Jane, you have a particular set of codes of behaviour that are radically established and are uncompromising about the male-dominated status quo: to cope with all circumstances without significant protest; not to give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; to speak up in situations involving the most appalling difficulties, when it matters; don't give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; ultimately, remain true to yourself. Such coda are radical not only in 19th century literature, but all literature before.Jane Eyre is a revolution in thinking and morality as far as male and female relationships are concerned. The only other novel that is as passionate, and as determined in thinking of the singular female self as Jane Eyre, is Emily Bronte's novel, Wuthering Heights, and her character, Catherine Earnshaw; yet Jane Eyre remains, through her novel, uncompromised of her own integrity and character, despite her circumstances et al. Catherine, according to Emily's narrative, is never given such a choice, or options of such freedom, i.e. independent female thinking.Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is an astonishing novel: besides Wuthering Heights, by her sister Emily, it is one of the most passionate, intense, uncompromising, painful, and beautifully and intensely emotionally sustained novels of all literature. An astonishing achievement, irrespective of genre, author or century."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I've watched the movie(s) over and over but have never read the book until now.I knew what was going to happen, and still I couldn't put it down.I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I loved this book so much, I have started everyone I know reading it!!

The dialogue that she would exhibit was far beyond her years, especially when she would go back and forth with Rochester. I was fascinated by just about everything Jane Eyre went through.It takes me a while to read books but it didn't take long for me to read \\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte. My daughter read it in grammar school and she enjoyed it, but I think I enjoyed it better because of the period it was set in and the way the story evolved.Whether you are in high school or an adult, if you like classic stories, I don't think you can go wrong with this classic romance novel.Kindle 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6\\" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Great read!

The book came in wonderful condition (considering its age). Could not be happier with this purchase!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Although classics are largely respected books for their ability to withstand the test of time, in most cases, these classics often seem overly erudite for most students. JANE EYRE seemed to, at first, embody the rather intimidating characteristics of a classic, but I later learned that it was my lack of experience, not my lack of old-English proficiency that hindered my true respect and understanding for the novel.Compared to other classics, such as the novels of Charles Dickinson, JANE EYRE presents itself in a more approachable style of writing. This helps readers of many different English proficiency levels be able to understand Jane Eyre's tragic events and unusual acquaintances.Despite the fact that many can grasp the literal meaning of the story, it takes a lot more experience and wisdom to be able to fully understand the underlying messages. Some themes that were hidden were the limitations of women in society and the conflict that people have to accept themselves.JANE EYRE, quite truthfully, was a rather slow and sometimes dull read for me. Although my first read was disappointing, I'm sure that I will be able to learn more from the novel when reading it in the future when I encountered different events and experiences. This unending learning that can be earned from reading classics is probably what justifies their endurance through continuous changes in culture and language. I highly encourage readers to read JANE EYRE periodically throughout their life because a new side of this book will be revealed every time it is read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"For me, the book was a little slow getting started.

I enjoy the older books better than most of the new ones."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Numerous movies have been made of this novel, or based in parts on the novel, and there is a reason why: it is a haunting, coming-of-age story, with a dark mystery and love story embedded within. Jane Eyre, who is shunted around due to her &#34;unladylike&#34; intelligence and strong sense of self, discovers love with her employer-the strange and moody Mr. Rochester. He is hiding a secret though, and it will threaten Jane's chance of happiness. Unlike many &#34;love&#34; stories from past and present however, Jane uses her inner-strength to succeed on her own, and sets the example for future &#34;strong women&#34; stories that have developed since this groundbreaking novel was written.The wordy descriptions and redundancy of some of the writing clearly dates this novel as a &#34;classic&#34; but do not let that scare you from reading. Having read this more than once, I like to skim much of it, including descriptions of her early years at the school Jane is sent to, for standing up for herself at the home she were she grew up. The descriptions DO set the mood for everything, but are still overly-wordy, which was the norm for this period of writing. One exception to this, is the novel &#34;Ivanhoe,&#34; set during the time of Robin Hood and written during the time of Queen Victoria's birth. Otherwise, as with the Bronte's works, you will deal with a lot of seemingly-useless descriptive paragraphs. AGain, it does set the mood though, and the writing itself is beautiful, even if it doesn't always forward the purpose of the story.This story is haunting, much like &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; but I prefer &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; any day for the sheer strength of the heroine, and the surprisingly moving passion of the star-crossed lovers."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"A good classic.

She still loved him as much as she did before, even when he was half blind, poor, and only had one hand. That's what you call true love.

My point of view changed as I realized that all of the families mentioned in the book are all dysfunctional, all of them had some sort of problem. I made this my thesis. In order to get the most out of this book, you must appreciate the detail of each thought that Charlotte Bronte put into text.

I mean, really a lot. I'll pick up a novel and finish it on the same day. Crime and Punishment? Took me half a day. Middlemarch? A day and a half.Because I read quickly, I tend not to be overly moved by the triumphs and travails of literary characters. I exult with them momentarily, but their brightness fades quickly once I set down the book.Jane Eyre was different. So many of the book's elements defied nineteenth century convention; so many of the book's elements set my heart racing and my mind on edge. The unexpected first person perspective. Charlotte Bronte's mesmerizing lyrical prose. The strength--or, as the British might say, the pluck--of the book's indomitable heroine. The tenacity of Jane's love for Rochester and the reciprocal power of his love for her.I don't often cry when I read novels, but for the last twenty pages of Jane Eyre, I read transfixed while tears streamed down my face. I doubt a novel has ever made a heroine come to life as vividly as did Jane Eyre.Read this book. Love it. Treasure every breathtaking passage and every witty turn of phrase. Watch as mere ink and paper breath life into Jane Eyre's heart--and your own."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"If you are a Jane Eyre fan, junkie, or a first time reader, this is a wonderful edition to pick up.

After recieving an ok education Jane goes to be a governess at Thornfield where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. Yet she is only a governess and Mr. Rochester is going to be married to someone else. Jane has to make him change his mind before the dreaded wedding date.I don't want to give too much away but there is a lot more to this story than the summary above. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I read some parts over and over again. Sorry guys but this is mostly romance and drama. How the author tells the story and the plot are very interesting. This book is considered a classic. All of the characters are explained in such detail. You have a connection with Jane Eyre. When I read the back of this book there was one sentence in particular that caught my attention. I hope that will help you in thinking about reading this book. Jane Eyre is now one of my favorite books.\\"Published in 1847 under the pen name Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine- one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect, and tireless perserverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved.\\"That sentence and the quote at the top describe Jane Eyre best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Although I found this novel a bit too windswept, making it hard to turn the pages in an orderly fashion, I was awe-struck by its darkly gothic mood, the barely suppressed passions of its characters, and the threat of violent transgression that seems to haunt every scene like a towering shih-tzu.My gym teacher used to warn me about books like this. One morning after dodge-ball, he pulled me aside, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, \\"Son, I know your English teacher is having you read a lot of gothic Victorian novels about frightened young women who fall for mysterious, unattainable men with a dark side...\\" He leaned down and looked me straight in the eye. \\"You know I'm worried, don't you. I'm worried about your manhood. I'm worried you're going to waste that great gift you've been given, that great dodge-ball arm, and just -- \\"Oh forget it. I'll save the rest of this story for my therapist."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Word has it that \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most imitated novels in literature, having almost singlehandedly spawned the genre of romantic fiction which supplies all those erotic-looking pulp paperbacks you see next to the magazine rack at the supermarket. What I found in Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece, however, was a smart, resolute, and independent heroine who stands out like a beacon in a sea of Victorian fictional women. As if obeying some sort of literary convention, the book does have a sad beginning and a happy ending, but in between there are some very rich surprises: moments of mystery, tension, and ghostly images, delivered in a tightly paced narrative.Jane Eyre is an orphan who has spent the first ten years of her life with a mean aunt who mistreats her and the next eight years at a miserable school for indigent girls called Lowood. With this education, she qualifies herself as a teacher and secures a position as a governess at a house called Thornfield Hall. Her employer is a man twice her age named Edward Rochester, and her charge is his ward, a little girl of French parentage named Adele.Given that Jane soon falls in love with him, it might be guessed that Rochester is a dashing, noble, gallant gentleman; but no: He is unattractive, eccentric, shifty, assumes disguises, and rarely gives a straight answer to a question. These might merely be manifestations of a quirky, enigmatic personality, or maybe he is so evasive because he is hiding something from his past -- as indeed he is, and that \\"something,\\" incriminating and dangerous, is locked up in Thornfield Hall, unknown to Jane and most of the servants.Rochester falls in love with Jane, too, despite his apparent attention to a conceited society woman named Blanche Ingram. After a short courtship and a marriage proposal, however, Jane breaks off with him when she discovers his secret. Abandoning Thornfield Hall for a new life, she meets a young parson named St. John Rivers who is planning to go to India to do missionary work and would like to marry her because he thinks she too would make a good missionary. Thus, she has had to reject two men in her life: the first because he was not honest with her and made her feel used and deceived; the second because he is not looking for a wife, but a co-worker.Jane is not foolish, but she is human. That she returns to Rochester does not mean she has decided to accept his faults, but that she realizes they have developed that special kind of mutually dependent relationship that only two people who are truly in love may foster. By the end of the novel, Rochester loses a great deal because of his mistakes, and Jane's love is his only redemption; Jane, on the other hand, gains much because of the strength of her character, and Rochester's love is the fulfillment of her desire."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The book, Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is considered to be a work of genius, and with good reason. The story revolves around the life of an orphan, Jane Eyre, living in England in the 1900s. The book starts out during her childhood, when she lived with her cruel Aunt Reed and cousins Georgiana, John, and Eliza, and her years at the Lowood School as both a student and a teacher. Then, Jane takes a job as a governess at Thornfield Hall. When she lives there, she falls in love with her master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and they plan to marry. But Jane's happiness is destroyed when she learns of the horrible secret Mr. Rochester has keeping from her, and she leaves him. A few years pass, and Jane is now the head master at a small school, when she learns that she has cousins who are still alive, which is very important to her. She lives with her cousins for awhile, but eventually returns to the love of her life, Mr. Rochester, because she misses him. When she returns to him, she learns of the many bad things which have befallen him and Thornfield Hall, but in the end, she is very content with her life.This is an excellent book, especially because of the way the main character, Jane Eyre, is portrayed. She is not perfect, because she isn't very attractive, or very well liked. She is very shy and has many personality flaws, including \\"a wicked heart, especially for such a young girl\\" ( pg. 39). But she also has many good qualities about her; she is very kind and humble. The book provides just the right balance of good and bad to make Jane Eyre a very real and likeable character. Another reason why Jane Eyre is such a great book is because although it is very long, over 600 pages, the book moves very quickly, and there are almost no long portions of the book where nothing happens. Anytime there was a lull in the book, a major event would occur and the plot would move quicker, thus making the book seem shorter than it really was. Another reason why this book was so good was that it was a great picture of life for women in the 1900s. The book really showed that all that most women possessed was there title, and if they lost that, then they had nothing. However, Jane Eyre managed to rise above this, and in the end, the book's moral was about rising above your position in life, so that you could be truly happy.However, some people might disagree with my view on this book. Jane Eyre is at times a very sad book, and not everyone likes a sad book. Although Jane is generally happy, there is always a touch of sadness in her words and actions, which is why not everyone would agree with my review. However, there is plenty of good to out way the bad. This is a very interesting and compelling book which is very highly recommended. The plot is full of interesting people and places, it is written beautifully, and is a definite must read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"A Realistic, Relatable Fairy Tale, by Michelle Giullain, student of Professor SWILUASome people never get sick of fairy tales. I, for one, have an incredible ability to hear the same story over and over again and never tire. Every once in a while, though, I crave something a little more realistic, while still maintaining that fairy tale \`happily ever after' ending. It is hard to appeal to both sides of the spectrum, but Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre accomplishes this daunting task. Though it does have the typical fairy tale ending, it is a novel the audience can relate to. Instead of a fairy tale princess, Jane Eyre is the fairy tale story of a plain girl who faces real struggles. Bronte's realistic, relatable characters who face normal struggles allow the reader to relate to the novel, making it a book that will be thoroughly enjoyed for years to come.The characterization Bronte uses is truly genius, combining archetypal characters with human flaws. Oddly enough, it contains some of the fairy tale archetypes we are oh so familiar with, the evil stepmother and stepsisters. In this case, it is an abusive aunt and her spoiled children, but they fulfill the same role. Other archetypes, such as the sacrificial best friend, Helen Burns, and the crazy ex, Bertha, all show up in the novel. It speaks to the reader's emotions, because everyone has and archetypal figure in their life of some form. Whether or not you have an evil stepmother, or mother in law, it is comforting to read about other people who go through the same struggles as you, especially if your ex is still haunting you.Additionally, the characterization of the protagonist, Jane Eyre, gives the reader a direct connection to the novel. Her imperfections are what make her so perfect. Her outside appearance pales in comparison to the beautiful princesses, literally. Her pale skin and her plain face do not match the description of the usual princess. But, because Jane is not perfect, the audience can relate to her. Not many of us look just like a princess, have a castle, or a fairy godmother to grant our every wish. When we read about someone who isn't that beautiful, those who feel they are not as beautiful as Cinderella have someone to relate to. However, it is not only the outer appearance that makes Jane so ideal. She also has character flaws. She does not posses the patience to tame a beast, like Belle, or Snow White's affinity to the caretaking of small innocent creatures. Rather, her honesty and stubbornness, un-princess like qualities, show that she is human. She is not entirely confident in herself and feels loneliness. In her own words, \\"I abhorred myself...I was hateful in my own eyes\\" (329). Though we may not loathe ourselves all of the time, there are many instances in which a normal human in the normal world would not like themselves. This additional perspective into the imperfect Jane helps the reader connect to the book.Bronte also makes the other character's flaws apparent, especially in the man Jane comes to love. Prince not-so-charming, Rochester, has his own flaws inside and out. He, like Jane, is not beautiful, dashing, or handsome. He is rustic, unrefined, and unkind and that is not all. He tries to control Jane's actions and play with her mind. He has hidden baggage, too. His crazy wife, Bertha, is locked up in his attic. By the end, however, he has proven that he is a good person, just like Jane. He heroically tries to save his servants and crazy wife from his burning house, and loses an eye in the process. The key to the audience connection is the imperfection of not only Jane, but also Rochester. For, how possible would it be that Jane could find a dashing prince charming when she is not beautiful? And if Rochester were handsome, why would he pursue a relationship with a plain Jane? The two is absolutely perfect for each other. To the reader, it makes perfect sense that these two imperfect characters should get together. And, it might even remind them of their own romantic endeavors, or give them a little hope for the future.Beyond the imperfect characters, the relationship between the characters also contributes to the appeal to the audience by creating even more reality amid a fairy tale story. The Rochester-Jane romance is not a love at first sight experience, even though she does sweep him off his feet. (Actually, his horse slips on the ice the first time they cross paths, but that is not really the same thing). Though Prince Charming and Cinderella lacked a bit of communication, they never had any significant relationship problems. Snow white didn't even need to meet her Prince. One kiss and he made her feel alive. However, like most human relationships, Jane and Rochester fight, argue, feel jealously and hurt. They keep secrets and experience disappointments. Rochester invites a party of beautiful women to his house to make Jane jealous. Then, on the morning of their wedding, she finds out that he has a wife in the attic. Jane then runs away because she cannot bear the thought of being a mistress to Rochester. Rochester is devastated and almost gives up living because he has lost Jane. Though they love each other, their relationship is not always perfect. Jane Eyre has no magic spells, princes, dragons, or balls. She has to deal with real life in the real world of relationships. Because this is more like the world we live in, the audience, who has likely experienced jealousy and conflict in a relationship, is able to see themselves in the story.Alas, all is well in the end, once the real life struggles are over. This fairy tale ending is the perfect finishing to the story, because it what the reader \`wants'. Though life doesn't always follow that pattern, sometimes it does. For Jane, something finally went right. Not many sentences in the novel provide as much joy as the simple declaration, \\"Reader, I married him\\" (462). Jane Eyre finds the love she has always wanted, and the reader, at that moment, experiences a small moment of triumph. That moment is the defining emotional moment of the novel, and what makes this novel so appealing to an audience. But, that is the same with any fairy tale.Because Jane Eyre does not simply focus on the \`happily ever after', but integrates the story into a complicated and realistic plot, it is a more believable story. The book does not begin or end with the usual \`Once upon a time\\" and \\"Happily ever after\\", nor does it focus on the marriage and courtship between the two characters. Jane has struggles throughout the novel, from the abusive cousins to the malnutrition at school to nearly dying from exhaustion. Even after she marries Rochester, she must deal with a blind husband who is an emotional wreck. With small triumphs are placed intermittently between many struggles, it reflects what life is like for the audience, and anyone who lives in the real world, for that matter. Jane may have struggles, but she sees the fulfillments of her dream.Ultimately, those who live in the real world have the opportunity to escape into a book that isn't just about some perfect fictional character in a far away kingdom. Jane Eyre is about the same world we live in because it presents the struggles many of us face, and the triumphs that even plain Jane can experience. No matter what time you may be reading this novel, the breadth of the archetypes and the imperfections of the characters give you the opportunity to enjoy and relate to this beautifully crafted novel. If you have not had the privilege to read this book, do so at once! You will be rewarded by one of the most enriching and inspiring books out there."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is my favorite book so far.

I just wanted Jane to go away. I wanted it resolved, but quickly. I was becoming quickly agitated and annoyed. But still, as angered as I was towards the ending (by the way, I didn't care for the deal with the Rivers family at all), the beginning was so majestic I just couldn't insult it too much.

I liked Jane Eyre as a main character better than Catherine from Wuthering Heights because Jane was more compassionate. I also liked her because of her intriguing personality. From the beginning she sets herself as different from other people, more hardy and thoughtful. Her stay at Lowood is interesting, mainly because of her relationship with Helen and the contrast between the two. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is original. Some of that is due to the fact that Jane falls in love without being made foolish by it. Her stay with the Rivers family was sort of frustrating, because her character was suppressed by St. John. I really didn't like him. The ending was very good except for the last few paragraphs which dwell on St. John.

In Jane Eyre, everything is pure, and the love is passionate without anything you'd be embarrassed to tell your parents about. The characters are likeable - I found myself rooting for the protagonsits, hoping Jane and Mr. Rochester would wind up togther no matter how many obstacles they may come across.

I too read this book for school, but began about six months before it was due. I think it is truly one of the most beautiful books I have ever read, with strong messages about human behavior..Jane, despite difficult beginnings in her life, became the strongest, most loving charcter in the book. Who really cares that she fell in love with an &quot;old guy?&quot; Here's a newsflash..he was only in his thirties or forties, and that isn't so old. Jane found love, and that's a bigger accomplishment than a lot of us can claim. Try Jane Eyre again some other time if you're up against a deadline..details are not evil, description is not boring. If the rest of the world says Jane Eyre is a classic, although you are entitled to your own opinion, there's a good chance it is. And one more thing-&quot;renting the movie&quot; and buying &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot; are not alternative options to reading a novel. To think that taking shortcuts in reading for school assignments is an advantage, is to fool yourself. I had a teacher give a pass/fail test in which the true/false questions relied solely upon the differences between a book and the movie made after it. Something to think about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's moving and is the best love story I've ever read. Bronte vividly draws out Jane's independence and love for Rochester. Her love for him was pure and perfect but when she found out his dark secret this perfection was shattered.

The beginning was hard to get though and I put it aside until it was almost due. The middle went through nice enough to what seemed a perfect happy ending, until you get to the wedding. After that it starts getting really good! I gave this only four stars because I'm not big on love stories, but other than that disadvantage-and the boring beginning-this is an excellent book! You have to read it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I thought I'd be sucked into another boring nineteenth century novel when I started this book my freshman year. However, I was drawn to the uncoventional love story of Mr. Rochester and Jane. Jane's strong spirit and self-dignity is very unlike the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; portrayed in most of these romantic novels. This is a novel not to be read, but to be experienced."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"A WOMEN'S MASTREPIECE&quot;Dear Reader&quot;- Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre was a milestone for English Literature as we know it. The fact that this captivating novel was written by a 19th century women only enhances it's genius. Charlotte Bronte acted as a trailblazer for all the women authors that would follow her; her unique style of writting and the essence of her characters stimulates the interests of every individual who reads even one line. Jane Eyre is a romantic novel about an innocent girl's voyage through life. The main character,Jane, is a orphan who we are introduced to as she is living in a house full of cruelty. The home belongs to a sour, cold women called Mrs. Reed and her three aggressive children. &quot;He bullied me and punished me ; not two or three times a week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually : every nerve I had feared hom, and every morsel of flesh on my bones shrank when he came near.&quot; Mrs. Reed's son John's treatment of jane caused harsh and long-lasting effects. The family's unjustifiable hatred for Jane results in her being sent to a distant school. Lowood is a cold, and gloomy institution for girls. Its routines are militay, its teachings are restrictive, and its conditions are horrible. She attends this school for eight years during which she excels in her studies as well as in sense. Despite the unsettled environment of Lowood, Jane enjoys her time spent there and more importantly cherishes the friendships made there. This is the place where Jane meets her first true friend Helen Burns. It is through helen's example that jane learns to be patient, diligent and expressive. &quot;Her (Helen) soul sat on her lips and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell.&quot; After eight years, Jane desires to move on in life. jane is now educated, confident and ready for change. After advertising for a teaching position, Jane accepts an offer to be a governess at Thornfield. Thornfield is a grand, old estate surrounded by the lonely moors of England. Her motive for going to Thornfield is to instruct the vibrant, young pupil Adele. The immense events and heart wrenching romance that she encounters there change her intentions quite dramatically. Jane's relationship wiht the dark and tortured owner of Thornfield, Mr. Rochester, forms the foundation of Jane's womanhood. The most unique aspect of this romance is the heroine's response to love. the majority of romance novels present a similar picture of love's hold on womane. they become increasingly more like the men they love and less like themselves. they grow weaker, more compliant and vulnerable. However, this novel's heroine does not conform but rather defies the expected. Jane discovers her love for another through the discovery of the love for herself. &quot;Women feel just as men feel.&quot; It would be pure arrogance and a literary sin if I were to describe what happens within the hidden walls of Thornfield. For this novel's majety lies not only within it's story but in the actual words of Charlotte Bronte. The way she can so vividly depict a scene or how she so clearly desribes love is a wonder. &quot;I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspects, and life in its colour: and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the front of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.&quot; Charlotte Bronte had the gift of being able to capture emotion and reflect it on paper; making the image more enticing than the subject. i strongly recommend this book to anyone who has a hunger for passion, a thirst for excitement and a desire for intellect. You are not only given complete enjoyment from this novel, but a life lesson as well. This lesson implies that the only thing that matters is that you are true to yourself and to what you love. This is a lesson that you can carry with you on your own journey through life, as Jane Eyre did."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I was at first really absorbed in reading the parts that had to do with Jane's childhood. I did not miss a word of it. However, I found the parts after she became a governess a bit boring. I had a hard time with her falling head over heels with Mr. Rochester. He is too cold and self absorbed. Not the chivalrous hero of most fairy tales. His personality doesnt change one iota despite all of the things he has been through. I never ever see a resolve where he loves and accepts Adele. I thought that his indifference toward Adele was one of the things that TURNED JANE OFF about him!! Then she goes weak in the knees over him. I just found that really hard to digest. Yes, I know it's just a fiction, but the inconsistency of the woman who *seemed* to be consistent in her character threw me off."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I think that this is a great book.

Jane is a very defined character, and although some of what happens is unlikely to the point of being almost unrealistic, it seemed to make sense.The only complaint I have is that I felt, many times, like I needed a French dictionary at my side. When Jane talks to Adele, and occasionally other people, it is usually in French, with no translation whatsoever.But since it was written in a time when most educated people took French, what can you expect?I would suggest publishers put footnotes with translations. The French is not, perhaps, very important to the story line (not that I would know), but it really bothered me to have no idea what they were saying."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I was a little apprehensive to read this book at first because it was written in the 19th century, and I speculated that it would not be an easy read. I figured that I would give it a try though, and I am glad that I did. Jane Eyre is the best book I have ever read.It is a love story, but not in the typical sense of traditional romances. It incorporates an actual plot line as to how two characters fall in love over a long period of time and follows through the depths of despair and joy. The twisting of conflicts and happiness throughout the story leave the reader laughing and crying, and never being able to predict an outcome.Jane Eyre has a well-developed plot that includes rounded characters whom the reader comes to identify with. Bronte's heroine, Jane, (who also narrates the book) is a believable character because she is not exceedingly intellectual, she is not beautiful, she is not wealthy, yet she is autonomous and strong-willed, unlike Jane Austen's heroines (i.e. Emma Woodhouse), who are invariably the opposite. Although Jane is simple and modest, her life is full of constant suffering. She is easy to like because of these characteristics, just as some of the other characters are easy not to like because of their own unique characteristics.Bronte highlights certain aspects in this novel that people of the 19th century went through and experienced through the depiction of Jane's own life: being poverty-stricken, being orphaned, being unwanted, being plain, or being driven insane with the unattainable. This book not only gives the reader a deeper sense of the past, but also allows him to empathize for people that lived in it, and therefore to empathize with Jane.Each time I read Jane Eyre I cry over and over again. It is a fantastic piece of work that should be read by everyone. Truly a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

Often I can't be bothered to start a new book, and I can just pick J E up and read it from any point.I don't understand how Charlotte Bronte could have written so much and had power in almost every sentence. Classics are hard to get into, and maybe the first chapter was slow but at the same time ghostly.I picked out few faults and though I'm an inexperienced school girl I haven't read many more books which were so intense, an yet somehow managed to keep the reader on tenterhooks.How real life her writing is, but at the same time supernatural. For me, Jane Eyre is a living person and she always will be."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"In short, Jane Eyre is the story of a fairly unconventional life. Jane is orpahned when she is young and sent to live with her Aunt Reed, to a horrible &quot;school&quot;, then to work as a governess at Edward Rochester's home. She falls in love with Mr. Rochester but his secrets may make it imposible for them to ever be together.The book has a really slow, melodic feel to it, so if you like fast reads, it is not the book you're looking for.This is one of the best books I have ever read, so good its one of few that I have actually read several times over. Definately a classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful and captivating book. Once you start it you just gotta finish it!The best part of Jane Eyre (pronounced \\"air\\") is the love story between Jane and Edward, her employer. Edward keeps a dark secret , the nature of which isn't telegraphed but instead thrust upon the reader all at once (very well done!!!), that makes him both penurious and tragic. This makes him a somewhat odd match for Jane who is the epitome of virtue and is self denying. The cat and mouse play in the begining of their relationship, the way they individually struggle after the secret is revealed, and the ultimate resolution of their love story makes this one of the greatest novels in Engish literature.This brings me to the movie. It isn't a very good adaptation of the book. Major parts of the plot are missing or altered beyond recognition and signifigance. I watched the movie AFTER I read the book and was glad I did it in that order. Their are some stories that just have to be read in order for you to enjoy them;Jane Eyre is one of them (David Copperfield is another). But that's o.k., Charlotte Bronte has provided us with a tale that mesmerizes and impacts its reader like few others can. If it comes down to the movie or the book...read the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I recently finished Jane Erye and I couldn't bear the thought of there not being more of it to read. At first I thought it was strange that Jane could fall in love with such a cold, hard man. But then it turned out that he had a certain charm and gentleness that was buried deep inside him, not to show its face until Jane uncovered it. I think a big reason that some people don't like this book is because they expect Jane to fall in love with a handsome, obviously charming man. But that kind of romance is done too often in literary works, and eventually it loses its effect. In his own suttle way, Mr. Rochester is Prince Charming, though it takes time and patience to see. The book has a slow start, but stick with it. I've seen two movie versions of this story already, and it's a shame to put the title Jane Eyre on them. They are great stories in themselves, of course, but they hardly do the book justice. I'm 14 years old now, and in a few years I plan to read this book again, in hopes of getting more out of it than I already have."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a thrilling romance novel. Set in England in the 1800s, this novel tells of the life of Jane Eyre. Jane is an orphan left in the care of her aunt, Mrs. Reed. At Gateshead, the Reed's estate, she lives a life of solitude and hate, mistreated and misunderstood by all. At the age of ten, she is sent to grim Lowood school, a reformatory school for orphans. Her years at Lowood are gloomy and dull, and she has few friends. When she is 18, she advertises as a governess, and finds a job at Thornfield Hall. Thornfield is all she ever wanted; there she is happy and loved, until a twist of fate and a long kept secret find her once more in peril. This novel is very romantic and heart warming. Charlotte Bronte has a knack for making her characters and situations seem real. At times I felt as though I were right there with Jane, sharing her hopes and dreams. I found this book to be interesting and fun to read, although at times it became drawn out. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance novels with wonderful characters, settings, and situations."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and a novice towards 19th century British lit. I've never read an Austen and I cannot compair this book to Wuthering Heights (as I have never read that one either). I can only offer my less than expert opinion.This book was very enjoyable, at times. Until Mr. Rochester shows up, however, the book is very slow. The heroine grows on you quickly, so it makes the reading more fun. Jane is likeable, and I certainly cared more and more about her as the book progressed. I liked how blunt she could be at times and how stubborn. She displayed a great deal of strengh and determination, in a tough world, without the gifts of beauty and fortune. Jane has to make it on her own steam, and I think that a lot of modern girls could learn from her example.The story line with Mr. Rochester's crazy wife is a bit random, but very interesting none-the-less, and it added a layer of mystery to the plot.The ending of this book irked me the most, however, because (without giving it away) everything sort of falls into place. This bugged me because, up until then, Jane had to overcome issues and, in the end, her happiness was more or less handed to her.My one other complaint is that dear Jane Eyre likes to ramble about God and life and whatever else she sees fit to ramble about. It is dull dull dull, as the young girl muses on and on in her own head and we have to sit through it.I still very much liked the book though, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting little romance with an awesome heroine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The Brontes were a family of brilliant minds; Charlotte was the most brilliant among them (so beat me up, Emily fans), and Jane Eyre is far and away her masterpiece. I have imagined Handel laying down his quill after penning the final note of the Hallelujah Chorus, reading it over, and exclaiming aloud, \\"Whoa--where did THAT come from?\\" Jane Eyre is the same type of work. The tricks and seams and recycled gimmicks on which artists rely to connect pieces of greatness are absent here. The novel seems unedited, unreviewed, untouched--uncreated, like Jack's beanstalk that just sprang up overnight.That Charlotte Bronte was a genius in the field of human psychology is best proved by the facts that she was a desperate 20-something daughter of a country parson, she craved love (and sex) and excitement and had none, yet she wrote a novel of moral self-denial that remains satisfying to people who have long since kissed their 20's good-bye--people who have, perhaps, denied themselves very little. Without having had the opportunity to kick up her heels (much less participated in the 12-Step program to bring her down to earth), she understood in advance the processes of temptation, restraint, remorse, and rejuvenation.The first 2/3 of the book concerns temptation. It is the Hollywood part of the work, and the section that most appealed to me as an adolescent. Without the final third, however, the novel is another dopey Cinderella story--Maid in England, maybe: nice ordinary girl somehow attracts the attention of prince, great happiness ensues, no one learns anything, close curtain. (The really interesting psychology in these Cinderella stories, if you ask me, is that of the Prince--what's he looking for under those rags and foreign accents? Who's he pissed off at in Prince-land?) To an adult reader, Jane Eyre is monumental because of the struggle through hardship and denial to a less perfect (but, of course, more perfect) happiness at the end. While Jane's moral quandry takes place within the limits of a 19th century British system of Christian ethics, there is surprisingly little hellfire involved. After all, to Bronte, the daughter of a parson, the answer to Jane Eyre's dilemma could have been a simpleminded, \\"It's wrong, don't do it--just get on with it!\\" just as the answer to modern western readers is, \\"It's wrong but fun--just do it!\\"This book is even great in Italian, which is how I reread it--and I'm not sure Italian even has words for restraint and self-denial.Jane Eyre should not be assigned reading for most teenagers, however, and it frequently is. I can't even imagine the torture it would be for that large percent of teenage boys who are just not interested in the human heart; there is very little action in it--it's purely character analysis. (\\"Ghostly happenings\\" occur now and then, but probably not enough to hold the interest of most modern kids.) On the other hand, some first-time adult readers might put it down early, finding the opening 2/3 of the book somewhat ridiculous--there are some broad character portraits, a plot that seems to be heading down that Cinderella path, and a pretty unbelievable series of events leading to the crisis. So, I'm going to recommend this book to people exactly like me: Girls, read it first in your early teenage years and keep it in the back of your brain; then, every 10 or 15 years, as you pass through another stage of life, pick it up again. There's more in there, believe me--even in a foreign tongue!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Just to correct some other comments, the present book is only \\"Jane Eyre.\\" It is not a collection of books by the Bronte sisters as implied in the spotlight comments above.This is a great read. I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic \\"A Room of One's Own.\\" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after \\"Jane Eyre\\", \\"Shirley,\\" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic \\"Madame Bovary\\" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.This is simply a great read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a brilliant novel!

The book Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a strong woman named Jane and her growth from a rejected orphan to a strong and independent woman. After living like a servant in her cruel aunt's home, Jane is sent off to receive an education at a poor institute for orphans. After witnessing the death of her best friend and surviving six more years there, Jane becomes a teacher and eventually a governess at the Thornfield Manor under the master, Edward Rochester.Unlike many stories about love, in this one it is Jane's intellect and passion that is what attracts Edward Rochester. They fall deeply in love, but the discovery of Edward's insane wife causes Jane to run away. Charlotte Bronte uses her talent with words to vividly describe Jane's pain.\\"Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent expectant woman---almost a bride---was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow...My hopes were all dead---struck with a subtle doom\\" (314).Homeless, penniless, and near death Jane somehow finds work and a place to stay. Her path of self-discovery continues in the finding of her cousins and her inheritance of her uncle's fortune.She finally returns to Edward to find him staying with his servants. The once wealthy businessman had become wifeless, homeless, blind, and crippled from a fire. Jane and Edward's love had not diluted in their time apart but grew stronger. The story ends happily with Jane and Edward's marriage and birth of a son.This book is written with such detail and emotion, you instantly connect with the young woman. The depth and compassion of this book draws the reader in and teaches him/her about determination and self-worth. Her morality and strength, in a time when women were not accepted for their minds, makes Jane stand out from other heroines. When she is at the point of near death from hunger and fatigue, she will not give up.\\"While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do other wise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and the sense of desolation-this total prostration of hope...And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! Sustain me a little longer!\\" (351).Jane Eyre is a classic book, but the text is quite long and at times can seem to trail off. There are points in the book that don't move and slow down the story. During one conversation between Jane and Edward the story feels like it's dragging on.\\"'Sententious sage!

It is captivating and powerful. It is a long read, but worth the time. I would recommend this book to everyone, not only women. Regardless of the gender of the hero, this book shows what one can accomplish no matter what obstacles life throws your way."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I first read \\"Jane Eyre\\" shortly after high school and was completely mesmerized by it. I have read it several times since and I come away with a different view point each time. Jane is the ultimate heroine: she's independant, doesn't bow down to what the \\"ideal woman\\" should be and doesn't let anything (or anyone) compromise her principles, even the man she loves. The book appeals to the reader both emotionally and intellectually. The emotional aspect of the book is what I love about it. When Rochester tells Jane of his feelings for her, I can the passion of the characters. And later, when Jane leaves him, the agony of the characters is palpable.\\"Jane Eyre\\" always seems to fall under \\"Wuthering Heights\\" shadow. \\"Jane Eyre,\\" I believe, is the better novel. It has all the atmosphere of \\"Wuthering Heights\\", but the romance of Rochester and Jane is far more romantic and believable than that of Cathy and Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read this book when I was 15 for a school English project when a friend recommended it- I'm now 17 and I'm actually in the process of reading the book again.

One thing I really like about this book is that Jane isn't pretty, at least not pretty like many other girls around her, and she isn't high class, but she can still have a wonderful life regardless!

The story of this girl fascinated me. I loved the language and emotion, and the beautiful picture of a life well lived that the author has managed to depict so carefully. As for this edition, there are a few errors, but the narration makes up for it. Even when I first read the book, I was not so completely immersed in the story as I was this time with the narration.

My sister and I decided a few years ago to read some of the 'classics' we had overlooked. Jane Eyre was our first selection. We are forever grateful we did not pass through this life without reading it. Oh, what we would have missed!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Oh how I love this novel! Jane Eyre is one of those novels that I can read over and over again and get something new out of it every time. I consider it to be one of the most readable classics, one I can just pick up and lose myself in it without even thinking about it. To me, that's a testament to how well it holds up, there aren't too many classics I can say that about because I find so many of them to be rather plodding.This time around, I found myself to be much more emotional about the trials that Jane goes through. I've gone through quite a few emotional events since the last time I read this one, and that undoubtedly affected my reading of many of the situations Jane is in. I openly wept when reading about her treatment during early childhood at Gateshead and later at Lowell School.As we get towards the middle section of the book, and Jane finds such happiness at Thornfield, I was so elated to witness her journey again. Yet, because I knew where it was going, I found myself deliberately slowing down, as if I could prevent more pain for her simply by reading the story so slowly. Of course, this didn't work and I was soon crying along with Jane again as another misfortune befell her. At some point, I just want poor Jane to catch a break!I think the thing that struck me most during this reading was how incredibly frustrated I was with St. John. Normally my frustration in this book is directed towards Mr. Rochester, he seems so fickle at times and difficult to read. Speaking of, I wasn't ever sure...is Rochester his actual name, or is that his estate/title? I think Fairfax is his real surname but I could be wrong. Those Brits always confuse me with this stuff!Anyway, back to St. John. He really is a good man, you can see it oozing from him, but he is so incredibly stubborn I wanted to reach into the pages and just slap him! I get that things were different back when this was written, and that what Jane proposed to him really just wasn't feasible. My frustration stems from his inability to just let the whole thing go!Given that he basically knows the entirety of Jane's story, I think it's really manipulative of him to continually try to convince her to do what he wants. He's not a stupid man, he knows that Jane longs to be involved with other people and is eager to please due to her childhood being so grim. And rather than taking a truly Christian path by wishing her the best when she makes her own choice, he continues to try and guilt her into doing things his way, even to the detriment of her own health, without any real concern for what may be best for her personally. Maybe it's my own ambivalent religious beliefs that make this more difficult for me, because I just don't believe that Jane should have to give up the things she believes may make her happy simply because St. John believes she *could* be a good servant to the lord. Needless to say, I agree with the choices Jane makes in the end, as she was finally able to do as she pleased.Because this is a reread for me, I knew all the major plot points ahead of time, and I think that knowledge added to the frustration I felt for St. John. With each reading, I feel like I understand Jane a little more, and feel for her more deeply, so I can almost experience the pain she goes through to the point that her conversations with these important people really affect me on an intimate level. I felt my own happiness being ripped away at the same time that Jane did, and that makes her all the more real to me.I've lost count of how many times I've read this novel, but this one really cemented it as my all time favorite classic, and one of the books I recommend to people when they ask for something new to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It was nice to be able to read this classic for free.

Needless to say, I never finished it. Then a few years ago I read Jasper Fforde's hilarious book, The Eyre Affair, which uses Jane Eyre as a backdrop, and I decided to pick up the book again.When I began reading, I got frustrated with the excessive description and the unlikable characters at the beginning of the book. But I pushed through, and by the time I was half finished, I couldn't put the book down. On the surface Jane Eyre is a compelling love story, but underneath it is a heavy handed take on the scripture \\"if your right hand causes you to sin, then cut it off. And if your eye causes you to sin, then gouge it out.\\" Despite the excessive description of trees and sunsets, Jane Eyre gives readers much to think about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I've read Jane Eyre many times over the years, but this time on my Kindle. It is a wonderful story with strong characters. The Kindle is helpful when reading older books because you can use the built-in dictionary to look up obscure, archaic words.

In fact, those that choose to have morals and values sometimes have to pay a very high price for them.

I'm on a quest to read great classics and if anyone has any suggestions, don't be shy, please share.On to the book - some say boring, some loved it. I loved it. Everyone has gone into the gist of the tale but I will tell you what I find most facinating.Charlotte Bronte wrote this in the first half of the 1800's. It's amazing that a woman in that century would be so bold & outspoken. Not only is Charlotte of this character but so is our heroine, Jane Eyre. In the year 2012 not many would find her personality unique but when reading consider that age in which this was written. A tad slow but that can be overlooked when getting to know Jane's character & wit. It's never too late for a classic - go ahead and take a chance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It was hard for me to love this book because I had trouble relating to Jane Eyre. She was a well rounded character...and every page of her story was vivid and interesting...but I just never really adored her as a character.She is not weak...she's more gentle...strong in character...but gentle...delicate and fierce in character. It's a bit hard to explain...but that's the reason I found it hard to relate.It was also tough because she at 18 yrs is so much like a girl and she falls in love with a man. It's well written...believable and I guess romantic...but it's hard to think of it that way because I never felt for Jane or Mr. Rochester or even some of the background characters enough to be enthralled by their stories.I did like little Adele though (partly because she was French and partly because she always spoke her mind. The author did a great job making her sound like a real kid.So I suggest you try this book, but I'll admit it wasn't my favorite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Read this novel for the third time since my teens and enjoyed it again just as much as I did the first or second time. Jane Erye is about a woman's struggle to to claim independence and self-respect in a closed society that had not yet accepted these ideas for women. Jane Eyre was an orphan and poor. She met each obstacle in her life as a student and governess with courage and spirit. As a governess, she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester, who had a terrible secret from his past; however, their bond was so strong that it overcame even this obstacle.

This book is about how she made the best of what she is given in life and how she matures and grows. It's a story of love and strength. I thought it was interesting how this book has a little bit of a dark side. I liked that, I felt that it gave the book more depth and made it more interesting to read.

I loved it as much as I ever have but this time I knew what parts were autobiographical and where the basic concept for the story came from. Interestingly, I had always thought the part between the time she leaves Thornfield and returns was rather less vivid than the rest. Turns out most contemporary reviewers thought so as well. Still, knowing that the marriage proposal from St. John Rivers has a basis in Charlotte Bronte's life made it more interesting this time around. I highly recommend both books."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I've deeply enjoyed this classical novel of Charlotte Bront.

Jane Eyre was a little orphanage girl, that lived with a family she did not love. Jane didn't feel as if that was her home. Jane says, \\"I was like nobody there. If they did not love me, in fact, as little as I did them.\\" There was to main people that had hurt her the most physically and mentally, Master Reed and Mrs. Reed . Master Reed was a cruel young boy. He liked to criticize, make fun of, and hurt Jane. He thought he was the boss and owned everything in the house. In the book it says that Jane was reading a book and he came along and asked, \\"Why are you touching my stuff? Everything in here will belong to me one day.\\" She responded, \\"I'm only reading a book.\\" He made her look away and threw the book to her head. Master Reed didn't get in trouble at all, because he was Mrs. Reed precious son.Another thing that interested me is that she was a girl that wanted to be different. No matter how people looked down at her, or ridiculed her, she was always determined to be someone in life. Mrs. Reed was very cruel to Jane because she was trying every way possible to put her in school or send her away. Jane began to think that she wasn't good enough for that family. They had downgraded her so much, that Jane began to think bad about herself. Jane began to think to herself, \\" What thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? She wanted someone to care about her and show her love. This novel would be good for a person looking for motivation or a book that is very inspiring.

Jane Eyre is a curious, intelligent and emotionally volatile girl, who we witness grow up into a woman, seeking to make connections with the world around her. There are so many great elements to this story that, considering how long ago it was written, seem novel and suggestive of feminism. Jane Eyre does not take crap from anyone, and is very honest, candid and assertive about this. She is devoted to making a life for herself without anyone else's help. She listens to her instincts, and let them guide her through the course of her life, not matter what the perceived cost may be.I found this story compelling. Even though the subject matter wasn't gripping or exhilarating, the manner in which it was written was enough to keep me interested every page of the way. The word choice and flow were so well done that I feel like I'm floating down the stream of consciousness that the author expertly disseminates through her passion and skill.

It was fun to pick up this old friend each day."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The main theme of Jane Eyre is that happiness and contentment can be found during our lives on earth. This is shown in the fact that Jane led a very discontented and sad childhood, but she found happiness in her relationship with Mr. Rochester. This theme also came out very strongly through Jane's cousin John. He was so dedicated to serving God and being a missionary that he asked Jane to marry him because he thought she was a hard worker. He didn't love her, but he believed that serving God came before his own happiness. The book makes it seem as though this is wrong, because in the end John goes to India by himself and does not enjoy the rest of his life. It is presented as though Jane did the fulfilling and satisfying thing by marrying Mr. Rochester, and John did the good but unhappy thing by becoming a missionary in India. Obviously, it is not good to marry someone that you don't love, but Charlotte Bronte seems to take this to the extreme by saying that unless you get married to the person you love, you will not lead a satisfied life. In truth, if you lead a life dedicated to serving and praising God, you will have a satisfied life. It is not just people and circumstances that can make us happy, but a close relationship with God. Nevertheless, I thought that Jane Eyre was a very good book. There was always a little hint of mystery to keep the reader interested, and the book presented some interesting ideas to think about. Jane Eyre did a good job of presenting Charlotte Bronte's ideas, and it is a very well-written, descriptive book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the rarest kind of novel - one that conveys boundless emotion without stumbling too far into darkness and misery.Plain and poor, Jane works as a governess in the house of Mr Rochester, a brooding and temperamental man with a dark secret, and eventually falls in love with her wealthy employer. She looks to the future and begins to overcome the unhappiness that has plagued her all her life, but Rochester's shady past comes back and brings everything down again.But unlike in the author's sister Emily's Wuthering Heights, this sadness neither dominates nor concludes the book when all is resolved in a happy, if somewhat bittersweet, ending.The real brilliance of Jane Eyre lies in the characters - we can all see ourselves, or our aspirations, reflected in Jane, who overcomes her circumstances to find happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the rarest kind of novel - one that conveys boundless emotion without stumbling too far into darkness and misery.Plain and poor, Jane works as a governess in the house of Mr Rochester, a brooding and temperamental man with a dark secret, and eventually falls in love with her wealthy employer.

I recommemd this book for the older more mature reader (13 and up). Even though nine year olds can read this book, to fully understand the passion and adult situations you must be a little more mature. To really fully understand Jane Eyre you must read past the words and into the heart of little troubled Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The story of Jane Eyre told by any other author would be a tale told to elicit tears, or sometimes a smile. As it is the book is so sincere and frank it seems to weep in your hands, and requires no acknowledgment from you. Indeed, Jane Eyre is very likely above such avowal even were you to tender it.

Bronte definitely has a way with words, and Jane's story, though in some parts a bit unrealistic, certainly makes for a good read. However, the dialogue is a little confusing sometimes because the author uses the wrong pronouns (like: &quot;Would she like a morsel of bread?&quot; when it ought to be &quot;Would YOU like a morsel of bread?&quot;)This happens pretty often near the end, and it's terribly annoying. These flaws not withstanding, however, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; will appeal to anyone who enjoys the romance and soap-opera plots of Victorian literature paired with some gothic characteristics (crazy Bertha screaming and doing mischief in her locked cell)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"As many people may know, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is the story of an orphaned girl who has an evil aunt that locks her away in an eerie red room where her uncle died in. Being the protagonist of the novel, Jane breaks away from her aunt's oppression and stands up for herself. As Jane lives life away from her aunt, she realizes that the outside world is just as strenuous. Against many odds, Jane pushes forward with her life. She finds a job as a governess and falls in love with her employer and he loves her back, but of course with Jane's luck, more obstacles are hurdled at her.Being set during the Victorian period, social status already plays a big obstacle in Jane's life. When obstacles, though some highly unlikely, beyond social class prevent her from marrying the love her life, Jane must establish her own code of ethics. What is wrong and what is right? What can she do and what can she not do?The novel may seem to focus much on the aspect of Jane's love life, but there's much more to it than that. Throughout Jane's love story, there's always eerie things going on, for example the shrieking yell coming from a room no one is allowed in and that's just the beginning. \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a book that has many different aspects and a hint of gothic fiction. There's love, mystery, strength, courage, and faith. It's the journey of a lost female on the road of identifying herself. This is a classic that should not be passed up especially if you're a person who believes that love prevails against all odds. This classic is a refreshing book to read; it's not every day that you find such a strong female character in literature.Even though the only complain I have to offer is the lengthiness and the endless dialogue, this novel is worth it all.

This is not a criticism - just part of reading Jane Eyre.)I have 2 main difficulties with Jane Eyre. First, it was difficult for me to see either Mr. Rochester or St. John Rivers as desirable. Both were manipulative control freaks. Secondly, there are some \\"coincidences\\" (specifically with regard to the Rivers family) that seem so entirely unlikely that it's distracting. (As a side note, I question whether Jane's time with the Rivers was necessary to advance the story. That section of the book seemed especially plodding.)Last but not least, Jane Eyre is deeply religious. This is not a bad thing, but much of the book is spent sermonizing. This, too, adds to its length.I came away from Jane Eyre disappointed but also appreciative of Jane's amazing (if flawed) journey."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I'm going to rate the quality of the Kindle Edition since this seems to be the only place to do so. I won't go into the story since there's a perfectly good sysnopsis on the description page and several well written reivews on the work itself. The kindle edition was good to say the least. I did find a few spelling errors that were annoying, but none more so than the heroine, Jane, repeatedly being referred to as 'Janet' throughout the entire novel; I find this to be unacceptable. I do not know if this occurs in the print-versions as this was my first encounter with the story. Had there been less (or no) spelling errors as well as the correct name reference to the main character, I would have given it 5 stars on content alone---although it still creeps me out that 19 year olds and 40 year olds so frequently ended up marrying in that day and age, but I just had to put it out of my mind when reading. Otherwise it was a good read and I look forward to reading more works by the Bronte sisters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyere is my absolute favorite book and I was thrilled when I found the book marked as collector's edition and leather bound. However, the book I received was not a leather bound copy and I doubt was even a collector's edition. It didn't say anything to that effect in the book and was missing the jacket."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is a beautiful copy and a great addition to any classic book library. So glad I made this purchase!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the world's best-loved classic novels for so many reasons.It's an exciting piece of feminist literature written at a time when feminist literature was little known and even more poorly accepted. That it is a semi-autobiographical novel written by a staunchly, independent female author who herself was struggling to survive by her own wits and means and stand on her own two feet makes the story all the more poignant and compelling. While it is a prime example of Gothic romance peppered with the typical fixtures of a Gothic novel - the spectral Thornfield manor that seems to attain a life of its own; the allusions to mythological characters such as ghosts and vampires; the uncanny timing of such weather phenomenon as lightning or a chilling, drenching downpour to accompany major events in the novel - it also breaks new ground in that it avoids some of the typical conventions of Victorian literature. And, finally, it is a piece of masterful story-telling built around larger than life characters that for over 150 years has enchanted readers of all ages and thrilled watchers of numerous television and movie adaptations.For those few of you that have yet to read this wonderful novel, the story can be summarized quickly enough. A dying father extracts a death bed promise from his sister to raise his infant daughter, Jane Eyre. The sister, a spiteful and mean spirited woman grows to hate the obligation that Jane represents and soon sends her away to a boarding school. (Did anyone else have flashbacks to Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby when they were reading this portion of the novel?) In spite of the harsh mental and physical cruelty she endures at the hands of the school's administrator and its teachers, Jane survives to become a teacher at the school. Ultimately she leaves to seek her own way in the world and secures a position as governess in the household of Edward Fairfax Rochester.At this point, most readers will correctly guess that Jane and Mr Rochester fall in love with each other but to tell more of the story would be to spoil the effect of this magnificent novel for first time readers.Suffice it to say that Charlotte Bront has woven an enthralling story into the exploration of a multiplicity of themes that will occupy students of the English language novel for decades to come - the interplay of self-respect, morality, conventional mores and religion; the effects of social standing and class discrimination; gender relations in a patriarchal staunchly male-dominated society; legal issues of the day that related to marriage, inheritance and ownership; contrasting extremes of religious zealotry as displayed by Brocklehurst's hypocritical Puritanism reflected against St John Rivers' obsessive but well-intentioned determination to spread Calvinist dogma as a missionary abroad.While many of these issues have clearly been relegated to the history of the 19th century, it's also a fact that much of the controversy that Bront has so eloquently built into her characters' lives persist as issues into our own 21st century. Little wonder that \\"Jane Eyre\\" has such enduring power in the world of English literature!Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It was a truly captivating novel. Never expected theending. Jane gives us a full account of who and what she was and hasbecome."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book is full of mystery and romance. I have never read anything like it before. It really captivated me.Jane Eyre is true to what she knows is right, no matter how hard the consequences may be. She is poor and plain, yet she doesn't use that as an excuse to live with the man she loves in an improper relationship. She shows rare strength of character and wisdom when she literally runs away from temptation. She knows if she stays with Mr. Rochester, she will never be able to be truly happy, and that despite his promises to the contrary, that she will lose his respect, and she will lose her self-respect. She gives up everything to do what she knows is right, and in the end, she is rewarded in unexpected ways. I will not tell you more because I don't want to spoil it for you.Despite the lessons in this book, it is not moralistic and preachy. It is very well written, and a very enjoyable read.

The novel follows the life of the fictional Jane Eyre, an orphan from birth, as she progresses from a student, teacher, governess, to finally, a wife. Some of the events Jane experiences are based on Bronte's own life. Bronte began writing Jane Eyre in 1846. It was an immediate and thorough success upon publication in 1847.

The reader cannot help but become involved and interested in the compelling story of Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the epitome of independence and success.

If you ignore that advice, you might conclude that a woman&#8217;s ideal role is something akin to slavery: total submission to the other gender.Yuk!The two men Jane involves herself with are certainly egomaniacs. Perhaps I&#8217;ve gone too far&#8212;maybe they&#8217;re just maniacs. Maniacs that Jane is more than willing dedicate her life to. The eccentricities of their personalities don&#8217;t bother her at all. What was Bront thinking of?A comparable near contemporary female character is Lizzie Hexam [Our Mutual Friend (Dickens, 1864-65)]. Like Jane, Lizzie was strong. Like Jane, Lizzie submitted herself to a dominant male, Eugene Wrayburn. Perhaps a significant difference is that the man Lizzie served, if not a perfect human, was worlds more appealing (at least to me) than either Eyre&#8217;s Edward Rochester or St. John Rivers.The last third of this book is all the more disappointing because of the quality of the two thirds that preceded it.

The parts where Jane is not with Rochester can be tedious sometimes but, fortunately, since I've read it, I can skip those parts and just read the good ones. When Jane leaves Rochester, Bronte describes it in such a way that it makes the reader feel as if they were leaveng their one true love.

However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. \\"Jane Eyre\\" doesn't come close to \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This was the first book I read by Charlotte Bronte, and after I finished it I immediately got Villette, then The Professor, and Shirley, and others!

I love her language and the flow of her writing. The book is romantic but a bit dark, which was a bit refreshing actually. (Although nowhere near as dark as her sister's Wuthering Heights).

But to fully appreciate this book requires that you be a \\"mature\\" reader. And also realize that this book was written in another era, where society and standards were much different than today.I originally read this book years ago for my highschool literature class. Although I didn't dis-like the book, I didn't exactly like it either. It did not have much of an impact on me. I think I was too immature (lacking in life experiences) to relate to and understand some of the strong emotions and the complex sides of human nature portrayed in the book.Reading this book years later as a mature adult, I was deeply touched by the story of Jane Eyre. You experience a variety of emotions: abandonment, despair, love, romance, mystery, danger, heartache. And Jane Eyre was really a character ahead of her time - Although content to conform to the standards expected of a woman in her time period, Jane had an independent mind and spirit. She would not do something against her will, heart, or conscience. She was not afraid to speak her mind. She had strong Christian moral beliefs and would not waver from them. She is a heroine to be admired and respected.So much more could be said, but I will leave it at that. If you were disapointed by Jane Eyre if you read it as a teenager, try reading it again as an adult."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Quite arguably one of the greatest British novels ever penned, Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is so all-around-wonderful, it's no wonder that it's been adapted into 5+ movies.We first meet Bronte's Jane as a child, young and abused, in the care of her aunt. We immediately take Jane under our wing, feeling more her personal protector with each turn of the page. Then, one day, Jane is a woman. Though retaining many of her childlike tendencies, Jane is determined to be independent: leaving her old boarding school victorious and free, she begins a governess position at the manor home of the elusive and mysterious Mr. Edward Rochester. It is Jane who tames Rochester's brooding and arrogant heart, reducing him to schoolboyish desperation.So deliciously provactive is &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; that it is impossible not to devour it within days; my own worn-with-love copy sits next to a dog-eared &quot;Villette.&quot;It is sometimes speculated that Charlotte Bronte exercised her complicated mind through the written word; &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is beautiful evidence of that.As the story slows to its conclusion, you will find yourself lost: hungry for more of Jane, more of Rochester, and more of the magic that is &quot;Eyre.&quot; Quench that thirst with more Bronte (perhaps Emily's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; or some of Anne's poetry?) or, if you're like me, a second read of the irresistible &quot;Jane.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I started this book and found the beginning of it a little dull and I put it down but a friend of mine encouraged me to try again to get through and I read the whole book in less than 3 days.

Two years later, we read it again in English, and I liked it even more.This book portrays it's main character as a strong, outspoken, smart and independent woman, written in a time when it was unconventional to do so. While the book is over 100 years old, it is not outdated because it's message is something that people can relate to today.Because it is wordy and not exactly fast, easy reading, some people disregard the book as being boring. However, if you give it a chance, you will probably find that it is suspenseful and exciting.There are many surprises. Just when you think that something is going to happen, some strange twist of fate changes the course of the story. It's also mysteroius and even funny.Ultimately the book has a positive message. Jane is an incredibly strong character who shows what it means to be true to yourself.Many people have to read this book, whether they want to or not. Other people choose to read it.

Bronte captures the horrors of Jane's family (I use the term loosely) and the physical, as well as emotional, hardships she had to endure throughout the whole of her childhood and ultimatly her life until the end of the novel. The book is much more readable than the indominably beautiful heroine who only briefly suffers and finds superficial happiness in the one she loves. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester goes deeper than the surface for she does not even glance at the startling deformities of his body, but tries to heal the deformities of his soul when she returns to him.

With that in mind, I thought it would be fun to REread Jane Eyre. About half way through the book, I realized that I had never read it before: this was my first read! Interestingly, the woman who led the discussion on Wide Sargasso Sea had the identical experience. So did another. We decided that it was more than the movie in which the still only babyfat Orson Welles wished himself to be the romantic hero: Jane Eyre was so much a part of Western Culture that without actually having read the book, we knew it. Charlotte Bronte, writing at the very beginning of the 19th century, was a much better writer than many who followed her. George Sand's writing is more pretentious and more closely tied to the 18th century. While &quot;Little Women&quot; is a wonderful book to revisit, Louisa May Alcott's potboilers are tiresome. I can not get into Dickens or James Fenimore Cooper. Until you come upon writers who bridge the gap between the 19th and 20th centuries -- Edith Wharton springs to mind -- no one is quite as readable as Charlotte, unless it is one of her sisters.That is not to say that the plot holds up. It is riddled with co-incidence that nearly undermines Bronte's intentions. However, her characters live and have dimension, even if their circumstances do not. So often, the infamous &quot;canon&quot; is criticized as being full of dead white European males. Charlotte is a woman whose work has shaped our thoughts and influenced us for nearly 200 years. I would say that Charlotte Bronte is part of the Western canon."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I LOVE this edition!

Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India.

Minimal (if any) errors and well set up. Next chapter always starts at the top of a page which makes it always a good place to stop.Kindle vs. Hardcopy -- one nice thing is that there are a lot of words considered either purely poetical or old or middle English, so no longer or not commonly used and if you move your cursor to the word on the kindle, it will automatically define it. Always useful, but especially where there are many such words.Well worth the buck!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bront is an 1847 novel published as \\"Jane Eyre. An Autobiography\\" under the nom de plume of \\"Currer Bell\\". The novel is told in first person narrative and goes through five distinct stages in Jane's life. In spite of many dark elements the novel has strong elements of right vs. wrong as well as morality.The orphan Jane Eyre, brought up by an duty bound aunt by marriage is having a miserable childhood. The family is spoiled and socially fixated, considering the orphan in their mists beneath them and bans Jane from her cousins. After an incident with her cousin John, Jane is sent to a school called Lowood where the moral pillar of her time finds herself subject to the hypocritical minister who runs the place. Jane endures the school even though she has been branded a liar and subject to a starvation diet as well as other miseries - but she remains faithful to standards which would break any other mortal.Reaching adulthood, Jane leaves Lowood to become a governess for Mr. Rocchester at his home called Thornhill. Mr. Rochester wins Jane's love and respect even though she knows he is harboring a secret. Rochester asks for Jane's hand in marriage, even though she keeps remind him what a poor, plain girl she is. At the last moment the marriage is thwarted, Jane flees Thorhill all alone and without a penny to her name. However, Jane finds her way back to society and moves up the social ladder only to make her way back to Mr. Rochester to discover his painful secret.I can certainly see why \\"Jane Eyre\\" is considered a classic. Bront's use of strong language , rhetorical brilliance and lovely narrative are certainly impressive. The author also had the guts to tackle many social issues head on, something that we, at this voyeuristic age, seem to take for granted. Even though this book was not meant to be historical, several decades later I found it captivating to read about the day-to-day living of 1800's England.The book described the fascinating social ladder of the 1800's where governesses (nannies/teachers) were far below their employers, yet often better educated. I felt that Jane's assertions to Rochester that she is his equal was something that was simply frowned upon a society which thrives on ambiguities.I found myself increasingly interested in the outcome of the story, the Rochester secrets, Jane's wit and eventual outcome. The personal story of Jane Eyre is very absorbing and well written. Bront's observations are poignant and engaging, her storytelling, when she's not of on a tangent, is admirable.But,oh the tangents... as much as absorbing as the book was, when the characters start going off on departures about religion and morality I almost felt as if I was being scolded. The huge amount of storytelling which is meant to be nothing but a filler got to be annoying after a hundred pages or so. The only conflict in the book is between Jane and Rochester, the rest of the book is filled with Jane being Jane, preaching to the reader about morality, virtues, temptations which might have some charm, but certainly isn't interesting.My favorite book, Don Quixote is known for its unbalanced structure, but the Quixote chapters are completely separate from the stories within a story parts. In \\"Jane Eyre\\" Bront tells the tale in logical progression which is structured around the protagonist. However, the consistency of the narrative is done at the expense of the overall strength of the whole."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"What can I say about this work that has not already been said in the many reviews that came before? It is truly one of the greats of English literature, and re-reading it as an adult is a pleasure that reaps even more rewards than when I read it as a girl.My only warning is for those who are reading it in the Kindle edition. The good points are that it is nicely formatted and almost free of spelling errors. The negatives are that it has no Table of Contents, linked or otherwise; and although it claims to be illustrated, no illustrations were included in the version I read.For pure reading pleasure, this novel has few equals. For formatting, you might be able to find better."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a masterpiece.I thoroughly enjoyed it. The protagonist, Jane, is narrating her biography, and the chronicle commences when she was ten years old, growing up with her cruel aunt and equally cruel cousins, who make her childhood miserable. She could hardly wait to get out of their grip to a school for orphanages, run by a saintly woman. There she befriends a girl, Amy, a noble and true friend, dying of consumption. Jane thrives in the school, later becoming a teacher for two years.But the real drama unfolds when she gets a job as a tutor for a young girl, Adel, a protege of Mr. Rochester, a wealthy bachelor. They fall in love and Mr. Rochester proposes marriage. But he forgets to tell Jane a minor point that he was already married to a insane woman, locked up in the same manor! Jane bolts home and a new adventure unfolds, meets her long lost cousins, finds enormous fortune and dodges her cousin's advances to marry and go on to India to preach! She wants none of this austere life. She misses her love and returns to her old digs but to her great dismay, discovers that the old house is burned to the ground and Mr. Rochester who is now blind, has left town. She runs to find him.It is a great story, nicely woven with unforgettable characters. The prose is eloquent and flows like well honed poetry. She was a century or so ahead of her time when it came to Women's rights and their place in the society. It is hard to believe that author of this classic novel was a unmarried young woman, who had a sister, who penned \\"Wuthereing Heights\\", another tour de force. Only annoying aspect of the book was the religious righteousness, however, that was de rigueur during Victorian era.It is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I'll confess I wasn't particularly looking forward to \\"Jane Eyre\\" when I started. I wanted to read it because I should read it, and because it's a travesty I haven't read it - until now. I assumed it would be dry, at times forcefully witty - a hunt for a man and a conquest. That sort of thing.Not a bit of it!Charlotte Bront creates in Jane a character with whom I find much in common: her manner of thought, her silented spirit, her tendency to love fully and passionately - to sketch, to think, to be content within herself.As a child she is abused by her stepmother and detested for her untamed spirit. She's sent away to school where her dear (and first) friend Helen Burns teaches her to stand bravely under reprimand - and to focus her courage.As Jane advances in school she becomes mellowed - but still the passion broods beneath. The story carries into her young adulthood when she becomes a teacher (at the same school where she grew up) and determines to see what there is in life beyond teaching and solitude and walls. So the orphan woman-child advertises for a governess position and is quickly hired at the home of the restless and gruff Edward Rochester - a man who finds Jane's controlled attitude, her level stare, her unfailing honesty and scathing intelligence enchanting. As their love develops, Jane realizes a secret about Edward that cannot be loved away, and she tears herself bodily from him, a terrified, frightened, heartbroken girl-woman once again homeless.I've no wish to spoil it for those who haven't read it, but suffice it to say, this fourth classic in all that I have read in my life surely inspires me to read more of its kind! I had no idea a Victorian woman would create a story with such passion. I feel moved to write, moved to create, and at a level with Bront that far exceeds death or time. She is a writer, a fervent spirit, and I stand here, nearly two centuries after her death, feeling shoulder-to-shoulder with her. She gives that much of herself to the work. I cried both at the last segment where she is a child, and the end of the novel itself (something I can't recall ever doing while reading.)Having read formula fiction all my life, I'm in particular impressed with Bront's power of description.Bront breaks norm often by flipping to the present tense, creating a quickness of spirit that contrasts remarkably with the more doleful passages. I find her writing comfortable - for want of a better word. Reading her tale was a pleasure - at times deep with wisdom, at times amusing with spirit, at times very doleful. She tours the human plane of emotion, twisting the plot quite more feverishly than I'd anticipated. Several times I sat forward in astonishment as the plot twisted and volted.So much symbolism in this novel, and captured so beautifully, like a still life - the virgin moon, the burning, lustful fires that destroy, fade out, then flicker anew atop candles before a fading portrait of love beautified as the novel draws to a close. In particular I'm struck by the irony in the way Jane and Mr. Rochester meet - and the way the story closes.I fell in love with Rochester quickly - I don't know why. He is rude, arrogant, and self-interested. Yet his changeable (nearly childlike) spirit - and his admiration for all that is reprehensible in Jane to everyone else - captured my heart.Bront writes both as a Romantic and a Victorian - challenging the church, female diffidence, and \`the norm' - and presenting her prose as richly as a woman in love and as candidly as a man of her generation before the court. A writer caught between worlds--and isn't that the richest place to be as a writer?5 out of 5 stars for Jane Eyre. I gave to Bront sleepless nights - and that's no embellishment."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Very descriptive, held my attention from first page to the end. I was able to see through Jane Eyre's eyes, her world of living as an orphan in England in the 1800s, the cruel and heartless people in her life, her selfish aunt who didn't keep her promise to her dying brother to rear her as her own. Throughout the novel, Jane was resourceful, nurturous and intelligent. She became a governess for a rich employer who had his insane wife imprisoned. Jane fell in love with him, suffered tragedies of a broken heart, trials of running from her past, a new identity. She discovered loving friends and family, became rich, and marries her former employer. Every time she had a taste of happiness it was taken from her. I cried and got angry."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I always tell people: \\"ask any girl if they liked Jane Eyre. The answer is sure to be a yes.\\" The story has been outlined through many forms of media, including the stage and the silverscreen. But the experience of reading Bronte's exquisitely detailed, and passionate writing is to be found on the pages.The sexual tension between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the pan-ultimate Byronic hero, is exciting, and Jane's growth as a woman is relational to her position with Mr. Rochester.The gem of the story is its subversiveness, however. Bronte was audacious in Jane's defiance of religious and aristocratic authorities, challenging the traditions that defined British society."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read this book on a sort of whim, because I'd been harboring a copy about a hundred years old (cloth cover, and kind of cool in it's own right), and because I had just read 'The Eyre Affair' by Jasper Fforde. In his story, the plot for Jane Eyre gets 're-written' to have a 'newer and more popular ending'. While Jasper Fforde is as loopy as Douglas Adams, that is another review. He seizes on something great though, which is the last section of the book where Jane has gone off from Rochester, and (under terrible pressure) is next to assenting to go off to India with her cousin to work herself to death and bear his children. In the Fforde story, that is how Jayne Eyre ends, until his heroine Thursday Next comes in and sets things on a different path. But enough of that. It's worth mentioning that I was intrigued by the glimpse I got of the story from a single remove. I am very glad I was compelled to read it. I found Jane Eyre very enjoyable, and as I mentioned very modern in many of it's features, from plot movement,to the confidential nature of the narrator's speech, to a certain darker caste, which, while gothic certainly, is also the color of the paper that nearly every screenplay and t.v. script is written on today. The rush & dash of the romance is first rate, and I am sure it was ground breaking when it was written.

Clean type, wide margins easily read, they chose to make the book slightly wider than thicker so it is comfy to hold.Entering the world of the immortal emotion in a setting long past, not being a scholar, does pose problems.Penguin provides valuable auxilliary notes explaining the context quite well.For instance,I had not known that Thackery was struggling with publishing then and that C.B. was taking solace and courage from his battles.Do other publishings of the classics:Norton,Dover, Bantam, etc. relate to the public as well?I whish my fellow customers or Amazon in its info blurb were more sensitive to how the book they review is made,and how the text is supported."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Of all of the books that I have had to read in high school, I have never enjoyed one as much as \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Charlotte Bronte has created a touching, beautiful heroine: one who finds herself and her one true love.

However when it is forced down the throats of unwilling English students, Bronte's ultra-quixotic plot, and seemingly incessant need to detail the most superficial minutia only add to the painful legnth of the novel.By page 400, I had become so tired of Jane's apathetic nature, I was indifferent to the outcome, so long as it came swiftly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I am not sure whether or not I enjoyed this book.

She starts out in the home of her aunt and three cousins all of whom despise her. She was left there as a young girl with her caring uncle when both of her parents died. Her uncle died shortly later and Jane was left in less than desirable conditions. After a blood-curdling incident her frustrated aunt sends her off to boarding school where, for the most part, she is treated worse than she was in her aunt's home. From there she becomes a governess and takes care of a little girl for a man whom she later falls in love with. This is where the story really gets interesting as several twists and turns take the couple towards an unexpected ending.Charlotte Bronte, the author, has a writing style typical of the romance period. Her vivid descriptions, while being wonderfully picturesque, can at times be lengthy. There are so many images of gardens and mountains and sunsets that the plot often gets lost somewhere along the way. The story can also become frustrating at times. I often longed to yell at the characters and set them in the right direction as they slowly picked their way through the tangled mess they were enveloped in.Bronte's heart was in the right place with this one. The story is one of a great love and an extraordinary woman. Jane Eyre is a one in a million kind of girl whose life story is definitely one worth telling. However, it is one that could have been told much more simply. There are parts of the novel that don't seem to have any real purpose other than to fill pages. They don't give away anything as to how she is going to end up. It merely confuses and frustrates the reader into utter boredom. So while the story and writing are both tasteful, Jane Eyre can only be taken in small doses."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane was such a brave woman throughout her misfortunes .She began as a womanly child, professing to ignore her troubles and trying to love life for its worth .She deserved LOVE."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I have a good hint for all you people who have to read this or any other book for summer reading or as a class assignment.

All I say is that there was an Anti-Semitic comment by Jane Eyre in the middle of the book that turned me down. I started to doubt Jane's moral and could not recover from that ignorant statement. I finished the book just to know how that story would end. I don't have any admiration for the character."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It seems that the basic purpose of the character Jane Eyre is to suffer nobly and then eventually succeed. Both elements are highly problematic as presented. Her noble suffering acts to undermine her actual character, making someone that reacts the same to most of the challenges--stoic, determined, largely silent, resigned. This required attitude makes her too much of a blank slate, too reactive, with insufficient personal details to be memorable or seem like a complex psychological portrait. One gathers that Bronte was trying to subvert common norms in representation of woman, by making Jane a lot plainer and less accomplished than was the usual style. She may have made a major improvement in this, and as discussed below there are some interesting elements to all this, but the basic result undercuts the character's agency too much. Jane can work as a symbol, she does not work as a person, and the novel is too deeply linked to her consciousness for that to be a passable loss.As well there are major pacing issues and apparent questions on the larger arc, with much of the first hundred pages and the last hundred and fifty being off-tangent to the necessary interactions for the particular story. Still, it was hardly the worst or most difficult work to get through. For much of the first two hundred pages I found it moderately enjoyable, without thinking it was very good. I was reading it as a dark comedy, framed by a blank protagonist in a fundamentally ridiculous situation. The humor--genuine though presumably unintended--came from the contrast of the stylized language forms and general etiquette focus and how cruelly people acts. See in particular the treatment of Jane in the devil child scene, in the way that's she stiffly defends herself as opposed to how the school argues she's a literal follower of the devil, and how that's a bad thing. Amusing, in a twisted sense, at least as I took it.Where I stopped being able to do this was precisely the point that the horrid and creepy Mr. Rochester became crucial to the story. He was a fundamentally twisted, harsh and disturbing person in his own right, and the eventual arc of the book where Jane does marry him and this is apparently a good thing fatally undermines the book. The way Jane plods on is problematic in itself, but it's what he ultimately plods to that is truly wrong. Rochester's focus on pride and control, his lies, his age, his borderline-deranged manner of fixating on women, the fact we have only his own word on the true story with his first wife, all these make Jane's eventual marriage with him very far from a happy thing. Yet the book seems insistent to regard it in this light, as if Rochester's injury has in itself transformed his character enough that Jane waiting on him for the rest of his life a satisfying resolution. It's the ending scenario that makes the conclusion of the author and the whole structure of the narrative less than even good.Nevertheless, the novel is an accomplishment in a number of ways. That it exists at all, that early in the nineteenth century a woman could be published. Furthermore, it's extraordinary that she was able to include so centrally in her work a protest and anger against the systemic condition of women of her time, and that both elements have been perpetuated down into the present. Creepy as some of the above subtext is, that's a worthwhile development amidst what was a pretty terrifyingly close-minded century.There's also some interesting stuff at work with religion, class and attitudes in the nineteenth century context, Jane occupying a bit of a hybrid position in all of these, not affluent nor truly destitute, not tightly religious or a firm skeptic. The hybridity of her position is very revealing to a lot of norms that we might not see in novels of the period, as her very existence in the text portrays social structures even while it undermines them. Jane Eyre the character and book are transgressive in certain ways, then, and the way this plays out is interesting. Yet, I find this appealing and informative more in my hat as historian than as a reader. The book is quite revealing of the cultural context of the author, but that's going to be the case for almost every book ever published, and it's notably less effective in framing the context for its invented narrative, cast of characters, and atmosphere. I could forgive a lot more in this book, and even come to value much of it, if it weren't for that ending that pushes the whole thing into a disturbed romance. However the book does, and so let it rest.Jane Eyre reminds me of and is better than: Bronte's Wuthering HeightsJane Eyre reminds me of and is worse than: Shelly's Frankenstein"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I had to read this for a class and expected to have to force myself through it.

I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it. Its language is beautiful - refined, fragrant, and surprisingly fresh. The dialogs and descriptions are memorable and visual. Above all, the novel introduces us to two main characters, a young orphan- pale, thin, \\"almost un-earthy\\" but determined, strong-willed, kind and reasonable Jane and Mr. Edward Rochester - sardonic, powerful, passionate, and tormented master of Thornfield. The story of their impossible love has attracted millions of readers not only in the English speaking countries but all over the world. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been adapted to TV and big screen 18 times. The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C.

When I picked it up again a couple of years later, I fell for it. I remember hating Mrs. Reed and her children - especially John - with such a passion, I wished I could reach through the book and wring their necks until they gained some sense. Mr. Brocklehurst, too. And being terrified when she was stuck in the red room. I've reread it at least five times since then, and it always seems that I come across a scene or a character that I've forgotten about in the year or two since I read it last. In college, I wrote a paper on it and came across interpretations that I'd never even began to consider, prompting careful rereading of most of the chapters once again.

Having heard it as a book on tape while on bedrest brought the story to life even more and made the mysterious Bertha and the dark and moody Mr. Rochester that much more intense.

I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of books, some more than once, and still Jane Eyre remains my favorite. It is , in my opinion, a must-read in everyone's lifetime.

My Grandmother reads hundreds of those Fabio-plastered, heaving cleavage covered paperbacks...but NOT ME. Don't get me wrong, I loved Gone with the Wind...but as I explored a few more of the more classic romances ie..Emma, Wuthering Heights, or Sense and Sensibility..I found the movies much more appealing. Then along comes Jane Eyre. She is not buxom and airheaded and dashingly beautiful. She is plain, modest, and smart...That's right! a more modern woman!! Jane does not faint at the sight of a handsome man, nor does she swoon over expensive clothes....Let me tell you a little more about Jane Eyre..... As a child, Jane was left an orphan with her brutal aunt and cousins. Treated unfairly and taunted buy the other children she soon developed a quick-witted tongue. After receiving an honest verbal lashing from Jane, her aunt packed her few belongings and pretty much &quot;shipped&quot; the young girl off to a dreadful and gloomy school called &quot;Lowood&quot;. At Lowood, Jane quickly learned to bite her tongue through strict discipline from the Headmaster.(Lowood often reminds me of the discplinary school David Copperfield received some beatings in.) Here at school Jane is educated and cared for but never loved. She stays on at Lowood to become a teacher herself, but soon finds a position in a far away town to be a private counsel and teacher to a young girl Adele. Adele is the young French, beautiful and very spoiled ward to a great man known as Mr. Rochester. Jane soon learns that Mr. Rochester is very mysterious and aloof ..he often leaves her and Adele alone for months at a time on business travel. When he is at home Jane finds herself drawn to him, his strange conversation style and his knowledge of good books. He is by no means a HANDSOME man but attracts a great deal of attention because of his financial means. I Loved this book for many reasons. I loved the contrast between Jane and Adele...Adele is spoiled, loved and beautiful....Jane the opposite. And the MYSTERIES! Where does Mr. Rochester go? WHO is Adele? Why are there screams late in the darkness of the manor? Who could it be? And the best mystery of all? What will become of Mr. Rochester and Jane? Romance? Jane never OUTWARDLY desires to be a distinguished lady like the beautiful women Mr. Rochester frequently entertaines. But as a reader you feel she deserves such a posion. You will find yourself page tuning faster and faster as you secretly wish for modest Jane Eyre to succeed and and achieve status and the love she deserves."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I recently saw the Broadway musical of Jane Eyre and was inspired to read the book. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Jane seems so real as a character that I wish I could meet her. What an amazing heroine! The reader roots for her success all through the book. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is one of the best in all of literature. In high school the classics I had to read were usually so dull (including Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte) that I tend to stear clear of classics now, even though I am a voracious reader, but Jane Eyre is so fast paced that it hardly seems like a classic. I couldn't put it down! Don't read this story because its touted as being about female empowermant and don't avoid it for the same reason. Wether you are male or female, read this book, because it is a great story with great characters you will remember for a lifetime!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Contrary to the MGM film of the 40's, this book does not begin with, \\"My name is Jane Eyre...\\" Instead, we get an opening chapter about a little girl who is cruelly treated by an abominable family, and her attempts to stay afloat. The Jane Eyre of the novel is a spirited young woman, who yearns to be able to experience life despite the limitations society has placed upon women. This book is a wonderful read. Bronte's 19th century England is not the neo-classical world of manners and balls that permeate Jane Austin's universe; rather, the world of Jane Eyre one of ragged romanticism that plays out against the harsh elements, and the world seems as primitive indoors as it does outside. Bronte writes in a very lucid, revelatory style, and the first person narrative does a lot to help draw you into this story. Even if you know the secret in the attic, there is so much more about this novel that you may not know about.The biggest surprise about this novel once I read it was that Jane's story does not end with the revelation of Rochester's dark gothic secret (even though this was written several years after Austen's Northanger Abbey, it's fun to read the two books in conjunction). I am surprised that most film and stage versions of this novel rarely include the important last third of the book. But I'll let you discover the developments to Jane's character on your own. The ending is a tear-jerker (but in a great way). This is definitely the book to read on the front porch of a summer cottage, or in front of a fire on a winter night. Mystery, romance, intrigue, religion, and feminism... it's all in here. And it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This was the best book I have ever read and I cried when it was over. I wish Charlotte Bronte had written more books.

I read it first four years ago and was particularly impressed with the quality of the writing and the ideas displayed. Charlotte Bronte very cleverly used her book as an outlet for her own feelings and experiences as a woman which, in her day, were not considered or acknowledged. Unfortunately, while reading some of the other reviews on this page and elsewhere, I have noticed that some people are still discriminatory and insensitive towards female writers and believe that their views can simply be dismissed as soppy and foolish. I do not think that this is right. The fact that a person can write about his or her life using such great detail and keeping such an objective view of it as Charlotte Bronte did should not be dismissed as monotonous or boring, but rather should be acknowledged as a talent and as a result of hard work. It also shows that it cannot be easy to analyse your own life in such a way that you can understand and write about every detail of it. Charlotte Bronte's writing of Jane Eyre reflects her own character; that she wanted, like Jane, to be independent and go out into the world, and I think that it is this element of independence in many women that defies the assumed 'authority' and 'superiority' of the opposite gender and therefore they resent feminists speaking out. All in all, I think that Jane Eyre is an excellent novel and that it should not be labelled as some foolish, whimsical piece of writing that is only respected because it was written more than a century ago. The quality and status of a book and its author should not be undermined by the period of time in which it was written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"an amazing and enthraling tale about love. it tells us to never give up in hope. many twists and turns,and leads to strange places. charlotte bronte has captured love and mystery in one fantastic tale."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"haha im into horror books.. but we had to do an Historical Fiction book report recently and i remember my mom buying me this book saying i should read it in high school, im in 7th grade, I have to say this is probably the best book i have ever read, although after she left mr.Rochester i wanted to stop because i thought it would just be depressing. but im glad i went on.

Eventually she is hired as a governess to a young girl and meets the girl's guardian Mr. Rochester, and of course they fall in love and plan to marry. But, there is a mystery about the house that once it is discovered destroys the wedding plans.A lovely tale, and Bronte has such a wonderful prose that makes you want to slow down and savor it and the story like a fine red wine or chocolate. The version I read isSelected Works of the Bronte Sisters (Wordsworth Special Editions) (Wordsworth Special Editions), so I did not have the distraction of the foot notes to refer to, and I don't feel that I missed much without them.

The things this author endured are truly amazing and no human should be subjected to the challenges she faced in this period of her life. She didn't give up though. She got through it and tells exactly what kept her going in this book. Whether it's a drug addiction or any other difficulty, Cynthia Hunter is proof that you can get through it and that happiness really is right around the corner. This is a very moving book and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Diary Of A Crack Addict's Wife","review":"This is an amazing story written in a raw style that clearly depicts the agony and pain of living with a crack addicted spouse. Cindy's story sheds light on what happens when you continue to try and believe that people in the control of drugs will change. Working her way through an unbelivably abusive relationship while raising her young son and trying to care for her unborn child is a testament to what can be done not matter your station in life. She pulled herself from a living hell and took control of her life in order to create some order. The work she is now doing to help others in relationships ruled by the iron fist of drug addiction is commendable and they style and tenor of this book done any other way would just not be as impactful. Take the time to read this book, it will give you a look inside the world of drugs, abuse and show you how there is always light in your darkest hour. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Diary Of A Crack Addict's Wife","review":"\\"Diary of a Crack Addicts Wife\\" is an excellent story that everyone should take time out to read. I think that everybody in their own way can relate to the story. Either someone knows someone that is a user or has been affected by the drug in their past. And this is one of the best books that talks about that specific issue. You won't find to many other women to come out of the closet and say that their spouse is on drugs. There is a problem in society and that is keeping the drugs off of the streets. Ms. Hunter is one of the very few who is attempting to do that."},{"Title":"Diary Of A Crack Addict's Wife","review":"First I want to start off by saying this was a great book. When I started reading the \\"Diary of a Crack Addicts wife\\" I found it was hard to even put it down for a second. I always enjoyed reading books about real life experiences. But this book just kept taking me by suprise. I personally havent dealt with any of the issues that were related to the book, but if there is anybody who is dealing or dealt with spouses who are or were drug addicts, or abusers I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Diary Of A Crack Addict's Wife","review":"A true story well written in dairy form, of Ms Hunter's powerful ordeal of her life with the man she loved who abused her and drugs.Thank god she lived through this nightmare to share her horrific story and also help others who are in abusive relationships.

The only way this can happen is if SHE was the crack addict and not the husband!!!! I have no sympathy for this lying manipulative woman who is now whoring her story for money. Research the facts, a baby cannot be born addicted to crack unless the mother has been using it! I feel no remorse for this woman and threw the book away immediately. I want my money back.

Her kids deserved to be taken from her."},{"Title":"Diary Of A Crack Addict's Wife","review":"Have you or someone you know been impacted by the effects of drugs? Are you aware of the impact that it brings to the immediate family and those around? Cynthia D. Hunter addresses these questions and more in her book DIARY OF A CRACK ADDICT?S WIFE.Based on a true story and taken from the pages of her actual diary, Hunter takes us into a time frame of over three years. In this period, she candidly shares the abusive relationship that she endured with her former spouse, Mark. From the surface, Mark seemed to be the perfect partner; however, after the discovery of his addiction to crack cocaine, the relationship dramatically changed, leading to a road of heartache, struggle, abuse, and betrayal. From beginning to end, we are offered a first hand account on how the addiction impacted all involved and how the journey changed her life.Whether you or someone else has been affected, the message that is offered is honest, passionate, and compelling. Many who have already been impacted will relate to Cynthia?s story. While my only criticism is that the distinction between the commentary and actual entries should have been clearer, Ms. Hunter has broken new ground in the literary world by sharing her own story. In the midst of it all, Ms. Hunter has come through, and I applaud her for her courage to make a difference in the lives of those who will come across this tale.Reviewed by Kanika A. Wadeof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Diary Of A Crack Addict's Wife","review":"I must agree that this book was very hard to put down and that the author's messages to the reader are truly inspiring and moving. However, if you are like me, and are very analytical when it comes to reading, it seems as though the author's message is lost somewhere along the line when she does not turn out to be the \\"martyr\\" she portrays herself to be. (SPOILER ALERT...don't read on if you don't want to know what happens!)Initially, you feel sorry for the author and understand where she is coming from...you want to sympathize with her as she always looks for the good in people. However, as the book progresses, you realize that the author is just as irresponsible as the crack addict himself. She goes along through the book, pointing out what a \\"bad\\" man he is all the while skipping and glossing over her own obvious issues as if there is nothing wrong with them. This author has had 3 children out of wedlock with 3 different men (did they ever actually get married or was it a common-law marriage). Not once does she ever mention that perhaps this was irresponsible (oops..she \\"got\\" pregnant!) Now I'm no fuddy duddy but this preaching of hers is completely clouded by her obviously un-Christian lifestyle. The clincher is the obvious addiction of her own...spending. The minute she gets any money in her hands, she is out buying clothes, cars, shoes, getting her hair done. It never stops. She also glosses over her past battles with alcoholism and has a baby born addicted to crack in the end. I agree a woman should treat herself once in a while but come on...if your crack addict husband is blowing all of your money and you were pregnant, wouldn't you be saving for a rainy day? Maybe he isn't the only irresponsbile one...I lost my sympathy for her character as soon as I realized she had her own demons she refused to acknowledge yet expected him to change. Huge disapointment."},{"Title":"Diary Of A Crack Addict's Wife","review":"I bought this book, started reading, was amazed it ever got published, put it down, picked it up again and reconfirmed my opinion. I thought the writing was simple and pedantic. Her story didn't add up in some cases. (she's slicing him up in the kitchen and her brother doesn't wake up?,)It spoke to a limited group, primarily black women living in the hood. I work with these women, they're not going to read this book. I found the vernacular to be pandering. There was no hope in this book. I found myself more frustrated than connected with the author. I wanted to hear about her journey of self-discovery, God-discovery and all I read was \\"poor me\\"."},{"Title":"Diary Of A Crack Addict's Wife","review":"Was not as gripping as what i had hoped, though it was an insight into the mindset of an abused woman."},{"Title":"Diary Of A Crack Addict's Wife","review":"I don't mean no disrespect to the author. I think she had good intentions for writing this book. I just think that as a writer, she missed the mark.After reading the reviews, I went out and bought the book,expecting a good read. What I got instead was a preachy self help book.I think that this book is good for people who may have had problems with drugs or have with dealt with addicted spouses. But for those of us who are looking for a good read, this is not the book for you. It's not a page turner, it not a book you try to stay up late to finish reading. In fact, I didn't even finsh reading the book. The preachy messages after the diary entries were just too annoying and distracting. The messages should have been saved for the ending or epilogue.For an exciting novel about drugs, I would recommend Crack Head by Lisa Lennox or Harlem Girl Lost.

Hunter's powerful true story. Written in diary form (spanning the years 1985-88) she smoothly takes the reader into her past and the many levels of abuse she had to withstand at the hands of her crack addicted spouse. Physically and emotionally corrupted, Cynthia also had to face the life-long effects her dysfunctional situation had on her young son. As Cynthia tells her painfully honest story, she continues to show her strength by providing words of encouragement and inspiration. I commend Ms. Hunter not only for overcoming her plight, but also for her commitment to helping others in abusive situations.EnglishrulerARC Book Club Inc.Star Rating: 5 stars"},{"Title":"Diary Of A Crack Addict's Wife","review":"Wow this book brought back so many memories of the Crack epidemic of the 80's and what many of my friends went though.

No nutritional information ie calories, fat etc. is listed. There a few color photographs but not many. Preperation time ranges from as few as 5minutes for Baked Eggs with Scampi to 1 and 1/2 hours for Whole Meal Gnocchi served with a Tomato and Basil coulis.Montignac's eating program is NOT explained in this small recipe booklet. But he does have a one page listing of the glycemic index at the back and on another page he lists food ideas for a MONTIGNAC party!MONTIGNAC also has another cookbook, which is larger with more recipes. I would select that one first and if you want more recipes with a gourmet flair order this one also!"},{"Title":"Brionne","review":"Brionne is a good western and an enjoyable read, but is simply not up to the standards L'Amour set for himself. The best part of his books is the unexpected twist that always comes in the climax. This time, I was dissapointed. The climax was spelled out through the whole book so there wasn't much of a surprise when it finally came.Don't get me wrong, though. I really liked the prairie fire scene, and the only reason I give this book 3 stars is the fact that L'Amour wrote many books that were much better. The fact that one of L'Amours worst books was still extremely enjoyable shows how far ahead of the competition he is. Kirby Jonas, Ralph Compton, Zane Grey and any other western writer you can name simply can't hold a candle to L'Amour. He is in a league of his own when it comes to westerns. Every one of his many, many legions of fans will attest to this fact."},{"Title":"Brionne","review":"L'Amour's story of a man whose wife has killed herself before a band of thieves and thugs can rape and murder her, keeps your interest from the first. Brionne's concern with his son, traumatized by witnessing his mother's attack and death, and his attempt to help a young woman in distress take him to wild country where the same band of outlaws are trying to kill him, his son, the young woman, and anyone else traveling with him.

They write like a matched pair, and I'd be proud to recommend anything by either of them."},{"Title":"Brionne","review":"This was a typical L'Amour, and it's easy to use the word typical with a L'Amour because let's face it, they were all an awful lot alike. The book was pretty good. I liked the characters and all. But like most of L'Amour's stuff they lacked the emotion I've come to enjoy from other authors. Take Kirby Jonas. He's the guy people have started calling The New Louis L'Amour. It's pretty fitting, because he writes in a lot the same style. But his books have more emotion, and you get more involved with his characters. What I like about L'Amour is how clean his books are, and how he keeps down the swearing. But Kirby Jonas is the same there, too. I think L'AMour has some stiff competition on his tail!"},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I only bought this book because of the horse racing connection. My guess is that the author has never been to a horse race in her life, much less done any adequate research on training and what it takes to become a jockey. Even for the reader without any knowledge of the horse racing industry, this is a very poorly written book, the ending is something a child would come up with, the characters evoke no emotion whatsoever from the reader, and their development is non-existent."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"No empathy for the characters, no knowledge of horses or horse racing and the book was difficult to follow.Do not read this book if you love horses or horse racing. It has little to do with any of it and it is very obvious that Fern did not do much research into either."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews.There is hardly any empathy for any of the characters, especially for one of the main characters at the end of the book. Oh, and horse knowledge? There is no way a Kentucky Derby would end as it did here. I don't want to give it away...but for starters, lets just say a horse does not cross over a finish line..but under a finish wire.The line of characters was also confusing, but I eventually figured it out.However if you are like me, a book with horses in it at all keeps me entertained."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I liked this book, having read the first two of the series. Some of the other reviewers had not read the first two books, and I think it helps to understand the characters and why things are happening the way they do.I found the events of &quot;Derby Day&quot; to be exciting with the unexpected turn of events. I too, was surprised by the ending, and wonder if it is &quot;paving the way&quot; for a possible fourth book in the series (that was supposed to be a trilogy)."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"UGH! How insulting this book is. If the plot got any more simplistic, I don't think that I could have finished the book. Oh wait, I didn't finish the book.

Does she think we are all simpletons?"},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"This was a great trilogy. Fern Michaels did a great job intertwining the Thortons and the Colemans from her previous two trilogies. There were some characters in the book that were not brought to their potential,but as an overall quick read for a fun summer book I loved it."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"Kentucky Sunrise follows the families of Kentucky through another run at the Derby. I found the story hard to follow and the characters did not have any depth.

However, Nealy is disappointed with the poor conditions of the horse farm and appalled over the thoroughbred chosen to represent Blue Diamond at the Derby. Being a half owner along with Emmie, Nealy begins efforts to invigorate Blue Diamond into her the operation.Emmie resents her mother's cavalier attitude and interference. A rivalry that somewhat existed before Nealy's arrival with Emmie trying to outdo her mother's success explodes into full war between the two relatives. Ultimately, the business cannot go on like this and a final confrontation between mother and daughter over who runs Blue Diamond is imminent with their personal relationship on the line as well.The final tale of Fern Michaels' Kentucky trilogy is an exciting relationship drama that focuses on the poignancy of two women who love one another yet perhaps love the farm more. This leads to an unhealthy competition for top dog (horse?) in what may prove to be a destructive relationship if they are not more sensitive to the other's feelings. The story line is typical of Ms. Michaels' extended Texas-Vegas-Kentucky orb and many of the same characters appear in this novel adding to the enjoyment of fans, but also takes a trots down a surprising track.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I started reading this book way back in August and I've been reading it for over a month and still haven't finished it. This book is trash! A horse just doesn't go to the Derby without prior prep races. They usually have a two year old season and then they have prep races in their three year old season and if they are lucky the horse makes it to the Derby. Another major flaw is that jockeys would NEVER ride their first race in the Derby. Jockeys start out riding at the bottom ranks and work their way up to the bigger stakes races as they improve. I still can't figure out why this author would write on a subject they had no experience."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I LOVE this series!! If you started with the Texas series, instead of this book, which is the last book in the series, I think you will find that these characters have a lot of depth and you become very involved with their lives. Once I started, I could not put these books down!!"},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I never thought about it but after I read the reviews, I guess someone who hadn't read the entire series might be lost but this is one of the best series of book I have ever read. If you start at the beginning with the Texas series the books are fantastic."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"It seems that all you need today is to have the patience to write a full-length novel - the talent and original ideas come in a poor second and third. This book is horribly written, the plot is cliche, the characters are selfish and hard to relate to, and Ms. Michaels has added the final insult of not researching her topic. She knows nothing about horse racing, horses, or Las Vegas.I think, besides all of the errors, that the thing that bothered me the most about this book was the stupid names of the characters. Pyne, Birch, Fanny, Willow, Hatch Littletree, even a Monica Lepinsky. This is drivel and should never have been published."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"This is my first Fern Michaels novel to read. I purchased the book because I live close to Kentucky and I enjoy novels involving horses and dogs. This one looked like a winner to me after reading the book cover. I thought the ending was a little strange. Not many people will dig up the remains from out of the graves, horses or human. Still, it was her story so to each their own. I could feel the characters and the pain of Emmie. I could also understand the perfectionist in Nealy. But more than anything, I enjoyed the plot and thought the story flowed very well. Family situations like this one that Michaels wrote about actually does exist in the world today, so it was a believable story to me. I think perhaps when reading a work of fiction, one should take into consideration that the words are only fiction and concentrate on the story. We may not the like the characters, or care for the outcome, but if the story is good and you can feel the emotion...want to keep turning the page, then Michaels has accomplished what she set out to do...write a good story. I'll be checking the library for some of her other works. I, for one, do recommend &quot;Kentucky Sunrise&quot; for a good read."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I picked up Kentucky Sunrise at the library hoping to find a new author I would enjoy. I am a Kentucky girl and grew up around horses. I will say that Ms Michaels knows horses but she left me utterly confused about the motivation of her human characters. Maybe I need to read the preceding stories so that I will understand why the characters behave the way they do, but the plot development in this book was very difficult to follow. And the epilogue at the end made absolutely no sense unless it was the setting for the next book in the series. I am not motivated to go and read the first two books in this series and would not recommend Kentucky Sunrise."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"This book is terrible. The characters are scattered and impossible to follow, the plot (what plot?) is horribly scripted, and it's a complete waste of money and time. I'd been considering reading it for some time, and now I'm sorry I spent money on it.If you're looking for a good horse story/mystery read Tami Hoag's DARK HORSE. Tami Hoag KNOWS horses ... she's an avid competitor herself. Fern Michaels obviously knows nothing about horses or horse racing. She'd be better off writing Harlequin Romance novels ... they are short and it would be much less painful."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"This is the first Fern Michaels book I've read, just picked it up on a whim. Absolutely no depth to the characters! Very hard to follow. Half way through the book and I don't even care how it ends! The dialogue feels like it was written by a 2nd grader. One star may be one too many!"},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I have read the Texas saga, the Vegas trilogy, and the Kentucky trilogy, as well as a few other books written by Fern Michael. For some reason, the Kentucky trilogy is the only one that I really loved. I love Nealy, her 'rags to riches' story and some of the people that come into her life.I do love the horse breeding/racing storyline too. But something that I've noticed, and the main reason why I stopped reading Fern Michael's books, is the continuity in her storyline from book to book. Sometimes even from events at the beginning of a book not quite matching up with the twists she puts in at the end. It's like she decides what she wants to throw into the story as she's going along and then doesn't even remember that the details differ from what she's already written. For this reason, I could only give these books 4 stars. As long as you can overlook that flaw in the writting, I would recommend these books."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"It was not one of my favorites, and I have read all of his triology books! The Vegas and Ketucky series were much better."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I can't speak for the previous books in the series (Kentucky Rich) as perhaps the early story of Nealy was better, but this book drove me nuts! I only kept reading to find out if they would race the Derby, and that was a pathetic short part of the book.Are we supposed to LIKE Nealy or feel a connection to her? God, what a horrible mean and controlling woman--famous jockey or no. I didn't like the rest of the family much either. No humor whatsoever. No romance either. The only characters I felt even some humor/connection/likability for were two of the minor ones, Willow and Jake. Shame.Apparently Fern Michaels has written a number in this series, and all I can say is why?"},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I read the entire Kentucky series and was horribly disappointed by how it ended. I'm an avid reader but haven't been this disappointed by a series...ever. Michaels spends the entire time redoing the personalities of her previous characters and makes them seem more narcissistic and selfish than in the first two books. She also obviously knows little about horse racing, but I had this figured out by the first book. Don't waste your time..."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"and that's just one of my complaints about this book. Kentucky Sunrise is the third book in the Kentucky trilogy and I read them in order. I kept hoping the characters would turn their lives around or learn from their trials but they just seemed to go from bad to worse. Why did I rate this 4 stars? Basically, Ms. Michaels knows how to tell a story, I loved reading about the racing setting and the training of horse and jockey alike. As with all other books I've read by this author, her dialogue needs work. There may be two people involved in a conversation, but one does all the talking and asking of questions before the other is given time to respond. It just seems stilted.

Because my commute is a long one I suffered through all three books. I have to say I have rarely seen characters more narcissistic, clueless and selfish. Finding a character I could even root for was daunting.I would not waste my time with this sad group of characters. The whole series was like watching a train wreak, only not that exciting."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"Fabulous customer service! Always have what I want and at an affordable price.

She was selfish and controlling and clearly had no love for her husband or her children. She was just obsessed with her horses and owning the family farm, etc. I thought she was a horrible person. I can deal with characters who have flaws they need to deal with, but she had no redeeming qualities at all. It was an awful book, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"I picked this book up to read while i stayed at the beach. It was very hard to follow, as i havent read the others, and rather well i dunno kinda boring. i love horses and racing more than anything in the world and it is rather obvious that the author doesnt know much about either subject. It seemed kinda repetitive and something about the story bothered me deeply...but im not sure what. if you want great horse reading buy Seabiscuit by laura H. it is a beatufully written story and interesting to follow!"},{"Title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"This is the 3rd in a series.

The instructions are concise.He tells you how to do a lift and he provides some tips to help you avoid doing a lift incorrectly. The shadow-man graphics make the proper form easy to recognize for most of the exercises.The lifts are described with simple barbell and dumbbell examples as well as machine variations for those who have access to more expensive equipment.

It's perfect for boys AND girls, with a surprise twist at the end...turns out the baby is in the kitchen with her DAD, not mom. Hurray! 1 word of caution...this book is not for you if you can't stand the noise of pots and pans banging together in the kitchen. As for me, I'm thrilled with any distraction that allows me and my toddler to peacefully co-exist in the kitchen when I need to cook/clean. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pots and Pans","review":"This book can be read very quickly for the impatient baby, or savored for the older toddler. The pictures are cute, and the main adult in the story is the father. My toddler liked the presence of the dog and cat. She enjoyed the book since she was 8 months old. It is not one of her favorites now at 2 1/2 but we still read it occasionally since it only takes about 2 minutes to get through. The rhythm and rhyme flow well.This would make a great baby gift!Jennifer Clauson"},{"Title":"Pots and Pans","review":"This is a favorite of my daughter's!

It has a wonderful rhythm as you read the words.

And suprise....at the end it is the Dad doing the dishes (you only see his socked feet for the previous pages). My daughter has been &quot;reading&quot; this since she was 10 mo. old, and now, at 16 mo. she brings this book to me every day, and we read it at least twice. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Pots and Pans","review":"Pots and Pans is a marvelous book combining fun rhyme with beautiful illustrations. The listening child will enjoy banging his hands to the rhythm of the poetry in the book as he watches the baby in the book bang on the pots and pans in the kitchen. Excitement builds as the kitchen becomes less and less tidy. Onomatopoetic words entrance the youngest readers and they are soon beating a tattoo when they hear, &quot;Ching, ching, ching, listen to them ring! Cling, clang, cling, listen to them sing! Bang, bang, bang! Bam, bam, wham!&quot; The illustrations show a &quot;real&quot; baby, with bib overalls, wispy hair and an impish grin of delight."},{"Title":"Pots and Pans","review":"My 22 month old daughter can not get enough of this book.

Got it to go along with the &#34;pots and pans&#34; purchased for her new &#34;kitchen.&#34;"},{"Title":"Pots and Pans","review":"A few years ago, I was given a set of stainless steel nesting bowls as a wedding present. I liked them and stuck them in my cabinet . . . and promptly forgot about them. They just weren't particularly useful. And then my son reached six months of age and began to discover toys and I was rummaging among my cabinets for something to give him, and there they were! Since then, those nesting bowls have become a fundamental part of my son's toys. He adores the noise they make crashing into one another and when flung about on the floor. Pots and Pans is the perfect book to capture that activity in its essence.A simple, rhyming book full of onomatopoeic sound words to describe the noise of pots and pans and other things, it's a clamorous joy to read aloud (and fun to add your own pots and pans to the beat!) A little baby, a puppy and cat are all busy exploring a kitchen full of pots, pans, bowls and boxes and making lots of noise in the process. The book transports you right into the middle of the activity with lively rhyme and rhythm. \\"Pots and pans/lids and cans/ baby's in the kitchen/with pots and pans\\". The pictures are soft pencil and pastel colors, but realistically drawn images of a baby, cat, dog and eventually a father who comes in at the very end when the baby has dumped over an enormous amount of stuff. Diane de Groat's sense of scene and composition make this book charming and delightful to look over the detail of the images, and yet convey the actions without making the page too busy.One particular thing I love about this book is that the pages are a sturdy cardstock, rather than the regular paper, or bulky board book style. They're sturdy enough that I can read this to a baby or toddler and allow them to touch the pages without immediate worry that they'll rip or tear it. And believe me, my curious almost-toddler loves to try and yank the pages out of my hands--he loves turning pages! There are few picture books, I think that capture an almost universal moment in babies' (and their parents) lives with such clarity and charm. I'm very happy I discovered this little gem! Folks who like this may also want to look for Cookie's Week by Cindy Ward and Down by the Station by Will Hillenbrand.Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshad"},{"Title":"Pots and Pans","review":"This book was a favorite of my two daughters, and now my 18 month old son loves it as well. The rhythm of the text, and the realistic illustrations, are very appealing to toddlers. Although my son can't say the words yet, he tries to \\"sing\\" along. This is one of those books that a child will consistently bring back to you again and again!"},{"Title":"Story Engine Universal Rules","review":"Outgrown the d20 system? Think GURPS is too clunky and bogged down? Then welcome to Story Engine, a bare bones, streamlined generic system.The systems is built around 6 sided dice, yes, just one kind of die! There are 4 stats; Matter (for physical trials) Mind (mental), Spirit (willpower) and Chaos (luck). To create a character the player spends story points to create descriptors under each stat. For4 example, you could spend some points and make your character &quot;strong&quot; (Matter) some more to make him &quot;Handsome&quot; (Matter again) and then maybe a few more to say &quot;Things tend to go his way&quot; (Chaos). But the descriptors aren't merely window dressing. During the game the player can &quot;burn&quot; a descrptior for a bonus on the trial check. The above character could say, &quot;I'm so 'strong' I should win this battle&quot; burning the &quot;strong&quot; descriptor for that gaming session and thus claim the bonus.In addition to the stats the players can develop abilities (basically skills, your level of experience with each skill determine s your bonus on checks) and special features, the nature of whcih depend on the campaign. In a hard-science espionage campagin a special abilitiy might be &quot;Very Likeable.&quot; In a supoerheroes campaign, it might be flight or x-ray vision.There are only two things that might bring this system down in some people's eyes. First, as stated, the game is minimalist, all trials are resolved by a single die roll. For people who enjoy long, drawn out battles and still think it's cool to keep track of &quot;hit points&quot; this can be a problem. Second, unlike GURPS there is little to no support material, which means the GM will have to do a lot of work to set up a campaign. If you don;t mind this though, &quot;Story Engine&quot; provides one of the best generic gaming systems available."},{"Title":"Story Engine Universal Rules","review":"it offers insightful points of view but doesn't really close in on it's main theory. basically it should be more a tip book for writing stories in video games.

The reason, apparently, is that it was originally not a Saint story, but was adapted from one written before the author settled on the Saint as his protagonist of choice.Nevertheless, the adaptation of this full-length story (concerning a battle of wits with a girl out to revenge the framing and consequent suicide of her father) is a thorough one. The Saint's constant adversary Claud Eustace Teal is fully integrated into the story, which is told with the author's usual acerbic wit; and Slinky Dyson and Snake Ganning (both fromEnter the Saint) make cameo appearances.And at the end we find out that the Saint and James Bond have more in common than we suspected.P.S.

He always knows if she will be here by the smoke on the mountain. He isn't allowed to touch her during a dream. She is crying now. She tells him that her parents are dead and her Great-Uncle will soon be coming to take her and her brother away. She will begin her training as a Wind Walker as soon as her uncle takes her. She has never told him her name. While they are talking, Arin sees a man with gray hair approaching. He grabs his friend and takes her away.He wakes up screaming and his father, Commodore Marcus Dorwen, comes running in Arin's room. Arin knows that he was adopted. His father now decides that Arin is old enough to learn the truth. It turns out that Arin is Ayanlak and that his father grabbed him during a sacrifice. Arin was being sacrificed. Some Ayanlak were getting ready to drop Arin into a flame, he still bears the scar on his arm caused by the fire.The Ayanlak were on this world when the Humans came in their ships. The Humans were forced to land and there has fighting between the two races ever since, mainly caused by the Humans. They are trying to take over more and more of the planet. The Ayanlak live much simpler lives. The Humans treat them as sub-Human.It is years later now, and Arin has studied and become an engineer. His adopted mother died and he is very close to his father. His assistant, Jolif, is Ayanlak and is the best friend Arin ever had. The two have even become blood-bonded. Arin is sent to a town to build a bridge over a river.Tayree and her twin, Talon, have become Wind Walkers. She was being pursued by the twin-heir, Palan. Tayree sensed the evil in him and turned him down. Eventually, he tried to rape her and didn't succeed because of her brothers. She married her twin's best friend in order to safe from Palan. It didn't work. Palan poisoned her three sons, and killed her Chaiqua (an animal that protects the nobly born and Wind Walkers). When Tayree's husband learned of the death of their sons, he went after Palan and both of them ended up going over a cliff together. Tayree is still mourning her loss. She has a dream that the other twin-heir is still alive and living with the Na'Huma. She is sent to the Na-Humas to find him and teach him all she can of the Ayanlak way of life during their trip back to her people.When she finally finds him, he is an identical twin to Palan. She sees her enemy's face every time she looks at him. Arin meets Tayree and begins to fall in love with her. It turns out that Arin was stolen from his parents and they miss him dearly. He finally gets permission from his Uncle to accompany Tayree back to the Canyon to his parents. And so they begin their trip back, facing danger at every step.Arin never really fit in with the Humans as a child. He was never really accepted as one of them. So, he turned all his energies into becoming an engineer. He is hoping that his high placement in their government will help him to fit in. He lived his whole life believing that he was never really wanted. After all, his parents were going to sacrifice him. When he finally learns the truth, he is shocked. He has always had the ability to &quot;talk&quot; to animals and influence them and has tried to hide this his whole life. Now, he begins to understand some of this and is anxious to learn all he can about the Ayanlak and their way of life. He also recognizes Tayree as the girl he saw in his dreams as a child. He begins to fall in love with her and hates what his evil twin did to her. He is afraid that she will never be able to overcome this. Jolif is a good friend to Arin. He is really the only friend that Arin has. When Tayree comes and Arin learns the truth about himself, it is Jolif that helps him to accept what he is. Tayree is a Wind Walker. She has trained for this and it is her whole life. Her duties as a Wind Walker are the most important thing to her. She has been hurt badly and has yet to heal. She knows what is expected of her and really doesn't want to do it. Eventually, she begins to see the man that Arin has become. She still sees Palan in his face and knows that friends are all they will ever be.I love the way that Indian legend and folklore is woven all through the story. This one is quite different from of Michelle Levigne's Commonwealth stories. There is no space travel during the course of this story. This one takes place all on one planet. The characters in the story are all very well rounded and the world as described is incredible! I loved the way that Arin had to learn to overcome the prejudice that faced him, first among the Humans and later among the Ayanlak because of Palan. This is a wonderful story full of adventure and myth and racial strife. This is one you definitely don't want to miss."},{"Title":"The Kingdom Agenda","review":"Tony Evans writes this comprehensive book with clarity and with the authority of God's Word. I found this book challenging to live my faith in every area of my life: my personal life, my family life, my church life and my community life. Dr. Evans touches on subjects many authors are afraid of, such as the woman's and the man's biblical roll in the family and church, racism, and politics. He doesn't hold back the truth as expressed in the bible. Christianity is not a one day a week religion; as this book suggests it is for every day, every moment, every area of our lives. I would recommend it to all Christians in all stages of maturity."},{"Title":"The Kingdom Agenda","review":"Are you ready to start living an amazing, exciting, adventurous, victorious Christian life? If not, go read the yellow pages! If so, this book is soooo for you!!! This book is so good it made me cry! For so long God has been dropping little things into my spirit. To read what God has been talking to me about over the past three years in one place at one time was like a sward that pierced my spirit. This book has and will continue to change my life. God has used Dr.Evans to put words to my heart cries. I have found myself shouting AMEN as I read. Every day is a new adventure now that I am living on His agenda and not my own.Dr. Evans outlines what the body of Christ needs to be doing and how we can start fulfilling the call that God has on our lives. It is an overall view of how we, as the body of Christ, can change the world. We are not just taking up time and space until Jesus comes back. We need to be about our Father's business. Dr. Evans breaks down exactly what that means in ways we can understand. Too many of us are staring up in the sky with our bags packed waiting for Jesus to come back. Some of us are not sure weathering to fight or wait for the great flight. At times, the job of disciplining the nations seems overwhelming, but if we take it bit by bit with everyone functioning in his/her gifting than the job seems so much more doable. Besides, we have the power of the Holy Spirit to fill in the gaps. He takes our mind from an earthy perspective to a heavenly perspective. What a difference a change of scenery makes! This book is a must for each and every Christian who wants to live a victorious Christian life that bears lasting fruit. Dr. Evans stays true to his great illustrations as well as his humor. You can almost hear him laughing as he writes.Take your time. Pray before you start reading and ask God to show you the world from HIS perspective and not our own. Enjoy! May God show you HIS agenda in all things!"},{"Title":"The Kingdom Agenda","review":"Dr. Tony Evans has a gift of breaking down the Word of God in the most simple terms.

In sharing his books with other believers, they too have be enlightened and challenged to demonstrate their beliefs in their daily walk.I strongly recommend this book to those who are seeking greater faith and a better understanding of God and who we are in His Son, Jesus.

In as much as a course is usually built around a textbook, the length and thoroughness of the textbook are of great importance. It is our belief that it is desirable to place such a volume in the hands of electrical engineering students even though only a fraction of the material can be covered in the classroom.The attendant problems of deciding what can be omitted in a college course has been simplified in this text by the arrangement of material. Each subject is treated in somewhat the following fashion:ConstructionDiscussion of operating characteristicsCalculation of operating characteristics from tests'sDiscussions and analyses of various related phenomenaParticular emphasis is laid upon methods of calculation and the physical principles on which the analyses depend.

Synchronous GeneratorsII. TransformersIII. Polyphase Induction MotorsIV. Single phase Induction MotorsV. Synchronous MotorsVI. Alternators in ParallelVII. Synchronous ConvertersVIII. Mercury-vapor RectifiersIX. Series MotorsX. Repulsion Motors"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I had to order this book from Borders because I ordered it in July, 2000. I received it the day before the Hanson concert in Tulsa. Yes, I was at the kick off concert for the &quot;This Time Around&quot; tour. It wasn't, at all, easy to get tickets to the Tulsa one, but I did it. I also went to the Norman, OK one the day after Zac's 15th b-day. They were both excellent. The Norman one was much better than the Tulsa one. In just 3 months time their concerts had changed a lot. Definitely for the better. Just as they've improved in their live shows, their albums keep getting better and better. I loved this book for the pure reason that it's Official. They're friends with the author and they had imput on it. All of the other books, you never know. If only, these other authors actually had imput by Hanson, not to mention, permission. Oh, FYI, I'm nowhere near being a teeny bopper. I'm 29. Yes, I live in Tulsa. No, I've never met them. The question that people ask me the most is &quot;Why do you like Hanson?&quot; I just say, &quot;They're the real thing.&quot; What you see is what you get. There's no hidden motive. That doesn't happen often, in this world. Needless to say, I read the book the day that I got it. I couldn't put it down until it was done. There's so much to learn and so little time."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"Who wants to know the true story about how Hanson became who they are today? This book is the best way to teach you the basics, written by Jarod Gollihare, who was a friend of theirs (also a musician). It's a GREAT account, leading you through Isaac, Taylor, and Zac's love and devotion to music and what it took for them to reach their dreams. The book is well written and truthful, as well as exciting to read and full of great pictures. I absolutely recommend it for any fans of the band!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"This book definately is a recommendee. It has the truth and nothing but. The photography is fantastic and the pictures blend well with the quotes and stories. Though there are not seperate chapters for each of the brothers, the group facts are enough to make up for it. Great job, Mr. Gollihare, for capturing the true blue Hanson."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I think this book is great and it's because it was written by a close friend of them, and it's the true story.You read what they felt and how they started. Maybe the other books have better pictures, but no one of them have ever said only true stuff about them and their beginning .Just half true, and the rest , what they have heard. (Mariana G.N.)"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"It was an absolutely awesome book. It had a lot of information on this totally talented pop-trio and great pictures. It is very well-written book."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I thought Jarrod did a good job with this book, a lot of it was vague but it was informative and at least with this book that the information is true unlike the slew of unnoficial teenybopper biographies out there. I would suggest however, for serious Hanson fans looking for more information to purchase Ravi's &quot;Dancin' With Hanson.&quot; It includes a lot of specific information, including good and bad things."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I think the book was well written! They did not write a section on there likes or dislikes because it is about there music and how they got there start ."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"it is a great book with great pics"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I love Hanson so the more I can see, hear, and read about Hanson is great and this book gave me that opportunity to do that. I recommend this book to anyone who loves Hanson! I also know these are true facts because they are written about someone that knows them very well!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"Nice book, the official book to be exact by Jarrod Gollihare, personal friend of the gang (who is probably very rich!... now). Book is done on a 2nd grade level but the pictures are great &amp; ones you have probably not seen before. The downer is that they are mostly staged &amp; not personal shots or anything. It has quotes from the guys &amp; some basic, non-in-depth background info. on them. The gang here noted that you could get more information from a website.. so we will give this title * * * stars :-) 2 COOL 4 School Magazine Online"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I think it is a great book because I can read everything in the book, and belive it, too, because it is official. I have baught all the other Hanson books on the market, and they all say things that make others untrue, like Taylor is right-handed, then another says he is left-handed, and yet another says he is ambidextrious! So, I think Hanson:The Official Book is worth buying, if you want the truth (and who doesn't?!)"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"Hanson is my all time favorite band! I was really pleased wilth how great this book was! It was really tough to find it at the book stores here! They sold out the day they came in!!! I'm going to another Hanson concert this summer and the tickets sold out in 6 min. so I feel really lucky that I get to go, and I have really close seats and possible backstage passes! I have loved Hanson for over a year and I have had all of their cd's the day that they have come out!!! So if you are thinking of buying this book, just do yourself a favor and buy it!!!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"The offical book was pretty good, it contained some pictures that you wouldn't find in any other books! I thought that there wasn't a whole lot of content being that it was only eight-some pages w/pictures! The only thing I didn't like about it was it only had there &quot;life story&quot; it didn't have their 'fave food, or writing hand! But being that they are a musical group and they want you to focus on there music, I guess I see why the didn't put in the little things! All'n'All I thought it was a good book!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"Let me say a few words, great, awsome, really good, freash, cool, hip, wonderful, stupendus, crush worthy, fine, and ofcorse TAYLOR IS THE HOTTEST GUY AND THE PICTUEES IN HERE TOTALLY PROVE IT!+ A+ A+ A+ PERFECT 10 !you'll never find a better book if you tried and it's alllllll true!AND I AM A GIRL&lt; SO DON&quot;T WOORRYYY!!!!!!!P&gt;S&gt; BUY THE BOOK P&lt;P&lt;S, it will make you feel better"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"HANSON is the best band ever and this book tells alot about HANSON and you know it is all true because it is authorised by HANSON. I bought this book the second I sall it and I am glad I did. This is a must have for all HANSON fans everywhere.No true HANSON fan would not have one.It rules!!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I think this book is great in the sense that the information is TRUE, not just rumours,and how it focuses on Hansons music,not irrelevent stuff like toothbrush colours.The pictures are also really good.I think this is the only Hanson book worth buying."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I know that it seemed to be an &quot;easy reader&quot; book but it was a good book because all the info. was definitely true! It was authorized by Hanson, themselves! It had great pictures from when the boys had first starting performing, which was very interesting to see! All in all, a great book about a great band!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"AWESOME BOOK OVERALL!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"But I still love Hanson !! They are the best !"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I understand that fans all over the world are happy about having the oppurtunity to read books about their favorite band. However, how is it possible that a biography is written about three adolescent boys who have yet to live the bulk of their life. Understandably, their lives have been anything but common to the &quot;common child,&quot; however, their lives are very similar to that of a child star. I do commend this book for being the only OFFICIAL Hanson book, and should probably be the only allowed on the market. Unauthorized books print false information that fans know is false. I also commend this book for being the only one that Hanson had something to do with. Of all the books available to fans, I would recommend this one of any, however, I think it may be a little pre-mature to publish ANY books about three children."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I read this book over and over and it was so hard for me to find.It contains the BEST info and even better pictures .I LOVE IT AND HANSON!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"This book was not very informative. They talked about the same stuff they talk about in interviews. The author did a very poor job in writing. The pictures weren't the greatest. I felt this was a waste of my money."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"This book was highly uninformative. It had 0 information and the pictures looked like something out of a children's book."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I dont' think they should have put out a biography with so little to tell. YEAH&lt; there FAMOUS WHOOWHOO so is everyone in this world. But they called it the OFFICIAL BOOK and they were only famous INTErNATIONALLY for like 6 months or something. NOT COOL&gt;"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I have always considered myself a true Hanson fan. Not only do I have six different books about them, but at one time I had 1015 pictures of them on all four walls of my bedroom (it may seem hard to believe, but there actually are that many pictures of those three out there). This book was a big dissappointment for one main reason. Yes, it is the &quot;official&quot; Hanson book, but it says the same exact things that all the unofficial books say. Sure, there are plenty of cute pictures of them when they were extremely little that no other books seem to have, but the information was the same. This book deserves the three stars I gave it because Isaac, Taylor, and Zac are three adorable guys with a lot of talent. I love their music."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"The book kinda lacked interesting stuff, I mean it was well...what we all have heard about the band for months! The picture were Ok but, they weren't many of them in there. 64 pages was tiny for a book that cost $10.95. I love the guys but the book was a bit of a waste."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"Ok,like,this is official and it's all true,but it's,like,their life story. I thought that the pics were cool,but I already had all of them. The only exciting part of the book was when Hanson was at the Paramus Park Mall in New Jersey and they all tried to get away and Zac was left in it. But,if you like to read biographies on people who have lead a very short life,this is the book for you. Don't get me wrong,I love Hanson,but come on. The oldest isn't even 18 and they already have,like,11 biographies on them. I'm 12. Do I have biographies written about me? I don't think so..."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I didn't like this book because it had no point to it. It didn't have any facts at all. It was a total disappointment."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"As a huge fan of Hanson (14), I found that the book was written with small words. Not to mention the huge size of the words. It seemed like the book was meant for only &quot;easy readers&quot; (no offence to people who found the book perfect, but it's true).The pictures were the highlight of the book, new ones and older ones. Still all the info in it can be found on the internet and has been said in TV interviews."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"This book is just a review of their early life, pretty boring, it's just like a normal life. I BTW like Hanson and their music alot, but this book really puts me off."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"This book was absolutly amazing. It had all the inside facts about Hanson's journey to the top. What I loved most was the younger pictures of them. I recommend it to every Hanson lover . . .P.S.~ I have over 6,550 pictures of Hanson!!!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I think it was a really good book.I tgave alot of info on my fav band and i really enjoyed reading it! HANSON ROX!!!!!!! I LOVE ZAC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"Hanson : The Official Book is one of the best biographies by far. It might have quite a bit of the same info as the unauthorized bios, but in a way it kind of mended them up by saying only the TRUE stuff."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I love this book it rules i love zac &amp; tay!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"This is by far the best book on Hanson. I loved the pics and all the stories about the places they went. Hanson lovers should read this book!!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I really liked the pictures when they first came out, especially the pictures of Hanson when they were younger. The content was ok, but it wasn't very interesting. It should've had a facts page."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I loved this book!!! It is autherized too, and I could &quot;trust&quot; all the info. in it. I really liked the pics in it, too. It even had pics of them when they were younger, they were really cute in the &quot;old'n days&quot; too!!! It told alot of really cool stuff in pretty good detail. It tells the fans how Hanson really got started and really how they got where they are now. I totally think every Hanson fan should have it on their bookshelf, it's a MUST BUY!!!! GO HANSON!!!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I like it. It was an excellent book. Um I would have given it a 10 which I wanted to, but I didn't think it had enough info. It wasn't that big either. Oh well I guess they edited a lot. I really liked it though. And I got it at barnes and noble for like $15 and lost it and I was so desperate to get it again. I bought it here for $9. What a great price."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"Well, it's official, so I guess it's all true. The pictures are kinda cool, but their not rare anymore cause their all up over the Internet. But anyway, It does have some interesting facts about tours and stuff. I'd give it an eight because it's a little boring. It's not the book you would sit down and read all the way through. The pictures are very cute. I haven't read other Hanson books so I can't compare, but if you love Hanson, then I'd recommend buying this."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I believe that these kids really had it going for them from the start. and this book shows it. they helped with the book also which gives the book good view. the pictures are great and so is the wording, If you are a fan, this would greatly appeal to you just like it did to me."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I love this book! I'm a 12/f from Seattle, WA, and a total Hanson fan! I liked this book 'cause it has lots of great pictures, some I hadn't seen before. Also, you didn't have to worry about what was true or not like you do with the unofficial biographys. This one is an official. I say it deserves 5 stars, if I could put anymore I would! Ok, that's all I have to say!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I really loved this book. I liked it because I know that everything in it is all true. Cause Jarrod Gollihare is friends w/ the Hanson fam. That's also how he got all those younger pix of them. I totally recommend it to everyone. It's the greatest book out of all the Hanson books I've ever read. Especially because every single page is glossy and in color. It tells the entire Hanson story. And I think that even people who don't necessarily like Hanson would enjoy it. I mean, people tease them, because they don't know much about them. After reading this, they'll understand them more."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"Why do I say it's official? The reason is obvious enough... Why dependable? Well, you get the point... Why reasonable? I have both heard of and read about comments made on this Hanson Official Book and find that the majority of the people/fans find it appealing while some others would say that it does not provide much information...etc... In my opinion, yes, this book might not give the kind of information such as the size of Taylor's boxers, the kind of shampoo Isaac uses, or Zac's shoe size...just to name a few...(trust me, according to a lot of the fans, this is THE type of info they have been trying to find...not that there is anything wrong with it, the curiosity is understandable...) but it does provide readers with a reasonably detailed look into what Hanson's earlier years have been like, revealing 'nothing but the truth' (am I in court?) about how Hanson has come to be the internationally known band, the music sensation, how Isaac, Taylor, and Zac feel about their success, and, you know, basically their insights on music (after all, this whole thing is supposed to be focused on music...&quot;we're three guys who write, play and sing our music...That's what Hanson is...&quot; said Taylor Hanson...That's what Hanson is about...and I feel that the book does make the point...) I enjoyed the book and think that as the content added to what I already knew about Hanson, it gave me a better idea of Ike, Tay, and Zac's background. It would not be a bad idea to have a 'Hanson biography II' some time in the future since there are so much going on in their lives...=)"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"Nothing better than the official book, It has lots of facts and things that makes you love Hanson. Totally cool."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I don't see how anyone could complain about this book. It's an absolutely fabulous book with tons of great photos and although the reading isn't too exciting, it has some pretty interesting facts. This book is by far the best I've seen out of all Hanson books (and I own every single one offered here on amazon.com) mostly due to it's superb pictures. It's a must buy for anyone who likes Hanson."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I'm brazilian, 13 years old and number 1 Hanson's fan, I love them and this book is really really marvellous, wonderfulll!!

Readers will feel like they really know this talented family while reading this book."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"This book is the best Hanson book yet! The best thing is that it's the only book out there that's official. If you love Hanson, you're gonna love this book.

The younger pics are adorable.(especially Zac !) I couldn't put the book down. I hope Jarrod writes another book.

Most of the Hanson books have alot of wrong info... like they say Hanson's favorite restraunt is Rex's Boneless Chicken.,, Which is a rumor, and I'm sick of hearing it. I have a wav of them saying they only ate there twice. I espicially HATE the Hanson Trivia book, because ALOT of that info is WRONG and thats what starts rumors. The only reason I bought it was to support Hanson who I love so so much =)"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"This book is great. If you totally are in Love with Isaac, Taylor, and Zachary Hanson then this is the book for you. It is filled with indepth facts and stories on the best brother act since the Jackson 5. It also includes exclusive pictures that only a friend of the Hansons could have gotten. Well, this book was written by Jarrod Gullihare, A trusted friend of Hanson. It tells how wacky Zac, shy Taylor, and serious Isaac travel the world and perform for thousands of fans at the ages they are: 12, 15, and 17. It also includes how they got started and how they managed to get a manager. Zac, Isaac, and Taylor were only 6, 9, and 12 when Hanson started singing. That is only one fact out of the many, you will learn in this genuine Hanson Book. I reccommend this 64 paged book to any Hanson fan who needs more Hanson."},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"I was SO impressed when I got this book for Christmas!

I can tell you i am there BIGGEST fan!!!"},{"Title":"Hanson: The Official Book","review":"Hanson-mania, although not everyone is a participant, is vastly growing across, not only the nation, but the world. For all we know, it might grow until everyone loves Clarke Issac, Jordan Taylor, and Zachary Walker Hanson. Yes. Those are their names, as you'll learn in the book Hanson: The Official Book. This book has something no other book about Hanson has. No, not pictures, although it is chock full of intimate pictures, selected by the guys themselves, taken by their favorite photographers. But, it was reviewed by the guys, and was written by a friend of theirs (Jarrod Gollihare). So, you can be sure that all of the information is true. Some of the information may have come straight from Isacc, or Taylor, or Zachary. You just don't know. One of the best qualities of the book, is that it doesn't single one guy out, and although it does talk about each guy individually, there isn't a chapter about each one proclaiming useless facts that any true Hanson fan knows by heart. Also, if you'd like to find out more about the guys, and what they looked like, way back when, you can find pictures, and stories about how Hanson became HANSON. You can see just how alike Taylor and Zachary look. You can see them with zits, pageboy haircuts, early instuments, and in some shots, you can discover what color underwear they wear.(i.e. page 19 where Taylor is hanging from a tree). You can catch different moods of the three assets to the group (the vocalists), and possibly find out really, truly which is your favorite Hanson.

This book is raw and spares no expense when it comes to describing the life of Rey, a young Cuban street boy who struggles to survive life on the streets by stealing, abusing his body and basically prostituting himself (for fun and natural desires only not for money) as he moves from town to town just hoping to beg for enough money for at least one day's meal. The Cuba portrayed here is representative of the urban street life of many young Cubans both male and female who are forced to adopt this life style at a young age when faced with numerous adversities. A Cuban himself wrote the book so the picture could not be more real. Prepare yourself for some harsh and vulgar language, drug abuse and unlimited female encounters. Out from his ability to clean up streets and women he is know as \\"El Rey de la Habana\\". This is a sad portrait but a very true one in country that has forced its citizens to live impoverished and destitute lives. This is a well written novel in my opinion because the author did write the book using the everyday speech of these \\"street people\\". I suggest reading the book in Spanish only and purchasing a dictionary of Cuban colloquialisms because there are plenty and the meaning can not be assumed. Otherwise it is a great read and I don't think a translated version can retain the rawness and crudeness of the language."},{"Title":"El Rey de La Habana (Narrativas Hispanicas)","review":"This is a quick-reading novel.

It's his only novel with enough clues to allow readers to figure out who did it--although the identity of the killer will still surprise most readers (including this one, to be honest). What distinguishes it from a typical murder mystery, however, is Hammett's fastidious prose, scurrilous characters, noir ambience, and borderline misanthropy.Ned Beaumont, a self-described \\"amateur detective\\" with an independent streak and a gambling habit, is the loyal underling to shadowy political boss Paul Madvig, whose major concern is to see his candidate, Taylor Henry, reelected to the Senate. When the Senator's son is murdered alongside a dimly lit street, Madvig is the chief suspect, the papers (controlled by the opposition) go on the attack, and Beaumont intervenes with an attempt to clear his boss's name. While not above resorting to ethically dubious behavior, Beaumont retains a vein of rectitude under his tough-guy exterior, and he's even willing to undergo the most brutal thrashings at the hands of the criminal opposition out of loyalty to his own superiors--as long as they themselves don't cross the line.His fourth novel in three years (1929-1931), \\"The Glass Key\\" is bleaker and more cynical than its predecessors, and the mood spirals further downward as the story unfolds. (One can almost imagine Hammett's brooding temper darkening with each stiff drink.) While most of his fiction deals with the underworld and its corruption and squalidness, this work shows most effectively the seedy alliances among businessmen, political bosses, elected officials, law enforcement, media figures, and organized crime in Prohibition-era America."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"&quot;The Glass Key&quot; is probably Dashiell Hammett's best-constructed novel. Our detective this time is not a professional sleuth, but Ned Beaumont, a sharp, tough, unglamorous, right-hand man to Paul Madvig, a powerful corrupt-as-the-next-guy businessman with political ambitions. Paul intends to win an upcoming city election and marry a Senator's daughter. But only a few weeks before the election, Taylor Henry, the Senator's son and brother of Paul's intended, is found murdered in the street. The police are desperate to solve this high-profile case. The city's various political forces are inclined to use Taylor Henry's death to leverage the upcoming election. Information is power, and whoever knows the identity of the murderer may control the election. Paul Madvig's now-precarious influence appoints Ned Beaumont as special investigator for the District Attorney's Office, and the newly-credentialed Ned sets out to sort out the murder before it sorts out the power structure in this unnamed Depression-era city.&quot;The Glass Key&quot; explores the interdependent cultures of politics, industry, and news media, which combine to thoroughly immerse the city in corruption. As much as I admire Hammett's themes and enjoy his stories, I've never considered the stories, themselves, to be plausible. I wouldn't have much trouble believing that the characters or events described in &quot;The Glass Key&quot; could actually have existed, though. This is the most grounded in realism of any of Hammett's novels, and it's the most tightly written. The novel is evenly paced and, like its protagonist Ned Beaumont, is spare, focused, and direct in its purpose. Despite the story's third-person narration that never reveals anyone's thoughts or emotions, the characters are well-drawn and never flat. Ironically, the narrative's objectivity seems, if anything, to intensify its brutality. By focusing its attention on the personal and professional machinations behind city politics, &quot;The Glass Key&quot; creates an insider's view of power in America, circa 1930. By keeping the identity of the murderer and the outcome of the power plays secret until the very end, Hammett keeps us interested. Although it lacks &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;'s exotic characters and more ambitious themes, &quot;The Glass Key&quot; is among Hammett's best works, and I believe it's his second-best novel."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Dashiell Hammetts creative light burned bright but for a brief 5-10 year period. In &quot;The Glass Key,&quot; his penultimate novel, Hammett melded the world of the &quot;hard-boiled detective&quot;--shady underground figures, powerful men and, of course, a beautiful woman--with a theme that recurs throughout his ouvre--of basic trust between kindred souls.Often over-shadowed in the eyes of readers by the novels that preceeded and followed, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;The Thin Man,&quot; &quot;The Glass Key&quot; is Hammett at the very top of his form. Writing as no one had before, or has since"},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"When you've finished reading this novel (and if you care anything about the American detective story, you will read this novel), think back. Can you recall even the slightest hint of emotion, or the smallest display of caring by one individual for another? I don't think so, and this is the essence of hard-boiled detective stories. Don't get me wrong. You know Ned Beaumont cares about those he is trying to help, and gets beat up for. He's much too tough to show it, though, and that's the key. That's why they call it tough-guy fiction. This story is straight-on, airtight, wonderfully written. In one eighteen-month period Hammett wrote The Maltese Falcon and The Glass Key. Amazing. We shall never see his like again. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"I was bowled over by this one. Oddly laconic with some rather awkward turns of phrase (he did it \\"difficultly\\"?!!), the writing, nevertheless, is nearly airtight and so sharply laid down that it carries and sets the mood beautifully in this strange tale of a political boss and his gambler buddy who are bent on winning their particular games of life. Paul Madvig, the boss, wants to win the upcoming elections and ensure continuation of his candidates in office while Ned Beaumont, the lone-wolf gambler, wants to get back on a winning streak, collect on a bad debt and protect his apparently dense friend Madvig who has stumbled into a situation. Madvig is in love with a senator's daughter and keen to win her hand and so has allowed his usual good judgement to become clouded. In shifting his political support to the senator, he has lost touch with his own less-than-respectable base, allowing a local gangster to muscle in on his territory. Intent on pushing the gangster back, he makes a dumb play and is soon sucked into a problem surrounding the unsolved murder of the senator's son. Who did it and why are the questions that lie at the core of Madvig's problems and only Beaumont is clever enough, and cares enough, to get to the bottom of it. Along the way Beaumont takes a bloody beating, participates in a murder and loses what he cares most for in all the world. Although the tale takes a while to get revved up and some of the transitions are so abrupt as to be jarring, this was not only a great \\"detective\\" story but one with real resonance that goes well beyond the genre in which it has been cast. I recently read Chandler's The Big Sleep and thought very highly of it, giving it five amazon stars. Well, this one's even better.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"This time around, the main character is not a detective, but a gambler with political friends &amp; enemies, one friend in particular. While there is a dead body early in the story, this protagonist doesn't seem all that interested in who the murderer is until the pivotal scene when he gets severely beaten for not turning on his former friend who he's temporarily on the outs with.I've noticed this plot gimmick more than once in Hammett. The rascally characters bring the protagonist's wrath upon them by needlessly attacking him. That happened in one of the shorter Continental Op stories and then again in Red Harvest and now in this one. One could put The Maltese Falcon in that class also.Personally, I had trouble liking the characters until that pivotal scene, and then only did I get involved with them. So I do feel that this had the weakest opening of Hammett's major works. However, once one gets through the first part, it becomes as riveting as any of Hammett's.So I do very much recommend this one along with Hammett's other books."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Dashiell Hammett, the legendary writer who singlehandedly made hardboiled crime respectable subject matter for American novelists, pulled no punches when he authored The Glass Key. The pages of this dark, decidedly non-uplifting book are teeming with violent acts and political corruption while vividly showcasing the basest of human instincts. The characters are largely unlikable. And that includes the novel's protagonist, Ned Beaumont. Perhaps especially Ned Beaumont. Ned is a professional gambler and the righthand man to a powerful political boss in the unnamed city in which most of the narrative of The Glass Key unfolds.The unsolved murder of a Senator's son provides the backdrop against which the numerous examples of depravity and hard edged action take place. Hammett unflinchingly tells this brutal tale using crisp, uncomplicated language that flows smoothly. The Glass Key is an ugly story, beautifully written. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"We live in a time when campaign financing makes every politician a little bit crooked --- and when some politicians, out of greed or cynicism or outright stupidity, sell their souls for a few bags of gold. This abuse of power is depressing as hell. But it's not new. And in \\"The Glass Key,\\" we see what political corruption looks like --- from the inside.Ned Beaumont describes himself as \\"a gambler and a politician's hanger-on.\\" That's too modest. He does most of the smart thinking for Paul Madvig, a behind-the-scenes power broker who controls large chunks of an unnamed city. Ned is no bruiser --- he's tall, tubercular and a sucker for a stiff drink --- but, on occasion, he's Madvig's enforcer. And there is much to enforce: a creep named Shad O'Rory is hoping his candidates will control the city after the upcoming election. Then there is the small matter of a Senator's son, found dead in street, right in the middle of Chapter One.Everyone has an angle. The Senator needs Paul Madvig's support. Madvig wants to marry the Senator's daughter. Madvig's daughter was having an affair with the Senator's son. And Madvig looks like the boy's most likely killer. Got all that?Beaumont persuades the District Attorney to give him limited authority to investigate the case. His aim, of course, is to slow that investigation down. Which he does by planting a key piece of evidence.And that's not half of it. The newspaper publisher is heavily in debt. The mortgage on his plant is held by a bank that favors a candidate not in Madvig's stable. So what? As Beaumont points out, \\"He'll do what he's told to do and print what he's told to print.\\"Dirty stuff, all of it. Which isn't to say there's no hero. There is --- Ned Beaumont. How can that be? Because there's a thin vein of idealism in Ned. Because he has a code. Because, in the end, he is a gentleman. And because he recognizes that Madvig, though corrupt, has the city's interests at heart.That's what makes \\"The Glass Key\\" so fascinating --- the way it presents a raw, ugly reality and then makes a kind of sense of it. Is moral order restored at the end? The title tells us it can't be; the glass key is a phrase from a young woman's dream. Yes, it can open a door. Once. Then it shatters. And the door can never be locked again. You don't need deep Freudian understanding to grasp that she's talking about the price of worldly knowledge --- that is, the end of innocence.If \\"The Glass Key\\" doesn't seem familiar to today's newspaper readers, maybe it's because it's more atmospheric. Ned Beaumont's fingers are always wrapped around a dappled cigar. And some of the men wear both vests and hats. They make corruption almost stylish."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Noir at its finest is not really black at all, it's really about 16 shades of gray. It's the blurring between those shades that separate the hero from villain in this story. Morals, scruples, and ethics are sub-par for all the characters here, a hallmark of noir, but the central character, Ned Beaumont, a shady gambler and right hand man of a political fixer, has at least one redeeming quality that renders him just that little bit more acceptable to the reader. He's no plaster saint, that's for sure, but he's loyal. Really loyal. And sometimes that's just as much a flaw as it is a virtue, at least in Ned's world it is. The book is written in third person but interestingly, Hammett never uses the omniscient voice: He never lets you inside the mind of any of the characters. What you know of them is only what they do and say, so sometimes the book feels a bit like it was written for the screen rather than a reading audience, but the truth is, Hammett creates a power there but has handed it over to the readers to use -- for better or worse. I really liked this book a lot, far more than 'The Thin Man,' and I did not expect that. The story and characters are complex but not stifling. The prose is spartan but not sterling, interesting but not gripping, so I gave it 4 stars rather than five. It's still better than 98% of the mysteries being published today."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"This novel is about politics, his only work that doesn't deal with the hard-boiled detective that he invented. But Ned Beaumont (nee Schoenberg?) gets fixed up as a special investigator to look into the murder of the Senator's son. Ned tracks down the bookmaker who welshed and skipped town, and uses &quot;the hat trick&quot; to claim his winnings; money is power. Afterwards he acts like a private detective as well as a political crony. Disagreeing with Paul Madvig, he meets Shad O'Rory; Shad tries bribery and torture to get Ned to betray his friend Paul. Ned escapes this trap, and helps to solve the murder of an eye-witness. In telling this, the book shows how a newspaper can slant the news: &quot;they wouldn't print it if it wasn't true&quot;!This novel seems to be a variation on Hammett's detective stories, using &quot;politics&quot; as the &quot;root of evil&quot;. But there is a relationship between political power and the love of money. This book shows government functioning as a feudal system: a ruler accepts loyalty from his subjects, and in turn helps and supports them. But the ruler may accept an election loss if that will punish disloyalty and keep his personal power. Could a blue-blooded aristocratic politician sacrifice his son, pimp his daughter, and attempt murder to keep political power? You can judge how this novel approximates the real world. (The book mentions that New York is a train ride away; does this imply Albany or Philadelphia?)"},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"This is not only one of Hammett's best books, but the obvious inspiration for the Coen Brothers' film \\"Miller's Crossing.\\" Its cynical, nasty view of corrupt city politics is refreshingly contemporary, and the book stands as one of the best of the 20s/30s all by itself, even today-- but film fans will get an extra kick out of the Coen's wholesale appropriation of language and characters as well.

Ned Beaumont, the sometimes gambler, sometimes political crony is deputized by the DA and attempts to use his wits and his indestructable body to solve the murder of a senator's son. Several subplots are interweaved, but none appealed much to me. I did appreciate the telegraphic writing style, but I never understood what drove Beaumont to keep going after getting beaten to an inch of his life."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"The Glass Key is one of those classic gangster novels that you just cannot put down. Known as the father of the hard-boiled crime novel, Hammett creates a world where murder is common, but there is also an unwritten code of conduct. In The Glass Key, Ned Beaumont works for Paul Madvig as his right-hand man, but when the son of a Senator gets murdered and Paul is the main suspect, Ned becomes Paul's personal detective as well. Did Ned's boss really murder Senator Henry's son? How is the senator's daughter involved? Are the senator's enemies trying to frame Paul?Hammett creates the ultimate no-nonsense novel. The prose is quick, and it reads almost like a screenplay. I guarantee that if you any pick one scene of dialog, you will be able to visualize it as if you are watching a Humphrey Bogart film. (Granted, Hammett did write The Maltese Falcon, Bogart is the main character in the movie version). For the first 50 pages or so, I really did not care about any of the characters. Yet, as the novel progresses, Hammett throws you deeper and deeper into this world of corruption and chaos. Ned Beaumont becomes a sort of ragged hero. While he will never turn down a fight, he never really wins them either.Each character has his or her own quirks that you will try to discern, but then they will surprise you as soon as you think you have it all figured out. The flare of the 1930s adds to the charm of the book, but the mystery itself will keep you turning the pages. Any guy who likes mysteries will love this book, and The Glass Key is one of the lesser-known books, so dad probably hasn't read it yet!This was one of the books for my mystery book club, and we all found the book tremendously enjoyable. Fans of film noir will love this book by such an important author in the field of noir literature. Even if it takes you a few chapters to get into it, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves mysteries.I give it a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Reading through some of the online reviews of The Glass Key, I'm a little bit surprised by all the contradictory readings. Hammett supposedly considered it his favorite among his own novels. I liked it-- a lot, even. It isn't my favorite-- I think that honor still belongs toRed Harvest. But I don't consider it (as many apparently do) one of his minor works either.There is a very nice quality of remove to this work. We learn next to nothing about the past of the characters (perhaps why some readers find it difficult to connect with the work?). Instead, their actions speak for themselves and the implication certainly is that the events of the book represent a fatal intersection of oft repeated actions. \\"You are what you do,\\" is what Hammett seems to be insisting here. I personally find this kind of noir writing much more compelling when it sticks to the surface in this way-- gives it an air of fatality and sadness that would only be undermined by too much backstory. He doesn't give us much hope for his bleak city. Only Beaumont seems to have any feeling for nostalgia, and that is undermined by his gambling nature-- his casual lack of ethics.It's an uncomfortable book, I'll give you that. Hammett keeps the reader back from any feeling of resolution, even when we learn the \\"truth\\". For me, it neatly foreshadows a film likeChinatown. The system of corruption in the world of The Glass Key isn't something that can be defeated by anything as trivial as a redemptive character arc. Hammett is telling us something about the world-- the hope will have to come from somewhere else.Wonderful, really."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961) essentially created the American P.I. novel, first in a series of short stories and then with five novels, many of them incorporating his earlier short fiction. Critics regard THE GLASS KEY as his weakest work; it was, however, Hammett's own favorite, a very convoluted tale of that mixes organized crime, political corruption, and a traditionally-styled murder mystery.The central story concerns gambler and tough-guy Ned Beaumont, who has been on a loosing streak until his luck turns with a major racetrack win. When the bookie goes on the lam with the winnings, Beaumont pulls strings to have himself declared a special D.A. investigator and uses a recent unsolved murder of a senator's son as leverage to force the bookie to pay up. But his success in this area entangles him in the murder itself: the senator is backed by crime boss Paul Madvig, who is in love with the senator's daughter, and who may or may not be involved in the murder.It may have been Hammett's favorite, but I have to agree with those who consider it his weakest. Like most Hammett novels, THE GLASS KEY is very convoluted in terms of plot--but in this novel he simply jumps from point to point and scene to scene without offering the reading much in the way of information. The characters are also weak. Paul Madvig is too stupid to be a successful crime boss; it is hard to understand how he manages to command such loyalty from tough-guy Ned Beaumont, and Beaumont himself is very inconsistently rendered. But the novel does have a saving grace that makes it worth reading: Hammett's prose style.It was, in a word, unique. Hammett effortlessly mixes terse toughness with unexpected flashes of poetry and insight and the result is indeed breathless and intense. Many writers would tear a page from Hammett's style, and a few--James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler leap to mind--would go on to create their own unique and equally powerful styles from Hammett inspiration, but no one ever did Hammett as well as Hammett himself. THE GLASS KEY may be the weakest of Hammett's novels in terms of plot and character, but Hammett's way with words carries him though. Ignore the book at your own risk.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Dashiell Hammett, along with Raymond Chandler, reinvented the detective genre in the 1930's and 1940's. They moved the genre away from the amateurish and simple parlor detectives that had previously dominated the genre to hard-boiled action characters who knew what was what and didn't mind taking a beating to get the bad guys. And along the way they produced some very memorable literary characters as well. Nick Charles, Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe are well known exemplars of the action detective.In The Glass Key Hammett takes a little different run at that same idea. The protagonist this time is not the usual detective but an old fashioned political \`fixer'. No, not the \`spin doctor' or \`flak' of modern media-driven politics but the older handler of the retail politics that counted in local urban scene with the added factor of a little off hand, old fashioned mob influence. Nevertheless, the \`fixer' Ned Beaumont has all the resourcefulness, toughness, loyalty, and hard-boiled common sense that we have come to expect of Hammett's real detectives.The plot revolves around the familiar problem of electoral politics-getting elected. In this case getting a Senator with a beautiful daughter, Janet, and an errant son, Taylor, reelected. Add in some political factions, also mob-dominated, a fair share of corrupt officials, an off hand murder and other crimes and misdemeanors and you would hardly know we are not dealing with a \`normal' Hammett novel. Further add in a slowly involving romance between Ned and the afore-mentioned Senator's daughter who is also the object of his boss's affections and you have quite a mix. Frankly, I prefer Hammett's detectives but any time you can get your hands on one of his books do so."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"'The Glass Key' is one of Dashiell Hammett's more controlled, accessible mysteries. The number of characters involved is limited, and the characterizations are uniformly excellent. The story, about political corruption and murder, is something like Hammett's earlier 'Red Harvest'. But 'Red Harvest' was a bit excessive in scope and as a result its plot became somewhat undecipherable after a while. Fortunately 'The Glass Key' doesn't degrade in that way ... in fact it gets better as the story progresses (complete with a good surprise ending).Bottom line: a measured, competent effort by Dashiell Hammett. Not among his more famous works but certainly among the better."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"The Glass Key has plenty of everything we like in a Dashiell Hammett book: corrupt power and wealth, strong characters with hidden motives, deceit and double-crossing. And, in the end, the good guy solves the thing and gets the girl. So what's the problem? Well, there's just too much of it all crammed into one book. The result is a story that demands you suspend not just belief but rationality as you wind your way to the conclusion. For some people that's fine, but not for people who actually enjoy the plot development of a mystery. At some level, the story line has to be believable, and this one isn't.It isn't a bad read...in fact it works quite nicely for a wet Sunday afternoon. But it isn't great work, either.

I was appalled to see how badly the Coen brothers ripped off Hammett. An excellent read."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"The writing was typical of the times (1931). Each movement of the characters was described fully -- almost like it was intended to be a screenplay. Not one of the characters was anything other than criminal at heart, so it was difficult to relate to any of them. Historically, it was very interesting to read about the crime, speakeasies and corrupt Chicago politics. It was what I would consider a \\"guy's book\\": tough men, gangster-like loyalties (without real friendships), drinking, gambling and everyone-out-for-themselves. The men and women in this book had big city mentalities and killings were a part of the life they led. Fear and greed is what drove them. The main thing I didn't like was that it had too many things happening with too many characters -- many of which didn't lead anywhere and tended to make it a rather confusing read. I found myself re-reading passages, just to keep things straight. So, I guess there were parts that I liked, it was an easy read, but the poor character development left me disappointed. I never did guess who the murderer was until the end of the book - which probably makes it a good detective novel, in and of itself."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"this was my first dip into the genre of early american murder mystery writers like hammett. i come away with the same feeling you do after watching an old black and white movie--nostaligic.usually i don't read light books like this, but i took this on a plane trip for vacation. figured it would be attention grabbing easy reading. easy reading it was, but most certainly not a page turner. let's start with what it is not. it is not a who done it! there are not enough clues given to lead the experienced murder mystery reader to solve the case (to explain more would give away the plot). it is not a serial killer, blood and guts story that draws you in. it is not a psychological study of a murderer.so what is it? it is a simple story of big city political corruption that leads to a murder which is solved, not by the police or a detective, but by a political confidant of one of the characters. never do you feel the excitment of a pending murder. never do you feel pending danger for one of the characters. the story just marches on to resolution.i do however, recommend it. it is an interesting period piece. it would never fly today in the world of paterson and all the serial killer tales, but it is a prelude to those stories. maybe it simply shows the deterioration(or some may call it the move to realty) of american entertainment tastes. we see it in murder mysteries from hammett to paterson, in tv from happy days to almost any comedy show today, or in movies from the trend of \\"G/PG\\" rated to \\"R\\". maybe its this nostalgia piece that makes it interesting. if you like old movies, you will find this book refreshing."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"When my book club decided to read The Glass Key, I thought it would be a fun change from the literary, often depressing books we sometimes choose. I was wrong. We unanimously hated it. None of us cared one hoot about who did it or to whom or why. Not only that but the writing was at times laughable. Here are only a few of my favorite passages:\\"Presently a path came under his feet.\\"\\"Ned Beaumont looked, with brown eyes wherein hate was a dull glow that came from far beneath the surface, at the card players and began to get out of bed.\\"\\"Knocking sounded on his door.\\"\\"Madvig addressed to another man a question having to do with the size of the campaign contribution to be expected from a man named Hartwick.\\"Obviously writing wasn't the talent Lillian Hellman saw in him."},{"Title":"Elton, My Elton","review":"This book is not for anyone, even passionate Elton fans, who have the slightest problem with Elton's sexual orientation. This very candid book was written by an on-again, off-again friend and lover whose feelings for Elton were strong enough to withstand the ups and downs that Elton's torrid lifestyle brought with it. It is an account of excesses and tormented minds, but also of happier times and deep emotions. It is, of course, written by someone who was ultimately rejected, and you must realize that you will see everything through the author's eyes and pain. Underneath it all, you will also see the pain and suffering that Elton went through to beat addiction and end up sober. Nothing you read will take away from his musical genius, his compassion for the victims of AIDS, and his generosity towards friends and the cause of the Elton John AIDS Foundation."},{"Title":"Give Us This Day: A Lutheran Proposal for Ending World Hunger (Lutheran Voices)","review":"Nessan does a great job of discussing the issue of world hunger and how Christians have become complacent in fighting it.

But I was positively surprised over the incredible amount of useful reference material that is inside this book. Not only does it describe how your everyday web-ware works, but it also explains very well how all the different connection standards are designed and function. This book helped me learn what I didn't know about the Internet, as well as gave me sufficient information to setup my Linux WWW server - even if that's by no means the purpose of the book.If you have any questions about the inner workings of the Internet, this book answers them very well!"},{"Title":"A Color Atlas of Rocks and Minerals in Thin Section","review":"This book is overpriced and almost useless. It only serves as eye candy for someone with exposure to the petrographic microscope. Outside of pictures it contains terse explanations and alot of blank wasted space."},{"Title":"A Color Atlas of Rocks and Minerals in Thin Section","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Fairbanks: this book should not be confused with the Mackenzie and Guilford atlas. The Atlas of *Rocks* and Minerals tries to be too comprehensive (by including both rocks and minerals) and in doing so has lost all of the information about less common and accessory minerals that was in the Mackenzie and Guilford text. Of course, much of what's in both books is now available on the Web, but it's still hard to find large format color photos like the ones in Mackenzie and Guilford.Another (less expensive) alternative is A.R. Philpotts' &quot;Petrography of Igneous and Metamorphic Rocks.&quot; In my experience as a student and then a TA in a mineralogy course, Philpotts' book does a better job of pointing out the distinctive characteristics of minerals than do the photographic atlases."},{"Title":"A Color Atlas of Rocks and Minerals in Thin Section","review":"The book is written in a consise and well laid out manner. As the previous writer stated, the colour photos are priceless and are exactly as you would see looking through a petrological microscope both in crossed polars and thin section"},{"Title":"A Color Atlas of Rocks and Minerals in Thin Section","review":"Color Atlas of Rocks and Minerals in Thin Section with Student Survey SetMaybe it is just me, but when I think of \\"student survey set\\" in conjunction with a small paperback priced at over $70.00, I am expecting to get a few thin sections that I can view under a polarizing light microscope...What I really received with the book was a marketing survey - something you would have to pay me to fill out - not something that I would ever pay money to receive... grrr.As far as the text, I like it, but will likely return the one I ordered \\"with the student survey set\\", and find a less expensive used version. Like another reviewer said - it is just the basics. I did like that the author refers the reader to other pages in his text, if there is a chance that the reader is not familiar with a term used. For example, \\"...Becke Line (see page 20)\\".This atlas does not have as many different samples represented (about 30) compared to around 100 for the Atlas of rock-forming minerals in thin section by W.S. Makenzie & C. Guilford, but the color in the images is more brillant, and I wanted a reference that I could compare a \\"rock\\" thin section image to a \\"mineral\\" thin section... I'm not sure there is much of a difference since minerals are always in rocks anyway, but comparing an Olivine-rich Basalt from Greenland in the Guilford version to just plain Olivine in the Adams version (both samples are from Greenland), the images are different. That is what I was hoping to accomplish by purchasing both books - a chance to see how one mineral's appearance can vary.The W.S. MacKenzie & Guilford atlas is even more expensive, but at least it does not try to pass itself off as coming with a \\"student survey set\\".I think the best idea is to look for both of these books used, or go with the Philpott book that another reviewer mentions."},{"Title":"A Color Atlas of Rocks and Minerals in Thin Section","review":"i'm a second year geology student and this book was an excellent companion during mineralogy and petrology labs"},{"Title":"A Color Atlas of Rocks and Minerals in Thin Section","review":"I believe this book is ideal for a second year University student to learn to identify rocks and common forming minerals under the microscope.Regardless of earlier critics, this book is only intended as a help to identify common minerals and nothing else.

I am afraid to use it because it is so outdated. My book is copyrighted 2003, but it has not been updated. There are terms that haven't been politically correct for years. Technology and the way Rehab counselors use technology has changed drastically and a study guide really needs to address this. The book is question/answer format, but there is no feedback about why an answer is correct.

This is a book outside of the over-published Wicca tradition. He does work very much from a Western magical perspective however. I worked with this book alongside books by John and Caitlin Matthews, aswell as WG Gray. It is due to be re-published in an omnibus edition along with &quot;Advanced Magical Arts&quot;. RJ's work is always trustworthy. His books go well beyond much of the new age nonsense generally available, and working with them is not for the faint-hearted. He leaves you with no illusions as to what is involved with doing the work. Highly recommended for anyone serious about their magical work."},{"Title":"Living Magical Arts: Imagination and Magic for the 21st Century","review":"Stewart's book made me get out my highlighter, because he states basic truths succinctly and clearly -- truths I want to come back to again and again. This book derives from Stewart's personal experience, and unlike other texts on \\"magic,\\" it is no pastiche of the work of others, or a mere catalog of magical correspondences. Stewart offers clear instructions, rationales and a coherent and profound magical philosophy for what he presents. As he defines it, \\"magic is a set of methods for arranging awareness according to patterns.\\" These patterns catalyze a transformation: \\"the purpose of magical arts is to enable changes within the individual by which he or she may apprehend further methods [of magic and transformation] inwardly.\\"The ultimate goal of magic, for Stewart, is not the acquisition of mysterious powers, wealth, health, control of others, etc. These are the vaudeville tricks of inferior and negative books on so-called magic which give the art a bad name. Yes, Stewart calls a spade a spade, from his point of view. His reasoning is simple: \\"magic attempts to relate human consciousness to divine consciousness through patterns inherent in each.\\" So anything that obstructs that goal is unnecessary and even harmful. Magic is not a religion, and certainly not anti-religion, but rather \\"a coherent set of traditions regarding human potential.\\" The god(dess) images of a religion are imaginative images \\"engineered to a high standard of performance.\\" So magicians, without ever denying the power or value of such images, work through and beyond them because they want to experience and work with the reality which lies behind images and which energizes them.Stewart's style is educated and not a breezy, colloquial one. Though it can feel a little stuffy at first, this book should be in the hands of anyone interested in developing awareness, transforming consciousness and inner growth. I say this not because I expect everyone will (or should) agree with Stewart. I don't always. But his common-sense, grounded, utterly practical outlook is refreshing and unusual when you look at the sometimes careless, unscholarly, irresponsible and misleading books on the market which promise a lot and don't deliver. Use your reason and intelligence fully, as Stewart would urge, because they're tools too. He remarks late in the book, \\"if the intellect can be turned to prove to itself that conditioned life patterns are false, it becomes a useful tool towards liberation.\\" No quick fixes (I'm usually suspicious of books which promise those anyway), but a path worthy of prolonged dedication."},{"Title":"Living Magical Arts: Imagination and Magic for the 21st Century","review":"If you are interested in practicing true magic, this book will give you a solid background without a bunch of mumbo jumbo. Unfortunately, here are a lot of misleading and foolish books out there on the subject of magic. Most of them avoid the real life-transforming truth of what living magic really can be. This book is one of the few exceptions. It leads you step by step through exercises that (if you take the time to practice them) will awaken your spiritual understanding and transform your reality. The author brings his considerable knowledge and experience of magic into all his books and I highly recommend them all.If you are looking for Harry Potter adventures with waving wands, spells, and bubbling cauldrons, you won't find it here. What you will find is a doorway into the inner reality that inspired the Harry Potter stories. This is a mysterious reality that lives within each one of us, and it is freely available to us if we should dare to open that door and explore it. Of course, one book can only offer a glimpse into this reality, but it can be the beginning of a lifetime of growth and deepening wisdom."},{"Title":"Living Magical Arts: Imagination and Magic for the 21st Century","review":"This is a definite must have book in my opinion. I see it as a successor to William G Gray's \\"Magical ritual Methods\\" Stewart does an excellent job of discussing practical magical work, particularly in describing how magic works and what the practitioner can do to refine his/her approach to magical work. I liked the methodologies presented in the book as well as the author's perspectives on different topics within magical work. This book will provide a solid grounding in how magic works and will help you improve your practice."},{"Title":"Living Magical Arts: Imagination and Magic for the 21st Century","review":"I have read, or tried to read, a number of books by RJ Stewart, yet unfortunately I continue to find them invariably flat and dull. I found this book, ostensibly about the \\"Living Magical Arts\\", to rather accomplish a deadening of Magic. Appalachian folk wisdom says, \\"If you would walk the Witches' way, observe with care the child at play\\", but Stewart has no use for the wisdom of children, and prefers that of the adult scientific mind.Clearly there are some who benefit from his work, and I tend to think that they, like Stewart, are by nature more practical, sensate, scientifically or intellectually oriented, and rather \\"basic.\\" Though Stewart does say that Magic can't be intellectually or conceptually presented, yet he sadly does just that, and kills off any magic that might have existed in this book by trying to present it intellectually and conceptually, and taking a possessive, narrow view of it. To read Stewart, you'd think that anyone with a view on Magic that didn't mesh with Stewart's own dull view, was a deluded idiot. For Stewart, magic simply MUST be part of a \\"tradition\\", cannot be discovered on one's own or \\"made up\\", and takes an onerous and overwhelming amount of practice and work to develop. Forget sigils or symbols, too: Stewart has decided that these are \\"corrupt\\" (pg 133) and irrelevant. And you must, by the way, read this book and all his others strictly in order, page by page, not doing the exercises first, not leaping ahead, or in fact following your intuition at all: for what emerges from a survey of his work, is that Stewart has no intuition. He's a follow the step by step instructions kind of man. If that's your cup of tea, then you might like him. However if you have enough intuition to be able to skip steps, you'll bound far ahead of him and learn in three days what he might accomplish in three decades.I think a good way to put it, is that you can basically get from magic whatever you want. If you want a serious, disciplined, step-by-step follow the directions onerous and unimaginative, unintuitive, non-straying from the approved path type of approach, you can get that. However if in spite of the ubiquity in our culture of stolid adults and uninspired teachings, you have managed to retain something of your inner child, who knows in her heart that magic is actually something children can do quite easily without years of study and instruction and the tyranny of step-by-step, you can do magic much more effortlessly and creatively. The choice is yours."},{"Title":"The Brownies and other tales","review":"Brownies and Other Tales is written predominantly about a family of several children, who get into various scrapes, and then get to hear fairy tale stories from various adults in their lives with simple morals hidden inside.The prose is not bad, but the story-within-a-story-within-a-story style was not to my tastes.

I also felt I was re-reading sections from her husband's book in her book; his words were just changed around a bit. There was nothing new nor were any original ideas presented in the book.She makes reference on why God loves to answer such a prayer as the Jabez prayer. Does that mean that God does not answer other kinds of prayers, and only chooses \\"prayers such as . . .?\\" I think not. She talks of women being very fearful and giving up on miracles in their lives. Well, thoughts have energy and if one constantly thinks fearful thoughts, then fear shows up in our lives. If one does not believe in miracles happening, then they won't. Ernest Holmes, in his ministry, stated, \\"Change your thoughts, change your life.\\" Jesus was able to do what he did, not only because of his faith, but also because of the power of his thoughts. Faith is a huge concept.The feeling I get after reading this book is that if one says this prayer then the miracles unfold. If one doesn't believe, or is skeptical, or has negative thoughts, their lives will not change. The author also talks about supporting one's husband. How about the husband supporting his wife's career? It works both ways and spousal support is not just \\"one\\" way. Have I stepped back into the 50's here? Satan is also mentioned in her book, which, in my review of the Prayer of Jabez, is getting old. We have free will, which God has given us. Our choices need to be held accountable by the person who made them and not blamed on someone else.She also makes reference that we have to realize that Jesus died for payment our sins and once we accept that we are saved. I think not. God's Spirit is with us always and if one does or does not accept the above statement, it does not mean that God will not bless us. We are God's expression on earth. We are already whole and complete and we are loved always. I am really tired of reading \\"Christian\\" books where the guilt it constantly laid on. This book also does not talk about a forgiving and loving God, which is very disappointing.She also talks ad nauseum on fear, on women's fears. Sure we all have fears, but again we either give into them or change them. It makes me wonder that as a minister's wife, she is so filled with fear, where is her supportative husband? Does she feel that insecure? Has her husband not helped to boost her self-confidence or has she been put down and made to feel insecure. Makes one wonder.This book was just as bad as the original, if not worse. Another disappointment."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jabez for Women","review":"I found this book to be insightful, though not quite as good as Secrets of the Vine (written by her husband, Bruce). Darlene Wilkinson gives the Prayer of Jabez a slightly different spin, putting her perspective on it. But beware of several items: 1) this is written from her perspective, so don't presume that all she says will apply or even make sense from yours; and 2) asking for God to enlarge your territory doesn't necessarily mean make you rich. I noticed a few other reviewers of Bruce Wilkinson's book thought that it meant make me rich. I took it to mean, make me more effective for Your kingdom, Lord, by taking me out of my comfort zone (my territory). Just as King Solomon prayed for wisdom and God, because He was pleased with his request, made him the richest king of all time, so with Jabez. The very same day I began my 30 day trial (I am still in it, by the way), God granted my wish by opening a position at my church for me to minister through serving. The Lord has truly blessed me through this prayer. It is 100% effective if you keep your eyes open and don't expect physical riches. For me, the riches I am seeking are those to be found in my eternal home. Though I'm not going to turn down any earthly riches if that is God's plan!"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jabez for Women","review":"I would have enjoyed this book more if I had not already read The Prayer of Jabez by Bruce Wilkinson.

What I found out is that God wants to bless us, not according to our worthiness but because we know He will answer our prayers.Wherever you are is your territory to bless others and glorify God. God will use you to benefit others, bless others, according to His perfect plan. We need to remove our limits on what we can do and who we can become to glorify God. God wants us to have a bigger impact on the lives of others by expanding our network of influence to reach others for Christ.On page 42, Darlene states a process to help us along in our Jabez Prayer:*Ask God to let me do more for him.*Aim to be available to those around me.*Approach surprise encounters as potential Jabez Appointment.*Acknowledge it's about God's agenda, not mine.I believe that if we are tired, overwork and stressed we are not living the prayer of Jabez because God always leaves us exhilarated, not exhausted.I would recommend this easy to read book to anyone who wants to feel like they are doing more for Christ as we are His Servants on earth.

The underwater scenes are excellent (as always), the descriptions of the Bahamas are vivid, and the wealth of technical details about diving and salvage work never slow the plot down. Best of all, unlike _Hatteras Blue_, the big plot twist that Poyer springs near the end of the story makes sense and ties together a lot of seemingly loose ends. Galloway is still a likable character, still wishing he could shake off the past and still unable to do it.As maritime thrillers go, _Bahamas Blue_ isn't quite up to the standards set by Sam Llewellyn, Hammond Innes, and Brian Callison, but its a solid piece of work and an excellent choice for fans of the genre."},{"Title":"Bahamas Blue","review":"Just got finished with this book(5/99).

I was a drama critic for nearly 12 years, saw hundreds of productions of all kinds from coast to coast in the US and a few in London, and never laughed harder or enjoyed myself more than at a regional US production of &quot;Hay Fever&quot; in the late 1970's. Do it again! Do it again!"},{"Title":"Blithe Spirit, Hay Fever, Private Lives: Three Plays","review":"Noel Coward's talent for spinning gossamer plots into rapier-sharp comedy assures his reputation in theatre, and his comedies have such timeless appeal that they remain staples of both English and American theatre. This volume collects three of his most memorable scripts: the fantasy BLITHE SPIRIT, the farce HAY FEVER, and the razor-wicked PRIVATE LIVES.Of the three, BLITHE SPIRIT and PRIVATE LIVES are best known to the general public through various film versions and frequent revivals. BLITHE SPIRIT concerns a novelist who invites a medium to give a seance that he might learn tricks of the trade for the book he is writing--but the medium is no fake, and she unintentionally summons up the ghost of his first wife, who promptly moves in and makes his second wife's life a living hell. PRIVATE LIVES offers the story of a divorced couple who unexpectedly meet while honeymooning with their new spouses--whom they quickly abandon in order to resume their torrid passion for each other. Trouble is, although they love each other desperately, their personalities are about as compatible as two scorpions in a bottle. HAY FEVER, one of Coward's earliest successes, presents the story of visitors to an eccentric family who are very nearly driven mad before they are able to escape.Coward was reknowned for his sophistocated and often acid turn of phrase, and all three of these plays contain enough outrageous situations and sharp-tongued lines to make even the worst sourpuss laugh loud enough to annoy the neighbors. Although those unused to reading playscripts may find HAY FEVER a bit hard to grasp, both BLITHE SPIRIT and PRIVATE LIVES read extremely, extremely well--so much so that you're likely to find yourself acting them out as you read! Wonderful fun, and strongly, strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Blithe Spirit, Hay Fever, Private Lives: Three Plays","review":"This is an important author, although poor Noel lived to see himself both scorned and forgotten. He got the Tennessee Williams treatment in spades. Suddenly, the clouds lifted and he was once again the toast of London, got knighted, and will live again evidently until the next round of purging. It all sounds terribly Soviet, doesn't it? But this seems to be how theater critics go about exciting the audience to new things. First they have to eviscerate the old. Coward could take it because he was a tough old sod. The British theater seems to produce little monsters, like Peter Sellers, Lawrence Olivier, and Noel Coward. Monsters as in gila monsters, with reptile-tough skin. Evidently one needs it. Coward exists in a time warp, somewhat like P. G. Wodehouse. His world is long gone if it ever existed. What is key is that once in it, you believe it did once exist and you hope it will last forever. The plays are addictive. Women love the roles in the same way they love to play Williams. I would venture to say that there will be a production of \\"Private Lives\\" some where on this earth every year until the last days of mankind. The editor is also Coward's most recent biographer. I happen to have this same volume, edited by Edward Albee with a nifty introduction."},{"Title":"Blithe Spirit, Hay Fever, Private Lives: Three Plays","review":"I got this book because I wanted to read the play Blythe Spirit. I don't even remember why now. I know I saw it as a young child as an old movie starring Rex Harrison; maybe it arose out of a moment of nostalgia.In any case, I almost put the book aside after reading the play itself. It seemed rather a bore, all things considered. I'd expected more witty conversations, double entends, and awkward moments. Instead I found a rather misogynistic attitude that was more annoying than funny. I also found that the play would have made a better Agatha Christie murder mystery. What if the central character wasn't just a haunted and beset husband but a serial killer of his wives? Many of the attempts at comedy came across as lame, and I couldn't help but feel that I, steeped in TV from childhood, had \\"seen it all before.\\" After all, Laugh In, Saturday Night Live, stand up comedians, and the late night talk shows had pretty much done what there was to be done.The only thing that brought me back to the book was the knowledge that Noel Coward had been regarded in his time as a very witty and irreverent playwright, and I felt I should give him a fairer trial. I was glad I did, because both Hay Fever and Private Lives were quite amusing. Oddly enough, they were also much earlier plays. Perhaps the 1920s and 30s had more in common with the culture of the late 20th and early 21st centuries than with that between 1940-1990.I can almost visualize the manic comings and goings of the characters in Hay Fever and their equally insane comments and quarrels. Sitting in the audience of such a production must have been great fun, and the synergy between audience and actors must have made it even greater. The interaction partakes a great deal of standup comedy, with a slightly off-the-wall comedian paired with his or her \\"straight man.\\" Here the off-the-wall and straight man types appear in abundance, and their activities on the stage generate a feeling of total pandemonium. It is no wonder that the guests sneak off, leaving their oblivious hosts to themselves. Here the dialogue is used to make a clear dividing line between the two types of individual, the conventional person and the totally unconventional. Much of what is said and what it means is known only to the unconventional set and the audience. The audience becomes part of the play by virtue of knowing what some of the characters on stage do not; that much of what the unconventional characters are saying are lines from a particularly bad play that one of them had appeared in at a previous time.Private Lives was less frenetically active, but it made its own great use of the stage. (For those who've never read a play, there are stage directions included at the beginning and throughout the play which lets the reader know when and where a character enters or leaves the stage, etc.) It also made wonderful use of the inanities of casual conversation, especially the repetition of statements ad absurdum. Some of them are really funny, even though the play is quite old, almost 80 years old. I suspect most of our conversations are still repetitive and inane! Again the author is pitting the conventional and the unconventional personality against one another. The utter confusion and total helplessness of the two individuals trying to be \\"normal\\" are the foils--or straight men--for the two who are total egotists. (Imagine a very young Lawrence Olivier, who played the role both on Broadway and on the London stage, as the confused and \\"stiff-upper-lip\\" young husband of the crazy Gertrude Lawrence, who also originated her role in both venues!) In short, the audience and its notion of doing the right thing become part of the play by virtue of their understanding of the confused couple. We'd all be in the same place if we'd been faced with the same situations. We can't help but sympathize with the confused couple, but we also can't help but root for the crazy couple.In general, I'd have to agree with his critics, Noel Coward was a genius at understanding society, it's affectations, and its behaviors."},{"Title":"Blithe Spirit, Hay Fever, Private Lives: Three Plays","review":"I recieved my summer reading list for Honors English a few weeks ago, and under the section that held a list of three play titles to choose from, I came across Blithe Spirit. Having never heard of Noel Coward, or anything of the other two plays in this book (Hay Fever, and Private Lives) I decided to give the book a chance and I am pleased that I did. I am not a huge fan of reading plays, but after I read Blithe Spirit, I felt that I just had to keep going and read the other two. After reading this book, it is now very obvious to me that Noel Coward was a man with extreme talent, and an awful witty sense of humor.

We had a very nice sized group and all the theater pros on hand to discuss Noel Coward. While a couple of people said that they still prefer to see plays in performance rather than read them, this was a hugely successful evening.Noel Coward wrote these three very fluffy, very silly little plays that are still revived on Broadway and in London every few years, and are mainstays of college and repertory theater companies in the US and UK. (We had a very nice discussion of the different versions of the plays we'd seen and discussed several leading men and ladies in the roles.) Coward wrote the plays for himself in several cases, but not as a gay character. He's always the urbane husband with the perfect one-liners who interacts with his wife (and ex-wives) with perfect aplomb.\\"Blithe Spirit\\" shows Coward to be a bit of a misogynist with a ditzy ex-wife ghost and a stern living wife. It's almost a criticism of heterosexual marriage. The ghost that only one person on stage can seem may see a bit tired now, but it is still completely fresh with Coward. \\"It's discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit.\\"\\"Hay Fever\\" is the most dated of the plays and probably the least produced. All members of the central family are all perfect narcissists (bad actress mom, bad novelist dad, bad artist son, and useless daughter) who invite inappropriate friends to the country on the same weekend. As soon as they arrive, you recognize the perfect mix-up and the re-alignment of the guests as potential partners, but instead you get hilariously complicated parlor games, the expected and unexpected misunderstandings, and then confused and angry guests. \\"I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.\\"\\"Private Lives\\" is fast and funny and completely plausible in the Noel Coward world of rich divorcees who run into their ex-spouses in the South of France and then re-unite so that they can dash to Paris (where the ex-wife happens to have a maid and an apartment) and continue their squabbles from years before. \\"It's a pity you didn't have a little more brandy. It might have made you more agreeable!\\"Coward invented himself and, in many ways, invented the concept of the modern celebrity. He never officially came out \\"because there are still three old ladies in Brighton who don't know.\\" Later in life, he made a fortune in Las Vegas by playing himself: he played the piano, sang a few songs, and told a few jokes. Eventually, he retired to Jamaica but years after his death is still immediately recognizable. \\"Thousands of people have talent. I might as well congratulate you for having eyes in your head. The one and only thing that counts is: Do you have staying power?\\" The answer is a resounding \\"yes.\\""},{"Title":"Blithe Spirit, Hay Fever, Private Lives: Three Plays","review":"I studied drama at Princeton because normally plays are shorter, but I never read this author.

Written with her characteristic disarming humor and affectionate intelligence, Cokie created an instant classic that hit #1 on the New York Times bestseller list where it remained for an astounding 26 weeks. Now, Cokie, who has been hailed by USA Today as a \\"custodian of time-honored values\\" joins forces with her husband of thirty-three years, political analyst and college professor Steve Roberts with FROM THIS DAY FORWARD an in-depth look at the institution of marriage, American-style. Part chronicle of their own courtship, marriage and family life, and part social/historical examination of marriage as an institution, FROM THIS DAY FORWARD uses the Roberts' personal stories as a springboard for discussing larger issues of love and marriage, work and family, parents and children. The book addresses such questions as: how in an age in which 50% of all marriages fail, why does the idea of marriage still endure, and what makes for ties that truly bind? Is it possible for marriage to flourish in a fractured culture in which families live thousands of miles apart? As the generations-old gate-keepers of family, religion and community fade away, what will take their place as the safeguards and strongholds of marriage? These issues and more are at the heart of this compelling look at the state of our unions.Told in both Cokie's and Steve's words, FROM THIS DAY FORWARD offers a fascinating, intimate portrait of their own journey together, from their courtship in the early 1960's-a time when people married right out of college as a matter of course-through their days overseas, balancing two careers and the demands of family in the turbulent 1970's, to their status today as \\"long-marrieds\\" with married children of their own. They reveal candid snapshots of their relationship-from how they fell in love, to how they approached parenting with two careers, to how they worked through the conflicting desires and expectations that test every marriage.Cokie and Steve also share stories of other American marriages: pioneers, slaves, immigrants, and Holocaust survivors. There is also a look at the surprising marriage of John and Abigail Adams, whose letters to each other reveal painful absences, heartbreaking tragedies, warm entreaties and wickedly funny, blisteringly honest exchanges. These extraordinary accounts show the universality of marriage-that cultural forces may change, but affairs of the heart do not.FROM THIS DAY FORWARD celebrates modern marriage with all its glories and flaws and turns a warm, embracing spotlight on the issues confronting today's couples who are determined to have and to hold from this day forward. As Cokie and Steve conclude, \\"Marriage is an act of faith, as well as hope...an unlimited commitment to an unknowable partner.\\" Filled with sage advice and written in a winning, fireside-chat style, FROM THIS DAY FORWARD is ultimately the story of all husbands and wives, the way they support each other and yet continue to grow and change as individuals."},{"Title":"From This Day Forward","review":"This is refreshing book about two respected journalists, radio and TV personalities and their lives, their family relationships, marriage, children, backgrounds and parents. But, they add to the book's interest by cleverly weaving into the fabric, historical research, stories about other couples in other times and situations ranging from the colonial period, to the life-and-death struggles of African American slaves, homesteaders of the American wild west, and European immigrants escaping the holocaust. The authors have used a unusual conversational dialog style, with occasional interruptions, as would be when couples talk, and the dialog includes many of Cokie's sharp-witted and hilarious one liners. As they juxtapose their own Cokie and Steve paragraphs, you feel as if you are listening in. This book will be popular for the same reasons as &quot;Forest Gump&quot; was popular. Steve and Cokie let you into their thoughts and lives with a seldom-achieved wit, style, and clarity. And they do it with panache, avoiding the embarrasing intimacy of a revealing &quot;tell-all&quot;---President Clinton's paramours might benefit from a writing course from Professor Roberts. You won't want to put the book down, and you'll want to hug your mate or your best friend after you finish. Its easy to recognize, and to laugh and to cry about many of the anecdotes the Roberts describe, especially if you are in Cokie and Steve's generation, or are, or have been married, or have had children, or travelled abroad, or lived far away from family."},{"Title":"From This Day Forward","review":"Having read and loved WE ARE OUR MOTHERS' DAUGHTERS, I quickly rushed out and bought this new one and enjoyed it even more. The description of their marriage was fascinating enough, but then to read about other marriages in history as well as contemporary ones, really made it a unique reading experience. I urge everyone to buy several copies of this book--for themselves and to give to loved ones."},{"Title":"From This Day Forward","review":"I received this book as a birthday gift yesterday - simply could not put it down. Possibly this results from my having followed these two people for many years (am a bit of a &quot;political person&quot;); but the thrust of the story is about kindness, friendship, honoring one's values and family, and, particularly, humor as an integral part of life! It certainly is not easy to combine marriage, family and work; the Roberts family appears to have made a blend of these an asset to all instead of a burden to any. Having lost the &quot;other half&quot; of my marriage a few years ago, the book only increased the joy in remembering the past and the special friendship (which is, after all, the basis of any good marriage). I do hope Cokie and Steve will consider a sequel: perhaps, as Tom Brokaw's book, &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;, engendered so many responses, this one will do the same. There must be many others &quot;out there&quot; who genuinely enjoy a love story which carries so many good lessons about life and commitment in our society. A must read for any considering marriage (still a great institution)."},{"Title":"From This Day Forward","review":"After reading &quot;From This Day Forward&quot; I wanted to learn more about American marriages like John and Abigail Adams. I also developed a renewed hope that interfaith marriages can and do work after reading how Cokie and Steve's worked so beautifully.I found the book very easy to read and enjoyed the way they interspersed their own personal stories with marriage stories from American history. Of particular interest were the stories about slave marriages. It is unbelievable what sacrifices were made for the hope of sharing one's life with another.Although my parents have remained married for over 35 years, I have many friends from divorced or blended families and it was fascinating to see a common thread through so many of the stories.Having always seen Cokie and Steve in a professional setting, it was wonderful and refreshing to realize that they are as down to earth as anyone else I know. The personal stories that they share give you a real insight into their marriage and lives. Thank you Cokie and Steve.I look forward to reading another book by Cokie and Steve very soon."},{"Title":"From This Day Forward","review":"I found this book to be worth the time spent reading it because of the insights they share about growing up in the 60's and becoming people of the 90's and the next century. Steve and Cokie Roberts grew up in vastly different East Coast households, but they were both from the &quot;old&quot; east coast. When as relative newlyweds they encounter the &quot;new&quot; culture of California and all its symbols - free love, feminism, war protests, etc. - their lives become a mirror in which we aging &quot;boomers&quot; can see ourselves.Cokie Roberts may be the daughter of political patricians but she nevertheless had to learn to cope with the changing assumptions about women as wives, mothers and professionals. When her career's zenith eclipses Steve's in the later part of the book she confronts issues that many of her younger, but nevertheless fellow &quot;boomers&quot; are facing today. Following Cokie Roberts example, the &quot;me&quot; generation could learn that the the whole (in this case, family) is worth more than simply the sum of the individual parts.Interestingly, the solutions to the &quot;problem&quot; of religiously mixed marriage Steve and Cokie devise are good templates for any type of &quot;mixed&quot; marriage today - mixed by race, ethnicity, religion, divorce and remarriage, or adoption. The inclusion of several stories about divorces they have known gives more weight to their ultimate hypothesis about marriage: &quot;[they] are better people together than [they] are separately.&quot;Okay, so sometimes it's a bit sentimental and &quot;gushy&quot; but that's part of the charm of this book. You feel the authors are talking to you as if they were in your living room chatting casually. The book isn't a prescription about &quot;how to&quot; have a successful marriage (which they achieved,apparently); nor is it a proscription against brekaing up bad marriages. It is friends talking with friends about their personal successes and failures with candidness and some measure of self-evaluation.

The chapter on divorce, in particular, seemed slightly sensationalized, and the examples extreme. Both of the Roberts' are from the baby-boom generation, so for those not in this generation, this might not be as interesting or understandable.

On the plus side, Cokie Roberts does more than her usual cut and paste from the work of others in From This Day Forward. When not pulling from the work of others, Cokie (and the compliant Steve) offer up tidbits that are supposed to inform the reader how s/he too can have a great marriage.Apparently the basic rule for a successful marriage is to live in your own little world the way kooky Cokie does. I doubt she realizes how racist she comes off in parts of the book. (Yes, Cokie, condescension is a form of racism.) Or how laughable most will find her book. Reading of the great &quot;trauma&quot; of her life, you realize this is someone who hasn't experienced many character building moments in her life. The great &quot;trauma&quot;? Learning that her new employer wouldn't provide a limo and that Cokie would have to take taxis around NYC. Oh, the horror! Oh, the shame! How did Cokie ever survive?(Had she been told to take the subway, one gets the impression Roberts would have called it quits right then.)A vapid celebration of what appears to be a vapid marriage isn't necessarily shocking -- what's shocking is that Cokie (and husband Steve) put their names to it. Had a child offered this slight volume as a souvenir to a wedding anniversary, we all would have &quot;oooh&quot;ed and &quot;aaaawe&quot;d over it.

I'm glad I picked up this book. It was a pleasant read for sure."},{"Title":"From This Day Forward","review":"This book is written by Cokie and Steve Roberts, who are married for over 40 years now. Cokie is a Catholic and Steve is a Jew. Inspite of their religious differences, they have created this book by writing alternately, leading to a harmonious melody. Hence the essence of this book can be summarized as Catholic Jewish Jugalbandi.The book begins with: This is a book of stories about marriage, not sermons or sociology. We deliberately focus on American marriages, our own and others', because marriage in this country is a rather peculiar institution. You might even say it's un-American. After all the Founding Fathers made it clear that individuals - not couples or groups or communities - have an \\"inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\\" But by definition, marriage is a partnership, not an individual enterprise. Married couples have to pursue happiness together, not as separate entities. And the essence of any successful marriage is self-sacrifice, not self-absorption.Well, with that as the beginning, the reader is assured that this is a book of substance. The book is well structured with chapters alternating between the history of marriage in America and that of the authors' marriage. Its like watching a movie set in two different eras, where the past is in sepia tone and the present is in color.The first category covers companionate marriage, slave marriages, pioneer marriages, immigrant marriages, blended families and divorce. These are presented with many touchy real life stories of people in the past. They shed light on the challenges they faced, the sacrifices they made and the trials and tribulations of a bygone era. There are many stories from history, but there are two simply outstanding stories, that will leave a mark on the mind of any reader. The first is about the marriage of Abigail and John Adams. They had five kids and Abigail was almost like a single parent while John was posted in Europe for work, for two years or so! But from their hundreds of letters one can sense how utterly united their minds and souls were, inspite of the geographic separation. They lived to celebrate their golden anniversary. In her later years Abigail Adams said\\" If I had youth and opportunity today, I would still marry the same man.\\" How lovely is that sentiment!Another outstanding story narrated by Steve is about a Jewish bride (a holocaust survivor) who gets her bridal gown stitched out of a recycled parachute fabric! After her wedding it is worn by 20 or more brides. Many years later it becomes a permanent exhibit at a Holocaust museum in America. As part of history it is displayed with the wedding photos of all the other brides who too wore it. Many of them lived to celebrate their golden anniversary. What a remarkable story of the spirit of man to survive and thrive! I also enjoyed the section on immigrant marriages where Cokie says that once you come here as an immigrant, the rules of the old world don't apply.The second category takes the reader into the world of the authors' marriage, as they travel with family from New York to California to Greece and then finally settle in Washington D.C. It is interesting to read about how they juggled down-town jobs and two kids in suburban schools. Inspite of being from different religions, they enlarged their life by celebrating festivals from both sides together. With two very busy, intense and demanding careers they found time to mentally connect with each other, while commuting to work.The uniqueness of marriage in America is that you don't have to drown your individuality in it. If both the husband and wife are capable then they can create a melodious jugalbandi, in which both retain their individuality and blend it into a couplehood of harmony. For what defines a jugalbandi is that the two soloists be on equal footing i.e. neither is clearly soloist nor an accompaniment. In conclusion, by writing this book together, Steve and Cokie have demonstrated how two individuals can have a symbiosis of enriching careers and build a wonderful life together, like a melodious jugalbandi.Ratna"},{"Title":"From This Day Forward","review":"i am very pleased with all of cokie roberts writings, she is insightful and down to earth in all her books ,she makes history come alive. this book is about marriage and she has a lot of fascinating things to say about it, from the standpoint of her own as well as some historical marriages."},{"Title":"From This Day Forward","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

In the era of mysteious dimpled chads, the perspective and level-headedness of a knowledgeable, experienced, and wise woman is invaluable.

I was not disappointed. By sharing their insights and their lives, Cokie and Steve Robers have made a major contribution to the complex subject of marriage. I urge anyone who is married--or thinking of getting married--to read this superb book."},{"Title":"From This Day Forward","review":"Read this book if you are interested in what it is like to, for instance, be a foreign correspondent for the New York Times in Greece. The biographical sections are interesting, but unfortunately didn't make a full book---so they decided to add some filler. The section about John and Abigail Adams in mildly interesting but the remainder of the filler material is dull, dull, snoringly dull.Now, about the Roberts. They spend a lot of time talking about her being a Catholic and he being a non-practicing Jew. The impression that I got was that she would have been in bigger trouble with her parents bringing home a Republican than a Jew. Since he is somewhat casual about his religion, she picks up the slack by adopting some Jewish rituals like a passover seder, a Hannakuh celebration and the like. When you consider that Jesus celebrated both those holidays himself, its not such a long stretch for Cokie.What irked me, and really bothered me to the core, was their chutzpah. They have been in the rarified air of Washington and the national media for so long, they don't even realize how distant they are from the rest of us. It is never said, but the implication is clear---we don't count.The world is controlled by the Roberts who are friends with the Brokaws, who are buddies with the Wertheimers, who are close to the Totenbergs, who hang out with the Hedrick Smiths etc., etc. etc. until it makes one feel rather insignificant.

In fact, had in not been for Cokie who is a Catholic, Judiasm would have barely been represented in the home at all. This one-sided religious representation appeared to be their key to success -- only Cokie had any strong religious feelings. Had they both had strong religious feelings, I think they would have been headed for trouble.Cokie, having been born to a family of political influence, power, and wealth, related something of a &quot;riches to riches&quot; story . However, she did relate stories about hardships she had to endure growing up such as how hard it can be to catch a cab in New York City.Steve on the other hand tried a little too hard to convince us that he really didn't mind that Cokie made more than he did and was more famous than him.The narrative style in which they related their story is fine for a magazine article but I found it a little tedious trying to read an entire book that way.My advice on buying this book would be to save your money."},{"Title":"From This Day Forward","review":"I always loved Cokie Roberts on TV and when I saw this book, I figured it would be fun to read about her marriage to Steve Roberts.

If you do purchase this book to assist you in pursuing ISO 9001 registration for software and services I strongly recommend augmenting it with &quot;ISO 9001:2000 Explained&quot; by Cianfrani, Tsiakals and West. That book will bring the material up to the 2000 version of ISO 9001. Also consider &quot;ISO 9000-3: A Tool for Software Product and Process Improvement&quot; by Raymond Kehoe, et al, which is a more comprehensive treatment of the subject (note that this book also is out of date with respect to the 2000 version of ISO 9001)."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"Having only recently begun reading Bellow I have found him to be an admirable guide to the way contemporary man thinks about the world and particularly human relationships. Although the characters sometimes seem a little too involved in philosophical wool-gathering to be true, their ruminations provide critical insights into the way our society is constructed. In The Dean's December, the contrasts are between the decaying society of late communist Rumania and the problems of society in contemporary Chicago. The Dean is in Rumania to be with his dying mother-in-law, a formerly powerful party official who has been ostracised for allowing her daughter,an internationally famous astronomer, to emigrate to the west.. The Dean, who is a respected journalist has ruffled powerful feathers in Chicago with a series of pointed articles critical of certain aspects of Chicago society and has also been involved in seeking justice in a case where one of ! his students has been murdered. In this he is opposed by his radical nephew who thinks that the case is racist because the accused are African Americans of deprived social origins. Bellow is a master of setting the scene - the bleak December weather echoes the coldness of communist and capitalist society, the cheerless bureaucracies and intricate politics of both settings. As well as societies problems, the Dean must also confront his own mortality as he watches his beloved mother-in-law die and the reactions of his wife and slightly eccentric relatives to this stress. This is a book which will repay several readings. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"The downside of being pugnacious and feisty is that people stop taking you seriously next time you jump into a scrap. This seems to be what happened to this undeservedly neglected book by a great and feisty American writer.Known for bringing artistic beauty, dimensionality, and a golden aura of wisdom to his tough Chicago turf, Bellow here took the gloves off. His University of Chicago Dean hero struggles with injustice and cynicism at its rawest, when he becomes engaged with the cavalier Chicago criminal justice system and its disgustingly casual response to the murder of a student. Counterpoint is meaningfully provided by the death of an old relative behind the iron curtain, whom the Dean visits. As in Lear, the subplot is no relief at all, merely stokes the flames of the main plot and brings Bellow's fury with the modern world to a white heat. Thus we are denied mere sociological or political excuses for our modern mayhem; the focus is what has gone wrong with our hearts the world over. Never has Bellow been more engaged or convincing. Indeed Bellow sacrifices something of his usual high gloss artistic finish to this product in the process, perhaps intentionally and savagely.Yeah, he wants to stick it in your face and it shows. This is doubtless what offends some readers. Nevertheless it is a worthy response to having just received the Nobel Prize. Most writers, American and otherwise, react by self-inflating to sanctimoniously gracious gas bags. Saul knew who he was, however, and never let anyone fool him on that score.I cannot recommend the real life portraiture and painting that shines through this text highly enough. It is entirely genuine, real, perfect, matchlessly true. I frankly know of no better Chicago novel.To be fair, however, I must warn you that the 2 respected readers I know, who read this one cover to cover, were almost viscerally angry afterwards for having done so. Ultimately the experience only underscored to me the difficulties of succeeding in fiction, of making it that real."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"Of course, there's no telling what the reception of a Nobel Prize can actually do to how a prizewinner relates to his work or material. Does he simply keep up the good work and satisfy himself with more of the same? Or does he feel compelled to stretch out a little, tackle tougher terrain, become a world spokesman, a kind of Bob Geldof of the academic world? Or does he simply pull up the stakes altogether and move to, say, Parnassus? While critics have expressed mild dissatisfaction with the post facto work of one of those Nobel winners, Saul Bellow, mainly because what some believe to be an unecessary discursiveness has crept into his later novels, Bellow's previous work is often so tongue-in-cheek and humorously numinous that it is easy to dismiss the dismissers as perhaps having read &quot;The Dean's December&quot; too superficially. Bellow's first novel after the Nobel watermark, in many ways, then, seems to betray the author's early attempts to keep up with the reputation he has gained: Big subjects, high blown philosophy, windy passages. But what else would you expect from Bellow, a man who hails from Chicago, the Windy City?It's bleak and apocalyptic in the Romania where Albert Corde, a prominent Chicago university dean begins his story. The depths of an East European winter made even colder by the moribund Communist dictatorship whose presence is felt everywhere seems nearly as leaden as the sallow plum brandy he sips as if it were contraband in the decaying parlor of his wife's ailing mother, Valeria. As the old woman, once a favored Communist official, now a sweetheart of an aging underground of pale faces and flowery dresses, slips into the slow throes of an early death, Corde is emotionally consumed, not with the potent world into which he has been pulled, but with another one: Chicago, a city he seriously believes is in uproar over two scathing rants against its crime-ridden ghettoes he'd recently published in Harper's.But, Bellow cunningly implies, such is the world of the American acadamy. A few cross words, perhaps bent towards the embarrassment of a number of pig-eyed public figures, and the next thing you know, you're a disgrace, a schmuck, a putz, the last guy anybody'd ever want to invite over for cocktails ever again. Not surprisingly, this queasy underbelly of the dissociative hyper-reality of America's upper classes is part of the price of our American comfort. It's a price of not really wanting to look, or of not quite knowing how, the cost of having willfully pulled away in both disgust and inadequacy from the often invisible reality of the downtrodden, tucked out of sight as they are in every major American city. Of course, the Romanian government has several quite neat solutions to the problems of public insolence. While Valeria's position as a political pentitent isn't beyond Corde's understanding, however, he seems beyond all that just the same.The bottom line? Corde's protected public role as the Dean of the School of Journalism has done nothing to protect him. He's worried about his job. He sticks out like a burn victim in the faculty lounge. He's worried about who he is, who he might become. Worried most of all about what the papers are saying, especially in light of the fact he's also managed to have gotten both himself and the university ensnared in a legal fracas involving a pimp, a whore, a murdered college student and his quasi-Marxist nephew, Mason--a typically Bellowish twist as the sublime and the vulgar mingle and become the ludicrous.Struggle as he might to find a way to meet the world in terms that actually make sense, Corde seems to know he's going to fail, and perhaps even become the embodiment of how out-of-touch public debate is from realities that are pressing in from every side. For him, poverty in a tenement, with its screaming, its dinge, its stench, its hopelessness and frustration are nothing but abstractions. While he might be in a position with enough influence to bring the bad news to the surface, still he's barely aware that the situation is as alien to his ways and means as it is astronomical.Saul Bellow is famous for railing at Chicago. He's been grilled for it. And doubtless he has first-hand knowledge of how it feels to shake the dust out of the rug when company is in the room. Furthermore, as a literary icon, Bellow more than likely has an intimate understanding of how askew the academic and mundane worlds in America are from one another. Perhaps Bellow just can't help it. He's writing what he knows. And so what if a close examination of our vaunted intellectuals proves they're clowns?"},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"This was my first (and thus far, only) Bellow novel, and I can't say I'm racing to pick up another. I had very high expectations, which were not met. Although passages of this book are quite beautiful and sensitive (most of which concern his wife and her dying mother) I was overwhelmed by how Bellow uses the main character as a megaphone through which to pontificate on contemporary race relations. He dramatizes nothing and leaves nothing for the reader to do. The setting, side by side, of a racially-inspired murder in Chicago and the death of an old woman in a communist country is certainly interesting, but way too subtle for me, especially in light of how heavy-handed Bellow is in other parts of the narrative. Still, I read this novel over two years ago and am still thinking of it; parts of it come back to me like a sepia-toned postcard, very fleeting."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"I am a Bellow fan and have read most of his novels. After a while his books become like old friends. This is an excellent novel, but a bit slow and somber.In case you are new to Bellow, his novels reflect his life, his writings, and his five marriages during his five active decades of writing. He hit his peak as a writer around the time of \\"Augie March\\" in 1953 and continued through to the Pulitzer novel \\"Humbolt's Gift\\" in 1973. He wrote from the early 1940s through to 2000. His novels are written in a narrative form, and the main character is a Jewish male, usually a writer but not always, and he is living in either in New York or Chicago. Bellow wrote approximately 13 novels and other works. The present novel - we can assume - reflects his own personal experiences of travelling to Romania in 1978, to attend the funeral of his mother-in-law, a former minister of health - similar to the story details of the book.Bellow's style progressed a long way as a writer over the five decades. The early novels \\"Dangling Man\\" and \\"The Victim\\" were written 25 years before his peak. Those were heavy slow reads. \\"Dangling Man\\" is often boring, and Bellow was in search of his writing style in that period of the 1940s. Some compare his style in \\"Dangling Man\\" with Dostoevsky's \\"Notes from the Underground.\\" Having read both I would say that \\"Notes\\" is brilliant while \\"Dangling Man\\" is at best average and sometimes a bit boring. The book is well written and compact and many like that first book, but it was never a big seller.His style changes with time, and the novels became more colorful such as \\"Augie March\\" or \\"Henderson the Rain King,\\" or in fact brilliant as in \\"Herzog\\" or expansive and entertaing such as in \\"Humbolt's Gift.\\" In \\"Humbolt's Gift\\" the narrator Charlie Citrine, again a writer, tells us a bit about his philosophy of writing and the need to entertain. Some of these novels have a warmth and charm, and have a certain tongue in cheek approach in describing the trials and tribulations of the narrator. The humour is mixed in with the meaning of life and the future of our souls. Along the way there are a few diversions such as \\"Mr. Sammler's Planet\\" where we see a much more serious individual but again there is a bit of humour with the character Sammler.That bring us to the present book, written by an older Bellow, one perhaps a step past his prime. But that did not stop Bellow nor does it detract in any way from the book. In fact, as we see in \\"Ravelstein\\" a few decades later, Bellow does not lose his touch, but the novels continue to change and evolve. The present book is serious, almost completely lacking in humour, and there are no side stories about former wives, or criminals, etc.Without giving away the plot - such as it is and it is weak like most Bellow novels - the book has two parallel stories but perhaps just one complicated theme. The parallel stories involve the visit by the narrator, Dean Albert Corde, and his wife Minna to Bucharest to visit Minna's dying mother in an ICU in a Soviet style hospital. Corde is the Dean of Journalism at a fictional Chicago university. That sets a rather grim and humourless cold war era tone. In Bucharest he meets up with an old friend, and now a famous journalist, Dewey Splanger. Unknown to Corde, Dewey is preparing a piece to be published on Corde and on their upbringings in Chicago four decades earlier. The second of the two parallel stories is the life of Corde as a Dean and the subject of his writings and life in general in urban Chicago. These events all seem to come together and converge in Bucharest in a wintry December. The general theme is the way Corde views of urban Chicago; the theme reflects his writings on urban affairs, and the impact of the university on society.The book is a bit slow to start, average in length about 300 pages long, but once underway is a complelling but not a brisk read. It does not have those Bellow touches that we see in some other novels. But still, it is Bellow, and as in other novels he makes literary tangent after tangent off of the main subject describing every character in great detail, and sometimes time shifting back many decades. He paints a stark contrast bewteen the grey communist Bucharest and the colorful and the complex Chicago, run by the political machine.In a later book, \\"Ravelstein,\\" Bellow uses Allan Bloom as a character and I thought that there were touches of Bloom in the Corde character, especially in setting the theme and how Corde viewed Chicago: \\"Bloom was a professor of social thought and a noted translator of Plato and Rousseau.\\" Bloom became famous and wealthy following his book \\"The Closing of the American Mind\\", about American values and the role of Higher Education. Bellow and Bloom taught together and Bellow wrote the forward for Bloom's most famous book.From a biographical description of Bloom I have copied this note: \\"Bloom blamed high technology, the sexual revolution, and the introduction of cultural diversity into the curriculum at the expense of the classics, which in turn produced students without wisdom or values. According to Bloom, American democracy has unwittingly played host to vulgarized continental ideas of nihilism and despair, and of relativism disguised as tolerance.\\"Some of those themes are present in the current novel, as Bellow describes the disillusionment of Corde with the crime and poverty of urban Chicago and the role in society of his own Chicago university.This novel was a lot better than I had expected, but it lacks the warmth and charm of some of his other works.Recommend. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"After receiving the Nobel Prize in literature, Saul Bellow produced \\"Dean's December\\", another extraordinary masterpiece. Probably the most insightful of the wave of novels which appeared in the West after some of the writers managed to travel behind the Iron Curtain, this is the story of Albert Corde, the University Dean and journalist from Chicago, who travels with his Romanian wife, Minna, to Bucharest when Minna's mother, Valeria, is at the hospital in critical condition after a stroke.Dean Corde, as an America in the Communist Romania (annoyingly called Rumania which I believe was common in English several decades ago, although incorrect), is protected by his wife's family, not advised to left the house by himself, and alienated by the language barrier, effectively being left alone, with scarce contacts with Minna's family (despite his strong feelings for them and his will to help). Staying alone in his wife's childhood room at Valeria's apartment, which is occupied also by an elderly aunt, Tanti Gigi, the Dean cannot even read books, being essentially a benevolent prisoner; so he immerses himself in thoughts, disturbing and worrying, his problems remaining unsolved and new problems appearing during this cold December. The professional matters, left in Chicago, mingle with the personal in Bucharest, and each has an element of another in it. Although the narrative is in the third person, it is clear that most of it is told from Albert's point of view and is, essentially, a stream of his thoughts, a monologue (with a phone conversation, a discussion with Minna, or some letters here and there).Albert has left Chicago in the middle of being involved in the trial of the death of one of his students, where the two accused are a pair of black inhabitants of the city - a prostitute and a man whose actions are dubious, but who is a friend of Albert's nephew, Mason. Mason tries to convince Albert that his friend could not kill the student, and uses clever arguments, which - Albert admits to himself - are better than he is able to rebuke.Because the Dean caused some stirrup with his articles (after all, he is not a true academic, as he reminds the reader quite often - he is a journalist) about the structure of the Chicago society, he feels he cannot count on the University authorities and feels a bit lost in the whole affair while he is in Romania.In Bucharest, he tries to be helpful to his wife, who is not permitted to see her mother dying in the hospital for the privileged (as she was both a well-established doctor and married to one, in spite of her leaving the party and being condemned and then rehabilitated, but never fully accepted by the regime, she was allowed this last favor), and summons all the diplomatic help he can get - he negotiates with the Ambassador and meets his childhood friend, Dawey Spangler, now an acclaimed political journalists, who also promises to do anything for help.Valerie's death on Christmas Eve provides an anti-climax, because it really does not provide relief, does not solve any of the trouble on either side, and although the Dean and Minna can return to Chicago, they are as disturbed as back in Romania.The novel is a slow thought-provoking read, written in dense and intelligent prose. The Dean is another impersonation of Bellow's intellectual, expressing the author's thoughts. And I can see why Bellow likes so much this type of main character (maybe aside from being close to such people in reality?). An intellectual, an academic, is a good model protagonist whose philosophizing, and constant literary associations can be excused, and who gives in exchange a background of knowledge, insightful and perturbed mind, and idealistic attitude which can be used for the best presentation of the views the author wishes to show here. The story is a tale of two cities, very different - one a place under the oppression of the dictatorial Communist system, the other the American dream not without political and social trouble of its own. And the question, which immediately comes to mind: what makes people, the core of any society, better? The freedom, or at least apparent freedom, and material well being, or the lack of it all, forcing people to stick together and help each other in any possible way, and to appreciate even the smallest bits of cultural and economical normality.In the other aspect, this novel, although clearly an attempt at objectivism from Albert's point of view, is a personal account, by definition not objective. Albert's perceptions and opinions are not ideal, his mental portraits of people, even the closest relatives, like Minna or his sister Elfrida, seem to be far from reality (he sees Minna, a professor of astronomy, as completely removed from the world, whereas she seems to be more down to earth than he is - maybe his view is blurred by love?), and his actions, although well intended and thought through, quite often miss the point.\\"Dean's December\\" is a great novel, a treatise on universal matters and a record of a fragment of our history, valuable both to American and international readers, There is nothing shallow, trivial or negligible, and nothing that could be easily forgotten of become obsolete."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"This is one of my least favorite Bellow novels. But because it is Bellow it has a lot worth reading in it. His thoughts about society and culture may not always be exactly on the mark, but they usually stimulate and inspire. In this novel the hero is a bit less sympathetic than many of his other main characters. Henderson, Herzog, Humboldt, Sammler , Augie March have vivacity and life that Dean Corde does not. The Dean's wife too falls short of Bellow's livelier and more appealing feminine creations, for instance the Ramona and Madelaine of Herzog. So too the whole spirit of the work has about it a pessimism and bleakness which contrast strongly with that of Augie March, and Henderson, and even in its way, Herzog. This book is really a winter book, and it has coldness and dying in it. And it has the oppression of the Communist Iron Curtain world in Romania, and the depression of Chicago's most beaten and desperate streets. The characters and the story seem less alive than the ideas.Again this is not one of his best. Far from it. But it is Bellow and because of that a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"... tapping this scurvy keyboard and getting myself in trouble by criticizing an American icon. Oh well, nasty work but somebody has to etc etc...The simple thing is that Saul Bellow doesn't write very well. He doesn't compose brilliant sentences. He doesn't construct tight plots or taut narratives. By simple stylistic criteria, he's no better at wordsmithing than the average purveyor of pulp fiction by the cartload. He maunders and muses self-indulgently, as if his readers would give him all the time in the world as they might a beloved grand uncle with a failing memory, in honor of his Nobel Prize. In his youthful novels about his useless self, he was charmingly crass and brash. A youthful reader could read himself comfortably into Augie March and be tolerantly self-abusive. This novel, The Dean's December, is anything but youthful. The title tells most of it. This is a weary old dude's meandering epitaph for his own energy, a novel about Death interspersed with jeremiads about a society - two societies really, America and Romania - hardly lively enough to sustain a worthwhile Life. The narrative elements include an old woman's death in a 'communist' hospital, a young man's death by murder in seedy South Chicago, the metaphorical death of the Dean's self-expectations, and the deadly friction of the Dean's relationships with the bureaucracies both of his school in Chicago and his Romanian wife's society.Somewhere in this sprawl of words there is probably a novel, or perhaps a couple of well-crafted novellas. Was Bellow too prominent by 1982 for Harper and Row to assign him an editor? And somewhere among Bellow's jabs and jibes at class warfare in Chicago and America, there are probably some pointed needles, but they are lost in the haystack."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"The dialogue and endless introspection offered in this book gets tiresome quickly. Bellow's best work came before his Nobel Prize and this is an example of his weakening powers -- when his ideas outweighed action to create tedious novels."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"The Dean's December tells the story of Albert Corde, one of Bellow's memorably depicted intellectual characters, a Chicagoan of 'pullman car' gentility, a college dean and sometime journalist, who waits for a dying mother in law in chilly Romania, behind the Iron Curtain, and also for the result of a trial of two blacks accused of murdering a white student, A trial on which he has commented.Corde is perfectly placed in his predicament for Bellow to explore the great themes that were brewing and swelling within his colossal mind at the time, some of them current and political, some of them the great eternal issues of life and existence. All are mixed in here. Corde reflects on the value of his intellectual life, surrounded by poverty and struggle in Romania, on the essence of virtue in ruthless capitalist societies where poetry and art are trampled by the one dimensional value axis of money versus poverty. Corde is a patrician intellectual, someone who escaped from the blocks fast in life, publishing an influential article on the Potsdame conference while still in his early twenties, but has stagnated along the way, in a similar manner to his precursor character Tommy Wilhelm in 'Sieze the Day'. Others, most notably the high flying political commentator Dewey Spengler have played the scales of life more practically, accepting society for what it is, eschewing old fashioned romanticism - their shared childhood reading of Shakespeare in Lincoln Park, and has played life as a political game. Corde, the philosopher, becomes trapped, and ponderous, much like Hamlet, and is denounced and outflanked by Spengler in a splendid denoument at the end of the novel.Not all of the Dean's December is sublime. There are many passages displaying Bellow's worst fault - the pretentious, intellectual name dropping - Freud, Marx, existentialism, you name it, sprayed about the pages for show. But at its best, all Bellow's intellectual influenes combine to produce great mind grabs of paragraphs, astonishing stretches of prose that capture with great perceptive, aesthetic and stylish depth just what it is to be human. There is an incident at the beginning of the book (a famous incident, much commented on by the likes of Amis, McEwan and Rushdie) where a dog in Bucharest barks out against the limits of dog experience (for God's sake, open the universe a little more!). Bellow did just that. That is why he was so great."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"Fascinating insight of a dark time in the Eastern European history- communist dictatorship seen first hand by an american"},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"In this somewhat rambling novel Saul Bellow contrasts the life in communist Romania with that in Chicago. Basically it's an indictment of much in American society. Dean Albert Corde is in Romania with his wife Minna where her mother is dying in a hospital. Bureaucratic red tape makes it impossible for Minna to visit her mother, though finally she's permitted just one visit. Meanwhile, Corde is contemplating the fallout of some controversial articles he's written for \\"Harper's\\" on Afro-Americans and the underclass. Romanian society is depicted as cold (it's no accident the story takes place in winter) and distant, while America is shown to be disorderly and confused, especially in the inner cities. Some of Bellow's observations are acute, but too much of the novel is sacrificed to the dissection of ideas by means of seemingly endless conversations. The novel almost talks itself to death despite all the pertinent analyses of public issues, from prisons to public housing, that Bellow examines. Interestingly, Corde solves his problem as Dean by resigning, but the reader wonders what will be next for him: \\"I'm quiet enough as a rule,\\" he says. \\"I don't like controversy.\\" Somehow it's hard to believe Bellow would be satisfied with that self-assessment from the hero of this novel."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"If you have not read anything by Saul Bellow, don't start with this book. It is pedantic and involves characters about whom it is difficult to care very much."},{"Title":"The Dean's December","review":"The third world and Chicago have a lot in common. Not just the inner city Chicago or America but our innermost being.This is what Mr. Bellow takes on in a sometimes remarkable way.The sometimes similar worlds of dispare and crime in Eastern Europe and Chicago meet on the soul's battle field, fighting to give people meaning to their lives.In the end what's left? The cold dark universe or the heaven where God dwell's and ulitimately must come and save us.Mr. Bellow puts a lot on your mind and not always perfect prose, he could have left the monkey and typwriter line out of this book, but a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Tropical Freeze","review":"This is Hall's second novel, Thorn's second outing. It is rich with minor characters and full of the elegant writing that marks all of his work. The book is about a scheme to smuggle into the US some very bad guys from other countries. Thorn stumbles onto it after losing one of his childhood friends who was an FBI agent working on the case.There are some really funny scenes and some beautiful snapshots of Key Largo. He brings that place alive brilliantly. It's almost as good as Under Cover of Daylight and right up there with some of the later Thorn novels, Mean High Tide and Red Sky at Night (my favorite)."},{"Title":"Tropical Freeze","review":"In this, James Hall's second novel featuring Thorn, the author expands on the one of the odder heroes of the Florida Keys. Thorn enjoys being the odd man out, anti-authority, anti-employment and a bit to out spoken for his own good. Mix this with an instinctive desire to right wrongs when they present themselves to him and you have a natural formula for trouble and good reading.This time Thorn's friend, FBI agent Gaeton Richards involves him in a very strange car deal (where the buyer tries to feed the salesman to the alligators) and then offers Thorn a job as fishing guide for Benny Cousins, a local political up and comer. Thorn declines (later he has to drop Benny in a hot tub to make his point). Benny may sound good, but he acts bad, and he is up to something more than a little fishy. Unfortunately, Gaeton, who was working undercover in the Cousins organization is exposed and suddenly disappears.Thorn is drawn into a relationship with Darcy Richards, Gaeton's sister and the local weatherwoman. The quest to find Gaeton ends grimly and Darcy and Thorn set about bringing the guilty to justice. What neither realizes is that Ozzie Hardison, a somewhat mentally deficient Florida Cracker (self-described), who has a compulsive yen for Darcy, is convinced that, if he only could kill everyone she liked, she would surely fall for him. Ozzie is a loser for sure, but he adds some deadly complications. Between Benny and Ozzie bad things are bound to happen.James Hall has a knack for pure storytelling. He paints with firm well-made strokes that make each character and every scene stand out from all the others. He uses a strong sense of humor to contrast perfectly with the grim and ugly parts. This type of story, the modern day heroic tale, is a challenge to write well. In order to make the quest for justice work the author must give away many of the plot's mysteries, hoping to draw us into the plot with suspense and ingenuity. Once again, Hall has proved himself a master of this genre."},{"Title":"Tropical Freeze","review":"There aren't many characters to root for in this story, especially the anti-social, anti-authority hero Thorn. Too typically, the characters for whom Thorn has a soft spot are murdered and his latest girlfriend is the sister of a childhood chum (she also nurses a grudge). However, to lift this novel from a lower rating, there is a clever underground railroad service that the bad guys offer to undesirables who want to disappear from their enemies. The title deserves some credit too for the double entendre applied to both a winter cold spell and the utilization of an ice cream truck"},{"Title":"Tropical Freeze","review":"I made it halfway through the book, to the point where the female character becomes more prominent, and stopped reading because I could no longer suspend disbelief. The writing of females seems to be a challenge for this author."},{"Title":"Tropical Freeze","review":"James W. Hall gives us the second novel in the mystery genre. Hall's books are Florida books and living in south Florida and being familiar with the area makes the book even better. Thorn isn't a private invesitgator, just a \\"Keys\\" guy. Everybody's friend, and he would help any of them. Gaeton Richards a boyhood friend and an FBI agent gets Thorn involved in illegal activities and Richard's sister becomes Thorn's love interest. If you like John D. MacDonald or Randy Wayne White, Hall is there too. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Tropical Freeze","review":"I like Mr. Hall's characters.

Nowhere is that better demonstrated than in the masterpieces on the walls of Italian churches and palazzos, still vibrant and alive after 400+ years -a truly amazing medium that reached it's peak in a 200 year period from 1400 - 1600. From the Alps to Sicily, some of the greatest of all frescoes are shown beautifully in this volume. You will not see better photography of these extraordinary frescoe cycles anywhere, and, although the author is new to this series(Kliemann)there is no drop off of historical and artistic insight and explanation in the editorial portion of the book. The other two volumes in this series (Early Renaissance and High Renaissance) are masterworks worthy of a museum. In exploring the later cycles, this book equals or exceeds the previous two. If you have seen any of these frescoes, you will find this book fascinating. If you long to visit Italia to see them but can't, this is as good a look as you could ever hope to have. Rich, dense, and beautiful beyond words, this is the kind of book you can spend a long long time with and treasure forever. Worth every penny and more."},{"Title":"Italian Frescoes: High Renaissance and Mannerism 1510-1600","review":"These people can do nothing wrong so far, what is really interesting about this book, is we start to see how the evolving influence of the acceptance of oil painting in Italy is starting to influence Fresco.In the prior books, the color tonality revolves around the support of the egg tempera painting paradigm fresco had been bred under, and the glow and influence of that medium, is transcended in fresco.This volume starts to show, that oil painting is taking off, and fresco is influenced, and the segway between Tempera and oil is captured with all the subtle changes as fresco evolves.We are in the carry over from the good old Botticelli days, to the \\"What is this guy Leonardo up to, days\\". How this influence migrates into fresco is very interesting and well represented.What this book really highlites well, is how Raphael, was in the middle and tried to sew it all together...as far as synthesis and integration goes. The quality of the images and text reflect this too perfection.The contrast back and forth is amazing and captured so well.A darker tonality sets in, but the highlites of still emulating tempera are preserved, so fresco is \\"keeping up with the times\\", these books are nothing short of stunning and incredible, if you study fresco, this series is a masterpiece of publishing. I have written reviews before on the other volumes, and the quality never stops coming. IT DOESNT GET BETTER...PERIOD!!!!!!You would not reget any aspect of your purchase, and the price is more than fair. Once engaged, these are hard books to break away from, you become mesmerized...it is such high quality work.Here is the best part....the book winds down at the Farnese Palace/Gallery (now the French embassy in Italy)....hopefully this is a bookmark....anticpating the next chapters which would be an early, mid, and late Baroque Fresco book series addition.These folks are great, and they have to keep going, we left at the Caracci, so hopefully we can look forward to DaCortona at the Pitti and Barberini palace, some Luca Giordono at the Medici,Carlo Marratta, (Clemency) , Pamphili Palace etc. The continuation to the eventual Baroque vs Roccoco vs Neo-Classical shoot out would be incredible to follow, with the effort to quality and integrity that the publisher, author, and photographer are committed to.I really think Venice Frescos, should be their own book, there is just too much there, just call it Italian Venice Frescoes.Keep the Baroque to Roccoco track focused in 3 volumes.This way lesser known Baroque work can be included in the Baroque volumes and we can pick up the Plethora of Venetian work in its own volume. Tiepolo and Veronese influence would fill its own book too full. What is so great about this effort is it is including great work from lesser known artists. That should keep going.These books simply cannot stop coming, and cramming the Baroque into one volume would be a mistake.Yes, this is a long review, so I apologize I am just trying to communicate enthusiam to potential buyers , so the publisher can keep going, you simply cant go wrong...and this is not a solicited nor a planted review...this is real...I have spent time in Italy...these people know exactly what they are doing, and they are doing a job that would exceed anyones expectations.And finally a very strong thank you to the publisher...a number of frescoes, which I had requested after the first books, were captured in this one, I can only hope that my reviews could contribute to the strategic direction of such great work."},{"Title":"Italian Frescoes: High Renaissance and Mannerism 1510-1600","review":"This review applies to a host of \\"Art\\" books.Dry academic writing must be the way to getting published.I am an artist and would love to see some authors writingtheir books from an artist's viewpoint.

Filled with action, the story moves right along, right up to the end."},{"Title":"Wilderness: King of the Mountain (Gunsmoke Westerns)","review":"So I came across this series in 1997 when I was in the US NAVY. I found the special edition \\"Prairie Blood\\" and the 20th book \\"Wolf Pack\\". I read them both while at sea and liked both of them. Our ships library didn't have any other titles so, I had to wait until I came home to read other books in the series. I found out that there were dozens of books in the series and being that space and money were limited, I didn't get around to reading any other ones.Now we have this new thing called \\"KINDLE\\". I kept giving excuses why I didn't need one to people who would ask if I had one. I was messing around on Amazon a few weeks back and I remembered the Wilderness series from more than a decade before. Now there are even more than I remembered, obviously. I still don't have the space for that many paper books but, at least money isn't a problem anymore. So, I checked to make sure that the first book was available in Kindle and to my delight it was. I purchased a Kindle and the first book I purchased was Wilderness #1 King of the Mountain.I started reading it with much anticipation and happiness. Right away I knew something was wrong. The transfer from paper to digital was awful. Very poor spell check and in some cases it seemed like flat out omissions of sentences maybe even paragraphs. By not having read the book before I wasn't sure. I kept going and things seemed to get better with less spelling errors and less possibilities of gaps in the story. Then you get to the very end of the epilogue and the sentence before the last one led me to believe they left something out again. Not certain but it left me wondering.So, with all my trepidations with the first book I started doing some research. I find out that after the second title, \\"YOU CANT GET THE 3RD ON YOUR KINDLE\\"!!!!! WTF! My reading of the 1st book wasn't very enjoyable. The story was great but the format sucked. I'll get to read the 2nd book if I want but then either have to buy the next several in paper back or wait and hope they become available on Kindle. Or jump ahead to the next available Kindle title. Then go back at a later date and read the ones I missed. HOW THE HELL IS ALL OF THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ENJOYABLE!!!!!No, here's what I will do. I will put the Kindle on the shelf somewhere and let it sit with my Prairie Blood and Wolf Pack titles. When Kindle, Amazon, the publishers, the spell checkers, the typers, and whoever else are making these BS decisions get their heads out of you know where, I'll come back and gladly spend my money on a decent product.Note to author David Thompson: Dude, I love the ones I have read and want to read the rest. I'm just not sure I can get this Kindle taste out of my mouth for some time. I'll be back as a reader of your work some day. Keep doing what you are doing!"},{"Title":"Wilderness: King of the Mountain (Gunsmoke Westerns)","review":"The Wilderness series by Oregon author David Thompson now includes over 60 entries. In this entry set in 1827, Nate King is just 19 years old and working as an accountant in a successful New York City firm. He hopes to marry his gorgeous girlfriend Adeline, who comes from a wealthy family and expects to live a life of ease in the future. Everything seems to be going rosy for Nate, but he senses that something is missing. A letter from his long lost uncle Zeke arrives from out of the blue; Zeke is the family black sheep who disappeared into the wilderness a decade earlier. Zeke promises Nate treasure if he meets him in St. Louis. Such treasure will allow him to marry Adeline and give her everything she desires, so Nate decides to take a great risk and venture to the wild west town of St. Louis. He's in for some big surprises.I have to admit that I was not familiar with this series until I stumbled across this one by accident and decided to give it a try. I don't typically read in this genre, but I do sometimes enjoy survival type stories. With that caveat, I thought that \\"King of the Mountain\\" was just okay. I didn't dislike it at all, but the plot was rather predictable at times, and the writing is average at best. The book quickly fell into a bland formula of Nate reflecting along the lines of...\\"during this leg of the journey, two notable things happened. First....\\" Fortunately, it was a quick read and did hold my attention. Fans of this genre will likely rate this novel at least a star higher. I may read the next entry in the series (\\"Lure of the Wild\\"), although it appears that currently, most of the older books are out of print.Note: This review is for the Kindle version of \\"King of the Mountain.\\" The transfer to digital text was somewhat sloppy here, especially in the first few chapters. There are errors every few pages, mostly spelling errors, missing punctuation, or missing words. For example, one character is called Tutttle, Tuttle, and Turtle within a few pages. These problems don't really impede the reading of the novel, though, and after the first few chapters I did notice fewer errors; however, it is dispiriting seeing such carelessness."},{"Title":"Wilderness: King of the Mountain (Gunsmoke Westerns)","review":"I have always been into serial, western novels by authors like Cormac McCarthy and Larry McMurtry.

They are like chapters not a real book. You just git into it and the book ends. I have bought 6 of his books or chapters and will not buy any more and there are about 64 in this series.

This first book in the long running series (I believe there are over 50 installments at this point) is excellent! It is very fast paced, and the action never slows.I've never understood why more Western authors don't write about the Mountain Man period. I've searched for exciting fiction covering this area, but have not found much. Now, with the discovery of the Wilderness series, I'll be busy ready for quite some time.Note: Some reviewers have claimed there are quite a few mistakes in the Kindle edition of this book. There were only a couple I came across, but they were not too distracting. Perhaps an earlier version had more before being cleaned up. For me, this book read just fine in its electronic format.The first and second books are available in Kindle format, but beyond that I have not had much luck finding the series, save for some of the newer ones.

Herbert George Beutler says he is Isaac Newton, but he knows that he is really Einstein. He adopted the guise of Newton to avoid upsetting another patient, Ernst Heinrich Ernesti, who claims he is Einstein. The third, Johann Wilhelm Mobius is himself. As a long term patient, he enjoys frequent visions of King Solomon.I had the great fortune of knowing little about the plot. I was continuously entertained by the playful unraveling of a murder mystery. I urge you to avoid learning more. The imagination of Durrenmatt is quite remarkable. He weaves an entertainingly unpredictable story.This short play warrants reading more than once, even more than twice, as the Swiss playwright Friedrich Durrenmatt not only entertains us, but explores fundamental questions regarding the role of science in modern society. The Physicists was written in 1962 when the world faced the possibility of nuclear war at any moment. The Physicists has been produced at the London Royal Court Theatre, on Broadway, and by many university theatre departments. I intend to become acquainted with the plays of Friedrich Durrenmatt."},{"Title":"The physicists","review":"I originally read this play some time ago while studying German in college and it is one of the few works from those years that has \\"stuck with me\\". In fact I still have the German language edition that I used at that time.As other reviewers have said, one of the central themes of this work is the degree of responsibility that scientists have to humanity or something called \\"the public\\". Having worked for over twenty years now as a nuclear scientist, I can definitely say that at times the desire for knowledge can override the consideration of all the possible uses of a given technology. The question them becomes, can an idea be \\"unthought\\"? This secondary theme of the book is intertwined with the theory of the inevitability of ideas at a given time and place.The translation by Kirkup is quite good as compared to the original German version that I have. Though the expository style (some very long dialogs) may be a bit daunting at times, stick with it. This play is a philosophical discussion, not a Hollywood action film."},{"Title":"The physicists","review":"Durrenmatt's play provides an excellent and thought-provoking critique on the role of modern science and technology in human affairs. Is science responsible to humanity? If we deem specific knowledge &quot;harmful&quot;, how can we hope to prevent its discovery? If the knowledge does exist, how do we prevent its misuse? This is a play that is incredibly relevant in an age plagued with similar issues in genetic engineering and cloning. I'd highly recommend the German translation."},{"Title":"The physicists","review":"Without giving away too much:Its's the story of a Physicist that is seeking refuge in a insane assylum to protect himself and the 'formula' he found. This formula may change the world as we know it. HE is trapped with two spies that try to get the formula. All of them pretend to be famous physicists. Then a nurse is murdered ...A classical drama. Everything happens in one room in the insane asylum. It is easy to get confused by the different characters. Every 'Physicist' has three identities: 'real' (spy, physicist), 'pretended' (announced in public, famous physicist), 'pretended in privat' (other famous physicist, pretended in private conversations). It's nice to have seen the play first.If you know german: read the original (Die Physiker).Durrenmatt is not well known outside of Switzerland/Germany/Austria. A great author. If you are looking for something easier, try 'Der Richter und sein Henker' (The judge and his executioner?) or 'Der Verdacht' (The suspision?). Too bad that neither book is available here. Available here: 'The Assignement'. Easier to read than 'The Physicists' but not as good.To get the ultimate: 'Achterloo'. One of the best plays I have ever seen but was allways afraid to read. Again: An insane asylum. But this time it is populated with different historical personalities (Cardinal Richelieu (sp?), General Jaruselzki, Napoleon ...). Great dialogs!"},{"Title":"The physicists","review":"The Physicists (1962) is difficult to categorize, a conglomeration of conflicting theater genres -mystery, melodrama, farce, morality play. There is an admitted affinity between the theater of Swiss playwright Durrenmatt and the theater of Brecht but Durrenmatt was very much his own man.A common vein runs through much of Durrenmatt's work: to expose hypocrisy, the twistings and turnings that otherwise respectable people go through to justify self-interest in supposedly \`moral' terms. This preoccupation is seen clearly in his best known play, The Visit (1956), which premiered in New York with America's foremost acting couple, Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontaine, playing the leads: an elderly woman returns to her hometown and offers fabulous wealth to the town's inhabitants on one condition: that they execute the lover who abandoned her years before, though he is guilty of no offense but having spurned her. It shows also in Durrenmatt's philosophical detective stories, The Judge and His Hangman (1952) and The Pledge (1958), in both of which detecting takes second place to musings on the human condition, and in particular our tendency to pursue self-aggrandizement to the detriment of moral obligation.The Physicists is considered a modern classic in German-speaking countries. Three madmen, all physicists -Sir Isaac Newton, Alfred Einstein and a nonentity named Mobius--inhabit a special wing of a Swiss hospital for the insane. Its proprietor is a hunchbacked psychiatrist, the last of a long line of distinguished but utterly mad financiers and military men. The police have been called in for the second time in two months: one of the physicists (Einstein) has just murdered his nurse. The inspector arrives. The mad man who calls himself Newton sits down with the inspector and tells him in confidence that he's really not Newton, he's Einstein but he doesn't want to make his true identity public because it would upset the other madman who says he's Einstein -and that man is truly insane. Another madman, Mobius emerges from his room and announces in stentorian tones that King Solomon has just appeared to him in all his glory. When Mobius's wife confronts him to tell she's divorced him and married a Bible-thumping missionary who is now going to take her off to the Marianas, it doesn't faze Mobius. When his nurse falls for him, Mobius cautions her that it is too dangerous for her to love him and then suffocates her. Things become more and more complicated. And more. More.There are many comic moments in the play but The Physicists is a serious play about a very serious topic: mutually assured destruction (MAD), and the role scientists played in making MAD possible in the 1950s and early 1960s. Nuclear proliferation was a major issue then: it was, after all, the era of the Cuban missile crisis and the Iron Curtain. But has the urgency of this issue faded with the decades? A quick look at today's world --Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, the threat of pocket bombs-- suggests not. The strengths of the play are its idiosyncratic characters, the plentiful twists and turns of its plot, and hidden puns sprinkled throughout the play: the sanatorium, for instance, is located in Les Cerisiers, French for \`cherry orchard' a la Chekhov's great play. And the Mobius of the play? Is he an echo of the Mobius who invented the Mobius strip, a two dimensional-strip that doubles back on itself, joining opposite sides of a sheet of paper together in one flat but twisty plane, so that both sides are now really one side? That would certainly be a fitting choice for a play that constantly veers from reality to fantasy and back again.The Physicists makes you laugh but it also makes you think. Which is not a bad combination for one play!"},{"Title":"The physicists","review":"Friedrich Duerrenmatt appended \\"21 Points to THE PHYSICISTS,\\" and in Point 14 he insisted that, \\"A drama about physicists must be paradoxical.\\" His next point stated that, \\"It cannot have as its goal the content of physics but its effect.\\" Duerrenmatt's 1962 play (which was translated into English from the original German in 1963 and then appeared on Broadway) succeeds most memorably by adhering to these two points (and his other nineteen which are printed in this edition as well).THE PHYSICISTS features three characters who make claims to being the famed physicists Newton, Einstein and Moebius. These three toddle into the action as unpredictably as individual gas molecules move in a heated, sealed container as the play utilizes bizarre happenings in an old section of a sanitarium to examine the potential destructive power of physics (and by extension, all branches of science) and the moral and ethical dilemmas arising from that. Plot twists and turns abound as the main characters -- and some minor ones -- change like chameleons and the contexual frame of reference is turned repeatedly on its head.THE PHYSICISTS will soon reach the half-century mark, but its themes continue to be relevant as twenty-first century scientists and the public at large confront an ever widening arena of scientific \\"advances\\" that could conceivably unleash immense, even catastrophic, repercussions. As Duerrenmatt says in Point 19, \\"Within the paradoxical appears reality.\\" Within the play, one can see truths for our times.Anyone who has seen or read the more recent plays COPENHAGEN or PROOF will probably find THE PHYSICISTS a great read."},{"Title":"The physicists","review":"I read this on the recommendation of a German friend (who, of course, read the original, not the translation). I'm not quite sure what to make of it--I feel like, in production, the switch in tone from rather larkily written \\"does love overwhelm even madmen?\\" farce to serious commentary on the responsibility of scientists in a commercial, WMD-manufacturing world (and the ego it takes to believe you can control knowledge and its use) could feel more like a nuanced punchline, a clever bait-and-switch, than it does on paper. On paper, it feels disorienting. Reading it over a second or third time might help me uncover more thematic links and foreshadowing to tie the two halves together, but a first readthrough left me feeling that I had read a piece that had ambitions it didn't manage to achieve."},{"Title":"The physicists","review":"I purchased this as part of a class I was taking in graduate school.The play is short and interesting.

It is excellently illustrated with many contemporary photographs.From the Preface -\\"The story of the Midland compounds, extending over nearly sixty years of British railway history, is not merely one of a single locomotive class, or groups of classes. In its origin, its development, its vicissitudes, and its triumph the Midland compound was, from the very outset, closely linked with other designs. It was involved probably in more competitive trials with very dissimilar engines than any other class, and in the story of these trials can be traced many of the principal trends in British locomotive practice. The compound principle, the introduction of superheating, the development of a more scientific approach to valve gear design, each in their turn received an important fillip from work centred upon the Midland compounds, while after the grouping of 1923 they formed for a time the focal point of the great controversy that raged over L.M.S.R. locomotive policy as a whole.\\"The Contents are -P009: PrefaceP011: The Origin of the Smith Compound SystemP018: The Midland Smith-Johnson CompoundsP034: The Deely CompoundsP049: Comparisons and Tests: The Introduction of SuperheatingP062: L.M.S.R. and the First Leeds-Carlisle TrialsP076: Dynamometer Trials, Settle & Carlisle Line, 1924-25P089: The Preston-Carlisle Trials of 1925: Larger Compounds: Oil FiringP100: L.M.S.

It writes of Jewish women of great distinction in short yet clear autobiographical sketches. It however diminishes its own value but including a too large number of present- day celebrities and lightweight figures. It too displays a certain political bias and there are a number of very left- wing politicians here whose contribution to Jewish life is extremely questionable. I also would have like to have seen many more of the great Jewish women intellectual figures, and heroines like Avital Sharansky , Ida Nudel and others who risked their lives for the Jewish people. A very large share of the entries are of people who have no real positive connection with Jewish communal life, and who just happen to be born Jewish something a few of them are not so happy about.There is much good stuff here.But a work of this kind could have been done with far greater emphasis on real Jewish values."},{"Title":"Great Jewish Women","review":"While there are some genuinely great Jewish women in this book, there are too many whose claim to greatness rests solely on fame and left-leaning politics.

But the combination makes for a terrific read."},{"Title":"Balance at Middlefork: An Adventure in Human Freedom","review":"Currently, I am only about halfway through &quot;Balance at Middlefork&quot;, but when I saw the absurdity of some of the reviews posted here I had to cut to the chase and give a pre-review review. I will be giving a more extensive review as soon as I have completed the book.Jeremy Dorosin's book thus far has been a gentle handling of philosophical topics that are usually given to the public in indigestible forms. His analysis of these topics is shuffled in with a narrative that is surprisingly gripping for its limited setting. These are the two aspects of his writing that I'd like to critique individually.First, the story telling:Well-crafted, easy to read. So far there is really no plot to speak of except &quot;Two guys go on camping trip&quot;, so if you're looking for drama and intreague, this probably isn't the book for you. However, the characters are presented realistically and the dialogue is believable. The inward journey undertaken by the author is rich and has its share of pitfalls. I was especially impressed at the author's honesty regarding his own personality flaws. In direct contrast to a previous review which marked Dorosin as an egomaniac, and another with &quot;serious psychiatric issues&quot;, there is a dialogue in the book in which the author humbly and intelligently addresses his own issues with dominance and control.Second, the Philosophy:As a student of philosophy myself, I have to say that I've yet to come across anything particularly mind-blowing. Then again, I'm just getting into the book. Most likely that the author is &quot;warming up&quot;, attempting to acquaint the reader with concepts that might be unfamiliar, and setting the stage for ideas to come. I will have to wait for the next review to really get into this aspect. For now my only disappointment is that he has not mentioned my personal favorites of philosophy. Where are the anti-philosophers? Where are Wittgenstein, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche? Where is Spinoza for the love of Pete!? I am eager to see if any of these fellows come up, and what role their ideas might play in the author's handling of east and west.More important at this stage of the book is how the author presents his concepts to the lay public, and in this respect I believe he both fails and succeeds. His failures, I think, are subtle and sparse. Now and then I have found a premise that should have been analyzed rather than presupposed. I have also noticed a tendency to rely on jargon in drawing and expounding a conclusion, though this should hardly be enough to completely baffle an intelligent reader. Despite the abruptness of division between analysis and narrative, the author succeeds magnificently in incorporating his concepts into those examples that he does give and the arguments he does unfold. Even more impressive is the way in which he blends his ideas into the narrative and dialog that is woven around the outskirts of the analysis itself.Balance at Middlefork has thus far kept my interest and above all has provoked a good deal of thought."},{"Title":"Balance at Middlefork: An Adventure in Human Freedom","review":"...You MUST READ THIS BOOK! Through a touching, compelling story about a trip to Yosemite, the Author weaves his past, present and future into a tool of philosophy, a continuation of Pirsigs ideas and some new insights you can apply to your own life.

Principles are at stake here, and Dorosin won't let you forget it. Anybody acquainted with Pirsag's, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, will find Balance at Middlefork an interesting read."},{"Title":"Blackbeard's Cup and Stories of The Outer Banks","review":"I found this selection of stories compiled and penned by Charles Harry Whedbee in this book entitled \`Blackbeard's Cup and Stories of the Outer Banks' to be remarkable. They are short, but well written mysteries, anecdotes and tales about a facinating region of the country called the Outer Banks. This book is more than just another collection of stories about a region of the country, the author actually conveys some personal experiences in living in the region that merit some attention. I found the entire collection to be quite enjoyable, but particularly the stories entitled: \`The Guns of Vandemere', \`Sir William Shakespeare's Wreck' and most of all \`Horace and the Coinjock Charade'. This last one about a mule named Horace literally had me laughing out loud, and was worth the entire book above all! You will enjoy this author's unique insight to the particular's about the region, as well as his attention to detail on the facts that really matter in telling a good story. I have read many collections of stories about North Carolina, particularly because I have a personal facination with the region, especially the Outer Banks, but this this collection is one of the better ones. This book also gives some intriguing history on the pirate Blackbeard. If you are looking to read a few good tales about this region, then this book would be a good one for you to start with as all of the stories are quite entertaining. This author has written five collections of North Carolina stories in all, so if you find you like this one, there are more to explore. Whedbee spins a great tale!"},{"Title":"Blackbeard's Cup and Stories of The Outer Banks","review":"I have loved the Outer Banks of North Carolina for some time now.Charles Harry Whedbee gives a well written account of some of the mysteries and legends surrounding the area in this, and all, his books.Basically, this book is just a collection of stories he has recovered from local people.I wish he still lived so he could share more of his love of North Carolina with fans."},{"Title":"Blackbeard's Cup and Stories of The Outer Banks","review":"Charles H.

(Weaver was introduced in Liss's A Conspiracy of Paper.) This sequel is immediately compelling -- Weaver is on trial for murder and found guilty, but as he's being led to gaol, a weeping woman he's never seen passes him the tools for escape. He doesn't know who framed him *or* who is trying to save him, but he has the skills and the motivation to find out. He just needs to escape first. The reader doesn't doubt for a second that he will, but enjoys nonetheless his style. This is a fun read, fast-paced if occasionally bogged down in British politics of a certain age. There are no remarkable twists, but this is a solid historical whodunit by a fine writer.If you've enjoyed Liss's other work, enjoy historical mysteries, are interested in the history of British politics, or if you enjoy dense character-driven fiction, I would recommend this book to you.I can't wait to learn what Liss will write about next."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"\\"A Spectacle of Corruption'\\" is the story of a 18th Century Londoner who is accused, tried, and sentenced to death for a murder he didn't commit. On his way to jail a mysterious young woman slips a lockpick into his hand. Within hours, Benjamin Weaver has used the pick to break out of Newgate, one of England's most infamous prisons where he vowed to hunt down the actual killer. While conducting his search for the killer, Weaver, a Jew, disguises himself as a wealthy tobacco trader from jamaica. We learn early on in this seamy mix of characters and plots of London's politians, high society, and its desperate lower classes in symbiotic relatonships. The arch villain of the piece, Dennis Dogmill, is a likely suspect to have done the deed. The build up of suspense for this on-the-edge-of-of-your-seat thriller is set in the vicious and rowdy political battle and the fired up rage of the populace led by cynical provocateurs. Still, another plot involves Weaver's love for a woman who has deserted him for an allegedly wealthy, politician of the gentile persuasuion.Historical fiction is at its best when writers invite the reader to feel the setting, to see the costumes of princes and paupers. In this case, it's possible that no one ever described the sounds, the smells, the sights, the nastiness of a rat gnawing on a dead dog in a garbage-filled alley better than David Liss. Move over Charles Dickens.Reading \\"A Spectacle of Corruption\\" one is struck by the similarities of two cultures three hundred years apart. Very little that is told about the battle of Tories and Whigs in historical London could not have happened in most American cities between our two major political parties. Author Liss's often profound observations from the following passage could have been written to describe American rowdies at recent political rallies and meetings:\\"Why would they do such a thing? It is because they are Whigs in their hearts? I don't think so. They could proably not tell you the difference between a Whig or a Tory to save their lives -- or for a pot of ale, whichever they value more. For them -- even for most electors -- it is all a kind of elaborate theater, a specatacle . . . This election is but a spectacle of corruption and you cannot be surprised that men like Hertcomb are willing to turn the Parliament into yet another stage. Meanwhile, politics becomes a sordid game . . . and the kingdom becomes more wretched for it.\\"\\"A Spectacle of Corruption\\" is a violent book, but how could it not be as it is rooted in murder and finding the killer(s), but author Liss also has the skill to present tenderness as Benjamin Weaver thinks of his lost lady: \\"But that promise was gone. I had long understood this, but I now came to believe it. And though I knew I might proceed with other matters -- those of the heart and otherwise -- there was a sadness in my acceptance, a sadness that was perhaps even more profund than the sadness of loss I had felt every day when I lived in inconsolable longing.\\"In addition to his agility with the varying elements of complicated plots, David Liss also excels at character-development, in every case his characters are fleshed out and made credible by his sensitive presentation of their motives and life histories. His description of people are no less deft, e.g., \\"We visited the shop of one Mr. Blacksmith, an apothecary. He was in his fifties, perhaps, and had weathered his years not so well as he might have liked.\\" Yet another notable feature of this author's writerly skill is his imaginative use of language, metaphors that cause us to see the world and its peoples in a different way. Without being cumbersome, he's mastered the ability to add nuances in sentences and vocabulary that cause the reader to step back in time.For those readers who also like history, this is a must read for you; for those who are also interestd in politics, move David Liss's book, \\"A Spectacle of Corruption,\\" to the top of the stack on your nightstand."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"A Spectacle of Corruption is a rare wonder of a book that educates, entertains, and tugs the heartstrings. Set in 1722 London against the backdrop of the first general election since the crowning of George I, this is the second installment of the story of Benjamin Weaver, Jewish ex-pugilist private investigator. David Liss is a master of characterization, creating complicated, compelling protagonists, and Weaver is no exception with his appealing combination of daring, determination, dry humor, and (mostly) controlled violence. Weaver's history allows him to move within many levels of London's society, but he fully belongs to none of them, and this loneliness underscores the story and the series. In this book, Weaver is accused and convicted of murder, and must uncover the true events of the crime in order to exonerate himself. As Weaver navigates the chaos and corruption surrounding the political process the reader is educated as well, and David Liss's deft wording alludes to similarities with the present without ever disrupting the flow of the narrative or taking the reader out of the world he has created. A Spectacle of Corruption had me on the edge of my seat and laughing out loud, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"Fresh from his earlier foray into the British stock market of the early 18th century in \\"A Conspiracy of Paper,\\" Jewish \\"thieftaker\\" and onetime boxer Benjamin Weaver finds himself falsely convicted of murder in \\"A Spectacle of Corruption.\\"After escaping from an infamous prison, Weaver, cleverly disguised as a wealthy tobacco grower, delves into the high-stakes world of parliamentary electioneering in a quest to clear his name, as unsolved murders pile up around him.Weaver leads us through \\"a spectacle of corruption\\" so sweeping that even the king himself may be in jeopardy.This tale is not the lightest read, thanks to the intricacies of the era's politics. Yet Weaver's tough-but-principled persona, his keen sense of humor and the novel's believable period feel make this a rewarding excursion into an earlier time.Well-crafted, with a fine ear for convincing dialogue and a wonderfully diverse cast of characters, \\"A Spectacle of Corruption\\" reminds us that politics once was an even dirtier business than it is today. Or at least more blatantly so.This is historical fiction at its best. Any fan of the genre who has yet to discover David Liss should correct that deficiency ASAP. I would recommend starting out with \\"A Conspiracy of Paper,\\" which first introduces readers to Weaver, who returns as the protagonist in \\"A Spectacle of Corruption.\\""},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"I loved this book, it was so...exciting, interesting, clever, relevant and laugh out loud funny! In fact I almost choked a few times I laughed so hard.This is the second installment of the fictional memoir from the life and times of Benjamin Weaver. I recommend reading his accounts in the order they are presented; A Conspiracy of Paper, A Spectacle of Corruption.Weaver is a charming, handsome, capable man of action and former pugilist who makes an honest living as a thief-taker, debt-collector and sometimes body guard. In this adventure Weaver has been found guilty of murder and sentenced to hang to death. He is innocent of the crime and determined to find out who framed him and why.The backdrop to his story is London circa 1722 on the eve of the first Parliamentary election since King George took the throne. Thief-Taker General Jonathan Wild plays a part in this story and there are references to Jack Sheppard the notorious thief who escaped prison four times. (Another good book featuring Wild and Sheppard is 'The Thief Taker: Memoirs of a Bow Street Runner' by T. F. Banks.)The corruption and greed of the day is intricately woven into Weaver's story. A love interest and past heart break also play a part in this account and I think the story is all the richer for it.So much of the historical politics in this book mirror our politics today. I'm always so surprised by the fact that so many things have remained unchanged even after hundreds of years...Greed and the lust for power are still such powerful motivators.Did I already say that I love Ben Weaver? Did I mention before that I hope this becomes a series? Well I do. And the end of this book certainly feels like it will be.If any of you know for sure if there will be another story from Ben Weaver please let me know with a comment.Mr. Liss you should be busy writing right NOW! :0)P.S.I just found out that Ben Weaver has another story to tell us.It's called 'The Devil's Company' and will be out in July!The Devil's Company: A NovelI can't wait to read it!"},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"And it's in 1722. Thank goodness we got a sequel to the wonderful \\"A Conspiracy of Paper\\". It has been awhile that we've had to wait, and I for one was very happy to see the return of Benjamin Weaver. This is gritty historical fiction that touches on the thriller genre. And we learn a lot about 18 century politics in England as well. What I really like about Liss's writing is that he places his readers right in the centre of his books, and in the middle of the action. This book starts with Benjamin being sentenced to hang for murder. He hardly knew the victim, and he desperately needs to find out who wants to frame him and why. So he attempts and succeeds to breakout out of Newgate prison. The book has him pursuing his investigation to try to save himself under various disguises.

I was a bit lazy while reading A Conspiracy of Paper so I don't remember all the details, but I'm able to pick back up 4 years later quite nicely.

I kept wanting to come back for more. Highly recommend this fast paced book."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"this writer really has done the right research to present the world at the time and the place as accurately as he can. The characters are so well developed!"},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"When I had read A Conspiracy of Paper earlier this year, I knew that I had to find the next book that featured Benjamin Weaver, a sometimes thieftaker and finder of things in eighteenth century London. Filled with evocative prose, exciting action, and interesting questions, it had been a novel that I had really enjoyed, and I was looking forward to finding more by author David Liss.Some time has passed since the close of A Conspiracy of Paper. And at the moment, Benjamin Weaver is in a great deal of trouble, and very serious trouble it is too. He's been brought before Judge Rowley, and sentenced to hang for the murder of a dockside worker, Walter Yate. Weaver and his family and friends know that he's innocent, and even his most stalwart enemy, fellow thieftaker Jonathan Wild, has testified that he's innocent. But Rowley, it seems, is determined that he hang, and as Weaver is led away to Newgate prison, a weeping woman who claims to be Weaver's wife embraces him, and presses something into his hands -- a file and a lock pick.So begins an adventure of false indentites, gang violence, political mayhem and some very strange alliances. Several characters from the previous book have returned, including Benjamin's friend, Elias Gordon, a would-be playwright and surgeon, and the fate of Miriam Mendes, Benjamin's love and the one who turned down his marriage proposal. There's Jonathan Wild and his gang of ne'er-do-wells, and some new characters as well.After a bold escape, Weaver finds himself having to switch his identity to find the mastermind who wanted him dead, and enters the hotbed of Georgian politics, where the Whigs and Tories are battling it out --literally! -- to see who will be in control of the government as a new parliament is called. By creating a new persona for himself, Weaver is able to enter the aristocratic circles where politics are decided, and men with money buy influence.Three of those men Weaver is going to get to know very well -- Griffin Melbury, Mr. Hertcomb, and Dennis Dogmill, who along with his delectable sister Grace, will be the most dangerous people that Weaver has ever come across. Indeed, compared to the gangs who are looking for him, for all of their fine clothing and surroundings, they are just as bloodthirsty and rapacious.To make things even more tricky for our hero, he also is drawn into a plot concerning 'the King across the water,' the would-be King James III of England, the Stuart Pretender to the throne, and his fiercely loyal allies.I have to say, the pace and style of writing in this one was top-notch. There are plenty of action sequences, period details, some biting commentary on our own political system today, and several heartbreaking sequences when Weaver encounters his beloved Miriam again.There is however a caveat here for sensitive readers -- for entertainment, the Georgians were very fond of seeing animals fight for blood. The extremely cruel amusements of goose-pulling and cock-fighting and dog-fighting are shown. While not gorily graphic, they are rather intense, and very unpleasant to read about. The general despair of life for the poor and working classes are shown as well -- there are alcoholics lost in gin, prostitutes, sponging houses and a host of problems that we can recognize today.For anyone who is looking for a historical novel to really enjoy, I can't recommend David Liss's novels highly enough. The plots are intricate but also logical, the characters never dull, and plenty of action and derring-do involved. The stories have relevance to today's issues, and I have to say that Benjamin Weaver is a hero that can be cheered for, even if he does have some rather murky sides to his character and morals.This was a novel that kept me up well past my bedtime in determination to find out what happened next, and I can only hope that Mr. Liss will continue to write more about Benjamin Weaver. In addition to the story itself, there is a glossary of terms, a timeline, and at the end, an interview with David Liss by Tammar Stein and a collection of questions for readers' groups.Five stars overall, highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"Benjamin Weaver, the Jewish boxer who first appeared in A Conspiracy of Paper, appears again here.A Spectacle of Corruption takes place in 1722: an election year. Although not all citizens have the franchize (vote), everyone is in an uproar. In the middle of the tug between Tories and Whigs, Benjamin Weaver is arrested for the death of a man he did not murder. Escaping from Newgate Prison, Weaver goes into hiding as a footman and then as a society gentleman just back from the West Indies. His goal is to find out who wants to see him hang, and who is so eager to see him live. He is still recovering from the loss of his lady-love Miriam, who converted to Christianty to marry a high-profile man in government.Weaver is a little bit more cynical in this book, and more susceptible to the opinions of society. Miriam has become not so much an object of Weaver's love as something that must be possessed. However, this book is an excellent follow-up to A Conspiracy of Paper, filled with tension and excitement. It is a must-read for any historical fiction buff."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"although Liss's \\"The Coffee Trader\\" was a terrific read, it is refreshing to catch up on the events of Ben Weaver, master thieftaker and pugilist.

He proves to be unprecedented in this art of presenting innovative historical fiction. My only complaint is that the first novel seems to be the tightest of them all, as this one feels the slightest bit rough in the beginning getting started. However, once it begins you cannot put it down, and it is a terrific read. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"Meet Benjamin Weaver, collector of debts and theft recovery. He is a tough PI whose action and investigative methods that rival Sam Spade and Sherlock Holmes. (Though Holmes is smarter, Weaver takes more risks and chases more women.) Set in the early 1720's, Weaver is hired to investigate the murder of a porter (dock worker). This leads to him being framed for murder. After a daring and somewhat humorous escape, Weaver attempts to clear his name of wrong doing, which takes him into the world of shady politicians and brutal thugs. But, Weaver is a resourceful character, with his clever language and pugilist skills. Like an old country James Bond, he is quick thinking, charismatic with the ladies and quick to use force where necessary. Writer Liss does a great job of describing the times of early London and entertains with Weaver's cunning and antics. Michael Page does an awesome job of reading for the audiobook. I look forward to more books by Mr. Liss."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"David Liss, author of the Edgar award winning, A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER, has once again penned a compelling yet authentic mystery that takes place in 18th century London. Benjamin Weaver is a private investigator who finds himself convicted of murder and sentenced to be hung after a man is discovered dead at the site of a bar fight. Weaver was investigating a threatening letter sent to a priest when he was apparently at the wrong place and time. He is, of course, innocent yet is sent to the gallows by a corrupt judge. As he is heading to the prison, a mysterious woman passes a lockpick to him and Weaver manages to escape. Given that he is sentenced to hang, he must discover who framed him and why in order to clear his name. His search for answers leads him into the convoluted web of British parliamentary politics in which the election is termed 'the spectacle of corruption'. He must use every ounce of his cunning to discover the truth and save his own life.With the SPECTACLE OF CORRUPTION, David Liss has managed to create a complex yet compelling historical mystery. Characters are realistic creations but the problem is there are so many minor ones that, at times, it may be hard to keep track of who is who. However, the main characters are original and memorable. The plot with a bit too much complexity tends to meander and there's a certain lack of focus. Weaver appears to travel around and around in circles trying to get answers. This is not a fast read in any sense of the word. However it is all encompassing and so well written that the casual reader would find the time well worth spent."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"Don't get me wrong -- this is a very good book -- better than 95 percent of what's published as popular fiction. But it's not up to the standards set by &quot;A Conspiracy of Paper&quot;, the first book in this series. Spectacle is an exciting book, but there are various loose-ends that are never tied up, and the some of the characters' behaviors seem contrived.Well worth a read, but if you had to choose one Liss book for your stay on a desert island, I recommend Conspiracy, not Spectable."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"\\"A Spectacle of Corruption\\" gets off to a rocket-fast roller-coaster start: the reader is dropped into a trial in which the 18th-century British narrator and private investigator Benjamin Weaver has been falsely accused of murder. Within pages, he is convicted to hang, handed a lockpick by a beguiling female bystander, and escapes, naked and freezing, from England's toughest prison.Ingeniously, Weaver contrives to \\"hide in plain sight\\" disguised as a wealthy landowner from the Caribbean, while he works out who framed him.Then things, sadly, bog down a bit, as the answer to his inquiry has to do with 18th-century British political rivalries, which takes many dozens and dozens of pages to explain. Do you find modern party politics fascinating? No? Then probably you will not like the 18th-century version much better.This slows down the narrative to a snail's pace in parts, and may not interest the more thrill-seeking of Mr. Liss' readership. (I actually rather liked it but then I am a history buff.) In general, though, although Mr. Liss never fully recaptures the vigor of the first few scenes, he delivers interesting characters and an out-of-the-ordinary plot with an authentic colonial-era atmosphere and details."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"This is historical thriller writing at its finest folks. Having read 3 of David Liss's novels, I am convinced that the author is one of the best fiction writers out there. \\"A Spectacle of Corruption\\" is a thrilling ride through the labyrinthine streets of Georgian London and an inside glimpse at the corruptible, Parliamentarian elections of the time. Liss's research is excellent, and he details the period and place with graceful style and insight.One of Liss's strongest writing abilities is to come up with interesting and idiosyncratic characters. Benjamin Weaver is a superb protagonist that displays a conscience as well as vices. The numerous other characters that appear in the novel are also deserving of the readers attention--each character attaches him/herself to the audience in some way or the other.There is plenty more to be said about the genius that is Liss's writing, but I do not want to be long-winded. If you are a fan of mystery, thrillers, historical fiction, or a great story, read \\"A Spectacle of Corruption\\".--Nolan, B.A. in History"},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"This second of a trilogy was as exciting and interesting as Liss' first novel where Benjamin Weaver's adventure began.

I really like the way London 300 years ago comes to life, and the feeling of authenticity Liss' style of writing brings. And, most important for any mystery, the plot makes sense.

I studied European history in college and love historical fiction set in the eighteenth century. However the plot never really grabbed me, the characters behaved like cartoons rather than real people, and I gave up just over half-way. I cannot recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"A Conspiracy of Paper, a story about the South Sea Bubble and the adventures of a Jewish boxer named Benjamin Weaver caught a lot of readers by surprise. The author, David Liss, nailed the historical detail and came up with a great plot, and an engaging sense of characters. Liss really carved out a category for himself with that book.A Spectacle of Corruption is the sequel, and it is quite good. Whereas the first book was a 5 star to me, this one is a strong 4, mostly because the newness of the idea in the first did not carry over to the second book.In this book, Weaver has to impersonate a wealthy Jamaican land owner in order to suss out a deep corruption. Of course, it doesn't help his effort that he has been framed for murder, and only recently escaped. Moreover, his investigations will require him to befriend the man who married the woman Weaver desired more than any other. Liss handles this tension a bit less adroitly than he might, and there is a bit too much melodrama in this element of the plot. However, his knowledge of the period, and his ability to describe it in detail is as strong as ever. You'll learn quite a bit about Papist plots, 18th century electioneering, and alehouses as you make your way through this fine work.I did not care for one of his books settled in contemporary times, but his historical novels are all top drawer."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"This book is very entertaining. I like books that do throw in some historical points so that it doesn't seem like you are reading just for pure entertainment. I did find myself staying up a bit too late to see what happened next, because it did keep me guessing - although I pretty much figured out the big \\"twist\\" at the end right at the beginning - it was fun to see what would happen next along the way. The colorful inventive swearing (and I do not typically like swearing) made me laugh out loud a few times. Not quite as good as A Conspiracy of Paper, and a little bit better than The Coffee Trader, which I do recommend if you like Liss's books."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"I liked it but wanted to like a whole lot more.

Thank God and our founders that we have a secret vote or it would only be worse.2) The book was full of such good humor and cleverness that I can't help but reward Liss with 4 stars.3) The very thing I liked least about the book: that Weaver did not seem to have as much control over his destiny as in the other two, and that the pace and sense of urgency were also not there, can be attributed to the fact that Weaver was indeed not in control of his destiny. This is one of the most elegant passages I've read in a long time:\\"It is in general and odd thing to reach some measure of fame and see one's name bandied about in the newspapers. It is quite another to see oneself turned into a chess piece in a political match. I should call myself a pawn, but I feel that does some disservice to the the obliqueness of my movements. I was a bishop, perhaps, sliding at odd angles, or a knight, jumping from one spot to another. I did not much like the feel of unseen fingers pinching me as I was moved from this square to that.\\"4) And finally, Liss has captured the highs and lows, the jealousies, and the agony of unrequited love as well as anyone I've read lately.Well done, Mr. Liss.

Liss lavishly paints the portrait of the times. The characters are vibrant in their specificity. The reader will feel right at home in this world, recognizing certain types that are still at it today in our political arena.However, the plot suffers a bit as the mystery unfolds somewhat early, only leaving the details to be colored in. There are precious few twists and even fewer turns.Still, the character of Ben Weaver continues to entertain, and he ably carries this book on his brawny shoulders.A reader who had not first read CORRUPTION OF PAPER might be at a disadvantage in starting with this, the second in the series.

Desperation and privilege are equally to blame. This Liss focuses on an early 18th century election in England that certainly does seem to have been a spectacle of chaos and corruption. Liss creates complex characters who are governed by and torn between loyalties, greed, survival, affection, personal conviction, ignorance, conditioning, faith, addiction, biology, intrigue, mission, fear, impulse... all of those influences that to one degree or another direct our actions and can lead one down a path of perpetual damage control and even render one unacceptable to oneself.

If you read the first Weaver novel \\"A Conspiracy of Paper\\" then some of your favorite characters are back the always reliable but over indulgent Elias and the lovely Miriam.Liss focuses this novel on politics of 18th century London. Many comment on how the narrative gets bogged down due to the author explaining the differences between Whigs and Tories but I did not find it to be the case. Explanations are not overly intricate and keep the story going. The mystery is fun and intriguing.Weaver is one of my favorite literary characters.

I will take a small amount of space to expound on what I am so enjoying about David Liss and his historical novels.A Spectacle of Corruption: A Novel is the third Liss Novel I've enjoyed (The Whiskey Rebels and The Conspiracy of Paper were tremendous!) and, I must say, Liss is a master at \\"fleshing out\\" his characters and drawing the reader into the historical period he is writing about.Liss has a knack for grabbing the reader's attention within the first few pages of his books and, at least for me, immediately getting to that \\"sweet spot\\" of writing where the audience actually cares about the characters they read about. Having been introduced to our hero, Benjamin Weaver, in The Conspiracy of Paper; Liss seems to relish in deepening our understanding and our relationship with Weaver. We know that he is driven by a sense of moral right and wrong (as we all are) and he walks the fine line between the traditions of his Jewish heritage and the Christian society he is a part of. (Like I said, deep-rich characters)Elias Gordon, whom is \\"Watson\\" to Weaver's \\"Sherlock,\\" returns as the dutiful friend. Their interactions, be it talking at a pub, formulating plans, arguing theories, richly underscores the novel. I had a \\"reminicient feeling\\" like I was hanging out with old friends.Liss is also beyond reproach in immersing his readers into the world in which he is writing. Simple details about the settings (drinking a \\"dish of chocolate\\") abound throughout the book, without being overpowering. It is masterful the way he can incoroporate such detail to help the reader imagine life hundreds of years ago without falling into the \\"Reading a History Book\\" trap.Suffice to say, I was (once again), very pleased with my selection of a David Liss novel. He is an excellend and fun author that has continued to make reading fun for me."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"I am tempted to say that the convolutions that the book undergoes is almost not necessary to be a good read. But those twists and turns make it complex and a much better read because of them. We open at the trial for murder, so we have one body. Again bodies accumulate along the way, and we see into the heart of hero and his longing for the woman he loves.These ingredients make a rich story and a deep one. We have the background of the first parliamentary election under George I and a thorough discussion of Whigs, Tories and Jacobites. These all work to provide smoke to the mystery. Why is our hero on trial for the murder of a man he didn't kill. He is no saint, he has killed before, but not this man? Why does his adversary stand a character witness for him? Why does the judge not give him a voice during the trial?These questions answered, one could proceed in a straight path to find the motive and the powerful figures behind the accusations. But while taking such a path, our hero finds that the path isn't straight, and it is also cluttered.We see up close the underside of London in the early 18th century, and a feel for its politics. Corruption is at the heart of all, there being no good men to be found who want to do better for their fellow men without some flaw or other.My gripe with this book, and the first has to do with the research the author has done on dance. He makes the case look as if couples could go to the dance floor for a private conversation. Not so. It would be a country dance where all your neighbors would hear your talk, or a minuet and then you would be on display. The description we have leads one to think of a couple held close n a waltz. Not so at the period.So I do recommend it. It has a lot to offer. Better than many another historical mystery, thought not as good as Coffee Trader or Conspiracy of Paper."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"Another great read from David Liss.

It is seen through the eyes of a combination private investigator/bounty hunter, called a Thieftaker, named Benjamin Weaver, a Jew in the predominantly Protestant London. It not only tells a story of corruption and lawlessness, but also of the struggle for survival during this tumultuous time in history.

Weaver, having escaped the horrors of Newgate Prison after being sentenced to death for a murder he never committed, lands himself in one dangerous situation after another trying to vindicate his name and prove his innocence.This is the second book Mr. Liss has written about the escapades of Weaver, a thieftaker in London under the reign of the Hanoverian King George I. The author brilliantly shows the sights and sounds of the seamy streets and tawdry taverns of the cities' east side where groups of ruffians roam the streets and death comes easily to the uninitiated. He also shows that prejudice against certain ethnic groups is nothing new in our century.After all the twists and turns, I felt the ending was a little lame but perhaps the author left an opening for another sequel and I would certainly be interested in reading more about the roguish Mr. Weaver."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"A readable book but doesn't live up to the twists and turns of the first."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"I found this a disappointing sequel and not just because I wasn't given a cameo by my favorite 18th century politico, the Duke of Newcastle, who would have fit into the book's premise beautifully.Liss does so much less than he could with the premise he chose and it points out the same problen in the first book of the series. He writes small, insular stories in which a big subject is reduced to a few fictional characters. He shows the mechanics of the election process, but, no matter how interesting they are, they don't address the true corruption of the politics of the time.

He authored A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER, and for his effort was awarded the 2000 Edgar Award for Best First Novel. While the halls of academia lost a potentially fine college professor, mystery aficionados gained a writer who combines his skill as a historian with excellent writing talents to produce compelling and fascinating novels.A SPECTACLE OF CORRUPTION is the sequel to the first Liss novel. Once again, readers are transported to London during an era when England and the British aristocracy ruled the world. Benjamin Weaver, the classic mystery novel protagonist, makes a return appearance in the book and once again must solve a crime that has personal significance.Weaver is a classic outsider. He is a Jew in a Christian community, an ex-boxer who supports himself by tracking down debtors and felons for aristocratic clients. In contemporary society he would be Sam Spade, Mike Hammer or any number of characters found in Elmore Leonard novels. In Weaver's first appearance in A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER he was called upon to investigate his father's death. In A SPECTACLE OF CORRUPTION the problem is even more personal: Weaver must investigate a murder for which he has been wrongfully charged and convicted.In the year 1722, England was embroiled in a parliamentary election viewed as a referendum on the rule of King George. As the novel opens, Weaver finds himself on trial for the murder of Walter Yate. Confident in his innocence, Weaver is stunned to hear the Old Bailey jury return a verdict of guilty and in accordance with that verdict sentenced to be executed by hanging in six weeks. As he is led back to the Newgate prison, Weaver is accosted by a courtroom spectator who slips a lock pick and file into his hands. Using those tools, and with the aid of a friendly fellow inmate, Weaver is able to escape from prison.However, escape is not freedom. He must confront two mysteries. Someone has gone to substantial lengths to see an innocent man wrongfully convicted of murder while an equally mysterious agent has gone to great lengths to set him free. Weaver's life hangs in the balance as he races to solve this conundrum.Weaver must somehow infiltrate London society to ascertain the identity of both his accusers and defenders. He assumes the role of a tobacco grower recently returned to England from the colonies. With the looming election and the possibility that the British monarchy may be toppled, Weaver must navigate an English society heavily embroiled in both politics and crime. It is a difficult task, but Weaver is up to the challenge.There is a freshness and uniqueness in reading and solving an 18th century mystery. Detectives must rely on guile rather than gadgets to solve the crime. There are no crime labs or computers to provide simple answers to complex problems. Liss must have Benjamin Weaver solve the murder of Walter Yate by simple and basic methods: thought, hard work and logic. Along the way, the reader is provided with a portrait of 18th century England that is educational and informative. In addition, a great detective shows once again that top notch sleuthing knows no historical limitations.David Liss and Benjamin Weaver make a great team. We know they will be back --- and we can hardly wait.--- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman"},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"in one of its periodical fits of morality.\\" Lord Macaulay.For England the year 1722 was not one in which the public engaged in a fit of morality. No, 1722 was a year filled with plots to overthrow the Hanoverian King George in order to restore the Stuarts to the throne. It was a year in which the panic caused by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble came to a head. It was, finally, a year in which a general election was held in which the Tories, thought to be sympathetic to the Stuarts, did battle with the Whigs, sympathetic to King George. Many thought a Tory victory would lead to a restoration of the Stuarts. Much was at stake. 1722 was a year of spectacles but it was a year in which an exceedingly dirty and violent election campaign turned the year into a spectacle not of morality but of corruption.David Liss tosses Benjamin Weaver, the protagonist of his well-received Conspiracy of Paper, into the middle of this political maelstrom. Weaver is a retired boxing champion and well known throughout London. However, he is Jewish, and as such his boxing fame cannot provide him with an entry point in English life generally. He is not permitted the right to vote and he would not be welcomed into most clubs or at most social functions. He works as a thieftaker (he finds stolen property and returns it to its owner for a fee) and a private investigator of sorts.Weaver is hired to find out who has been sending threatening letters to an Anglican priest who has been speaking out on behalf of oppressed dock workers. Almost immediately upon commencing his investigation Weavers is arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a dockworker. It is a murder Weaver did not commit. It is clear from the start of the trial that the fix is in but as he is carried off to Newgate prison to await execution a mysterious woman slips Weaver the tools from which he manages to escape. A wanted man, Weaver assumes a new identity while trying desperately to unravel the events that triggered his being framed for murder.It seems that Weaver's investigation on behalf of the priest has placed him in the crosshairs of both the Whigs and the Tories in the middle of the 1722 election campaign. Nothing is as it seems. Weaver cannot vote and does not therefore have an interest in politics. This makes it even harder for him to analyze his situation. His old adversary and fellow thieftaker Jonathan Wild plays a major role yet Weaver cannot understand why Wild might actually reach out to help him in his endeavors. The love of his life, Miriam, also plays a major role. She has, since Conspiracy of Paper, married a British aristocrat and converted to Christianity. Her husband is running for parliament. He may be a friend and ally but Weaver cannot be sure.Spectacle of Corruption made for a very enjoyable read. It is difficult for anyone writing historical or political fiction to provide enough background material so that any reader can enjoy the full flavor of the book. Liss does an excellent job of setting the table without turning the novel into a text book. There may be parts where the complexities of the political system take a while to explain. However, those explanations help the reader actually understand what Weaver is up against. More importantly, Liss keeps the story line going and does a good job keeping the excitement level up, even when the pace slows down a bit. I think Liss has done a decent job fleshing out the personalities of his principal characters. There seems to be more depth to the characters than existed in Conspiracy of Paper. This bodes well for an eventual third volume.All in all a book worth reading."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"David Liss writes about the 18th century, but his subjects casts a curiously strong light on modern institutions. In his previous two novels, early finance capitalism is all too recognizable to modern readers for its pervasive corruption. \\"A Spectacle of Corruption\\" turns its eye on another cherished modern institution, \\"free\\" elections. British voters of the early 18th century would have been confounded at the idea that elections should be free, when so much money was there to be made, and insulted if no one bothered to buy their votes. The idea that elections should be free and fair is by no means a natural one, a fact we ignore at our peril. David Liss shows that elections in England were a well handled tool of the British rulers, not a great leap in human liberty. The subject is quite topical as we watch the modern spectacle of election fraud.\\"A Spectacle of Corruption\\" returns to the story of Benjamin Weaver (from \\"A Conspiracy of Paper\\"), a Jewish pugilist turned \\"thief taker\\" - an occupation much like detective, except that its practitioners are expected to fabricate evidence as often as not. He accepts a commission to identify the author of letters threatening a priest for his duplicitous defense of British dock workers. The waters turn very deep when Weaver finds himself framed for the murder of a dock worker and quickly condemned to a death sentence. Someone badly wants him dead, but it appears that someone just as badly wants him alive when a mysterious woman gives him the means to escape. His journey to exonerate himself takes him from the world of the British working class, where incipient trade unions degenerate into gangs run by thugs, to the parties of the ruling class, where election fraud is an openly practiced art.Liss is a better writer with every book, and his knowledge of the era makes for fascinating reading, but I find him less capable with each book of creating a likable main character. This may be by design, but it's a dangerous tactic for a writer. Weaver was a sympathetic figure in \\"The Conspiracy of Paper\\" - outside the Jewish community looking in, trying to maintain a standard of honor in a sordid trade. Within the first 120 pages of \\"A Spectacle of Corruption,\\" he has cut off an unarmed man's ear and thrust another's head into a chamberpot, nearly drowning him. He does these acts with a peculiarly detached, even sociopathic attitude, at odds with his previous depth of feeling. \\"I considered his words for a moment and then reached out with a speed than even I found remarkable. With one hand I grabbed his right ear, and with the other I used my knife to sever a substantial part of it. I held the bloody thing in my fingers and showed it to him before tossing it onto his writing desk, where it landed on a pile of correspondence with a heavy slap. Too astonished to cry out or even to move, Rowley only stared at the little pieces of flesh...'Where do you keep your banknotes?' I asked again.\\"The author tries to redeem Weaver later with strong concern for abused geese and women, but he certainly didn't win me back. You could make a good argument, based on \\"The Coffee Trader,\\" that Liss wants to show his characters increasingly alienated and disaffected, but pushing ordinary people into the realm of sadism without remorse is not the way to go. With all his writing skills, he doesn't seem able to darken his characters without making them emotionally flat. He'd be wiser imputing torment to his characters than deadened feeling. At some point, wonderful period detail notwithstanding, I will stop reading if sociopaths become the subject."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"Ben Weaver is back and in more trouble than before to solve a new mystery upon which his life depends.The story delves into fascinating aspects of the British election process in 1722, with the scandals, powerplays and corruption; and almost 300 years later, we can see not much has changed. I like a book that both educates and entertains.The author has a talent of taking a topic in a slice of history that may not seem on the outset interesting, but in the telling of the story the author shines in his clever plotlines, entertaining characters, uncovering sardonic historical intrigue."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"In this sequel to \\"A Conspiracy of Paper,\\" framed for a murder and sentenced to hang, ex-pugilist and now \\"thief-taker\\" Benjamin Weaver, The Lion of Judah, escapes from Newgate Prison and sets out to clear his name. Weaver's quest takes him on a tour of London's seamy and genteel sides with scarcely a moment for either Weaver or the reader to catch his breath. This is a world of bought judges, crooked elections, racketeering gangs, exploitation, deceit, sedition, and filth that truly lives up to the novel's title. It is nothing resembling Boswell's and Samuel Johnson's London, but is instead a dystopian view of an often glorified time. Free, but in constant danger, Weaver hides in plain view and disguises himself as a West Indian planter. He then moves back and forth between \\"genteel society\\" and his own identify in his attempts to unravel the mystery and save himself. This leads to his peripheral participation in both sides of a parliamentary election campaign where corruption, money, brutality, and treason rule in what a character describes as \\"A Spectacle of Corruption.\\" However, this is not a dark novel. It is instead more picaresque with abundant humor, adventure, and romance to offset the bleak society portrayed. Cast adrift and surrounded by human sharks, Weaver must live by his wits with the assistance of his friend Elias. His cousin and lost love, Miriam, also returns in this book, only to have left Jewish society to marry a character key to the story. Weaver does not overly despair because he finds a new love interest, and wonders at one fleeting point if he could remain in his new identity forever. Nevertheless, Weaver realizes his position is tenuous and fated to always be at the fringes of society. Although a sequel, \\"Spectacle of Corruption is virtually a stand-alone novel, but to fully appreciate the setting, \\"A Conspiracy of Paper\\" should be read first. The author, David Liss, definitely avoided the sophomore jinx, and there are many possibilities for future adventures of Benjamin Weaver."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"In his previous two novels David Liss dealt with themes revolving around finance in a historical setting. \\"A Conspiracy of Paper\\" tells the story of Ben Weaver and his search for his father's murderer. Ben soon finds that the reason behind the crime is connected to a scam in the financial markets. But Weaver's real family name is Lienzo, and in \\"The Coffee Trader\\" Liss goes back in time to narrate the story of Miguel Lienzo, on of Ben's predecessors who amassed his fortune through the trade of futures in the Dutch market. In this novel we find again the character of Ben Weaver, with the focus of the novel changing to a political setting.Ben is accused of killing Walter Yate, crime of which he is innocent, but he finds himself going to trial anyway. It is almost funny that someone who killed others in the course of his business before and who escaped the consequences unscathed, finds himself in the \\"hot seat\\" when he truly is not guilty. Those that have read the previous book featuring Weaver will surely remember Jonathan Wild, one of the most colorful and intriguing characters in that novel. Wild is a notorious criminal and a sort of \\"godfather\\" who has people stealing for him and then he charges the owners of the goods for their return. Wild is also Ben's adversary, since they practice similar businesses, with Ben taking the honest route. That is why when Wild is called as a witness in Weaver's trial, we are expecting to see a clear case of perjury and Ben hanging as a result. But beware, Liss likes to surprise his readers!The trial presents some very interesting aspects, dealing with witnesses that lie and recant in the spot, a judge that is focused on seeing Ben convicted and a jury that allows to be badgered into a verdict. This is how Ben ends up in death row and his only way out is to escape prison after a lovely lady he has never seen in his life provides him the means to do so. Now, he is determined to find the real culprit and to clean his name. In order to achieve that, he has to embark in a very dangerous adventure that will situate him against some clever adversaries that know how to play the game of politics.There are two aspects that have been present throughout all three books by Liss. One of them is showing how unfair the treatment of Jews was in the different time periods and places selected as settings for the stories. In this case, in the eighteenth century in England, we find evidence of such treatment on various occasions. The most blatant one is during sentencing, when the judge tells Ben: \\"I can see no reason for leniency, not when there are so many Jews in this city\\". The other aspect is the importance of family, which of course is not disconnected from the first one at all, since the Jewish religion pays the utmost attention to family. In the present novel, we find Ben suffering over Miriam's decision of rejecting his marriage proposal and marry another man instead. Miriam is the widow of Ben's cousin, and not only did she marry a Tory candidate, but she had to convert to the Protestant religion in order to do so. As a result, she is not allowed to communicate with Ben anymore.This novel is a novel with interesting characters, a well-developed plot and detailed and realistic descriptions of the settings in which the story unravels. This allows the reader that is not familiar with this historic period to get a very good idea about how life was at the time and also understand the motivation behind the different political parties. What makes this book even more remarkable is the fact that the talents displayed by Liss do not stop there, since the author shows a clear knack for suspense and mystery. All these points make this a very hard novel to ignore."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"Before reading this book I recommend you read Liss' first book \\"A Conspiracy of Paper.\\" The first book will introduce you to Benjamin Weaver and London in the early 1700's. In both his books Liss displays an uncanny abilty to weave history with fiction. One can feel through the authors first person detailed descriptions the grit, grime and smell of that time and place. Both books smoothly moves one through intricate plot and unforgetable characters. Both books are page turners. A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"David Liss re-creates the sounds, looks and even smells of life in cramped, dirty and violent London of the 1700s. Benjamin Weaver is a thief-taker, former pugilist and highwayman who haunts the back alleys and taverns for his next job.

The Catholic King James II has abdicated the throne in favor of German born King George in 1714.Factions called Jacobites exist that support James' son James Stuart as the rightful heir to the throne. Due to a severe depression caused by a stock narket crash, a general election is being held as a referendum on the rule of King George. The 2 major parties, the church supporting Tories representing wealthy property owners and the Whigs representing the landless nouveau riche are using any corrupt means possible to garner votes.The story revolves around Benjamin Weaver a Jewish ex-pugilist who now functions as a thieftaker or detective. Weaver is framed on trumped up charges of murdering a labor organizer Walter Yate. Yate represented the quayside porters of the Westminster borough, a hotly contested seat in Parliament. Dennis Dogmill, a wealthy tobacco importer and Whig election supervisor, with the help of a sympathetic judge has Weaver convicted and sentenced to hang. Weaver eventually escapes from Newgate prison and with the aid of friends assumes a disguise of a wealthy Jamaican plantation owner to try to clear his name.With the election as a backdrop Weaver becomes involved with both Whig anf Tory campaigns and witnessses the widespread corruption involved. The plot eventually leads to the shocking actual reason for the betrayal of Weaver.Liss with the aid of exhaustive historical research does an illuminating job in his description of daily life in this time period."},{"Title":"A Spectacle of Corruption (Benjamin Weaver Series)","review":"I love this book! It combines two literary loves of mine - detective/mystery novels and historical fiction, with a heavy dose of what life must have been like in England of 1722. The detective is the 18th century equivalent of Sam Spade, private eye.I got an insight into a very confusing time in English history and a glimpse of what it must have felt like on a daily basis to live there and then.For anyone in the modern period, 1722 was strange enough to be like science fiction but familiar enough to show what humanity could be like without all the social and governmental safeguards we have now.I often read one of the many historical myteries set in Roman times such as the SPQR series. While the views of daily life are wonderful in those novels, the mystery part is usually a little obvious. But Liss succeeds in both genres. Fascinating mystery and gereat feeling for the 1700's."},{"Title":"Systems Engineering and Analysis","review":"I hate when the author/publisher is so cheap that they recycle material and don't have decency to edit it.In this book you will find sentences that don't make sense, cryptic questions referring to deleted material, and obvious mistakes in figures and illustrations.

So, I'm doing a very rigorous reading/summarizing to create my presentations. At the moment I'm doing chapter 15 and so far it has been a mixed ride. Sometimes, I have to read the paragraph to make sure I'm getting the point. Most of the time it works but sometimes I'm left puzzled.

I picked this book up because I saw it referred to all over the place, and assumed that it was reasonably definitive. Sadly, it is not. What the book does do is give the reader a reasonably good high-level overview of systems engineering in general, and of some of the techniques involved in estimating the \\"ilities\\" of a given system design. However, the level of detail on any one subject area is very light, and the bias of the book is very much toward DoD-style systems engineering. A good book for systems engineering managers. System designers should also seek out Wymore's \\"Model-Based Systems Engineering\\" for a thorough understanding of requirements and design."},{"Title":"Systems Engineering and Analysis","review":"Blanchard and Fabrycky start with an excellent discussion of systems engineering (SE) history and proceed to cover program/project SE in a logical and orderly fashion.

The authors do a great job of walking the student through the systems engineering process, and ginving a general overview of the steps. The later chapters expand upon this overview to give the detail needed to actually carry out the process. The last part of the book expands upon the &quot;-ilities&quot; of systems engineering which are the authors partiucalr areas of interest. I think anyone interested in systems engineering should get this book, its a great resource. A few things I didn't like was the constant referencing of graphs and figures from previous chapters, it really inhibits my learing when I have to keep flipping back and forth to follow a train of thought. There are also a few chunks of the book that are very, very hard to follow the logical train of thought and require meticulious attention to the detail, and often require rereading.

It is a handsome book (in hardback with smart dust jacket) and would make a brilliant gift for a Haring fan, especially if they were into a form of dance too.

Whether he's creating a robot DJ, whimsical animals, or tribal/iconic looking humanoid figures, Haring imprints his distinctive style upon all.My only problem with the book involves the following editorial note on the publication data page: &quot;The Keith Haring artwork in this book has been reproduced faithfully; however, the colors of some works have been altered.&quot; So. . . which colors have been altered, and why? I'm of the opinion that you don't mess with the work of a master artist unless you have a very good reason, and the editors of this book fail to fully explain this matter of alteration.But despite this matter, Haring's vision shines through. He wrote, &quot;The freedom of the artist is symbolic of the human spirit in all mankind.&quot; Haring's appeal transcends all barriers of difference, and &quot;Dance&quot; truly speaks to that universal human spirit."},{"Title":"Dance","review":"I plan to use this book with kindergarten students and it is a bit sophisticated for that age group.

One of America's most frequently anthologized writers, Welty's distinctly Southern tone and the fineness of her over-all work makes her the only regional author whose reputation consistently challenges that of William Faulkner.This particular collection of Welty's short stories includes all works previously collected under the titles A CURTAIN OF GREEN and THE WIDE NET, which were her first and second published short story volumes, written in the 1930s and 1940s. The stories from the former are widely known, and include such favorites as \\"The Petrified Man,\\" \\"Keela, the Outcast Indian Maiden,\\" \\"Why I Live at the P.O.,\\" and \\"The Worn Path.\\" Although less well known, stories from the latter are equally fine, and include such titles as \\"First Love,\\" \\"The Wide Net,\\" and \\"Livvy.\\"Welty was blessed with a talent for writing from the inside of the character, and in reading her work one consistently feels that one is not so much reading Welty as the writings of the characters she presents--writings rendered with superlative, memorable imagery. But although Welty's work generally consists of character portrait rather than plot-driven material and maintains a stylistically consistent tone, it is remarkably varied, ranging from the outrageously comic to the deeply touching to the profoundly disquieting.Of particular interest to modern readers is the way in which Welty, who wrote primarily during the era of segregation, addresses race in her work. In one sense, she does not address it at all, for her work is not issue-oriented; at the same time, however, certain aspects of her work (such as characters who occasionally use the 'n' word, which even in the South of this era carried certain implications about the mentality and social class of the person who used it) indicate her awareness of the slow-boil hidden beneath the surface of Southern society. Although it is not included in this particular collection, those interested in Welty's work would do well to read her 1960s story \\"Where Is The Voice Coming From?,\\" a fearsome portrait of violent racism in action, for Welty's ultimate position on the matter."},{"Title":"Selected Stories of Eudora Welty: A Curtain of Green and Other Stories (Modern Library)","review":"There are some five-plus star stories in this selection from Eudora Welty's two volumes -- A Curtain of Green & The Wide Net -- and there are some three-minus stories also. My own five-star rating is intended to recognize the best of Welty's work, which is very good indeed. But I'm not going to identify my favorites; you, dear reader, might well take issue with my choices, and with good reasons. It does Welty's work no service to read these 25 stories sequentially and without interruption. Unlike the story sets of writers like Turgenev or Alice Munro, Welty's stories don't interpenetrate and magnify each other. Each is an artifact in itself, and too many artifacts on display at once always diminishes the impact of each one separately. These were primarily magazine stories, published at intervals in The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, Harper's Bazaar, New Directions, and other toney journals with urban, chiefly Northern, readerships. The best way to read them, I find, is once in a while and not necessarily in the indexed order. Put the book by your reading chair or on your night table; pick it up when the mood is right, like a dose of intellectual Viagra.Those Northern urban readers of the 20th C seem to have had an appetite for \\"Southern Gothic\\" -- for depiction of grotesque, wayward, aberrant manners and lifestyles among the colorful and colored bumpkins of the post-Civil War South. Perhaps such portrayals served to confirm their own cultural superiority. But the best-known of the self-consciously Southern writers - William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, Harper Lee - had something more than burlesque in mind. They were all issue-driven. For O'Connor, the issue was always her obsessive heretical religiosity. For Lee and especially Faulkner, it was Mythos, the grand invincible delusion of Southern particularity, the Myth of the Lost Cause, the finely-tuned hierarchy of racial destinies that only a true Southerner could feel in her/his blood, the tragedy of survival. What separated Welty from the others, and what has made her work unpalatable to many Southern readers, was her inattention to \\"issues\\". Oh, the issues are there -- chiefly race and isolation -- but that's all they are: there! Welty, it seems to me, wasn't writing about exotics or Gothic abnormalities. She was imitating the only life she knew well, a local girl capturing local scenes of reality in carefully framed snapshots. She was, by the way, a photographer as actively as a writer. By picturing ordinary quotidian life in the rural South without an aura of magnolia grandeur, without myth, Welty distanced herself from Faulkner and from the pernicious self-congratulation of Southern \\"better folk\\" like the heroes of Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"If you, dear urban reader of the 21st Century, find the characters in a story like Welty's \\"Petrified Man\\" to be stupid, vulgar, and enjoyably grotesque... if you think they are comic exaggerations, you simply haven't had them for neighbors. I have. I spent some years of my late childhood in trailer camps in the South. I've heard those women gossiping, those men bull-sessioning. If I had Welty's camera-like memory for dialogue, I too could write a story like \\"Why I Live at the P.O.\\" What I'm saying is that Welty was above all a realist rather than a moralist. Her gift was the ability to focus her word-camera, to crop and re-touch, and to print an image that contained nothing extraneous yet everything necessary.This pertains to her stories. Her novels were another matter entirely ..."},{"Title":"Battle for Empire: The Very First World War 1756-63","review":"Tom Pocock correctly identifies the Seven Years War (1756-63) as &quot;The First World War&quot; and gives a very readable account of how Britain waged it outside Continental Europe. The focus is however purely on this aspect and, as such, the campaigns on the European Continent, including the spectacular role played by Prussia, are excluded. The sheer geographic scale and the vaunting ambition of British policies are however well conveyed as well as the brilliant strategies underlying the first war to be fought with truly global objectives. As well as the better-known campaigns such as &quot;The French-Indian War&quot; in North America, Clives's amazing conquests in India and Byng's disastrous manoeuvres off Minorca (that led to his execution by firing squad &quot;to encourage the others&quot;), there are fascinating accounts of less familiar undertakings such as the operations of the author's own kinsman in the Indian Ocean and the captures of Manila and Havana by British expeditionary forces. The Havana operation, which finally succeeded at a horrendous cost in deaths from disease as well as military action, is an epic that would merit a book in its own right. Though satisfying as far as it goes, once feels that the author missed an opportunity in &quot;Battle for Empire&quot; in not expanding the scope to cover the whole war, on all fronts. There is a gap in the market for a readable single-volume narrative history of the war, ideally written with the easy style, lively depiction of personalities and colourful anecdotes which Mr.Pocock provides in this one."},{"Title":"Battle for Empire: The Very First World War 1756-63","review":"Tom Pocock, whose biographies of Nelson are also very much worth your time, has written a wonderful short history of the Seven Years War, which he is correct in referring to as the first truly world war, and as the war that set Britain on its road to empire. Pocock has a real talent for vividly depicting people in a chapter or two, including the unfortunate Admiral Byng (shot to &quot;encourage the others&quot; as Voltaire wryly observed), Wolfe, and Clive. Very, very much worth reading; the Seven Years War (which has been consistently reduced to the status of a minor squabble in American history books under the misnomer of the &quot;French and Indian War&quot;) has been almost forgotten but its effect on the history of the late 18th and the 19th centuries cannot be overestimated."},{"Title":"Battle for Empire: The Very First World War 1756-63","review":"Pocock's book is a rather episodic narrative of the main events of the Seven Years' War outside Europe. That war is worth studying, because it shaped the world for a long time to come. In Europe, the Prussians served notice of an intention that they, not the Austrians, should one day be the leaders of united Germany; overseas Britain began the process of 'painting the map red' that (despite occasional setbacks like the loss of the Revolting Colonies) continued until the early 20th century and has left enduring landmarks (the modern states of India and Canada, for starters). It marks the emergence of Britain as the naval superpower, a position it maintained until the 1920s. As another reviewer has said, Pocock's big weakness is that he ignores the European side of the war. Even though the British were able to conduct an overseas strategy with minimum reference to what was going on in Germany, the same wasn't true for the French, and Britain's success undoubtedly owed much to the indefatigable Frederick the Great of Prussia tying down so many French troops.When assessing the quality of (allegedly) factual books, I'm always discouraged to find errors on matters that I'm able to check personally; even if minor, they throw doubt on all the stuff I don't know and wish to be informed about. Unfortunately Tom Pocock commits such an error (unforced at that) on his very first page, when he makes Captain Augustus Hervey the son and heir of the second Earl of Bristol. Hervey's father never succeeded to the title, Hervey himself was a younger son (the second Earl was his elder brother) with no certain expectations of inheritance, and heirs to major titles (unless near-bankrupt like the Cochrane Earls of Dundonald) rarely went into the armed forces (Earl Percy in the War of American Independence, heir to the great and rich house of Northumberland, is a conspicuous exception). The real crime is not this somewhat peripheral error, but the fact that Pocock claims (in his bibliography) to have read two works - NAM Rodger's 'The Wooden World' and David Erskine's edition of Hervey's 'Journal' - that between them very clearly state both the principles involved and the details of the Hervey family. When an author ignores his own cited sources on simple matters of fact, the reader must be wary. Maybe Pocock's start as a journalist has something to do with it.Nevertheless, this is a book worth reading, if only because of the detail it gives for events that are often confined to a brief mention or a footnote in more general histories. Pocock starts with the loss of Minorca and the consequent execution of Admiral George Byng (which is where Byng's service follower Hervey gets into the picture), and follows it with the campaigns in Bengal and the Indian Ocean (where Pocock's ancestor Admiral George Pocock fought a long attritional struggle against the French commander d'Ach&eacute;), North America (where the Ticonderoga fiasco is described in all its horror, and the taking of Quebec is shown to be much more touch-and-go than given in imperial hagiography), Cuba (where Admiral Pocock and Augustus Hervey - now also an Admiral - surface again) and finally the most far-flung and improbable of them all, the capture of Manila. He gives many fascinating details (especially for the taking of Havana) that were new to me; the descent on the windward coast of Cuba via the intricate Old Bahama Channel is a justly celebrated feat of military navigation, but the hardships and fearful losses from disease during the siege are less familiar."},{"Title":"Goodnight God, I Love You a Lot","review":"This book was exactly what I was looking for!

I recommend it to any parent, grandparent, uncle, aunt, or anyone with a favorite child.

During the course of his being examined by a police psychiatrist who bears a striking resemblance to him, Jack kills the doctor and assumes his identity, escapes to London. The New York City police are corrupt and selfishly wish to keep the escape a secret. They authorize Henry Marboro to go to London to bring back Lewiston dead or alive. Marboro had been forced into retirement while he was investigating the case of the murdered prostitutes, one of whom was his sister. Eventually Lewiston becomes the assistant to London's medical examiner and tries to find a normal relationship with the examiner's daughter, Prescilla. However, his appetite for murder and mutilation are overpowering. He leaves a path of mayhem. Marboro tracks Jack from London's East Side to posh London where he meets and falls in love with nurse, Loraine Broderick. Jack plays cat and mouse with Henry, the police and the public with taunting,boastful letters to the press.When he realizes that Marboro is too close he kidnaps Loraine and forces a confrontation with Marboro. In the ensuing struggle, Jack is shot and plunges into the river. The police believe that the decomposed body found in the river later is that of Jack which closes the case. Or does it? The action is fast paced; the suspense building to a peak to the finale. The characters are well-drawn. The details of Jack's murders and mutilations are graphic and gruesome, not for the faint hearted reader. There is explicit sex. Both of these while explicit are necessary to the story. Flowere has captured the sights and sounds of New York City and London's East End in 1888. You can feel the squalor of the city and the deprivation and desperation of the people. He maintains a fine balance in the narrative of the first person(Marboro) and the third person(Lweiston). He delves into the demented mind of Lewiston with his love/hate obsession with his mother. In his departure fromm contemporary thrillers,Flowers has given us a compelling and powerful account of Jack the Ripper. This is another theory of &quot;Who was Jack the Ripper&quot;? Flowers makes a strong case in his presentation."},{"Title":"In The Dark Of Night","review":"Set in 1888, New York City. Jack the Ripper was killing and mutilating prostitutes.

Wrightson's conception of the monster is both horrifying and frighteningly sympathetic, and he demonstrates both his talent for capturing dynamism and motion as well as his grasp of the emotional conflicts of the story. A note to literary students, however: this is an abridged version of Mary Shelley's work, albeit an effective one.

Each character gets a unique voice, and each voice seems so right, so perfect, so able to extract every last dramatic energy and subtle nuance Mary Shelley gave to her literary creations. This audio version is a must have! I rank it right up there with Jim Dale's rendition of Barrie's Peter Pan.The story is the foundation which Vance's magic builds on. So, to be sure, not only is the excellent narration a huge reason for buying this particular audio version of Frankenstein, the deep and moving tale of the \\"Demon\\" and his heartless creator is the prime mover for owning this classic gothic tale so one can enjoy repeated listenings and ever higher climbs to deep meaning and literary revelation. Michael Naulander wrote an excellent mini essay expositing a nice framework by which to appreciate this text; therefore, my review is less abstract and more in praise of this particular version of Frankenstein, due to Vance's oh so pleasent voice and wonderful characterizations. Any one at any age will simply love this tale, the young for the plot and uplifting and complex diction, the not so young for the philosophical and emotional depths, as well as the uplifting and luscious diction.

Great insight into the \\"practice\\" of management, as opposed to theory. I highly recommend to all of Drucker's books."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"This book was written in the 1950's. At the time, the concepts of management espoused by Peter Drucker were revolutionary - the result of study and observation post WW-II and his first hand observation of the failure of pure command and control management.If you are new to the topic, Drucker's work is an important foundation for modern management techniques. His observations and insights are as relevant to the human psychology, the practice of management and the theory of business today as they were 60 years ago.Having said that, the book is merely foundational and background now. The modern manager has largely been trained, thanks to Drucker, in his management paradigm. As a result, the trained manager will find some useful nuggets, some interesting observations, and about 400 pages of what is now \\"common sense management\\". The revolution of the 1950's is largely in the past today. The book is less useful or revolutionary today for a manager than it was 60, or even 20 years ago. And for that, Drucker should be commended. However, it makes it tougher to recommend the book for more than a reader who is more interested in the background/foundation it espouses than someone looking for new ideas or fresh thinking."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"The multifaceted and dynamic world in which we live obligates the actual management to act and react with leonine fierceness, his capacity for being actually in the multiple areas of knowledge, information, behavior patterns, changing consumer habits, emotional intelligence and the undeniable advances in the informatics technology, require a focused man, concentrated but in the meantime deeply informed about an increasing wave of new advances in this competitive environment where the lesser slip an dictate the irreversible failure.Despite the famous article of Henry Mintzberg in 1993 in Harvard Business Review about the fall of the strategic planning, this text is an important guide in which you will find devices, tools to improve your own skills.The greatness of this book is its actuality and that goes beyond another virtue, in a world that goes forward with giant steps.Go for this admirable book in which you will know important anecdotes, and valuable information about the fascinating and every time much more4 exigent and demanding Management Science (or Art?, perhaps?)."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"A bit dated, but if this book was followed I still think the work place would be much better."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"To say that this book is remarkably relevant for a publication dating back to 1954 is little better than pointing out that getting out of bed is a prerequisite to a good day's work, or that the 1920 - 1930 architecture of Mies van der Rohe is still the cornerstone of today's architecture. That said, there are many good things to consider with regard to managing a PRIVATE business.Much is made of management's responsibilities toward society. But this seems to me to be proposed from the context of fear and/or reprisal if management doesn't accept such a responsibility. Furthermore, as the example of \`the mystery of the washroom doors' made clear, the managed are content to axe down a washroom door in preference to spending twenty cents of their own money to purchase a new key to replace a lost key, and let the thousands of dollars worth of repair bills fall to management whose fault it was for making a claim for new keys too difficult. \`That'll learn em!'The biggest impediment to management as advocated in this book, is government. Government in consort with a myriad of non-elected bodies now compels a business, through draconian legislation, to conform to a specified role in society. In Drucker's day, this was more a matter of choice. However, with the politically sound MBA acting as the government's executive we have returned to a situation very similar to that of post-revolution Russia where the business was an adjunct of government. This is why the disparity in executive pay compared to the general labour is so acute today. And why this book is outdated."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"Having read this book, I really am surprised how many of his ideas have stood the test of time. I'm certain many leading CEO's, CFO's and managers have read Mr. Druckers work.One thing I found somewhat annoying is the that this book hasn't been updated to reflect the management of the 21st century. There are managers today that wern't even born when this book was published, so it would seem natural to revise it for the modern day manager.We can not rely solely on ideas of the past, but must constantly strive to create new and inovative methods in our constantly changing economic climate."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"This book was published in 1954 and given its age it is still remarkably readable. It is chock full of good advice and thought provoking ideas. One of the blurbs on the back of the book describes Drucker as a &quot;business and management philosopher.&quot; He certainly is that. This book is so completely devoid of anything approaching a scientific approach as to be sickening. He frequently says stuff like, &quot;most companies&quot; or &quot;probably something like 60 to 70 percent&quot;. Seeing as how his figures are completely unsubstantiated they do more harm than good. The book shouldn't be treated as anything more than an extended opinion. As near as I could tell there wasn't a single substantiated fact in the entire book. Kinda scary that this is the best that the &quot;dean of business and management&quot; can produce. I would have hoped that industry was based on something a little more substantial than gut feelings, rumors, hunches, and hearsay."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"The late Peter F. Drucker is the most influential management thinker of the 20th Century. This book was first published in 1955 and consists of five parts plus a proper introduction and conclusion. Drucker, in the Preface, explains that the first aim of this book \\"is to narrow the gap between what can be done and what is being done, between the leaders in management and the average\\".The Introduction - The Nature of Management - consists of three chapters. Within the first chapter Drucker explains that \\"the manager is the dynamic, life-giving element in every business\\" and that management \\"is the organ of society specifically charged with making resources productive, that is, with the responsibility for organized economic advance.\\" In the second chapter Drucker explains that \\"management is the least known and the least understood of our institutions\\" and discusses the three functions of management: managing a business, managing managers, and to manage workers and work. The third chapter states that management faces its first test of its competence and its hardest task in the then imminent industrial revolution called \`automation'. Drucker does explain that automation is not \`technical', but primarily a system of concepts, a concept of the organization of work.The first of six chapters within Part I - Managing a Business - uses the Sears, Roebuck & Company as an illustration of what business is and what managing it means. Based upon this illustration, Drucker concludes in Chapter 5 that \\"there is only one valid definition of business: to create a customer. ... It is the customer who determines what a business is.\\" Chapter 6 introduces Drucker's most famous question: \\"What is our business - and what should it be?\\" This does look relatively simple, but it is not simple to answer and the author provides guidance. In the next chapter the objectives of a business are discussed: \\"Objectives are needed in every area where performance and results directly and vitally affect the survival and prosperity of the business.\\" Chapter 8 discusses the tools that management needs to take make decisions today for the result of tomorrow. But no matter how sound the business economics, how careful the analysis, how good the tools, managing a business always comes back to the human element. This is the subject of Chapter 9, which deals with the principles of production.The first of the six chapters within Part II - Managing Managers - uses automobile company Ford to explain that the \\"fundamental problem or order, structure, motivation and leadership in the business enterprise have to be solved in the managing of managers.\\" But he also warns that managers are its scarcest resource. Drucker also introduces the major requirements of managing managers, which are detailed in the next five chapters.The first of the three chapters within Part III - The Structure of Management - discusses the issue of organization structure. The next chapter is concerned with building the structure. Chapter 18 deals with the small, the large and the growing business, which Drucker breaks down into four stages of business size (small, fair-sized, large, very large business). He discusses the problems and potential solutions for each.The six chapters within Part IV - The Management of Worker and Work - discuss the human elements of business. Drucker uses IBM as an example to show basic problems in managing worker and work, and some of the principles for their solution. He also emphasizes that the management of worker and work is a complex subject. Within Chapter 20 he discusses the worker as a resource, the demands of the enterprise on the worker, the worker's demands on the enterprise, and the economic dimension. The next chapter explains that although personnel management is not bankrupt (\\"but certainly insolvent\\") the relationship between a man and the kind of work he does is known due to the Human-Relations school. Chapter 22 details human organization for peak performance or in Drucker's words \\"the engineering of the individual job for maximum efficiency.\\" The fourth chapter in this section discusses the economic relationship between enterprise and worker. This is followed by chapters on the first-line supervisor and on the professional employee (who is neither management nor labor).The title of the final part - What It Means to be a Manager - gives away the subject for the three chapters. Drucker believes that a manager has two specific tasks: \\"The manager has the task of creating a true whole that is larger than the sum of its parts, a productive entity that turns out more than the sum of the resources put into it. ...This task requires the manager to bring out and make effective whatever strength there is in his resources - and above all in the human resources - and neutralize whatever there is of weakness.\\" This requires the manager to balance and harmonize the three major functions of the business enterprise: managing a business, managing managers, and managing worker and work. Chapter 28 deals with decision making. The five phases in decision-making are discussed. The final chapter discusses the manager of tomorrow. Based upon the new demands required, the manager of tomorrow has to acquit himself of seven new tasks.The book is concluded with a proper conclusion on the responsibilities of management. \\"... the business enterprise must be so managed as to make the public good become the private good of the enterprise. ...To make certain that this assertion does not remain lip service but becomes hard fact is the most important, the ultimate responsibility of management: to itself, to the enterprise, to our heritage, to our society and to our way of life.\\"What can one say about a masterpiece like this? Books by Peter Drucker always deserve five stars since they are eye-openers to most of us, but this one is exceptional and possibly the best I have read by him. Highly recommended to anybody involved with management or working within business enterprise, it provides great insights for employees through to chief executive."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"What can I say about Peter Drucker that hasn't already been said.Written in 1954 it is as relevant to today's world (perhaps even more so) as it was back then. Fundamentally what strikes me about the Practice of Management is that it advocates a profoundly ethical view of management and the responsibilities of management.If you walk away with a just a few of the ideas he presents, you will be a better manager:1) Management by objectives2) The imporance of having the right \\"spirit\\" in an organisation.3) The need for managers to feel empowered and have all the authority they need to carry out their job.4) Appropriate rewards for strong performance and the need for censure when performance is weak.5) Creating an open culture where mistakes are expected and form a basis for future knowledge.I could go on.As a final note, Peter Drucker foresaw one of the most remarkable changes in industry - a change that allowed the movement from vertically integrated industries to a distributed supply chain model - and that strong managers would be needed to deal with it.I would rate this as one of the best buys I have made this year."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"Peter Drucker wrote this book at the height of the mis-application of statistics and &quot;science&quot; in areas such as management and economics. Drucker, who had the benefit of experience, saw the flaws decades before the rest of us. I suspect that the reason Drucker was so ahead of his time is that he was able to tap the experience of the great industrialists who probably were unwilling to share the trade secrets of their management knowledge with the general public. It wasn't until the 1980s when the masses began to learn these things.The book is a classic and is just as valid today as it was in the mid 20th century (why wouldn't it be?).Drucker explains within the book the reason for the word &quot;practice&quot; rather than &quot;theory&quot; of managment."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"Peter Drucker needs no introduction.

Here, gathered together and framed by a thoughtful introduction from the Review's editor Nan Stone, is a priceless collection of his most significant work.One of our leading thinkers on the practice and study of management, Drucker has sought out, identified, and examined the most important issues confronting managers, from corporate strategy to management style to social change. Through his unique lens, this volume gives us the rare opportunity to trace the evolution of the great shifts in our workplaces, and to understand more clearly the role of managers in the ongoing effort to balance change with continuity.Now, these important articles and essays are strategically presented here to address two unifying themes: the first examines &quot;The Manager's Responsibilities&quot; while the second investigates &quot;The Executive's World&quot;. Accompanied by an interview with Peter Drucker on &quot;The Post-Capitalist Executive&quot;, as well as a thought-provoking preface by Peter Drucker himself, a complete picture of management theory and practice emerges, both as it was and as it will be.Infused with a perspective that holds new relevance today, these essays represent Drucker at his best: direct, wise and challenging. Peter Drucker on the Profession of Management, sure to be studied, debated, and enjoyed by everyone concerned with management, everyone concerned with management, is a timely offering from one of the most respected and prolific authors to appear in the Harvard Business Review.At 90, Peter Drucker is, by all accounts, the most enduring management thinker of our time. Born in Vienna, educated in Austria and England, he has worked since 1937 in the United States, first as an economist for a group of British banks and insurance companies, and later as a management consultant to several leading companies. Drucker has since had a distinguished career as a teacher, including more than twenty years as Professor of Management at the Graduate Business School of New York University. Since 1971 he has been Marie Rankin Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management at the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management, Claremont Graduate University in California, where he still teaches in the fields of management and business policy. He is the founder of The Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, and has counseled numerous governments, public service institutions, and major corporations.Drucker is a writer, teacher, and consultant with a long-term business perspective second to none. His twenty-nine previous books have been published in more than twenty languages and span sixty years of modern history beginning with The End of Economic Man (1939) and Managing in a Time of Great Change; Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices; Innovation and Entrepreneurship; The Effective Executive; Managing for Results and The Practice of Management. Nan Stone is the editor of the Harvard Business Review."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"There is a lot of self-centered managers thinking they are very good, but in reality they are below average human beings both intellectually and ethically. There are also many managers that are good people and try to do their best. I think all managers belonging to the latter category should read this 60 year old book. Drucker wanted managers to contribute to humanity by being good managers. I would say that it is inspirational to read Drucker's words knowing that they were written such a long time ago. The book is written in a very engaging manner and is not what you would expect for such an old book. Managers today struggle with pretty much the same issues as identified in this book. This is not to say that this book contains everything, but by reading it, you realise how much useless or fluffy stuff is written in many current management books."},{"Title":"The Practice of Management","review":"although schools of management change, the basic principles of sounds management stay the same. using powerful theory of management in combination with convincing real-life examples of good and bad management in certain companies, peter drucker gives the reader a powerful state of mind and direction to follow, to become a successful manager."},{"Title":"Madame Delphine","review":"This is a little novelette about a woman in 19th century New Orleans trying to make a better life for her daughter.

To encourage the handler to have fun and to provide an enjoyable showing experience for their dog.I reccommend this book to readers of all ages, show experience levels and breeds.My 11 year old daughter read it after me and we both enjoyed discussing what we had learnt."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I totally disagree with the the person who wrote the first review. i don't know about him, but i'm not paying $25 an entry to lose. I am an owner handler and took no offense to his comments. Alston is trying to give you yor winning edge. He's honest and forthright and I would buy this bokok over and over again if i had all the money in the world."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"That is what is contained in this book.

Highly recommended for all handlers, beginner or experienced."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I gave this a 5 star rating because it has been such a help to me, being new to the show world.

I intend to refer to it as often as needed."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I'm a novice at conformation shows. I've taken my dog in the ring a few times, but I needed more tips on handling. This book is just what I needed! It's more advanced than the basic how-to's of dog shows, but it still addresses the handling techniques that beginners like me need to know to look as professional as possible in the ring. I recommend this to anyone who knows the basics but needs to hone their skills."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This book is a wonderful reference to many things that are often overlooked in todays show ring. Lots of common sense knowledge and useful for the beginner and experienced exibitor alike."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"If you are serious about handling your own dogs - BUY IT NOW! I only wish I had read this book years ago. It is the supreme guide for those owner-handlers who aren't content to merely SHOW but who are ready to WIN! The weekend after I read it I used the skills learned to put the first point on a 9-mo-old puppy against professionals with Open dogs. It really made a big difference for me. The only thing better is going to one of his seminars - they are even better. Better yet - do both - and the results will amaze you."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Contrary to the comments a previous reviewer, I hope most will realize the value of this excellent and practical book and give it a try. The criticism of the &quot;reader from Texas,&quot; is INANE and inappropriate. FIRST of all, the author never pretends to be a writer. He is, however, an accomplished Pro Handler with a track record of big show wins and real life experience to share about what to do (and not to do) in the show ring. SECOND, as for the comment about &quot;how many times he belittled the owner-handler in this book,&quot; that too is utter nonsense. He is simply pointing out the kinds of behaviors that will NOT help you to win in the ring, and isn't that the ENTIRE POINT of reading this book??? Yes, showing dogs is a sport, but the reader is in La La Land if he does not realize that what &quot;the judge likes,&quot; and &quot;how to hide faults&quot; are paramount to successfully showing and winning with your dog. The author does not pretend to be there to discuss &quot;important aspects&quot; of dogs. One presumes that the book will be bought and read to help the amateur handler understand how best to handle their dog in the ring. Ignore this reviewer and read this book! I found it to be extremely down-to-earth and full of little gems of wisdom and hints to remember and apply. I have bought a number of more &quot;professionally written and less judgmental&quot; books on showing and handling and they are too bland and so general as to be useless. They are NOT going to be the ones that I will refer back to and read again-- but this book will be read again and again. It's aptly named. It is indeed full of little secrets that are important to know in the show ring. It is an OUTSTANDING and entertaining reference in a gritty, no-nonsense way. I HIGHLY recommend it."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This is a detailed book designed to guide you through your Speciality dogs' campaigning. This is not a book made to help class dogs win in the breed ring. This is written especially for Group 1's and Best In Show wins. I highly recommend reading this book before attending one of his seminars to be prepared what and what not to ask. This author has had mulitple BIS dogs in his resume' and has a unlimited wealth of knowledge in the sport. This book can teach you everything from installing fear into your competition, to getting the photographer to take the kind of picture YOU want. This is the best book on the market for the Advanced Owner-Handler or Professional Handler."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This book's focus is for the owner-handler/ amateur handler to aspire to the professionalism of the pro handler. The author points out the common mistakes of owner-handlers and how to avoid and correct them. This is not a book on the basics of dog showing, but good for someone who already grasps the concepts of handling and showing dogs. Alston's focus is on the handler doing his job rather than the dog. He incorporates sports psychology and how to prep yourself mentally. He also goes into showing the dog to the best advantage, how to emphasize the strenghs rather than the faults of the dog (since we know all dogs have them). He does not cover how to hide faults, because you really can't. All in all, it's a great step towards improving your performance in the ring, resulting in a better performance from your dog."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Recently, there have been many people online asking about showing, and not expressing confidence when they show. READ THIS BOOK! It will help you understand many aspects of showing that you never even thought about! Mr. Alston attained over 300 Best in Shows, while he was handling, and this book shares much of his knowledge. It is not a basic, &quot;How to Stack and Gait&quot; book, but picks up where those on just the mechanics of showing leave off. If you want to know about showing, this should be a MUST on your book list."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"George Alston is the consummate proofessional. This book is not for the beginner (Bob and Jane Forsyths book is for that), but rather for the person wanting to campaign their dogs. Mr. Alston's book told me things I hadn't learned in 25 years of showing dogs in Conformation as well as Obedience. He tells you the psychology of showing dogs, and the principles. He gives seminars around the country that are so popular, they are very hard to get into. This book basically covers everything he teaches in his seminars. He has an incredibly vast knowledge, and believes dogs should be handled kindly. I teach one of the largest Conformation classes in St. Louis, and I learned much of what I teach from Mr. Alston.

It's the second one I've purchased (get Peter Green's \\"New Secrets of Successful Dog Showing\\" for a great entry-level book) and I have already gained innumerable tips and insight that I will be putting to immediate use. What I found most refreshing was the perspective that the owner-handler is actually at an ADVANTAGE over the pro because 1) he probably only has one dog to focus on and 2) all things being equal the pro is going to be held to a higher standard of performance in the ring. Makes sense to me!I won't go into every detail of the book but I do have to say that what I appreciated the most was the admonishment to treat your dog as though they are a fine piece of art in the ring. Every touch, every motion on your part should give the impression that you are displaying a priceless Ming vase. So many times I've seen frustrated handlers (let's be honest here--I've BEEN one!) whose handling belays their frustration...particularly if the dog is getting wiggy in the ring. I am going to work on that illusion....that I am presenting a priceless china cup to the judge and they should feel honored to be allowed to handle it. My dog deserves that high respect regardless of whether or not he's the best specimen in the ring that day!There is a lot of info on campaigning in the Specials that I probably won't use, however I still mined it for jewels."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I went to my first show before reading this book - I would have avoided a couple of mistakes if I had read it first!

Pay attention to your dog, the judge, the ring conditions, and your competition. He gives great advice on how to adjust your stride, the leash, your grooming, etc. to give your dog the best opportunity to win. He also includes wonderful chapters on Psychology and Ring Etiquette, something that can make or break the handler - not just the dog.

The first thing you must know before you get this book is that unless you've been in the ring at least once, you won't understand a single word of what Alston says.Alston reveals many showring \\"secrets\\" (like sucking on a mint if you're nervous so your dog won't smell the adrenaline in your breath and get nervous himself), and there are a lot of interesting stories and good tips throughout the book.The one problem of this book is his utter contempt for owner-handlers. He seems to think that they don't know one end of the dog from the other, and that all they do is complain when they don't win and gripe about the politics, while the professional handler is the expert in all situations and never complains about the politics (which is untrue: I know this lady who is a professional handler AND a judge, and she is always complaining about the politics in the ring).If you seek a book that teaches you how to stack, bait, gait, etc. correctly, then this is not the book for you: Caroline Coile'sShow Me!will fit your needs."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge: Show Ring Secrets (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I couldn't believe how many times he belittled the &quot;owner-handler&quot; in this book.

He also liked to write about what &quot;the judge likes&quot; and how to hide faults instead of commenting on what is the most important aspect, the dog itself. I have found other handling books to be much less judgemental and more professionally written.

What is amazing is that this book was written in the spare time Cardinal Wiseman had available to write - from a man whose duty was not to compose novels but to take care of his flock, but reading the book one would think that it was written by a full time author. True, the book is not as finely written as \\"Quo Vadis\\" by Henryk Sienkievicz - the other great novel on early Christians - but the simplicity and directness of the writing is still charming and beautiful. And, like all great novels, it not only delivers a great plot - one day I read 200 pages in one sitting - it also provides profound insights into human nature and frailty, and has important lessons for everyone in humility. In this regard, the book can serve as a pedagogical tool for parents wishing to inculcate Christian virtues into their younger children."},{"Title":"Fabiola;: Or, The church of the catacombs,","review":"This book is a wonderful book! It is very informative. Set in ancient Rome during the reign of Emperor Diocletian. You will read about many saints, including St. Agnes and St. Sebastian. There were times when I didn't want to put the book down! This book will keep you reading!"},{"Title":"Fabiola;: Or, The church of the catacombs,","review":"Sharing this summary because I found it very helpful - hope you think so too. Note: *CONTAINS SPOILERS*\\"The story is set in Rome in the early 4th century AD, during the time of the persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Diocletian.The heroine of the book is Fabiola, a young beauty from a noble Roman family. She is spoiled by her father Fabius, who cannot deny her anything. Fabiola seems to have everything, including a superior education in the philosophers, yet under the surface, she is not content with her life. One day, in a fit of rage, she attacks and wounds her slave girl Syra, who is a secret Christian. The proud, spoiled Roman girl is humbled by Syra's humility, maturity and devotion to her in this situation, and a slow transformation begins, which finally culminates in her conversion to Christianity, brought on by Syra and of her own cousin Agnes, whom she adores and dotes on.Another thread of the story deals with the young boy Pancratius, a pious Christian and son of a martyr, who is himself preparing for martyrdom. Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his enemy the meaning of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed.Another major villain in the story is the enigmatic Fulvius, an apparently rich young man from the East who soon reveals himself to be a hunter of Christians who turns them in to the authorities for money. His aim on the one hand is to gain the hand of either Fabiola or Agnes, and on the other hand, to uproot the Christian community in Rome. After some dramatic events that reveal his surprising connections to Syra, who is his long-lost younger sister Myriam, Fulvius rejects his evil ways, converts to Christianity and becomes a hermit.The story also weaves a number of martyrdom accounts and legends of real-life Christian saints into the fictitious story. These include Saint Agnes, Saint Sebastian, Saint Pancras (Pancratius), Saint Cassian (Cassianus), Saint Emerentiana, and Saint Tarcisius. Two exceptions are the characters of Fabiola and of the blind beggar girl Caecilia, Syra's friend and fellow Christian; though they do bear saints' names, are not identical with Saint Fabiola (who lived later) and Saint Cecilia (whose legend is very different from Caecilia's story in the novel).\\""},{"Title":"Fabiola;: Or, The church of the catacombs,","review":"Read Fabiola when I was a teenager. The writing is well done and inspired.A detailed account of the early Christian era and the background in whichit developed and survived.

This volume includes the Monologion, the Proslogion, Gaunilo's reply to the ontological argument, and Anselm's reply to Gaunilo's reply. Anselm is known by the motto \\"faith seeking understanding.\\" However, it should be noted that Anselm is not \\"hoping to replace faith with understanding\\" (xiii) but rather the better that you come to know God \\"the more you will see that he is worthy of all your love\\" (xiv). The Monologion proceeds on these themes, exploring God's Divine attributes and provides a few arguments for the existence of God. The reader will be immediately struck by Anselm's obsession with semantics - Anselm argues that \\"systematic reflection on the language of Christian doctrine is... always in the service of a better understanding of God\\" (xv). Anselm also discusses the question of Biblical metaphor, Trinitarian theology, and the rational soul.The Proslogion contains the famous ontological argument. Anselm's ontological argument is as follows. Premise I: God is by definition that than which no greater can exist meaning that God is the most perfect object, the most perfect being that can be thought about. Secondly, it is understood that it is greater to exist in reality and the mind than to exist only in the mind. If you tell the fool who does not believe in God to think about the concept of that than which no greater can exist, that concept exists in his mind. Even the fool cannot doubt that the concept exists in his mind since he had heard it and understood it and \\"whatever is understood is in the mind\\" (pg 150). Premise II: Anselm states that that which exists in both the mind and in reality is greater than that which exists only in thought. God by definition is that than which no greater can exist and if it does not exist in reality it contradicts itself. Conclusion: God exists. The rest of the Proslogion applies this \\"proof\\" to other attributes of God.Gaunilo's primary objection to Anselm's ontological argument takes the form of an island. Premise I: Imagine the perfect island, the island that no greater than be thought. Premise II: The Island of that than which no greater can be thought plus existence is greater than the island in the mind. Conclusion: Thus, the perfect island of that which no greater can be thought exists in reality. But we know that that island surely cannot exist in reality. Then Gaunilo shows that one can prove every highest form of any kind using his argument. Thus, man can think of the perfectly evil being in the mind and prove its existence.Anselm replies that Gaunilo application of the island is a type of form, and the perfectly evil is a type of being. While in his ontological argument he was arguing for the greatest extent of being possible, not just a form of perfection, but ultimate perfection itself. In response to the argument that the mind cannot hold truth from \\"the verbal formula\\" (pg 150) Anselm states then the mind is not actually thinking of that than which no greater cannot be thought. And if the concept of than which no greater cannot be thought can be thought to exist then it must exist \\"of necessity\\" (pg 156).Sadly, the Introduction to this work is almost to brief to be of much use besides explaining Anselm's Proslogion and Monologion. Gaunilo's reply is practically ignored and the ramifications of Anselm's ontological argument are not even touched on. Anselm's proof has long reaching Philosophical implications and influence and this volume apply lays out for the diligent reader the necessary primary sources. A must buy for the those interested in Medieval History and Medieval Philosophy (and hopefully other philosophy buffs)!"},{"Title":"The Death of God Debate","review":"When the cover of the April 8, 1966 edition of Time magazine---the Easter edition---asked, \`IS GOD DEAD?' the movement in American theology called the \`Death of God' movement came into popular consciousness. Four Christian theologians---Gabriel Vahanian, Paul van Buren, and especially William Hamilton and Thomas J.J. Altizer---were the leaders of the movement.This book was published in 1967, and collects many of the most perceptive reviews and articles written on the subject, as well as letters from the public to Hamilton and Altizer, on the matter. It also includes at the end two previously unpublished articles by Hamilton and Altizer, and a reprint of an article by Vahanian, which provide a useful commentary.Although the DOG movement was rather \\"faddish,\\" there is some interesting material here (e.g., Hamilton's \\"We are not talking about the absence of the experience of God, but the experience of the absence of God,\\" or Vahanian's \\"the secular is the real and the real is the secular\\").Some other books that provide useful background are Thomas W. Ogletree'sThe Death of God Controversy: a Constructive Explanation of the Writings of Thomas J.J. Altizer, Wiland Charles N. Bent'sThe death-of-God movement;: A study of Gabriel Vahanian, William Hamilton, Paul Van Buren [and] Thomas J. J. Altizer, (Exploration books). Some conservative Christian critiques include John Warwick Montgomery'sThe Suicide of Christian Theologyand James D.

And Iowa's own Chloe Madsen is set to turn the Big Apple on its collective ear. (If apples can have ears!) Gibson's Girl is a delightful read from start to finish. Loved Anne McAllister's true to life characters. Gibson Walker is used to beautiful women--in varying states of dress and undress. As a high fashion photographer in Manhattan, he's photographed the most stunning women in the world. But none of those beauties prepare him for the down-to-earth warmth and sensuality of Chloe Madsen. Chloe has come to New York to get the bright lights out of her system before she settles down to a sensible, comfortable life with her sensible, comfortable boyfriend back in sensible, comfortable Iowa. Sensibility and comfort are out the window from the moment she lays eyes on Gibson Walker. Heaven is in Iowa. And it's in New York. It's anywhere these two characters come together. A definite keeper!"},{"Title":"Gibson's Girl (Harlequin Presents #2060)","review":"Gibson Walker was appalled when Chloe Madsen came to work for him. he's only agree to employ her as a favor-- he had no time to babysit an innocent small town girl. So why was he finding himself tormented by Chloe's shy beauty-- and infuriated that she didnt even notice him?Chloe didnt dare notice Gib. She was already engaged, and only in NY for the summer. besides, Gibson walker was exactly the sort of man mothers warn their daughters about: sinfully gorgeous and determinedly single!this is a fun read, but dont expect it to be one of your favorites. i enjoyed reading this book but this is the type of book that i wouldnt read twice. I found some of what's happening absurb and the guy wasnt up to my standard for an ideal hero.

The first three short stories follow a small-time tough named Alyx on a series of typical fantasy adventures. Alyx is an engaging character who fights and battles with her wits against sea monsters and pirates. The third story, \\"The Barbarian,\\" shows a bit of a turn, as Russ has Alyx do battle against a sort of Faustian figure. At this point, Alyx as a character seems to have sparked Russ' creative interest, as the stories now go beyond the standard fantasy fare.The most ambitious of the items in this collection is the novella \\"Picnic on Paradise.\\" Russ puts Alyx into a future where a \\"commercial war\\" is being fought, and her job is to transport a group to a port on a planet called Paradise. When they arrive at the location of the port, they find it has been destroyed. They then trek for two months across Paradise to find a safe haven. Through that journey, Alyx battles monsters and human attackers, feels love, and experiences loss, as Paradise dishes out as much hell as possible. While the story wanders a bit during this trek, it shows Russ growing in her abilities as a writer.The final story, \\"The Second Inquisition,\\" is a bit of a departure. The narrator is not named, and she does not act or seem like Alyx in many ways. However, we are clearly meant to see her as such, not only because of the story's inclusion in this volume, but also because the tag-line that ends all the stories takes on a variation in this story. The story here is an inter-textual sci-fi story that relies as much on H.G. Wells as it does on standard sci-fi conventions. Russ is also at her most feminist in this story--thus pointing toward her future writing--and her prose is crisp and quick moving. While \\"The Second Inquisition\\" is an odd end to this collection, it is the strongest entry in this uneven collection."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Alyx","review":"When I read this book when it first came out, I remember thinking how great it was to finally find something written by a woman who was not hidding her gender under a masculine pseudonym or who had to use just initials for a first name.In retrospect, after many years, I realize the only thing I remember about it is that it sounded like Lesbian soft core porn with males reduced to mechanical sex slaves for the domineering females. This was considered very avant-garde stuff then before it turned out that real feminism just consisted in having women having access to well paying professional jobs (doctors, lawyers, etc.).The real future turned out to be a lot more prosaic but more empowered than we could ever have imagined."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Alyx","review":"Joanna Russ is a big name in feminist science fiction for a reason: she was one of the first big radical noisemakers in a predominantly male world.First does not always mean best, and even best does not necessarily mean great.I'm sure that die hard feminists would disagree with me, but, after sharing this and other Russ books with my female feminist friends, I can only say that her work is sometimes good, sometimes passable, sometimes garbage. Rarely great. The Female Man is an IMPORTANT book, but by far not a GREAT book.This collection is probably the best, and not coincidentally, the least radical she has to offer. It is certainly more enjoyable, although could not be considered important.It contains several stories collected from other sources (presumably previously published stories from magazines) containing, loosely, a chronological tale of an adventurer named Alyx. The descriptions and chronology are variously inconsistent; this is not necessarily a bad thing, since the stories stand independent, and since they are suppposed to represent an idea more than a single character.Her writing style is short sentences and sentence fragments, if that is your sort of thing. Also of note, this book contains what is probably her only reference to heterosexual sex (I could be wrong, but there were no other references in the two other books of hers that I read).Russ has often been vocal about getting people to go out and read the female corpus of literature, naming some great women writers as her inspirations. I agree; there are some great women writers. You should probably read them instead."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Cloak: An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists","review":"January 1, 2003: Bought this collection of diary and journal entries based on a review that said it would be a great book to leave in the guest bedroom for visitors. Have resolved to read a day's worth of entries each morning, and finish the book in one year.February 16, 2003: Have discovered that this book is much more conveniently placed in the bathroom, where I am sure to spend five minutes each morning, rather than the guest bedroom.April 13, 2003: What a remarkable collection of fascinating historical figures! The featured diarists are carefully chosen, as are the selected entries. Together they span four centuries and at least as many continents.June 1, 2003: Have started to develop personal favorites among the many diarists. Pepys, for his unrepentant lasciviousness. Chips Channon, for his loveable pretentiousness. Kafka, for being Kafka. Warhol, for being Warhol. Coppola, for her intriguing insights into the life of her film-making husband. Woolf, for her introspective moodiness. Gide, for his sarcasm and arrogance.July 5, 2003: Have become utterly addicted to my morning routine with this book, and have now started reading ahead.July 29, 2003: Have only two minor complaints so far. One is that the diarists are predominantly British - perhaps a more diverse selection would have been better. The second is that there is a disproportionate number of entries during the WWII time period. Without doubt a fascinating and important time, historically, so I guess this is understandable.August 7, 2003: Finished the collection, almost five months early. Will now return this book to my guest room, where friends and family will be sure to enjoy it for years to come."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Cloak: An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists","review":"I don't recall hearing any press buzz when this book came out, and I can't understand why. This is a brilliantly edited collection of excerpts from diarists both famous and obscure. Some of the most interesting entries were written by total unknowns, including people of whom one would not even suspect literacy. One-paragraph biographies of all diarists appear at the end of the book, for reference.The genius of the editors, which sounds like a gimmick but isn't, is their arrangment of the excerpts by the month and day that the entries were written. Within each day, the entries jump magnificently from century to century, and from author to author, so that the voices that the reader hears, and the perspectives on history and society that the reader gains, are constantly shifting. For example, entries of European Jews in the midst of the Holocaust are juxtaposed with British entries from the same era--and German entries from twenty years earlier.The format makes for more richness of texture than any one diarist could. This book calls to mind Thomas Mallon's _A Book of One's Own_. Mallon's book groups diarists by type, however, not entries by day, and Mallon provides a great deal more commentary than the editors of _The Assassin's Cloak_ do. The Taylors let their own quirky choices of entries provide implied commentary.Warning: this book is 600 pages long, and highly addictive. A must read for anyone interested in diaries and journals."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Cloak: An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists","review":"This huge, juicy anthology is packed chock-full, in chronological order, of tasty tidbits from diarists of four centuries -- some the usual suspects (Pepys, de Beauvoir, Warhol), others you've probably never heard of, or at least not in this context (who knew Brian Eno kept a diary?). Some were writing for themselves alone, others knew darn well their journals would be published some day. All are eminently readable and completely intriguing. Expect to spend many happy evenings curled up in a chair reading May Sarton's opinion on why people under 40 shouldn't live alone, Liane de Pougy's memory of her wedding night, Noel Coward's description of a Beatles concert, Stendahl's observation that eating peas made him less lustful, and many, many more."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Cloak: An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists","review":"Reading diaries from the dead, has always made me feel like a voyeur, looking into half open windows, the curtains partially drawn, and seeing what shouldn't be seen. Granted, some diarists write to be read, while most, in my opinion, do not. But there is a kind of sweet pleasure in committing a misdemeanour and getting away with it - which is the sensation one feels when reading this anthology.There are some 170 diarists in this anthology, some well known and others not so, and well over 1800 entries, containing profound thoughts of the time from a few great historical figures to the routine-filled humdrum of the day-to-day. The humdrum day-to-day, in most cases, was a lot more interesting because it is usually what people do everyday that provides insight into their character and the times in which they lived.On the front flap of the cover is a single line that really defines a great diarist - \\"The best diarists are those who write without looking over their shoulders.\\" That total lack of self-consciousness, that pure honesty that comes with writing about self and others, is certainly a pleasure for the reader. For example, a simple line, almost an after thought, written by the French novelist, Andre Gide - \\"It requires a great effort to convince myself that I am as old as those who seemed to me old when I was young.\\"Because this anthology includes both famous diarists and those not so famous, many unknown individuals in some cases, there is a biography section at the back which gives a brief history for each contributor, that for me, managed to provide enough background information for the entries to be much more meaningful.As with most anthologies, one does not necessarily need to read them chronologically, but can dip, skip and choose ar random as the particular mood dictates. This is the perfect book to have by your bed to read a few short or long entries before falling to sleep. One can sample a taste of the 16th century with one of the most famous diarists, Samuel Pepys, and jump a few pages ahead to read Andy Warhol and his unusual observations about some famous people and New York's art world of the sixties.Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Cloak: An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists","review":"What a surprisingly marvellous anthology. I was initially put off by the arrangement - with wildly disparate entries for each day of the month, at first this seemed more like a novelty book than a serious exploration of diarists and their work. Yet I've found this eclectic approach to be absolutely perfect, not least because the entries for each day have been so thoughtfully selected: some amplify the themes of the others, while some offer instead a comic or tragic counterpoint. Indeed, comedy is one of the hallmarks of this edition: diaries are always \\"bitchy\\", to some extent - as the title suggests, the diary is like an assassin's cloak we wear while stabbing comrades in the back with a pen - and the dark, neurotic humour so typical of the diarist is here in spades. The Taylors have also been kind enough to package their selections with an insightful introductory essay, thumbnail biographies of all their sources, along with full bibliographical references and a comprehensive index by diarist. The only thing missing is an index by subject - but that would probably be bigger than the volume itself. This is a brilliant, must-have anthology for anyone interested in literature, social history, and the art of the diary."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Cloak: An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists","review":"Fascinating stuff. The book progresses through each day of the 366 (leap year, too) calendar days. Excerpts from all the diaries are organized in chronological order (from earliest year to most current year) within each day.The earliest you get is from the 1600s (usually Samuel Pepys) on up through Alec Guiness and others in the mid 1990s. The excerpts vary from only one phrase to about a page. The stuff from the 1660s is rendered with its own peculiar spelling and grammar. You really get an amazing sense of our shared humanity across the ages.I deemed its only overall flaw to be a preponderance of British entries and World War II entries. Plus, two entries I wished I hadn't read: the artist Delacroix blandly witnessing the mistreatment of a horse, and some English guy shooting a heron.The excerpts from Jewish diarists right before the Holocaust were chilling.There were diarists who became my favorites:Eleanor Coppola (a shy woman in a high-profile world);Virginia Woolf (wonderfully perceptive about herself and her social class);Noel Coward (often hilarious);Alan Bennett (gentle irony);Evelyn Waugh and H.L. Mencken (both funny like Coward but even more acerbic);Andy Warhol (so banal); andKatherine Mansfield (haunting).There were other diarists I grew to dislike:Goebbels (fanatically anti-Semetic);Brothers Goncourt (misogynistic);Alan Clark (also misogynistic);Marie Bashkirtseff and Liane de Pougy (twits);and Leo Tolstoy and Franz Kafka (both morbid and difficult).Overall, a varied and fascinating window on the world of journal-keeping."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Cloak: An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists","review":"For a compulsive reader or diary-phile, I can't imagine a better day book to accompany you through a year. To take 10 minutes out of the day and read the wonderful (really--I wondered at some of the things that people would write in the diaries) selection of entries for the day will provide you with a refreshing start, bookend, or break for your day (your choice). Even the potted biographies of the diarists (found at the back of the book) are delightful.The authors have provided some lovely groupings of entries. January starts off with three entries from Mahler's lover, stretched over three successive days, that made me laugh. More complex emotionally is the chain at the end of January: two different diarists record the death and funeral services of George V of England in 1936, along with the assencsion of Edward III. A few days later is a recollection of meetings between Charlie Chaplin and Edward III (now the Duke of Windsor after renouncing his crown for Wallis Simpson) in the middle of World War II. Towards the end of January, in the 1930's, Count Ciano records the advice he gives Mussolini--on the same day, but in 1943, a nurse records the arrival of refugee children evacuated from Italy.Some small errors in the bios at the back that I noticed: Goebbels kept his diary right until 1945 (not just until 1941); Delacroix did start his diary at 24 but dropped it after 2 years and did not resume it until he was 50 (the bio suggests that he kept his diary continuously); Pepy's diary wasn't kept in code but written in shorthand (a contemporaneous book describing the system Pepys used has been discovered)--but these are hardly the point with this delightful book. On the other hand, I didn't think that Woodeforde's diary revealed author to be a glutton (as the editors suggest) but I may not have read between the lines sufficiently.I found this book on the remaindered shelf of my local bookstore (a crime!) but it even made the price right for me: $7.00 Canadian.Wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Cloak: An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists","review":"This is a charming and wonderful book. I too am surprised that it did not get more \\"buzz\\" at the time it was published.How fascinating it is to eavesdrop, as it were, on authors' musings about their life and art. The diary entries help me fill in a multi-dimensional picture of what Virginia Woolf, Kafka, Dawn Powell, and others were like.But not all the diarists are famous. Ordinary people's journals tell us a great deal about what it was like to be a Londoner evacuated during the Nazi bombing, or a wealthy slaveowner in the American South just before the Civil War.There are, to this American's taste, too many British diarists here and too few Americans. I would have loved to have read a U.S. senator or cabinet member's personal observations of some political dust-up, but alas, that is not here. So I read the book at least partly as a window into British civilization."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Cloak: An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists","review":"I love this book! It took me two orders to actually get it. It's out of print, and the first order from The Book Depository never arrived. Amazon did refund the money (thank you!), and then about 2 months later, there's the book. AFTER the second order had arrived. I reported this and paid for the first order. Are you still with me? I now have two copies--one at home and one at my office. This is very nice. When I want a piece of candy, I read an entry or two. I love the organization by date.

I wish it weren't out of print and were easier to get."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"This book is one of my top ten favorites. I bought my first copy in 1972 for my father who passed away a year later. I have re-read this book many times with increased pleasure each time. It not only has Charles Russell's drawings and paintings, it has some of the best short stories I have ever read. I've lived in the West pretty much all my life and the characters he portrays ring so true that you know he knew them. He not only knew them, he was able to capture their essence in a few words. I usually don't laugh out loud at what I'm reading, but many of these stories are just plain &quot;laugh out loud&quot; funny. Anyone who enjoys Cowboy Poetry needs to have this in their library. It's not poetry per se, but gives you the same Western flavor in its writing. Most of the stories can be read in 5 minutes or less. I give it a solid 10 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"This is a classic work of Western nonfiction by a Montana artist whose drawings and paintings helped create the iconography of the early cowboy of the open range. Also a storyteller, Russell wrote this collection of yarns and memories before his death, commemorating frontier life in the closing decades of the nineteenth century. It was published in 1927, with an introduction by Will Rogers in the form of a cowboy eulogy. The original edition featured more than 50 of Russell's illustrations, some of them in color.Unlike the fairly rollicking account of Teddy Blue Abbott, his cowboy contemporary, Russell's book is a more melancholy view of what he remembers as the good old days. His stories are told in an ironic vernacular by an old-timer cowboy named Rawhide Rawlins. Many concern the adventures of cowboys; many also feature Native Americans, in the early years of the agencies (reservations), portrayed with some complexity of feelings, ranging from fear and distrust to respect. Some are outrageously tall tales. Some are spirited character sketches, capturing something of life on the rough, raw land before settlement and homesteading, the motorcar, and civilization - before the plow broke the prairie sod where buffalo and then cattle and cowboys ranged freely.One of the finest pieces of Western writing occurs in the last chapter, &quot;Longrope's Last Guard,&quot; which describes in vivid detail the experience of riding herd on a pitch dark night as the stillness is shattered by an electrical storm that stampedes the cattle and takes the life of one of the men. The burial of the dead cowboy on the open prairie and the subsequent disappearance of his grave is symbolic of the passing of the brief frontier era Russell's words and pictures embrace.I recommend this book for its capturing of the historical cowboy as remembered by a man who was there and lived among them. As a companion volume, I also recommend Teddy Blue Abbott's &quot;We Pointed Them North,&quot; a well-detailed and more light-hearted recollection of the same time and place."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Will Rogers said Charlie Russell wasn't &quot;just another&quot; cowboy artist, he wasn't &quot;just another&quot; anything. Though remembered mostly for his paintings, this book proves that Charlie Russell was a keen observer of human nature. This is a sentimental look back at a world that disappeared in Russell's lifetime. The stories will leave you nostalgic for a time you never knew."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Nothing compares to the facts, and no one who has not lived this could write it as C.M. Russell did. This old cowpuncher commands the written word and infuses the reader with his perfection -- the imagery of clear storytelling and spirit of those long-gone times. This he does quite as well as he wields the brush to canvas. I read it at a sitting, and will do it again as there are some facts in here about horses, people and buffalo that I did not know before. Another way of thinking and presenting a story about the actual facts is handed down in Trails Plowed Uder (1927) from former times . . . by this gifted sentimentalist."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"You would generously call this Amazon editon an oversight, otherwise it's a shameless fleecing because for the same price The University of Nebraska press edition, current, for the same price has the many sketches from the original.The Doubleday hardcover editions had five, double-paged color iillustrations, five half-tone illustrations and forty three sketches, This Amazon edition has none, which for a Charles M. Russell book is inexcusable."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Most people realize Charles Russell was a wonderfully gifted, world renowned artist who chronicled Western life with a myriad of sketches and paintings that grace the finest art museums in the world today. His work is meticulous with an attention to detail second to none. What few of us realized is that as good an artist as he was, he was an equally gifted author.Published a few months before his death, Trails Plowed Under is a compendium of 43 short stories. He often complained of being \\"deaf and dum\\" with a pen but these writings, or yarns as he called them, certainly prove otherwise. In them he covers various aspects of everyday cowboy life from animals and stampedes to the colorful characters that peopled the American West as he knew it. Having cowboyed all his life he knew his subject well and he leaves behind a prism through which we today can catch a glimpse of the past as it was.This book will tug on your emotions. You will laugh, reflect, think and admire Russell's skill with words. Some of these stories are undoubtedly true while others are designed to definitely pull your leg.There is not a rotten apple in the barrel."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Charles Russell left us a wonderful gift in these stories. He managed to capture a first-person account of the Old West. I read this book many years ago, and recently re-read portions. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys good American western writing.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Charles Russell's stories are second to none and fun for all ages. His art is also a big part of the experience. Tragically the ebook version does not contain any of Russell's great images. Poorly done, Kindle folks. However the literature is great."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"If you know who Charlie Russell is, you probably don't need to read this to know that this book is one of the most fascinating sources of first-hand information about America's Old Wild West. It's not a history book, and it's not about people you would have heard of. This is a collection of stories Charlie has either told or heard from others and retold. Accompanied by about 5 color plates and several drawings, it is worth the price for the artwork alone. Try to get one with the dustcover intact. Top it off with a foreword by Will Rogers, and you have one of the best books ever published on the subject. The language is in the vernacular of old Montana, and the stories are told as if he was standing in front of a campfire talking to friends -- something Russell did a lot of, and something for which his friends, like Rogers, missed him greatly when he passed.Russell was one of the great painters of the old West, and many of his works fetched record-breaking prices during his lifetime. Now they hang in museums all over the world, especially the Russell Museum in Great Falls and the Amon Carter in Fort Worth. Published in 1927 and originally sold for $5.95, it's a shame this book hasn't been reprinted for modern audiences. But the original old books, if they were cared for, look like they just popped out of the printer's press. The paper has aged well, and the binding is perfect. You can read this book easily without wrestling with the pages.Though the stories are usually short, you find them wedged into cowboy movies -- almost every cowboy movie ever made contains at least something from these pages. Here you sense the animosity between the white Americans who pushed the frontier ever-westward, and the Indians who resisted being forced out of their native hunting grounds, villages, and homes. But Russell never stoops to criticism of either race. He tells it like it was, and lets you put together the pieces. He admired Native Americans as the amazing people they were and still are, and portrayed them honestly and sympathetically. At the same time, they could be scary in battle, and in some of his tales the Indians (and the Cowboys, too) will raise the hair on the back of your neck.If you are a fan of the old West, this book is absolutely essential reading. One thing to watch out for: be sure to ask the seller to check and make sure the plates are intact. People used to buy this book, cut out the color plates, frame them, and hang them on the wall. It was a very cheap way to acquire 5 Charlie Russell paintings. Specify to the seller that you want the color plates intact, and that you will return the book if they are missing or damaged.Shooshie"},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Wonderful, expressive book of tales and happenings in the life of Western artist Charles M.

Great read!!!!"},{"Title":"A Panorama of American Film Noir (1941-1953)","review":"In 1946, French critic Nino Frank gave the cynical, existential, expressionist, and often erotic crime thrillers that Hollywood had been producing since around 1940 a name. He called them \\"film noir\\", after \\"s&eacute;rie noire\\", the French expression used to describe crime and detective novels. In 1955, Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton, film scholars from Toulouse, France, gave \\"film noir\\" an identity. They published \\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\", which became the basis of all film noir theory that followed. This 2002 edition is the first time the book has been published in its entirety in English.Noir theorist James Naremore has written a valuable new introduction to the book, in which is explains the reception that American film noir received in France in the post-war era, the Surrealist environment from which noir film theory emerged, and why \\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\" was so influential.\\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\", attempts to define \\"film noir\\", identify its sources and influences, and to document its rise and fall. The first three chapters focus on definitions and sources, from the obvious hard-boiled crime novels to the events of WWII. \\"The War Years and the Formation of a Style\\" follows the genesis of film noir from 1941-1945. \\"The Glory Days\\" explores the apogee of film noir, when films such as \\"Gilda\\", \\"The Big Sleep\\", \\"Sorry, Wrong Number\\", and a trio from Alfred Hitchcock exemplified a fully developed style, 1946-1948. \\"Decadence and Transformation\\" traces noir's shift toward realism and location shoots in the period 1949-1950. And \\"The Demise of a Series\\" discusses some of the last true film noirs of the classic era, 1951-1953, as Hollywood moved toward escapism. Two chapters, \\"Influences\\" and \\"French Film Noir\\" discuss the role of psychoanalysis and crime films in film noir, as well as noir's influence on the cinematic traditions of Italy, France, and England. In the book's final chapter, \\"A Balance Sheet\\", the authors summarize the characteristics of film noir, its sources, history, and repercussions. They also explain \\"A Panorama of Film Noir\\"'s purpose, limitations, and methodology with impressive foresight. The authors added a Postface in 1979.In the back of the book, you will find a chronology of major film noirs 1941-1954 and an alphabetical filmography that includes titles from the 1955 original publication plus those referred to in the 1979 postface. There is an index of films, books, periodicals, names and various related works of art.The prose of \\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\" can be awkward at times. Translator Paul Hammond has chosen, correctly, to convey the meaning of the French as closely as possible, if it means sacrificing fluidity. \\"Influences\\" and \\" French Film Noir\\" are particularly disjointed. This treatise was written for academics, not the average movie-goer, and employed a new vocabulary at the time, so I don't suppose one can expect it to be eloquent. \\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\" is noir theory's seminal work and an insightful and essential read for film noir enthusiasts."},{"Title":"A Panorama of American Film Noir (1941-1953)","review":"Though often neglected today, Borde and Chaumeton's seminal piece &quot;A Panorama of American Film Noir&quot; was the book that first identified film noir as a genre. This piece, which is nearly 50 years old, is a wonderful way to explore the genre of film noir from the perspective of an audience member who was experiencing the films when they were released - not in retrospect.This edition offers a great introudction by Noir expert and author, James Naremore as well as a chronology, filmography, and film stills. &quot;A Panorama of American Film Noir&quot; is a classic piece of film history."},{"Title":"A Panorama of American Film Noir (1941-1953)","review":"After all the controversy over the constitution of film noir, it can only be edifying to read the perspective of classic-period French critics. Indeed, it was Gallic mentality that first recognized and recorded the phenomenon, and--if these writers are representative of their ethnic mainstrem--surmised that noir was born of an infusion of angst into the cinematic puritanism of the Anglo nations. While American scholars have often seen noir as a reaction to good times (as comedy is a reaction to bad), the authors site only the related relevance of World War II in its capacity to desensitize audiences to stark screen violence. Furthermore, they label only a handful of films as true noir and assess many other features--such as police and psychological dramas--as merely possessing qualities of noir. The book discusses a myriad of these movies in a colorful but easily comprehended style that avoids becoming parched with pedogogic discourse. A lengthy, up-to-1979 filmography, which also includes non-American films, has been added to the text--and is of particular interest in listing features not commonly called noir, such as cartoons and sci-fi thrillers. (I always knew Soylent Green was black!) Digression aside--for those with amour de noir, this book is de rigueur!"},{"Title":"A Panorama of American Film Noir (1941-1953)","review":"Succinctly translated into English by Paul Hammond, A Panorama of American Film Noir 1941-1953 is a remarkable and collaborative work by Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton which was originally published in France in 1955. A Panorama Of American Film Noir offers unique insights into the dark surrealism and ambivalent atmosphere of Hollywood's film noir glory days. A brilliant critique of classic movies and the American culture that created them; as well as a film noir chronology and filmography enhance this masterful work which is strongly recommended for personal, professional, and academic Cinematic Studies reference collections and supplemental reading lists."},{"Title":"A Panorama of American Film Noir (1941-1953)","review":"Film noir is the stupendously important American contribution to moviedoms decades long production of dopey epics, musicals and animated animal films. Film noir spanned the decades since the 1930's and included movies that included all the major and so called minor movie stars working in Hollywood. Finally, I would consider American made film noir as the third stool of Americas contribution to world culture. The other two being the invention of jazz and pulp fiction, a cousin and source of film noir. What else can be said about such a seminal contribution."},{"Title":"The Insurrection in Dublin","review":"An excellent book for those who want to know the effect of the 1916 Easter rising on the average Dubliner. Walking out one morning the author narrates how he saw small groups of people gathered on each corner. They all seemed to be looking in the same direction. He finally stops to inquire what is going on and hears that the Sinn Fein have taken over parts of the city. From there the book recounts his spectator's view of the uprising.The book is not a military or political history so it doesn't cover the planning of the uprising or the responses of the British. Instead the author narrates his observations and the reactions of the people around him as the uprising continues. At first people are in shock and even angry at the insurrectionists. But then, as the days pass and the uprising continues Stephans is puzzled. More and more he notices people smiling. It is only later that he realizes that they are smiling out of pride. If the uprising had been immediately quashed they would have been depressed. However as the fighting dragged on the author recounts the growing feeling of pride that the people began to have for those involved in the futile uprising. All in all a great book for those who want insight into stirrings of nationalism in a people."},{"Title":"Messer Marco Polo","review":"A mixture of three elements give this simple tale a unique flavor. A modern Irishman tells the adventures of a Christian Italian in pagan China. Irish mysticism mingles with the mystery of the east for a romantic and tragic love story based upon the visit of Marco Polo to the court of Kubla Kahn. In one framework we have folk tale, history and imagination . His simple narrative style is a kind very rarely found among modern authors: it suggests the fireside stories and poems of the past which passed from generation to generation by word of mouth.&quot;A very magically beautiful book.&quot; -James Branch Cabell"},{"Title":"Messer Marco Polo","review":"This is the story of the explorer Marco Polo, as told by an Irish bard. The Irishness of the telling is as thick as the head on a Guiness Stout -- the very Irish-sounding Pope is a particular treat -- and the China of its imagining is very unlikely ever to have existed. But the love between Marco and Golden Bells, the daugher of the Khan, was the first great love story I ever encountered, and I have no more recovered from it than I have recovered from my own first love. I understand why this is sometimes categorized as children's literature. The story is simple, romantic, lyrical, a kind of storytelling that has long gone out of style. But I read this when I was sixteen, and it has remained my favorite book ever since.\\"Never let your dream be taken from you,\\" the Pope tells Marco, and if you read this at a certain age, you may be moved to tears, as I was, and am."},{"Title":"Messer Marco Polo","review":"Great story, well told!

My kind of guy. Translated from French, Eliade writes in the middle chapter of this short book describing the important role of the mythic androgyne. God can only be expressed fully as a paradoxical coincidence of opposites. If God were expressed wholly as a human, that human would be both entirely female and entirely male simultaneously. Thus Jesus, at least post-resurrection, must have been an androgyne (not merely intersex) as was the pre-Woman Adam. He traces a number of Biblical and non-canonical early Christian sources with variations on this theme, showing this idea is already built by God into our brains. I don't know that Eliade ever remarked about modern transgenderism - he liked history too much - but I am sure he would have loved genderqueer and intergender. Personally, this has become the foundation of my thinking on Transgenderism."},{"Title":"The ancestry of Edward Rawson, secretary of the colony of Massachusetts Bay: With some account of his life in old and New England","review":"This is a must for your family history.

He knows me as well as anyone. He knows I'm struggling with my \\"fishing experience\\" and looking for direction. I don't need to catch the biggest fish or experience the newest destinations. I need to fish. I need to fly fish. Ted Leeson helped tell me why. This book spoke to my soul. It corrected my direction. I have read many fishing books, some technical some just good stories. The first time, and I'll read it again, I read this book I realized early on that I needed to read it slowly, introspectively. I was in this book. Mr. Leeson spoke to me. He answered my direction question when he said, \\"In the end, to fish well is to cultivate an arrangement of time and place, of circumstance and perspective. We arrange ourselves into the arrangement, and if the collusion is careful and lucky, we reap a kind of enclosed moment of some sharply felt beauty and significance.\\" The Habit of Rivers is a special book and I recommend it to any fly fisher looking for direction or confirmation."},{"Title":"The habit of rivers: Reflections on trout streams and fly fishing","review":"As Ted Leeson writes in the introduction, \\"...this book is an attempt to discover points of fixity and pattern in our involvement with rivers and landscapes, with trout and fly fishing, as a way of plumbing their peculiar sustaining power\\".If this strikes you as so much hooey, you might as well stop right there on page 4 and cut your losses. There's a lot more of this kind of cerebral musing throughout The Habit of Rivers.If on the other hand, cerebral musing is what overtakes you as you fish, or if you don't fish but you do tend to muse cerebrally just for the heck of it, then this book's for you, for sure.Here's a sampler of what's in store...* The river is a flux, the salmon a counterflux. To fish the run is to share this paradoxical trajectory, moving at once forward to a conclusion and backward toward sources.* The universe may, as science tells us, be composed of subatomic building blocks, but I suspect that irony is the mortar that holds them together. For no apparent reason, fate springs a handstand, inverting circumstance, momentarily turning the world into its opposite. In nature, the reversal produces vaguely disturbing anomalies.* The very boundedness of the meadow and the tangibility of its limits curls your awareness inward, creating a small enclosed world inside of which boundaries disappear.If your awareness doesn't easily curl inward to recognize this as a book about fishing, pick up something by Lefty Kreh. As for me, I reveled in the vaguely disturbing anomalies, and highly recommend it to both fishermen and non fishermen alike."},{"Title":"The habit of rivers: Reflections on trout streams and fly fishing","review":"Leeson is certainly a master at his craft of writing. But you need to like his style if you're to enjoy this book. You might love it, I just didn't. It's a bit choppy in it's delivery, a bit too many metaphors for my tastes, too many adjectives that seem to me to be just a bit too much. Read Middleton, or read some Steve Raymond, then read this, and if you like Leeson's style better that's great and more power to you. When I look for fishing books I want the author to just tell me what the heck they like and why without making it complicated, convoluted and metaphorical. You can get \\"deep\\" if you like, but too much of that and the motivation for writing the book is in question. \\"Deep\\" isn't a writing style, it's a feeling from the heart. I just don't think it comes through as much as other folks say it does. It is NOT a bad book, but if there are folks looking for Thoreau, this isn't Thoreau."},{"Title":"The habit of rivers: Reflections on trout streams and fly fishing","review":"Mr. Leeson's book is about flyfishing, but it is not your typical flyfishing book.

The author covers a lot of ground and has a lot of real practical examples.I would recommend reading it. The author relates patterns to architecture, component based development, data persistence, pluggable architectures, algorithms, code efficiency, and a ton of other great topics. He also relates the topics to real world scenarios, so it is all very practical. He also uses TDD to build tests to show how to test the implementations of the components he builds.The author also make extensive use of Generics, which lend themselves very well to patterns. He has some great examples of how to use them to modify the tradition GOF patterns to make the more .NET 2.0 savvy.He also points out when to use interfaces and when it is appropriate to use classes in component development, which is very important to know.Over all I think the author does a great job of showing how to use patterns in real life OOP.There are two downsides to the book. One is the style in which it is written. Things are broken down very well and you need to really pay attention to what points the author is making. The other down side it the downloadable code. It is a chaotic mess and it's not usable."},{"Title":"Foundations of Object-Oriented Programming Using .NET 2.0 Patterns","review":"To those of us who started programming back in the dark, dark ages when languages didn't have any 'object orientation' to them but were procedural in nature the new concept of OO is particularly difficult to grasp. So many books start out with a definition of OO something like \\"an object can be anything ...' Obviously this is BS because that cup of tea sitting on my desk is an object but has little to do with programming. Then these books don't mention objects again for a hundred pages or more.If we've had to write using an OO language, we tend to copy down the stuff that goes at the beginning and end of the program and then write the programming using an OO language but using a procedural style.This book is different. He starts out with a chapter on essentials of OO programming. And By Golly, what he says makes sense. What I'm saying is that he has a writing style that appeals to me, makes sense to me, that approaches the problem in a way that I can understand.This book explains several concepts, OO, Patterns, C#, .NET 2.0 in sufficient detail to get a grasp of what we're trying to do without being so detailed that we get bogged down in a pit so deep that we can't see out. After reading it, I'm ready to move on to learning more of each of these subjects, as well as some others that he touched on."},{"Title":"Foundations of Object-Oriented Programming Using .NET 2.0 Patterns","review":"I am just about thru with ch03. Some very good stuff on Interfaces, generics, factory and bridge patterns. The code examples in the book and those available from Apress hinder rather than help me to understand the very good knowledge the author tries to convey. For me I need to approach this book with emphasis on being very diligent on absorbing detail. At times I need to re-read a chapter to completely understand what he is saying. I think some of that is due to the nature of the information but a bit from my point of view it lacks some necessary editing for continuity. But for me its worth the effort although I don't like to have to work so hard getting the examples to work. I have not been able to compile cleanly any of the code from Apress. Frankly, when I learning new technology I don't want to spend more time trying to figure out how the examples compile than I spend reading the book.

Having said that, could I sit here and figure everything out. Sure I could but that's not the point. I bought the book to learn and get a different perspective. For me, looking and stepping through examples is how I learn. The author admits the source is horribly organized.

I payed a fraction of the published price - however, I have to say, I am having a huge reaction of repulsion to this book - regardless of the price.I have a few years of .Net Coding, and decades of programming experience. I know enough to realize that there are some really beginning things in this book, and some concepts that are just a bit past a beginner. I find the writing style irratic and irritating.It could be that part of the problem is that the publisher did not put the authors paragraphs through an Editorial team and make the author keep his style clear and simple. (A technical reviewer would not do that) The Editorial team would make sure that the English states a theme and stays on topic to a point of clarity that really seems to be missing in what I have seen so far. If there was an Editorial team, they missed the boat - a book should never have gone to print this bad.Only one other technical book has ever created such a strong repulsion before and that was over 10 years ago. That older book sounded like they were too full of themselves - I cannot point to that in this - at least so far it just seems to be extremely irratic in its presentation to the point that I find it terribly annoying.I am not even sure that the hoped for \\"Pattern's\\"(e.g Gang of Four) will be fully developed in what I have seen so far. My reaction to the writing was enough to want to post a review to warn others.

If you are pushed to defend OOP to a non believer, to justify its existence, it really all boils down to patterns - reusable code, self documenting classes, robust, maintainable applications, all the benefits of OOP are actually benefits of the Patterns it enables.Still not all religions are created equal, and neither are the books about Patterns. This one is written by an author with a gift for making the simple complex, and the elegant obtuse. His examples (all in C# and making extensive use of advanced features like Generics) almost all fail to enlighten, while his prose rambles unbearably with constant repetition of mundane asides (and this is not a very long book for such a broad subject matter).Not content to touch on dozens of patterns he also tries to introduce .NET, Nunit test framework, Log4Net logging package, NHibernate O/R persistence layer (yes really). Predictably the result is one of those high speed tours of a strange city (\\"and on our left we are passing the Command pattern while if you look to our right we just used the NUnit framework\\"...)I could not decide if Christian does not understand his subject matter or is just a poor author in need of a good editor, but either way there are some lovely pattern books available so dont waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"Speaking of Trust: Conversing With Luther About the Sermon on the Mount (Lutheran Voices)","review":"A unique and helpful way to study the New Testament's Sermon on the Mount.

I'm a lay person who enjoys more meaty texts that are written above an eighth grade level, but not intended for theologians. I'm a Tozer fan and found this to be equivalent. It's not par with a Barnes commentary but leans more to an interesting and informative narrative. I especially enjoyed the chapter \\"When You Pray\\". I was provided new thoughts to ponder. For instance, when Jesus instructed the disciples not to pray publicly his intention was a focus on intent and motive, not the actual act of praying publicly. He was instructing us to be attentive to our motives-false or genuine. It resolved the conflict I had felt between praying in private and the verse about two or three of us praying together, he is there also.

That is just one chapter in a text that contains 28 chapters each addressing mysteries and controversy about baseball events and the players on and off the field. The Babe's home run in the 1932 World Series against the Cubs is chapter 10. Other chapters deal with such issues as whether the Giants were stealing the the Dodgers signs when Thompson hit the shot heard round the world, what was Satchel Paige's real age when he finally played in the major leagues for Cleveland, which pitchers really threw the spit ball, why the Dodgers left Brooklyn, why Fidel Castro didn't sign a professional contract offered to him by the Washington Senators, did Moe Berg really spy against the Nazi's in World War II, what took the Red Sox so long to win a World Series, and sone sabermetric questions such as does stealing bases pay, do managers really help, how can small market teams compete and does clutch hitting really exist. These and other provocative topics make for very interesting reading. To find out the answers go pick up a copy of the book."},{"Title":"Did Babe Ruth Call His Shot? and Other Unsolved Mysteries of Baseball","review":"Paul Aron is to be commended for this book. It is well-written and interesting, particularly for the casual baseball fan. The mysteries Aron discusses are mostly intriguing and the format--5 to 10 pages per chapter with a bibliography at the end of each--makes it easy to pick up the book now and again without investing too much time in it all at once. Some would say this is a deficiency--after all, the book is not scholarly or particularly in-depth. But baseball, like any topic, needs fun books as well as serious ones--light reading that helps the reader escape for a while. Moreover, there's something here for most types of fan--the sabermetricians, the traditionalists, etc.--because Aron explores the eclectic mysteries in a variety of ways.This being said, there are a few little problems with Aron's work. While he does a good job answering some of the mysteries, he makes no efforts to answer others. Rather, he leaves it up to the reader after presenting the evidence. I would prefer at least an educated guess, but that's just me. The bibliography has some real gems in it, but Aron tends to be repetitive, citing the same works several times. This would be fine if the bibliographies were a bit longer, but the effect here makes it seem as if Aron hasn't really read THAT much on the topics. Finally, the author doesn't really break any new ground here--most of this stuff will be too familiar to many baseball fans, and some of the \\"answers\\" to the mysteries are a bit obvious.To be fair, though, I don't think breaking new ground is really Aron's intent--he seems to be creating a primer here, not a definitive work. In the end, therefore, a young reader, casual fan, or a more serious fan who just wants to brush up a little on these mysteries will find this a thoroughly entertaining read that stimulates discussion and adequately informs the reader. In fact, noted author and editor John Thorn put it perfectly in his advance praise of the book--\\"Here is surefire water-cooler ammo.\\""},{"Title":"Did Babe Ruth Call His Shot? and Other Unsolved Mysteries of Baseball","review":"THIS BOOK ASKS SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS CONCERNING SOME OF THE LEGENDS OF BASEBALL.

Well, you'll just have to read it, too!Altogether Aron examines many baseball myths in scientific terms to either dispel or to confirm them.His writing style is light and airy, but he's concise and to the point. A very good read, indeed."},{"Title":"Did Babe Ruth Call His Shot? and Other Unsolved Mysteries of Baseball","review":"Author Paul Aron examines more than two dozen baseball mysteries in concise, readable detail. Did Babe Ruth call his shot against the Cubs in the 1932 World Series? Aron tries to answer that question, although perhaps he should have asked the U.S. Supreme Court, as justice John Paul Stevens claims he attended that game as a 12-year old. Other mysteries include does Clutch hitting exist, does a curveball really curve and why did the Dodgers leave Brooklyn? Readers learn about each of these mysteries, and in several cases the ongoing controversies. Each question has its own brief (6-10 pages) chapter, along with appropriate quotes, views, and source documentation. In some cases the answer seems clear, in others the mystery persists. But in each case readers come away better informed. These pages include espionage (Was Moe Berg a Spy?), international politics (Why didn't Fidel Castro sign with the Senators?) and business angles (Can Small Market teams Compete?). There are also famous baseball personalities like Ted Williams, Jackie Robinson, Branch Rickey, George Steinbrenner, etc. The author does make a couple minor mistatements of fact, once again leading us to ask why publishers never seem to use knowledgeable baseball fans to edit these books. Still, this remains an insightful, well-wrtitten, read."},{"Title":"Did Babe Ruth Call His Shot? and Other Unsolved Mysteries of Baseball","review":"This is a sequel to an earlier book written by the same author entitled \\"Unsolved Mysteries of History.\\" I found that book to be well written, quite informative, and very interesting, so, having an interest in baseball history, I decided to take a chance on this one. It did not disappoint.As with the earlier book, I particularly liked the author's method of presentation. For the subject of each chapter: he described the \\"mystery,\\" presented all sides of the issue, and then, rather than stating his own views, presented the pros and cons of all the various opinions. This clarified many of the subjects and, in some cases, added to the \\"mystery.\\"I found some of the subjects included in the book, however, to be irrelevant, at least from a historical perspective, while others seemed to be more curiosities than true \\"mysteries.\\" I also got the impression, based on some of the not-so-mysterious subjects and the curiosities, that the author had to stretch his definition a bit in order to find enough \\"mysteries\\" to fill the book. Nevertheless, even the simple curiosities proved to be interesting.The chapters which really caught my attention, however, were those which dealt with subjects which truly could be called \\"mysteries,\\" or at least historical uncertainties: Chapter 1: Who invented baseball? (It wasn't who you think it was) Chapter 3: Who was the first black in the majors? (It wasn't Jackie Robinson). Chapter 8: What caused the home run surge? (in 1920). Chapter 25: Does clutch hitting exist? (It seems unlikely) Chapter 26: Were yesterday's players better? And Chapter 27: Do managers matter?If these subjects don't whet your appetite, you'd better find something else to read. But if they do, you might want to let this book take you back to the ball game."},{"Title":"Did Babe Ruth Call His Shot? and Other Unsolved Mysteries of Baseball","review":"These are really clever solutions to baseball's enduring mysteries.

Not only was he a man of monetary wealth, he was also a man of fanatical genius in searching out and publishing works by the modernists of the 20th century in his infamous and invaluable New Directions Publishing house. This splendid book is filled with the writings of famous persons but it doesn't stop there. Included in this irresistible volume are photographs, book covers, hand written notes, postcards, doodles and other memorabilia of some very important artists of word and image.Included in this witty and wise and funky book are examples of alphabetically arranged luminaries such as Paul Bowles, Gertrude Stein, Tennessee Williams, William Carlos Williams, Merton, Miller, Pound, Pablo Neruda, Denise Levertov, Bei Dao, Wyndham Lewis, Jean Cocteau, Lillian Hellman, Allen Ginsberg - to mention only a few. Laughlin's comments on these and others are poignant, full of gossip, insightful and hilarious.The volume has been published by - who else? - New Directions and the 343-page book is richly illustrated and overflowing with bits and pieces of James Laughlin's autobiography s well as his own works and his pithy observations of the people whose careers he helped secure. This is a splendid book for all those who love to read as well as those who love to delve into history - from the backdoor! Highly recommended. Grady Harp, November 06"},{"Title":"The Way It Wasn't: From the Files of James Laughlin","review":"James Laughlin who died at 83 in 1997 left behind a vast collection of personal files filled with notes, stories, pictures, and other memorabilia about the people he had known through his life. Most of these were literature figures from the early and middle of the twentieth century.The collection of material is about as random as you could imagine. They are simply filed as you would in a filing cabinet from A (begins with Auto-Bug-Offery) to Z (Louis Zukofsky). The entries vary from a few lines to a few pages and reflect some incident, some communication, some little something that lends an added dimension to their relationship and to our understanding of both Laughlin and the subject.Expect no consistency, it's A to Z order and while generally the letter of the alphabet refers to the last name of the subject, this isn't necessarily the case. For instance in the entry under Hitler, he is barely mentioned.The best part of this book is it's unexpectedness. You have absolutely no idea what going to be said next."},{"Title":"The Way It Wasn't: From the Files of James Laughlin","review":"James Laughlin once wrote that he was working on his \\"auto-bug-offery\\" [autobiography]. It was, he continued, \\"Mostly fictional. What I wished had happened. \`The Way It Wasn't' would be a good title.\\" By the time Laughlin died, in 1997 at age eighty-three, he had produced, still unfinished, a distinctive memoir in verse called \\"Byways.\\" In THE WAY IT WASN'T, Barbara Epler and Daniel Javitch compiled another memoir of sorts from the jottings of Laughlin, his correspondence, and various ephemera. It also is quite distinctive as well as one of the most enjoyable books I have read through in a long time.This James Laughlin was more formally James Laughlin IV. James Laughlin the First founded Jones & Laughlin Steel Co., which at one time was the fourth largest steel company in the world. James Laughlin the Fourth was born in 1914 and grew up in (to me) unfathomable wealth and privilege. The Mellons lived across the street; Henry Clay Frick was a great-uncle. Before matriculating at Harvard, James the Fourth went to The Choate School and Le Rosey, a boarding school in Switzerland where one of his classmates was \\"Pahlevi\\", the future Shah of Iran. Once, when Laughlin was skiing in the Alps, he fell and ripped his pants; to the rescue came the Queen of Holland, who \\"had a sewing kit in her sitzpack and quickly repaired me.\\" \\"Then there was the promising young conductor from Vienna, Herbert von Karajan, a fine and fearless skier. He took pity on my shortage of cash for the busses. He would ride me up the mountain in his chauffeured car then let me ski down with him, coached by his private instructor.\\"Laughlin ended up using his money to do more for literature in this country than anyone else I can think of off hand. In 1936, while he was still at Harvard, Laughlin founded New Directions Publishing, which remains the foremost independent publisher of modernist and avant-garde literature in the U.S. Over the decades, Laughlin and New Directions published (often as the first American publisher) the likes of Borges, Brecht, Camus, Garcia Lorca, Hesse, Nabokov, Neruda, Paz, Rilke, Sebald, Dylan Thomas, and Tennessee Williams - to name just a few. Though he tried to run New Directions in a business-like fashion, his inherited wealth enabled Laughlin to publish and maintain in print many \\"non-commercial\\" authors, such as Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams and other American poets.THE WAY IT WASN'T contains scads of anecdotes both from a life of wealth and privilege and from the literary world. As regards the latter, which ultimately is the more interesting, the book contains profiles of, among others, Djuna Barnes, Elizabeth Bishop, E.E. Cummings, T.S. Eliot, Denise Levertov, Henry Miller, Thomas Merton, Ezra Pound, Kenneth Patchen, Kenneth Rexroth, Delmore Schwartz, Edith Sitwell, Gertrude Stein, and Dylan Thomas (Laughlin was the one who identified Thomas's corpse at the morgue at Bellevue Hospital). Laughlin also relates considerable gossip and he pens a few venomous characterizations, such as calling Paul Bowles a \\"hashish-eating scum-bag\\", a \\"dogs'-behind-licker\\", and an \\"obliquious snot-sniffer\\".The book also contains some fascinating items of correspondence, with the likes of Hemingway, Kerouac, and the two Williamses (Tennessee and William Carlos), as well as numerous photographs from Laughlin's personal files. Two of those photographs are of Marianne Moore, one inside Shea Stadium with Casey Stengel and the other as part of a group outside the ballpark. Laughlin writes that he used to take Miss Moore to ball games, and that she was very knowledgeable about baseball - that, indeed, \\"she could have managed the Dodgers.\\" (He goes on to make a slight mistake: in the course of bragging that he had seen Mazeroski's homer to win the 1960 World Series, he writes that that \\"was the same game when the Yankee's great shortstop Phil Rizzuto was hit in the Adam's apple and had to be taken out\\" - it actually was Tony Kubek, not Phil Rizzuto, who had to leave the game after a potential double-play ground ball took a bad bounce into his throat in the eighth inning. Though I wasn't at Forbes Field, I saw the game on television.)Under the heading \\"Girls\\", there are snapshots of nine different comely women, all clothed, though three are in swimsuits. On the next two-page spread, under the heading \\"Girls: Personal and Confidential\\", there are three proofs, spilling out a plain white envelope, of an equally comely woman, naked. And speaking of girls, there is this entry: \\"As you point out, there is a dichotomy in the girl/woman department. I think I explained it to you once. In Latin, the word \`puella', which means girl, is very beautiful-sounding, while the word for woman, \`mulier', is to my ear very ugly. That's all there is to it. I'm an object of scorn from the feminists anyway, so it hardly matters.\\"Great stuff - and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Entries are organized in chapters from A to XYZ. In addition to the marvelous content, the book itself is very handsomely produced, with pleasing graphics and spacious layout. I bought the hard-cover edition, which, as of today, Amazon offers for only five dollars more than the paperbound. The hard-cover is more than worth the extra five bucks. The paper is thick, creamy, and semi-gloss; the binding is first rate; and there even is a sewn-in ribbon marker."},{"Title":"The Way It Wasn't: From the Files of James Laughlin","review":"Laughlin is of interest to historians of publishing and those old enough to remember him and New Directions- even if its list was irritating. The Way it wasn't is an inviting title, but the book is grossly over-produced:printed on heavy art paper, too much white space amongst the blocks of self-conscious typography.

I'm usually lucky if I can get plus/minus two degrees. So, okay, it is best if you have an industrial-grade shop, and twenty years of experience, but that's not the book's fault. A project like the cradle is beautiful BECAUSE it is difficult to produce the compound angles, and finger joints, etc. So far, I'd say his instructions were clear, dead on, and the sequence of operations make sense. The only thing I'd suggest that he didn't is to get a fair amount of extra wood so you can make practice cuts. Most home woodworking equipment is not precise enough to set cuts with his kind of accuracy, but you can get there with good measuring tools (protractor, especially), and a fair number of trial cuts on scrap wood (of EXACTLY the same thickness of your finish stock). I also got the DVD and it was very helpful, although it almost scared me off when I saw the tools he was using--but in reality, those industrial tools won't really enable you to do better work-just faster work."},{"Title":"A Long and Happy Life.","review":"Rosacoke Mustian has been in love with Wesley Beavers since she spotted him in a pecan tree eight years ago. She has endured his stint in the U. S. Navy; and as Reynolds Price's 1961 debut novel A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE begins, Rosacoke is still in the dark as to Wesley's feelings about her as he prepares to take a job in Norfolk, Virginia selling motorcycles. Most of the rest of this near perfect short novel-- 195 pages--is about this young woman's search for love with a person who probably doesn't deserve her. Of course there is a whole passel of supporting characters in Price's story set in rural North Carolina in 1956.Just having read Mr. Price's excellent memoir ARDENT SPIRITS where he talks at length about writing this his first novel, I wanted to reread it to see if it holds up after these many years. It does. Mr. Price gets all the details just right: from cherry Jello to Kool-Ade to the local church's Amen corner to horehound candy to a punch board (something I had not thought about in more years than I care to remember). Men get their hair cut at home by family members; and the church, of course, is central to these characters' lives regardless of how they live when they are not within its doors: whether it is an emotional African American funeral for the young Mildred and friend of Rosacoke, who died in childbirth (the opening scene of the novel) or the closing Christmas pageant in the white Delight Church where Rosacoke plays the Virgin Mary and Wesley is a less-than-enthusiastic Wise Man. The last twenty or so pages that capture this event, complete with the Christmas carols that the pageant players sang, took me back to every similar Christmas in the Baptist Church I grew up in rural East Tennessee although the characters had different names in my mind's eye. And how many times have I heard a well-meaning person say on the death of someone, \\"He is far better off,\\" what the ancient Mr. Isaac tells Rosacoke's mother when her husband was killed.While this novel takes place in the time just after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision and before Martin Luther King led the nonviolent movement for the rights of black people, when North Carolina and much of the rest of the American South would see all kinds of racial turmoil and violence, black people and white people, at least in Price's world, live together with a modicum of understanding.The novel's beautiful title-- Price is a master at choosing them-- comes from a line from the movie \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" when William Holden says, \\"Let me wish you a long and happy life.\\" Wesley and Rosacoke show up again as principal characters in Mr. Price's 1989 novel GOOD HEARTS, the same year that a 25th anniversary edition of A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE was issued in hard copy. What this author would do so adroitly in novel after novel, writing evocative beautiful prose and always demonstrating a gentleness towards his characters as well as often telling his story from the point of view of the woman central character, is certainly evident in this first novel that I understand has never been out of print."},{"Title":"A Long and Happy Life.","review":"This is Reynolds Price's first novel, and what a distinguished beginning it is. Wesley Beavers and Rosacoke Mustian are involved in a mating ritual, a courtship spanning six months (June to December), as they test each other out as a prelude to marriage. Rosacoke spends much of her female energy trying to get Wesley to commit himself emotionally to her, while he is satisfied merely with the physical. She gives herself to him finally (she indeed thinks of what she does as \\"a gift\\"), and by the end of the novel she knows she is pregnant and about to give Wesley another \\"gift\\" - unwanted at the time by both, but this gift of childbirth will seal their marriage. The novel is filled with opportunities for Rosacoke to handle and calm babies, which she finally succeeds in doing, as she is compelled to \\"grow up\\" and face her new responsibilities. She is not sure Wesley will be exactly what she was hoping for, but both reach a plateau of confidence that they will share \\"a long and happy life\\" together. The novel is a pastoral one, with much of it set outdoors. Price's personal writing style, which is purely his own and is amazingly powerful and exhilarating, especially in his use of similes, is established right away - a major asset. A wonderful and marvelously written first novel."},{"Title":"A Long and Happy Life.","review":"I am somewhat surprised to see that there have been only three other reviews of this novel, which now is almost 50 years old. But then Reynolds Price seems always to fly just under the radar of the general American literary public. A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE was Price's first published novel, and since Price was not yet thirty, it seemed to promise a long and productive literary career, which by and large the years have borne out.Price was from the Piedmont region of North Carolina, which is where A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE is set. The time is the late 1950's. The central character is Rosacoke Mustian, who is in her early twenties, an age for marrying. The leading (in truth, for Rosacoke, the one and only) candidate is Wesley Beavers, with whom she has been entranced since she was fourteen. The novel begins with a brilliant scene where Rosacoke is on the back of Wesley's motorcycle as he passes a short funeral procession, with the pine box coffin in the back of a pick-up truck and \\"one black boy dressed in all he could borrow set up in a ladder-back chair with flowers banked round him and a foot on the box to steady it\\". The coffin holds Mildred, a young black woman who was a girlhood friend of Rosacoke's and who had died in childbirth, and Wesley is driving Rosacoke to the funeral service, where she will be the one person \\"representing the white friends\\". The next day Wesley will be discharged from the Navy and it is high time for Rosacoke and Wesley to decide whether or not they will try to make a long and happy life together. The novel covers the next half year while Rosacoke and Wesley circle round and round that issue.It is a rural community of swimming holes, church picnics, horehound candy and jello desserts, birthing-at-home with a mid-wife, and Christmas pageants. The blacks and whites have separate churches and for the most part separate social lives, though they rub shoulders with one another without much tension. Aspirations are modest.Price depicts this rural Piedmont community marvelously, with a multitude of keenly observed details (such as the paper bag nailed next to the door of the black church with the note \\"Kindly Leave Gum Here\\"). But, to be engaging, the novel needs more, just as \\"The Return of the Native\\" needed more than its marvelously depicted setting, Egdon Heath. And Price superbly fills that need with his heroine Rosacoke Mustian, just as Hardy did with Eustacia Vye. Rosacoke is strong-willed, idealistic, and honorable, especially to herself. Her most distinguishing trait is her sharp and cleverly quirky tongue. She is as memorable as Eustacia Vye, yet loveable whereas Eustacia is desirable.A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE makes for a fine story. But Price clearly wanted to do more than tell a story; he wanted to do so in a literary fashion. And that leads me to my only reservation: the novel is a tad over-written, so that at times it becomes mannered, especially due to aggressively odd syntax. All the same, it still rewards the reader, even after a half century. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"A Long and Happy Life.","review":"What a fine novel this is. First published in 1962 and Price's debut work, its freshness is still there. This is a masterpiece of language, character, place, and the inner voice. It's the story of Rosacoke Mustian growing up in an integrated rural town in North Carolina in 1956. Her family and community come to life in an instant, almost cinematically, from the opening page. The strangeness and richness of people and nature intrigue and provoke her and draw her into her inner world: her first moment seeing Wesley Beavers, her peculiar memories of Mr Isaac who is the town's rich bachelor eccentric handing out horehound candy to all the kids, memories of her tortured alcoholic father and his senseless death, memories of her brothers and their transformations. Price's writing quietly draws the reader in. Symbols abound. Events, births, deaths, comings, goings, and love take on larger meaning. \\"A long and happy life\\" is not a trifle or a passing wish. It's a rarity. In the end, one has no idea if Rosacoke will have a long and happy life or if anyone will, but the process of living has been revealed here. Masterpiece! Someone ought to write a film treatment of this story. Highly recommended. It should be on every college Twentieth Century American Literature required reading course list."},{"Title":"A Long and Happy Life.","review":"I admit that after reading the first sentence of this novel, which goes on for quite awhile, I dreaded continuing.

The culture of Southern Illinois is to a great degree Southern. I was born in 1944. I came of age in the 1950's experiencing some of what Reynolds Price describes in \\" Long and Happy Life\\"; the people, their Christianity, the terrain and its creatures, the out-of-doors pleasures and discomfortsI look back on my grandparents home- no plumbing, no central heat, only electricity- with too much nostalgia I know, but I am thankful my parents took me to the farm, usually monthly on a week-end, to see people loved, rural, poor, hard-working and of a simpler, tougher time who could still wring some pleasure out of existence for themselves and for me. There was little hugging and \\"I love yous\\",but I knew I was loved and that I was with people who were most importantly adults. I later realized this is what children need most from parents and grandparents; that they be adults.Reynolds Price with a language alive and exactly right brings us the young, vigilent, love-struck Rosacoke Mustian. Rosacoke is one of the lovliest female creations in American literature. Rosa yearning, the handsome Wesley, her love, tentative. You will like the people and wish Rosa happiness.

Putting that aside, Arizona Ghost Stories was a very interesting read. Every chapter deals with a specific town or city. Garcez gives a short bio and location of the area before he launches into the ghost story itself. Most of the hauntings took place in or around a home, though there are other sites such as saloons (big surprise), a hotel, a courthouse, and a prison. The accounts were written down as though the narrators were talking themselves.The most chilling was the haunting which occurred in a rural area outside of Phoenix. Two women were on a nature hike when they met up with a couple. The four of them got acquainted with each other. They were talking among themselves when one of the women caught a naked Indian woman running across the desert. Blood seeped though her fingers as she held onto her stomach. From two hundred yards away, the people felt her intense fear as she was obviously running from something or someone. They tried to run after her, but she literally vanished. Park rangers have also spotted this ghost while they were out surveying the land.There are two haunted sites (maybe more that are not included in this book) in Yuma. The first is the Yuma Court House. It is haunted by an elderly caretaker, who gave the night watchman a good scare. The second, is the old prison, which is now an historical landmark. The most affected of that area is the Dark Cell, where several inmates went insane after several days of solitary confinement.

It is probably the best book I've ever read about sex from an authentically Christian perspective. Sex can either help us become more loving, or further aggravate our resistance to love.

In one story, he seduces a 16 year old girl before turning her over to the police. The stories are of mixed quality and length, some much better than others. Some of the plots are transparent, but overall they are interesting light reading."},{"Title":"What big teeth you have!","review":"This book turns the potentially mundane topic of animal teeth into a fascinating one. Patricia Lauber goes beyond the expected description of incisor, canine, and molar functions by presenting lots of details and interesting facts. For example, felines have sharper teeth than canines because most big cats (e.g., lions) pounce on rather than chase after prey. Elephants, walruses, and hippos use their tusks to dig, to get around, for defense, and for hunting. The writing is clear and informal: &#147;Perhaps you are wondering how an animal with such big teeth can close its mouth. The answer is that there are two pockets in the upper jaw. When a hippos closes its mouth, the lower canines fit into these pockets.&#148;Lauber tells how animals can be classified by their teeth, and describes a variety of animals, including bats, dinosaurs, sea mammals, fish, and reptiles. The book is aimed primarily at elementary school readers, although older children will find much of the material enjoyable and interesting. There are 60 pages, with black and white illustrations and an index."},{"Title":"When in Rome","review":"From the first Ngaio Marsh book I read (_Death in a White Tie_)I was hooked. Now, reading my fourth Marsh novel, _When in Rome_, I can say that I like her even better than Agatha Christie. _When in Rome_ is about a group of tourists (incl. the famous Inspector Alleyn) whose guide suddenly disappears. Only Inspector Alleyn, who joined the tour because he suspects that the guide is a key member of a drug ring, is worried about his disappearance; most of the tour group couldn't care less. In fact, a few of them couldn't be happier that the seedy Mr. Mailer has conveniently vanished."},{"Title":"When in Rome","review":"Having read all of Agatha Christies novels I never thought that I would find an author comparable to her. Yet, after reading most of the Ngaio Marsh books I believe it is time to start comparing Agatha Christie to Ngaio Marsh. A great example of this can be found in When in Rome. In this book, Chief Superintendent Roderick Alleyn gets himself involved in a guided tour in an old church site in Rome. When the rather disrepeptable tour guide vanishes and a murder in unearthed in the underground portion of the old church, Alleyn finds himself in the thick of it. Together with the Italian Police, Alleyn trys to sort out the possible suspects. Marsh is at her very best as she takes the reader on a magical mystery tour of Rome. As always, her character descriptions are flawless and the plot moves along in rapid fashion. This book is on a par with Grave Mistake and many of her others. A great read and a superb mystery. Ngaio Marsh is can well be considered one of the best Brittish authors of the century."},{"Title":"When in Rome","review":"This late (1970) Marsh book is worthwhile reading for Marsh fans. Unfortunately, it does not compare well to some of the more classic Alleyn books from earlier in her career. Marsh was at her best writing about earlier days. Her misunderstandings and often (unintentionally) comic view of youth culture during the late 1960s/early 1970s is one of the unfortunate hallmarks of this period in her writing.In When in Rome, Alleyn registers for a tour incognito to try to crack a drug and blackmailing ring run by a thoroughly unpleasant fellow. When the fellow in question turns up dead, he and his fellow tourists have a great deal of thinking to do about guilt and innocence.Truthfully, this is probably a three star book. I gave it four stars because of the extra Ngaio Marsh spark which can make even a tedious book worth the time to read. Recommended, as I said, for Marsh fans. Readers new to her work should choose one of the novels from the 1930s through 1950 as a first experience."},{"Title":"When in Rome","review":"WHEN IN ROME presents us with a tantalizing tale of Mr. Sebastian Mailer, an up-scale tour guide whose idea of showing his guests the town ranges from artistic landmarks to drug laden dens of iniquity. Unfortunately, Mailer also laces his mixture with a spot of blackmail, so it is no great surprise to Chief Inspector Alleyn, on duty in Rome, when a body turns up where no body should be.Among the great authors of 20th Century mystery fiction, Ngaio Marsh was particularly noted for her ability to create unique characters and place them in memorable settings--and WHEN IN ROME offers her the opportunity to do precisely that. But in this instance Marsh overplays her hand. The novel is tainted by repeated condensending British jibes at Italy, some faintly hilarious ideas about drug use, and what can only be described as indirect but nonetheless obvious sneering fits of homophobia.In the end, this is novel that established Marsh fans will want to read--but it is also a novel that not even established Marsh fans will consider in the same league with such brilliant works as BLACK AS HE'S PAINTED, DEAD WATER, or OVERTURE TO DEATH, to name but a few. Readable, even amusing, but ultimately dismissable.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"When in Rome","review":"Superintendent Alleyn is in Rome doing some undercover sleuthing in connection with a drugs ring. He joins an organised tour run by the singularly unpleasant Sebastian Mailer.When Mailer disappears during a tour of a Roman Basilica his tour party don't seem too bothered about it and some even seem relieved. In between liaising with the Italian police Alleyn does some digging of his own and finds himself the recipient of confidences from the rest of the party.I enjoyed this very well plotted mystery. The characters are a marvellous collection of the nice and the nasty as well as the downright repellent. Rome - the tourist and the seedy side - come vividly to life. The Italian police characters are well drawn too and make interesting reading. As ever the book is well written with plenty of amusing one-liners and some interesting motivations.If you like your crime novels in the traditional mould then you will enjoy Ngaio Marsh. If you haven't tried her books then you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"When in Rome","review":"This late entry in N. Marsh's strong list of mysteries is not her best IMHO, but it's still pretty good--much better than most mysteries. It's p. 142 \\"an away match\\" wherein Superintendent Alleyn is alone in Rome--but on a mission. So, no Nigel Bathgate as Boswell and no artist wife Troy--too bad, the novels they play in seem to sparkle more. I may be stretching a bit giving it 4 stars, but it was clever--still, the necessary clues are not given until the very end. Also the information on drugs is dated if not in error. However, there is some clever commentary upon the differences in male-male vs. female-female communications a la Deborah Tannen (e.g.You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation&That's Not What I Meant!). One might object to the somewhat overdone differences in both communications & temperament between the Brits and the Italians in this book--which I think may have been an attempt at humor--but not a very successful attempt. But, as usual, Marsh's characters are unusual & jump off the page into your lap--even though many are rather sleazy in this book. It's interesting though to see Alleyn up against a complicated case without his myrmidons. Enjoy."},{"Title":"When in Rome","review":"The deficiencies here are glaring. Two of the victims are villains and the third hisses a few words, spits at one of the villains, and is gone, never to reappear except as a dead body. We don't miss any of them and don't really care who killed them. The central characters are never remotely in danger of being suspected. The most interesting feature of the story is a fictional twelth-century basilica built atop a third-century church, which had itself been built atop a house dating from Mithraic times. In all, a book without tension, suspense, or interest (except in the basilica)."},{"Title":"Delirious New York","review":"A romp through New York's sometimes jaded history with a view to uncover the roots of the modern metropolis and the singular element devised by architects to inspire (amuse?) the masses - the Skyscraper. The book looks at Coney Island as the testing ground of the Skyscaper, Manhatten as further exploration of the Skyscaper which is trialed in the name of symbols of a propserous future, economic rationale and pushing the envelope to its limits and finishes with Office of Metropolitian Architecture's own experimental projects in New York. A very compelling history of a complex city."},{"Title":"Delirious New York","review":"RELLY GREAT YEAH!!

The book should be required reading for every high schooler, as part of a course on Critical Thinking. Clear, logical thought is more important today than ever, but the average Joe is not capable of it. With more high school kids believing Creationism than Darwin's Theory of Evolution, it is obvious that the schools are failing our children miserably by not teaching them how to think critically.The book is laid out into three clear parts: Material Fallacies, Psychological Fallacies, and Logical (formal) Fallacies. About 51 different fallacies are delineated and explained. They are all here: faulty analogy, generalization, \\"post hoc\\" reasoning, false dilemma, appeal to authority, ad hominem, special pleading, apriorism, non sequitur, and many many more. The fallacy is analyzed and explained, then the authors provide several (often humorous) examples of the fallacy is everyday life. Sometimes, they also offer their personal comment on the example.EVERYBODY can benefit from reading this book. Democracy cannot survive without an informed, intelligent electorate. With TV and the electronic age, there is less reading and less time for critical thought. This, in turn, endangers our democracy. This book is the necessary tonic to combat this ominous threat. It is clear, well-written, and as amusing as a book on logic can be!

These two stories begin separately and later join together. The interweaving is superbly done. I can't remember enjoying seeing the world through a wolf's eyes so much since I read Jack London's White Fang many years ago. The protagonists are well characterised and highly likeable, as are some of the other characters. There are also some villains worthy of boos and hisses. The story itself is believable, gripping, entertaining, and moving.As a bonus, there's a great depiction of forest fighting in the book. I live in a rural area which recently got through a forest fire, so firefighters are my heroes, and I very much enjoyed the description of the smoke jumpers."},{"Title":"Woman's Sigh, Wolf's Song","review":"I really enjoyed this book. My wife and I tend to choose very different reading material, so when I slipped this one from her recent acquisitions, I had no special expectations. I must admit, I would not usually have found the \\"Woman's Sigh\\" portion of the title especially appealing. I was, however, interested in the apparent wolf theme. When I finally replaced it in her collection, I considered what a pleasure it had been to discover that this book really went the distance for me, and that perhaps my wife and I had struck the same chord.There is a lot of grit and excitement here. I had begun warily, expecting to find an abundance of emotion, but when it was amply delivered, I didn't mind. I would predict that most adult readers are going to connect, as the author skillfully and spiritedly answers fate with resolve. For me, she finds unique perspectives and breathes new life into old lessons about vulnerability and strength, all the while weaving a fascinating tale.Upon discovering the dual nature of the story, I had a moment of apprehension, half expecting it might serve to distract. To the contrary, the stories are a splendid complement to each other, and I sensed not an ounce of contrivance. The shifts are deftly timed, and were received with pleasure by this reader.This book has a lot of dimension, but that challenge is readily handled under Madison's pen. She courageously and effectively offers the reader a story of terrific scope.Those with no penchant for wildlife themes shouldn't be put off. There is a lot more happening here, and I think that you will likely be drawn in.Sharing one man's perspective, I found this book to be a page turner, and I spent every available moment with it to the finish. What an auspicious start! I will be looking for more of this author in the future."},{"Title":"Woman's Sigh, Wolf's Song","review":"It's hard to believe this is Kathryn Madison's first novel.

A thought provoking, vital, and entertaining book."},{"Title":"Woman's Sigh, Wolf's Song","review":"It's been so long since I've found a book to captivate me like this one. From start to finish, the author holds you with stories of this woman veterinarian's life. From her marriage ending to how she picks up the pieces by embracing her life work, the obstacles that she overcomes - the fascinating details of the sharks, the firefight, the wolf hunt, - and the spellbinding relationship with the wolf that evolves. This book has many elements working for it - the human and animal survivors connect, and then connect you. Great read, highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Woman's Sigh, Wolf's Song","review":"I took this book with me on a business trip as a casual read on the airplane as well as at the hotel. What I didn't expect was to become so attached to the characters that I would stay up until the wee hours of the morning just trying to get one more chapter in... and then one more after that.The human side of this story, that of Alexandra Verazzano and her struggles to come back from personal tragedies, is so real it feels like it is happening to your closest friend and you want to reach out and help her or cheer her on. Sometimes I would get so engrossed that I completely lost track of time as I turned page after page. It takes you on a masterful emotional rollercoaster of hurt, discovery, trials, triumph, and more... all with subtlety, allowing it unfold so naturally it feels like you are experiencing the emotions along with her.Even more engaging is the unique way the lives and adventures of the timber wolves are brought to life and woven in to the human story. I feel like I've gone through the experiences with this family. The society of the wolves was created in such a way that I was left feeling privileged to be given a glimpse into how they really live. And the imagery of nature created by this book painted pictures as though I was watching a movie, only better. Many of the images are so strong that I can imagine I am standing on a hillside with breath-taking views, taking deep breaths of crisp, clean forest-scented air.All-in-all, this book was refreshing in how it truly captured my emotions. All through this review I talk about how this book made me FEEL and that is the best word I can describe this truly engaging book. I hope there is going to be another book soon so I can feed this new addiction and find out what happens next with Alex and Survivor.Erin Fitzpatrick"},{"Title":"Woman's Sigh, Wolf's Song","review":"I was hooked from the first scene, following the police officer and his dog down the rickety steps into Seattle's ancient underground city.This survival story takes place on a grand scale - from scuba diving in Monterey Bay to snow camping in the Canadian Rockies - and Kathryn Madison writes with an authority that made me believe her. I felt Alexandra's terror trapped and out of air beneath a shark feeding frenzy and I shared her awe at the close passing of an infant gray whale.The interlaced stories of woman and wolf forced me to share the struggle of both creatures with new eyes. My senses came to life as I sniffed the wind with the wolf and listened to their calls with Alex.Nature plays a primary role challenging their spirits with a heavy hand, no more so than when a forest fire tests life itself as animals and firefighters strive against her.

It may have been a real revolution for the authors to openly talk about the basics of healthy human sexuality.My perception is that the focus is largely on the male experience, with the unique needs of the female omitted. For instance, it is assumed that everyone has the potential to receive pleasure from sex, at any moment.&quot;Non demanding touch&quot; is a good idea.

He discusses the obvious damages of slander, propaganda and gossip and also other ways that we hurt others. For example, if we know something to be true about someone then do we tell someone else? Well, that depends on the circumstances. Is there an issue of someone else's safety involved? Will it help another to avoid financial or other mistakes? If it is just something that you know but will do nothing but cause humiliation to the other person then it is best to keep it to yourself, even if it is the truth. If the only reason to tell someone else is to lower their opinion of the person then it is unethical to disclose the information.Can people change? I'm sure that each of us knows at least one person who has made a complete change in their lifestyle. Some for the better and some for the worst. As for me, I would not want to be judged today based on all of my opinions, words and actions as a teenager. The author looks at several ways that the press and others have ruined people because while a person can change their life, they cannot change their past.This is a guide for all those who want to change or improve their relationship whether personal, in business, or other circumstances. This is a guide for those who want to improve their marriage or move it up to the next higher level. This is a guide for those who want to know that all their communications are ethical and moral.You can't remove hurtful and damaging words from your vocabulary until you understand what they are and what they do.

Rather, words possess tremendous power to shape or break relationships. They can humiliate and destroy reputations, careers, friendships, and marriages and thus leave deep, emotional scars and irrevocable damage.And, unfortunately, in our society, it seems as though the only verbal exchanges that most(but not all) people are not uncomfortable with, and secretly relish, whether they publicly admit so or not, are the ones that appeal to the weak side of human nature, such as spreading malicious gossip and rumors, constantly criticizing and finding faults in others, and making prejudicial and ugly comments about various racial, ethnic, and religious groups.Thus by creating a toxic environment, we should not be surprised that there is a small minority, who refuses to take part in this nauseating verbal incivility, and therefore finds themselves isolated, emotionally paralyzed, and unable to wholeheartedly live life to the fullest.This is where Rabbi Telushkin eloquently offers soothing advice to this often ignored and unspoken pain.He states that if people were more self-aware and acutely conscious to the inflammatory power of words and its devastating consequences, rather than denying that they exist, they can learn to refrain from(think before you speak!)making inappropriate and negative comments and lead a richer and emotionally deeper life.If we constantly remind ourselves to stop speaking with an evil tongue and refine our communication skills, new meaningful relationships based on trust can be formed, and people would become less hostile, deceitful, and hypocritical and more open, friendly, and receptive to others.Thank you, arigato(Japanese), toda(Hebrew), gratias(Interlingua), Rabbi Telushkin for setting a HIGH STANDARD for ethical, moral, and spiritual decency!"},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"The damage we can do to others by our power of speech -- for example, by gossiping and by passing along rumors for no constructive purpose -- is a matter of great concern in Jewish tradition; one passage of Torah even seems to indicate that embarrassing one's fellow publicly is tantamount to a kind of murder. The most comprehensive works on this topic are those of R. Yisrael Meir Kagan (the Chofetz Chaim), whose writings on Shmirat ha-Lashon (the Laws of Proper Speech) are available from the Chofetz Chaim Heritage Foundation.R. Joseph Telushkin has provided here a highly readable and accessible introduction to this important topic, suitable for Jews (of all levels of observance) and non-Jews alike. His clear exposition and helpful explanations/examples set out the rationale for what may be _the_ single most important area of Jewish observance for our time.This volume is highly recommended for anyone, of any religious background or none, who wants to exercise self-control and thereby prevent a great deal of needless but often invisible spiritual damage.

This book-and there is so much to praise about it-will stir your mind and emotions. It is calming. It is wise. It is practical.Through simple, thought-provoking words of personal experience and well-chosen stories from the Old Testament, Rabbi Telushkin provides real inspiration and a rare and valuable insight into the real purpose of communication: the upliftment of the general human condition and growth of our own spirit.Reading this work has moved me to re-consider the entire agenda and purpose of my life. Today so many words are spoken. Perhaps some of them are heard. What does all this interaction accomplish?When political candidates bend over backwards to smear and denigrate their opponents without offering anything genuinely worthwhile to the public discourse-what does it say about life today, when the very survival of the planet is at stake and those who aspire to become decision-makers employ barbs as their stepping stones to position?I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It ought to be used as a communications textbook at the earliest feasible level of a child's education. But it's a treasure useful for anyone at any age. I purchase very few books and recently cleaned my shelves of a number of them whose usefulness had long ago faded. This one will not only remain on my shelf, but I plan to send it to several friends. Even if you think you're pretty good with the spoken word, time spent reading this book will have a salutory effect on your being.Wisdom is priceless and can be difficult to find.

Words that damage and destroy -- we hear them everyday on our playgrounds, in the workplace, at the grocery store, in our schools. In his introduction, Telushkin asks his readers if they can go 24 hours without saying an unkind word about or to anyone.

We can and we should be reminded by the weight and the impact on our lives and our community when we don't constrain our will and our words. Miracles, I once heard is a direct result, a byproduct (if you would) of one's intent and the right use of words.

It is my strongest recommendation that anyone wanting to live above the circumstances in life and have meaningful interactions should strongly consider purchasing a copy of this book for themselves and their loved ones."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"This book will open your eyes to the power of things you say that you may find insignificant. Once you read this book you will never feel the same about how you speak to others. You will find yourself carefully choosing your words before you say them."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"Rabbi Telushkin is one of the great teachers of Jewish ethics today. In this book he takes up the question of how we through what we say may hurt of may help others. He gives advice about how we can learn to not insult others, how to speak and fight fair, how to criticize and properly accept rebuke, how to avoid publicly humiliating others, how to control our rage and anger, how to in short incorporate principles of ethical speech in our everyday life.He provides many examples and cites traditional Jewish sources in a convincing way.If we could learn to apply the principles of this work to our own lives this would make us all better people."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"In &#65533;Words That Hurt, Words That Heal&#65533;, Joseph Telushkin talks about the tremendous power of words and the negative effects we could unravel if we don&#65533;t choose them wisely. He also talks about positive and effective ways to deal with anger. Although the book is written by a Jewish spiritual leader, I highly recommend it to any person regardless of creed. I believe that as long as we could grow spiritually and could bring peace into our lives, it does not matter which religious background the teaching is coming from. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"This is a worthwhile book. Its value is to focus our attention on the words we speak and even *think* - do we practically apply biblical precepts as constant guides to our daily conduct?\\"Who is the person who is eager for life, who desires years of good fortune? Guard your tongue from speaking evil, and your lips from deceitful speech\\" (Psalms 34:13-14).Rabbi Telushkin covers a wide range of life situations and examines the biblical moral imperative to avoid slander and humiliation of others. For example, is it moral to convey humiliating information about another person to someone else who needs to know that information? Is it moral to tell the truth to those who will use that information to destroy lives? In this, the book is reminiscent of the first book of Plato's Republic, in which the Athenian guest attempts to help his listeners decide what exactly is \\"justice\\". Unlike Plato, however, the Bible is not merely a thought-provoking enterprise of Socratic dialectic leading to a meditation on the ultimate verities; therefore, Words That Hurt, Words That Heal goes beyond (for the biblically minded reader) philosophical generalities and appeals to the pronouncements of the Old Testament (Torah) to definitively answer such potentially perplexing questions.The book's concept --- helping the reader to focus on the necessity to guard the tongue (and mind) and thus speak wisely --- is stellar. The book's presentation, grounded in biblical law, is excellent. But the book, given Rabbi Telushkin's mastery of the Torah, might have been written much better, I feel. (Hence the three stars.)Recommended as a breezy read on a rock solid topic."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"The book is very thought provoking. I have started to think more about what I say, if I need to say it, and how it will affect the person talked about or the person talked to. Provides ethical thought on gossip, privacy for public officials, staying on subject, etc."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"The order was handled very efficiently. I was pleased with the way my order was handled."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"This book was almost impossible to put down, with such compelling content that I actually forgot I was having lunch in a restaurant while reading it! This book takes little time to read but should provoke considerable reflection in the reader. We ALL need this reminder of the impact of our words and that we CAN CONTROL our reactions to events and to others and that we MUST consider the consequences of our word choices on others."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"This book's awesome! Powerful messages that change the way one looks at the words. Loved it. Received as described!"},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"I've only just begun reading this book but I'm familiar with the content and have read several of this author's other books. He is a wonderful writer and his work both inspires and educates. I highly recommend anything written or co-written by Joseph Telushkin."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"This book is very effective; it's simply written yet deeply transformative at the same time. It's really amazing how little effort it takes to change your verbal habits. I read the book, recognized myself in so many of the examples, and started making a subconscious effort to change how and when I used certain words. First, I began to notice all the situations I was in on a daily basis in which words were abused. I started to merely refrain from joining in gossip, insulting and other hurtful talk when I was around it, and it felt wonderful. It never occured to me that my (in)action could affect others, until a good friend told me after a few weeks of this that he'd noticed it, and was really moved. Just goes to show how one person really can make a difference. Get it, read it, live it! It's so easy, and so meaningful!"},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"This book is well written and an excellent resource for ALL people. There is no one who wouldn't learn something."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"I picked up this book one lunch hour at Barnes &amp; Noble. What a great little treasure! I liked Telushkin's analysis of the different ways people injure each other verbally from a Jewish perspective. Although I'm not Jewish, it gave me a new way to look at the way I speak to others.Highly recommended. I'd like to give a copy to all my friends and family. Does Amazon have quantity discounts?--Valerie Kameya"},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"This is a praiseworthy book, for it is apt to elevate those who read it to a higher ethical plane!But some of the key principles discussed in the book are evocative of questions and reservations; and I ask Rabbi Telushkin whether strict prohibitions against &quot;evil-tongued speech&quot; (lashon harah) permit balanced biographies of living persons to be written. I am reading a biography of a living scientist at the moment, and by any conventional standard, the biography is excellent. In fact, its excellence derives in part from its balanced discussion of this scientist's personality profile, which is characterized, of course, by both positive and negative features (and the negatives are pretty repugnant)."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:J},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],H={key:0},R={key:1};function W(n,a,s,c,r,i){const u=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",B,[(e(!0),t(f,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",R,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,S)):p("",!0)])}const x=d(A,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-2b139351"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/40.md","filePath":"library/40.md"}'),j={name:"library/40.md"},O=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(a,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(x)]))}});export{q as __pageData,O as default};
