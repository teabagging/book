I have to say that after reading the book, I felt even more honored to participate in the race (and a little nervous). The author does a wonderful job of capturing how this just isn't a race, it's an event that stretches through over a century of history - not only of the course, but of distance running itself.Reading it before hand, made the course more alive and familiar to me while I ran it. Recognizing the landmarks and knowing the history behind each one gave me something to look forward to each mile (and in the later miles keep my mind off the suffering). And finally, it gave me a sense for the spirit of the event itself and the personal stories that are inextricably linked each year to it.I did read a few reviews that admonished the author for running as a bandit, I respect that perspective and don't condone bandit'ing the race.However, the author's real value in this book isn't his running prowess (as he readily admits time and time again). Rather, it's the hard work and research he obviously invested to bring all of this history to the reader. I can't think of a better way to personalize the 'data' than to relate it to an actual running of the course. True, it would be ideal if the author was also an elite runner who had qualified - but barring that intersection, I think it would have been a shame to not have this author share his research in the way that he did. That's what I believe the review should be rated on.Hope you found this helpful. I strongly recommend this book and think it should almost be a required reading for anyone signing up to run Boston.You'll be happy you read it!Kevin"},{"Title":"26 Miles to Boston: The Boston Marathon Experience from Hopkinton to Copley Square","review":"This book humanized one of the most famous road races in the world. It was a delight to read and thoroughly entertaining."},{"Title":"26 Miles to Boston: The Boston Marathon Experience from Hopkinton to Copley Square","review":"I bought Michael Connelly's 26 Miles to Boston as a Christmas gift for my husband. I was aghast to read that the author had run the race as a bandit (i.e. not registered--either by qualifying, as part of a charity program or any of the other ways to LEGALLY run without qualifying). This one fact all but ruined what otherwise would have been an entertaining and interesting book about one of the world's greatest running events. In particular, his tirade against Marty Liquori, who had the temerity to suggest on-air that unregistered runners respect the Boston Athletic Association's rules and decline from taking advantage of the many course amenities for which they didn't pay (in Mr. Connelly's case this included the expertise of medical staff after the race), reduced my respect for him as a \\"runner\\" to the point that I couldn't enjoy the book. I suspect other runners who do respect this great race may have similar feelings. It took me several years to get to the point that I could even consider trying to qualify for Boston; Mr. Connelly decided six months ahead of time to begin a running career and had such a sense of entitlement as to feel that the world owed him the privilege of running the Boston Marathon right off the bat. This would have been a much better book without the inclusion of Mr. Connelly's self-righteously conceived, ill-advised personal experience."},{"Title":"26 Miles to Boston: The Boston Marathon Experience from Hopkinton to Copley Square","review":"I loved Michael Connelly\\"s \\"26 Miles to Boston.\\" I have read a number of running books lately, but Connelly's book was incredible. Connelly, a Boston attorney, nearly died from a heart ailment. Six months later he finished the Boston Marathon. This book really puts the reader in the race:for every mile, Connelly describes exactly the course, his mental state, and all the other ups and downs he encountered. I always hope to be inspired by reading books written by the stars of the running world, but this book really moved me precisely because it was by an average person; a person with a dream that he made come true. This book was recommended to me by an Amazon.com suggestion, and as a runner and former Boston resident, I bought it knowing it would be a winner. I highly recommend \\"26 Miles to Boston.\\" Whether you are a runner, or not, anyone will be inspired by this book. If you have a dream, you can achieve it.

It has occurred to me that the drug war seems to drag on, decade after decade, the men and women in the trenches apparently helpless to have an impact on the problem, their efforts little more than a token show of force. But now I have found something that at least offers a plausible explanation for the existence of this problem that plagues millions of our nations citizens, causes untold damage to our economy and forces upon each of us a police presence that routinely flirts with the erosion of our civil liberties and constitutional rights. Special Agent Ben Rich brings all of the necessary tools to the table to take the reader on a raw-boned, in your face 367-page high-speed joy ride down a drug war superhighway. His well developed characters, with character flaws that allow none to cast the first stone, give the reader an insight to the men who daily risk their lives in a war where honor and integrity are measured in degrees of blind trust to a maze of agencies that reward those who don't ask too many questions. And if you don't like guys who act like guys, talk like guys do to other guys and see the world through battle scarred eyes, then leave this book alone and visit the romance section for another selection.

Joe's most recent being The Hatwearer's Lesson; a novel that brings old time traditions to present day life is by far one of my favorite reads for 2002Hats have always been a part of our history, our hats represents different periods. Men wore black sharecropper's hats for protection from the sun while working in the fields. During the Wild West wide brims represented power. Hats were also worn to cover the face of cowards who took pleasure in killing African Americans. In The Hatwearer's Lesson Grandma Ollie wore her hats because of the love she had for them, a love she passed on to her granddaughter Terri.Grandma Ollie raised Terri after her mother died in Grandma Ollie's arms while she gave birth to Terri. Water is such a significant entity for Terri and Grandma Ollie. Terri was born in water that threatened to take her life, but Grandma Ollie saved her as she continues to do throughout the story. Terri was born with the same sixth sense of her grandmother. They both had what was called back in the day \\"the gift of gut.\\" Knowing when something is going to happen whether it is good or bad.Grandma Ollie's uses old traditions and signs of the universe to teach Terri valuable lessons. The story opens with Terri deciding to marry and just as Grandma Ollie begins to write the announcement in her bible, the pen runs out of ink and Grandma Ollie knows something is wrong. Terri moved from her small town Collingswood Arkansas to live up North where she could forget her roots. Fortunately for her, Grandma Ollie will not allow that. She must use those roots and folklore to help her see what is in front of her face.I absolutely adored the way this story was told, the book opened with Grandma Ollie writing in her bible and closed the same way. As I read this story, I felt that I was sitting in on those hair-brushing moments Terri and Grandma Ollie shared. I often wondered if Grandma Ollie was in fact the author's grandmother who raised her.It is my hope that this review reaches everyone who likes a feel good story, because this is certainly it. I encourage you to read this book once it is published.Missy"},{"Title":"The Hatwearer's Lesson","review":"It takes a special kind of lady to be a hat wearer, not everybody can pull it off. I think that I'm still a little to young to wear hats yet but I most definitely love to see a lady in a hat. I tell people all the time that I love to wear hats but I'm not old enough to wear them yet. I could never really pinpoint a reason why I don't feel as if I'm ready, but this book put my sentiments into concrete words. I don't think I have the wisdom yet to accompany a beautiful brim. I really enjoyed The Hatwearer's Lesson by Yolanda Joe because the characters were so real to me. This was a quick, and witty read. This book had the most vivid use of characters that I've read in quite some time. Grandma Ollie could have just as well been my grandmother, because of all of the euphemisms used, brought back so many memories. Even sitting and holding a conversation while oiling the scalp and brushing hair with fifty strokes was so vivid to me because I would eagerly sit at my grandmothers knee and wait for her to offer words of wisdom. Reading the book, I could just picture my grandmother, with her hat wearing self, doling out advice in a no nonsense manner.Terri Mills in Grandma Ollie's only granddaughter. She raised her from birth and taught her to that she could be anything that she wanted to be. Through her grandmother's thorough planting and rooting of Terri, she was able to pursue her dream of being a high-powered attorney in Chicago. There she met Derek, an equally successful attorney, and from there it seemed as if a fairy tale romance was abloom until Grandma Ollie couldn't right his name in the family bible. That was a bad sign. Grandma Ollie believed in the signs and learned as a child how to interpret them. Sure \`nuff grandma was right. As the story progresses, the signs that grandma interprets along with her mannerisms, style and wisdom spin a tale of nostalgia and funny wit. As the plot matures, The Hatwearer's Lesson(s) warm the spirit. Terri is one lucky woman and her life has been a charmed one for the existence and wealth of information that her grandmother has imparted to her through the years.I've not read any of Ms. Joe's previous works but I \`m definitely hunting them down after this. Her writing style is so conversational and lyrical. The characters jump to life and compel you to keep reading, I simply could not put this book down.

She made law review at Harvard, worked abroad in France and is a networking diva. Next to her at most of the big boy events and also in the bedroom is her new fianc&eacute;; smooth-talking, suave dressing, sexually stimulating and politically correct Derek Houser, also a prominent lawyer. They appear to be the perfect couple, one of power and prestige, going places and making things happen. They also know all the right people and even contribute to the black community, attending scholarship dinners and fraternity picnics.Near and dear to Terri's heart is Grandma Ollie who raised her in the small country town of Collingswood, Arkansas. She has taught Terri to follow her dreams and is an avid supporter and inspiration to her grand-daughter. Grandma Ollie has a sixth sense of sorts and is known for reading signs and for the colorful stylish hats that she wears religiously whenever leaving the house. She's quick-witted, charming, and shares lessons on life with those around her. As Grandma Ollie begins to update her Bible with Terri's recent engagement, she suddenly runs out of ink and is unable to inscribe Derek's name next to Terri's. Seeing this as a sign (and she's hardly ever wrong about her signs), she worries that something isn't quite right with Derek. This is just the beginning of this wonderful story. Are things going as well as Terri thinks they are? Or is Derek holding out on her? How will Terri handle things and does the saying \\"there's no place like home\\" really ring true for her?THE HATWEARER'S LESSON is heart-warming, the characters leave an impression on you and the overall lesson is one that has been passed down in families across the globe.

What a sweet, deep truth there is in the character of Grandma Ollie, who has the gift of reading &quot;signs&quot; to predict the future. She tries to warn her very modern granddaughter before she marries the wrong man. This is a modern fairy tale, full of heart, old-timey wisdom, basic lust and the ever-redeeming path to True Love, which never does run smooth (if it did, nobody could write a good story about it). Yolanda Joe has done that. Her voice is funny and personal, and made this reader want to search out all her other books."},{"Title":"The Hatwearer's Lesson","review":"WOW! this book is phenomenal! i received an early copy and i was foolish enough to let it sit for a few days before opening it. i have read all of the author's other work and i was only lukewarm to the idea of another 'yolanda joe novel'.though the other books were good reads, they do not compare to the eloquence and descriptive creativity of 'Hatwearer's Lesson'. i read it in one sitting and this novel made me laugh, cry, and cheer all at the same time.Terri, like myself grew up without a mother so i could relate to her anguish. i also had a grandmother who tried on many occasions to 'steer' me in the right direction, but being headstrong, i, like Terri also veered off course.Terri learns the lesson(like i did)that all that glitters is not golden, and that coming home sometimes means letting go when holding on seems more secure!Grandma Ollie personifies all that Black women have endured over the years and yet her quiet strength makes you feel at home. Grandma Ollie's courage against the odds signifies what we are and will become in the future.Ms. Joe's story shows that happiness is contentment with what you have and an understanding that true joy comes from within.i'm trying to not give away the storline, therefore all i can say is READ IT!!!!This is destined to become a bestseller!"},{"Title":"The Hatwearer's Lesson","review":"\\"She's got the gift and she's got to use it\\" - that could be Grandma Ollie's motto. She has been reading signs all her life and she has never been wrong. So when the pen's ink runs dry while attempting to write the name of her granddaughter's fianc&eacute; in the family bible, she knows something is wrong...and the drama begins. Yolanda Joe's The Hatwearer's Lesson focuses on the relationships of and between a countrified, sassy, hat-wearing grandmother (Grandma Ollie) and her ambitious, citified, attorney granddaughter, Terri Mills.Terri and her fianc&eacute;, Derek, are a hard working, high profile, no nonsense attorney power couple. Their relationship is what fairytales are made of: they look good together, have great careers, and have the political and social connections to match. But Grandma Ollie's prediction comes true and trouble invades paradise on both the romantic and professional fronts. Terri soon finds herself back in the small rural town of Collingswood, Arkansas under the counsel of Grandma Ollie. In a strange turn of events (fate perhaps), Terri's life is rearranged with a surprise ending. However, it is not only the Terri-Derek storyline that baits the reader; it is the amorous adventures of a young Grandma Ollie that are equally engaging. It is there where the valuable life lessons are truly revealed and where Terri extracts the wisdom and guidance to make the right decisions regarding Derek and her life.The Hatwearer's Lesson is a charming novel full of homespun anecdotes, humor, and wit. Some of the expressions quoted by Grandma Ollie are truly \\"keepers\\" and can be retained as priceless bits of practical advice. This is my first Yolanda Joe experience and I am willing to read her other pieces as well as her next release.Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book ClubApril 1, 2003"},{"Title":"The Hatwearer's Lesson","review":"This book was an awesome book.

However, she was once a widely read authority on subversive activities, particularly Jewish ones.\\"The Plot Against Christianity\\" contains a wealth of material, thoroughly documented, on these activities. No one has ever refuted her research; she is merely denounced by the other side. Read the meticulous research for yourself and you will quickly discover who is really lying."},{"Title":"The Plot Against Christianity","review":"Dilling reproduces quite a number of pages out of the volumes of the Talmud. The only volume which I've read in whole is the Book of Gittin, but this reproduction of select items taken from the Talmud can be worth going through as one of the briefer ways of gaining some general familiarity.At the same time one has to be closely on the alert for many errors which creep into Dilling's text because of her own Right-wing ideology.To take one error, Dilling refers to an alleged \\"Communist\\" burning of churches in Spain. Now anyone familiar with the record of the Spanish civil war knows that the church burnings were carried out by anarchists, adherents of Bakunin who were ideologically hostile to Marxism. A Right-winger like Dilling may consider this difference an inconsequential detail, but it is impossible for anyone who wishes to study the Spanish civil war to understand anything if you don't pay attention to such details. In actual fact, the Spanish Communist Party ended up having to defend the churches against the anarchists. It's also clear what Dilling's angle is in making this false assertion: \\"Communist church burnings\\" = \\"Jewish church burnings\\" = \\"Jewish war on Christianity.\\" The argument is totally wrong in this case, however, since there is no evidence that I've ever run across of any substantive Jewish role in Spanish anarchism.Another false implication which Dilling tosses in is over Kerensky's request that Trotsky be allowed back to Russia. Here the light is supposed to flash that \\"Kerensky wants Trotsky back in Russia\\" = \\"Kerensky part of big Jewish plot with Trotsky and Lenin.\\" This is a very poor reading of history because it overlooks the simple fact that until the summer of 1917 Lenin and Trotsky were generally regarded as very bitter ideological rivals. As it happens we now know that, in this one historical instance, Lenin and Trotsky did manage to set aside their feuds and work together. But the history of the Left throughout most of the 20th century could easily lead one to expect exactly the opposite to occur. There are so many recorded instances of Left-wing groups with very similar ideas tearing each other apart fatally that Kerensky's decision to seek Trotsky's return made perfectly good sense at the time. Lenin we know was aided by the German general staff, not for any ideological affinity but because they hoped that Lenin would disrupt the war effort of the Provisional Government. It therefore was logical for Kerensky to seek the return of Trotsky with the assumption that Trotsky and Lenin would counteract each other. As it happens we know that it didn't exactly work out that way, at least not swiftly enough to benefit Kerensky. But Dilling's claim that this shows Kerensky to have been working all along with Lenin and Trotsky is unfounded.Actually Dilling does at times show overtones which remind me very much of how Trotsky approached certain issues, though Dilling does it from the opposite ideological end. Trotsky used to charge that the brand of politics followed by the Comintern in the 1930s, called 'Popular Frontism' is most treatments, was dissolving the Marxist program into a simple brand of bourgeois liberalism. Dilling takes it from the other end and envisions a conspiracy to dissolve conservatism. The facts show that Trotsky's view, with all of its errors, does come much closer to the truth than Dilling's perspective. What is simply ironic is the way she duplicates a similar mode of logic to that followed by Trotsky without even realizing that that is what she is doing.If it weren't for the reproduced texts from the Talmud, I would have to give this book a total zero if judging just based upon Dilling's textual discussion. Because I found the textual reproductions from the Talmud interesting I give it a midway grade."},{"Title":"The Plot Against Christianity","review":"If you are a Christian you must read this book from cover to cover.

She accepted without question the scurrilous forgery, Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and argued that Henry Ford stopped distributing them because of the pressure of Worldwide Jewry and those allied with them against evangelical Christians.She was, with other ultra-conservative Evangelists, a Nazi sympathizer, albeit one who should not have been brought to trial on charges of sedition along with a sizeable group of pro-Nazi ultra-conservative evangelicals. A member of the greatest generation, she wasn't, speaking for support of the Nazi antisemitism. One of her associates was known as the Jayhawker Nazi.Having this long dead hater claim any kind of scholarship on the Talmud or other sacred Jewish material is akin to having Pontius Pilate deliver the eulogy for Christ, then having him rape the followers. This is sick material. Dilling blamed Jews for every evil in the world -- and never looked in the mirror of her kind.The book might have value for researchers in to hate literature. You can read anything you want to, but it's a disgrace that Amazon is giving any space to the reprint of one of the more unspeakable pieces of drivel from someone who should be forgetten -- along with the hate.There is a conflict between the beliefs of the conservative evangelicals and other christians.

Why neither we with our unparalleled European Technology NOR our earstwhile Adversaries in the Old Soviet could LAND on the Red Planet? It is held by THEM. And these sons of the Kovenant control, by Proxies, our National governments, in Wash, London and other places which were once the glory of Western Civilization. And how? By sending their DAUGHTERS to Earth to Invagle the Sons of Men. By all manner of Means, by their diabolic Allure when they are young and by sutil Argument when aged.

Quentin Marks, in town on business, visits the bar every night after spotting Shandi working there, repeatedly offering to buy her a drink. He is drawn to Shandi in a way he has never been drawn to a woman before. Shandi feels that same pull, but in her determination to get her career on track, she does not want to look beyond a brief affair.When Quentin's business is concluded in New York, he is determined to take Shandi with him to his home and the quiet life he misses in Texas. Convincing her to go with him for a short visit proves difficult. She is fearful of establishing a deeper relationship with Quentin, not wanting to compromise reaching her career goals.Alison Kent once again brings her readers the unique, sensual characters that they have come to expect from her and a high recommendation comes easily."},{"Title":"Kiss & Makeup (Harlequin Blaze No. 197)","review":"Bartender Shandi Fossey is mixing cool cocktails temporarily at Hush - the hottest hotel in Manhattan. The place practically oozes sex...has sexual fantasy written all over it. For Shandi, it's a stopover on her way to finding her dreams. And a very long way from pulling beers at the Thirsty Rattler in tiny Round-Up, Oklahoma. So what's a girl to do when sexy Quentin Marks comes by every night offering to buy her a drink?To music producer Quentin, Shandi is one part sweetness and two parts sass with a dash of the unexpected thrown in. He wants to taste every inch of her...bury himself in her soft skin. He can open a lot of doors for Shandi, yet the only door he wants to lead her through is right upstairs...at Hush.But will everything change the morning after...?3rd in the Do Not Disturb series"},{"Title":"Kiss & Makeup (Harlequin Blaze No. 197)","review":"Shandi Fossey left her home tending bar at the Thirsty Rattler in Round-Up, Oklahoma to find fame and fortune in Manhattan. While she waits for her break, Shandi tends bar at Hush, a Manhattan luxurious hotel.Music producer Quentin Marks visits Hush every night that Shandi is on duty offering to buy the beautiful Sooner a drink. She sweetly declines each time, but does so with an impish hint of brazen fire that turns Quenti on. He muses that he probably would have a heart attack when she finally says yes as he sees desire for him flash in her eyes. He knows he can help her career, but does not want the gratitude of a roll in her sack as her remittance. Shandi's fears are similar that if he gives her career a boost, he will misinterpret her need to make love with him as payment in kind instead of truly coming from the heart.KISS & MAKEUP is an interesting contemporary romance because of the lead female character. Shandi is sweet and hot as the hunk Quentin will testify. The story line is somewhat common with the small town sweetheart and the big city dude falling in love though both have doubts about the other's motives since he can make her career. Alison Kent steps away from her exciting Smithson group thrillers to provide readers with a heated modern day Manhattan romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Catriona: A sequel to 'Kidnapped'","review":"I really enjoy Robert Louis Stevenson. Like Arthur Conan Doyle, he's got a surprisingly timeless voice. \\"Kidnapped\\" was my first introduction to R.L.S., and from the moment David Balfour met the narcissistic highlander Alan Breck Stewart, I was hooked. The plot was exciting, adventurous. The characters were surprising and fresh. When I heard there was a sequel, \\"Catriona\\", I settled in for what I imagined would be more swashbuckling, more pirates, more Scottish political intrigue.There's a fair serving of the latter, I suppose, but the vast majority of this book is a plodding romance between David Balfour and Catriona, daughter of rogue MacGregor James More. It's love at first sight for David, and the next 200 odd pages are rife with manufactured subplots and artificial bickering to keep them apart until the final chapter. (Yes, she's a Highland lass with a renegade father, but David, being an orphaned laird with a considerable inheritance, doesn't exactly have a lot standing in his way.) I spent much of the time waiting for the return of Alan. There'll be the excitement, the adventure, I thought. But nope. He just showed up as a perfunctory cameo, and played the role of matchmaker. Yeesh.If you're looking for a tidy historical romance, \\"Catriona\\" might just hit your fancy. If you're looking for something more in the line of \\"Kidnapped,\\" it's predecessor, you'll probably be disappointed. Apart from some crossover characters, there isn't a lot to tie these two together."},{"Title":"Catriona: A sequel to 'Kidnapped'","review":"Picture an upright, law-abiding young man as just about alone in the world, thrust into an unexpected fortune and a friend's rebel scrapes. Picture a bonny highland lass, the essence of innocence and loyalty. Picture Jacobite struggles, a negligent father, and a situation in which the only honorable course of action is that which appears the least honorable. Stevenson has done an exquisite job of weaving Davy's heartstrings into a knot--and, of course, the reader's as well. Can the tangle be unraveled without damage? By whom?I rarely enjoy a sequel as much as the story before it, but keeping Kidnapped and Catriona divided into two books is the same as slicing a standalone in half and buying both pieces separately. Kidnapped reads much more quickly, with a lot more fast-paced action. Catriona introduces more complex relationships. You can't have one without the other--they're opposite ends of the same arc.So if you're a fan of R. L. Stevenson, please do yourself a favor and find a copy. If you haven't read Kidnapped yet, then do yourself a different favor and find them both. Best read out loud in a Scots brogue."},{"Title":"Catriona: A sequel to 'Kidnapped'","review":"Having enjoyed Kidnapped very much, I wanted to read the sequel too but found it rather tiresome in the end.The beginning and and ending are pretty good, and the characters are well-developed, but the author seems to be fabricating and drawing out the tension in rather contrived ways for nearly the entire book. The hero's foolishness gets him and Catriona into an awkward situation, at which point her highly unlikeable father comes on the scene and makes the final chapters very tedious reading."},{"Title":"Catriona: A sequel to 'Kidnapped'","review":"This sequel to _Kidnapped_ does not start out as well as _Kidnapped_; however it soon makes up for it. _Catriona_ takes up the story of David Balfour only one or two days after _Kidnapped_. He must now try to clear his name and the name of James Stewart of the Appin murder. This will not be easy because the Campells want James Stewart to hang."},{"Title":"Catriona: A sequel to 'Kidnapped'","review":"Nearly as interesting as Kidnapped, but with quite a bit more romance"},{"Title":"Sources of Our Liberties","review":"Sources of Our LibertiesThis book starts with the Magna Carta (1215) and goes through the Bill of Rights (1791) in between are colonial charters and other documents from the 1200s and 1600s.

I have owned it for a long time, having purchased it more than 15 years ago. I ordered it without knowing terribly much about his work or the book itself.The examples of his early work presented here are magnificent. The publication quality is very high. The book and the images within it are quite beautiful. It presents his earliest work using a Leica camera in Europe and Mexico. It includes some remarkable images that are not well known, including alternate versions of some of his most famous images. These series help to illuminate his working method and the aura of mystery he is able to distill within a single frame.Many of these works explore concepts related to surrealism as well as documenting social conditions related to urban and rural poverty, middle-class rituals, unconventional behavior, and other scenes capturing people outside mainstream society.The book is essentially an exhibition catalog from a show at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. The introductory essays are excellent and provide a great deal of personal and artistic background on Cartier-Bresson, including some early examples of his forays into painting.I continue to return to this book repeatedly to revisit the images. I have posted a few photographs of Cartier-Bresson's work in my Flickr photostream, including several from this book. They can be viewed at [...].The image that I have titled \\"Cartier-Bresson -- hair\\" is the photograph on the cover of the book.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in black and white photography, spontaneous shooting, the history of photography, or Cartier-Bresson's emergence from experimental photography into photojournalism."},{"Title":"Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Early Work","review":"great images and biographical text by the editor of the photographerif you are an admirer of bresson's work already then the reference material about his life is indispensable"},{"Title":"Vandenberg","review":"This is one of my favorite hard rock albums of the 1980s and Rock Candy got it right with stellar remastering from Jon Astley!

We hope Sikes writes many more books like this for us to read in the future."},{"Title":"Hearts Across Forever","review":"The title sounds great but the writing doesn't only leave much to be desired, it leaves everything to be desired! It is predictable and trite. I was hoping for a writer of the talent equal to Barbara Michaels. This author is a huge disappointment. I will never purchase another of her books. She writes as if she's imagining herself in the part of her female character. She writes as a lovestruck teenager writes in her journal."},{"Title":"Hearts Across Forever","review":"When Kathryn Calder and Flynt Kincaid of New York City are transplanted to Jamaica, their attraction to the supernatural flavor of society they find that includes voodoo and native magic whets the appetite of the reader to learn more about its culture as well.

Flynt fears for his friend's safety as she is drawn to find out more about the scenes of these dreams and paintings depicting them.

Every Christian who has not abandoned rock music, including &#34;Christian rock&#34; must read this book. The author totally exposes the demonic and satanic agenda of all rock music.

I have studied piano and organ under some of the best teachers available and have won competitions, played for hundreds of church services, weddings, funerals, graduations and many other occasions. I am finishing up my degree in music performance. This writer uses more fallacies, errors, prejudices, and flat out lies than I have ever read anywhere. One classic example for you health care professionals is his explanation that during Diastole of the heart there is ventricular contraction to the lungs. Obviously flat out error! His views are obviously one of a non musician or amateur. He is doing the Devil's work by attacking the \\"Devil's music\\" in such an weak and uneducated manner. There is much truth, but it is severely tainted by his disregard for the truth. He even bold type's his text like some conspiracy theorist. This book was sad and obviously not edited."},{"Title":"Inside Rock Music","review":"This is a great book for people with very strict views on religion, otherwise I believe it is just trying to silence rock.

But as a novel this is complete, transparent, uninvolving, boring junk. I don't know why I bothered to finish it. Follett undeniably has talent. Pillars of the Earth was good, if in need of a good editor. Night over Water is just plain awful."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"It's a quick read because you can skim through about 80% of it without losing track of the \\"plotline\\". Sorry, but I didn't like Pillars either and this is my second KF book. Pillars should have been edited down to about 300-400 pages and this dud should have been a short story. Edited down to it's core, it would make an interesting article for an in-flight magazine.Follett seems to have a knack for stretching scenes out w-a-y beyond their natural and useful lifespan. For example, a girl runs away from home to go find her aunt in London. Why do we have to weed our way through a dozen pages of a pointless odysee, her every step described in excruciating detail, before her plan gets spoiled? In a book about high crimes above the high seas? That scene could have been done more effectively within a few paragraphs.There are quite a few other scenes with the same ailment, but I won't go into them here. I guess, if readers weren't bothered by the disease in Pillars, they might not notice here. Also, I suppose it would be different if the *characters* were interesting, but they're not.Another reviewer mentioned the thief's story and I agree, THAT one had potential but it fizzled out to nothingness. In fact, the book feels more like a collection of unrelated stories, none of which are brought to completion, and all of them forced into the main story of the big airplane. And then the big flop, literally, at the end.FWIW, the information about the plane is fascinating and yes, I certainly give KF cedit for doing his homework on it! Hence the two stars.I'm going to give Eye Of The Needle a try next. I don't give up that easily ;)"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I borrowed this book from our library, and enjoyed it so much I wanted to share it with my husband.

Well paced writing that kept my interest, always wanting to see what the next twist would be. Although a somewhat long novel, I read it at a leisurely pace within a 14 day library loan period."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I could not put this book down. The entertainment value was in the setting of the book. A plane... A \\"titanic\\" type aircraft. Only for the rich, one of the first Trans-Atlantic flights... What a story.I think the value of Ken Follet is in the diversity of his books. Yes they seem to follow the path of \\"SPY thrillers\\" but none are EVEN REMOTELY close to being similar in any way... (I've only read half his books so far though).But i just want to say that the book was very entertaining, and has, in my opinion, kept up to the standards that Follet has created for himself.I will say this as my only negative critisism: The book did jump around a slight bit, (Not that it was hard to comprehend, but you felt like you wanted the part of the story to continue, before he whisks you away to a different sub-plot). Also i felt slightly impatient at parts of the book, and just wanted the story to \\"wrap up!\\"... But in time it does, and is well worth the \\"build up\\".Honestly. Who can write a better book about a single flight??? He could write a masterpiece with only a square closet as the setting, I'm sure of it...I would call this book : killer!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I could not put this book down and just spent a very pleasant July 4th weekend reading it. Follet is an excellent storyteller, making this more than just another spy novel.The glamorous setting of the Pan Am clipper in 1939 is illustrated with vivid description- allowing the reader to truly feel the plane. Follett creates an ensemble plot with diverse characters with interesting backgrounds and now intersecting lives.This novel is very well written with lots of twists, great dialogue. I didn't want it to end and recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This book will take you back to 1939. Just when the second world war was starting.

Anyone would find this story riveting, and fans of historical novels (particularly WWII genre) will particularly enjoy this book. My only criticism is, while I am not a prude, the book has more than its share of gratuitous sex scenes. That having been said, I have not been disappointed in a Follett novel yet. This book gives one a new appreciation for the early pioneers of trans-atlantic travel."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I almost passed up this book because I don't really care for WWII novels.

Not deep like Pillars of the Earth, nor complex like The Third Twin, Night Over Water was just a good, fun read!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Night over Water is just a fun entertaining read. It takes place in a Pan Am clipper sort of like a flying hotel, during a flight across the Atlantic. We meet some interesting characters along the way and like eye of the Needle we get fantastic plot twists."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This was the first Follet book that I have read, and I love it. It was recommended by a friend, and I doubted him at first. But the characters are so strong and the plot is so appetizing, that I was pulled in before I even finished the first chapter. Just when you think you have the book figured out, Follett throws a curve to shake you up. I definitally will read other books by this author."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I've refrained from comment on two previously heard audiobooks by Follett because they were only abridgments. But Night Over Water was the long version, and I'm happy to finally get the opportunity to praise Ken Follett's exceptional storytelling. He's head and shoulders over most of his peers at creating engaging characters and combining their various stories into a strong dramatic narrative - all within a convincing historical context. In this case, it was a transatlantic flight from England to America at the outbreak of WWII. In A Dangerous Fortune, it was the financial world of turn-of-the-century London, and in A Place Called Freedom it was Scottish coal mines of the early 19th century. I give Night Over Water only 3 stars because I didn't enjoy it quite as much as these other titles, however he maintains a consistently high level of craftmanship in each of these diverse efforts. He's no high literary stylist, but he's never embarrassing either. The action is inventive but not contrived, the dialogue is never excrutiatingly unnatural, the characters are well differentiated but never cliched. It's just sturdy, reliable storytelling, which is a rarer commodity than one might think."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"OK, the author is generally so good that you are ready to forgive him for this one and move to the next better one.I found the book lacking in inspiration and missing the epic dimension one can find in Pillars of the Earth.

Highly recommended for all readers of spy-fiction."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This story, set at Brittain's entrance into WWII is a great Romance novel with a solid dose of Intrigue. The story follows several intertwined plot lines that are well linked. The plot takes a few twists and turns along the way, and includes a couple steamy scenes. This is the third Follett novel I have read (Lie Down with Lions, and Whiteout). I would rank it ahead of Whiteout but behind Lie Down with Lions."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I'd heard Follet's name a bit, so when Night Over Water showed up in the local discount bin, I gave it a try. I should know that nothing good ever comes from the discount bin.As an aviation buff and a fan of the era, I have to say that the setting is well-researched and very intriguing. I think also thought (unlike some other reviewers) that Follet managed to keep the story consistently plotted and moving along nicely. After a chapter or two, I was very excited about this book. But the characterizations eventually ruined it for me. The people are all two-dimensional cardboard cutouts, given to whiplash changes in attitudes and intentions. The only predictable trait? No matter what happens, the women all remain the sort of libido-driven sexual bobcats that exist only in the wishful fantasies of heterosexual males. By the time the gangsters show up and start spouting every offensive four-letter word known to man, for no apparent reason other than to show how mean and nasty gangsters can be, my interest in the book was almost nill. I finished it, but my enthusiasm for the story had long-since waned.The drama inherent in a mid-century transatlantic crossing aboard the most luxurious flying boat ever built could be the basis of an absolutely magical story. But this one isn't it."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"A story of romance,intrigue and espionage takes place over the Atlantic on the Pan American Clipper at the onset of WWII. Follett's mixture of characters are wonderful; everything from aristocrats to theives and spies on this flight. People from all walks of life taking this flight for all different reasons. A darn good yarn and as a bonus I learned something about the Pan American Clipper; an amazing engineering feat in itself."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Having finished Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, I rediscovered Follett after having read Eye of the Needle eons ago. Night Over Water is as well constructed a story as you'll find. He introduces the cast of characters so well, that when the flight commences and the personalities meet, the mystery and spice pull you in. Tighten your seat belt, this one is going to be a turbulent good read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"As usual another great story told by Ken Follett. This book takes you back to 1939 in pre-war times in England. It it about several different families and lives that come together on the Pan-Am Clipper. The story is beautifully told from many different points of view. I like the was he would end one chapter with one persons point of view, and then resume the other chapter going a few minutes back in time and telling it from someone else's point of view. I loved this book. Thanks Ken Follett for another wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"By Jeffrey W.

It's my personal opinion he peaked at \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" but something about \\"Night over Water\\" caught my interest.Set in the golden age of the airboat our story starts the same day war is declared between Germany and England. The London Pan Am clipper- a luxury airship that makes a trip from London to New York taking over 24 hours-is making its very last trip and it's filled to the brim with people desperate to escape the coming ravages of war.Our passengers number among them a fascists lord and his socialists daughter who is desperate to escape his overbearing clutches, a small time jewel thief running from the law, a woman leaving her husband for her lover, a businesswoman who must save her company from her brother's scheming and an FBI agent escorting a dangerous gang enforcer back to the US.But unknown to the passengers the plane's engineer is being blackmailed-his wife kidnapped and instructed to cooperate with a mysterious passenger when the time comes or his spouse will be no more. Not wanting to betray those who depend on his expertise or harm his wife the engineer is caught between a rock and a hard place.\\"Night over Water\\" is almost unbearably tense. There are at least 4 storylines going on at any given time, all of which have their own drama added to the larger drama of the eventual mysterious plan to cripple the plane.However the writing style here is fairly cheesy. Some of the dialog reminds me of bad 40's movies talking and the overly heightened emotions and decisions based on them made during the flight seem unrealistic at best and just plain silly at worst.Overall this was a decent read-but nothing special. Three stars."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Being a fan of anything connected with aviation I throughly enjoyed Night Over Water.The more I read the more difficult it became to remove myself from this story set on the verge of WWII. Well written with plenty of twists and turns that made for fascinating reading.The author did a great job of researching the Pan Am Clipper and its technology to give the reader a pretty good idea of what it was like to be a passenger on that elegant aircraft.A fine book."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Another well-crafted, fantastic book by Ken Follett. My only complaint is the formatting for the Kindle--random italics throughout the novel made it very distracting to read."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"A typical Ken Follett novel giving a highly believable blend of historical accuracy and dramatic imagination that will leave the reader wondering where the one finishes and the other begins.Simply written and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"It seems to me that Ken Follett just gets better and better with each new book he writes. I can't put his books down and I end up reading when I should be doing other things! He makes me care about his characters and what is going to happen next, and I don't want the book to end. World War II is a particular interest of mine, probably because I spent my formative years under its shadow and had eleven uncles and cousins fighting all over the globe. \\"Night Over Water\\" was an entertaining and informative read."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I had never heard of the Pan Am Clipper, but now I know lots thanks to this book and Googling. This story kept you in suspense and is so different of a plot from the other books I have read by Ken Follet. I loved this book. Now I'm reading the book The Key to Rebecca by Ken Follet and find it just as interesting and learning about how WW2 affected Cairo. Such talent Ken Follet is as an author!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"First off I'm a huge Ken Follett fan. I've read most of his work and just finished \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World\\" so I wanted to try something different. I loved this book. As others have mentioned, it does take quite a few chapters for the action to start. I read an article where I believe Ken said his first 10 novels were rejected. Upon closer examination of those novels by a close friend of the author's, he found his pace too quick with incomplete character development. So now he takes his time so when the action starts, you have a good idea of what they're going to do. And then he throws you a curve. Great plot development with lots of tension and unanswered questions, underhanded sneakiness and backstabbing and even a couple of good sexy romance scenes. And finally, the best compliment I could give would be to say this would make and EXCELLENT movie."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"On the eve of the Second World War, Pan American Airways provides luxury trans-Atlantic travel on its Boeing Flying Clipper, the largest passenger plane of its time. The plane shortens the trip from Southhampton, England, to New York City from the 5-6 days required by ocean-going vessels to a mere 30 hours. It also provides a sense of adventure for those who can afford the ticket.Set aboard the Clipper, this book tells the stories of a disparate group of passengers making one of the last passages before service is suspended because of the war. We have a love triangle, a petty thief hoping to escape jail, a disgraced noble and his family and other characters, thrust together in close quarters. Follett does a terrific job of developing these characters and their stories. The interactions between the characters all ring true, and as the tensions mount, he keeps the reader guessing as to what will happen next. This is a terrific thriller, in an unusual setting that gives the reader a detailed glimpse into what the early days of commercial air travel looked like."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Ken Follett always does such an amazing job of blending history into a fantastic fiction piece this time involving one of the last sea planes to cross the Atlantic at the start of World War II. The book really shines with the many cast members all being fleshed out and becoming individuals. This was a great drama with personal relationships thrown into a war time action novel. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Follett's 'Night over Water' could easily fit into the Romance vein of literature. I have read little of this genre, but I suspect that you will be hard pressed to find a better representation of its breed than this book. This book is chalk full of romantic interludes that in my opinion got a little old after a while. They were interesting enough only because the situations the characters found themselves in to get to the romantic bits pushed the story along. And the story is pretty interesting.The plot is set at the out break of war between England and Germany in WWII. Follett manages to bring a good dozen characters to life, exploring their history and their current problems which in turn set up an engaging series of delimas. I sort of felt like this book was unfolding like one of those star studded 1970's mega movies... like Towering Inferno or Earthquake. Several dozen stars undergoing the same events, yet lost in themselves.So if you are after a breezy romance, this is your ticket. Think Towering Inferno meets Titanic meets Gone With the Wind. I would say that Henry Miller is probably a better bet if you are after a more brazen read, try either 'Sexus,' of the Rosey Crucifiction trilogy or 'Opus Pistorum.'"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Thin plot, thinly developed characters, not the author's best. The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best. Night over water is interesting, but not nearly the suspense, drama or richly developed characters of Follett's best... not worth a read in my opinion."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This is a great setting and a good theme - badly executed. It reminds me of a plot of a Tom Swift boys adventure book from the '20's - but without the excitement and adventure. Maybe Follett hired someone to grind out the hundreds of pages of bad dialog and the all too predictable plotlets and final wimpering big bang climax. In the end, the book lays there dead, motionless and emotionless, like the dead cardboard cutout Scotland Yard Special Branch detective."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"The books was completely spoiled for me because 3/4 in the story there is a very sudden and extremely inappropriate scene. I can accept adult scenes, but this was unexpected because up until this point, there was no other adult material that would have at least warned the reader. I was abruptly ambushed with something I would never choose to read."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"If you like airplanes, intrigue, World War II stories, and good writing, you'll enjoy this novel by Ken Follett. Follett always does his homework and I always learn from him. This story takes place at the beginning of England's entry into the war against Nazi Germany in 1939. It is about the last flight of the flying boat, the Pan American clipper (Boeing 314), from England to America. The luxurious, short-lived air ship began life in the summer of 1939 and ended a few weeks later when Hitler invaded Poland.On board is a troubled aristocratic British family; an American actress; an Englishwoman running off with another man, leaving her husband; a young jewel thief; a criminal being returned to the states by authorities; a grumpy, demanding old princess; a German scientist and his companion; and others. This mix of characters and the situation in which they find themselves, make for an excellent story, especially considering the terrifying news flight engineer, Eddie Deakin, receives shortly before takeoff.The writing is tight, the suspense builds with every page (as events in a well-crafted story should), and the wartime events are accurate within the scope of a tale of fiction. I found it enticing, riveting, and plausible. I cared so much about some of the characters that at the end of the book I wanted there to be a sequel. I wanted to know what happened to Margaret and Harry, Diana and Mark, Nancy and Mervyn, young Percy, and even Margaret's sister, Elizabeth, who left the story fairly early on. The only problem with this book was that the copy I received from Amazon had 32 missing pages! I had to borrow a copy to read the missing text!!Another good Follett book with airplanes and a World War II setting is Hornet Flight (November 2003).Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Yet another gripping story by Ken Follett. On the eve of the outbreak of WW2, a clipper ship of the Pan American Line is due to fly from England to New York. These massive flying boats are the epitome of luxury and passage can be afforded by only the wealthy. It's a mixed bag on this trip-an aristocratic family who have been forced to leave England because of the fathers fascist views, a petty crook,an eloping couple who are being pursued by the womans jealous husband and various others.It's a gripping and exciting tale, well written in the Follett style and a good,fast,satisfying read."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I read this 544 page paperback in 3 days. Its \\"Ship of Fools\\" meets the Pan Am Clipper in 1939 at the very beginning of WWII. Everybody on the legendary flying boat seems to be running away from something and their stories all intersect during the 40 hour flight from England to the U.S. Its an easy and fun read, and the closest we'll ever get to experiencing the golden age of travel by flying boat."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Follett does his usual excellent job of researching his subject matter--in this case old passenger seaplanes--and the history of the era (a world spinning toward war in the late 1930s). And the writing style is fine, but the story just never got off the ground. I never quite got the point. It was as if he worked hard to invent characters and plot around a subject he wanted to write about: seaplanes. The whole thing seemed like a stretch. Think of it as &quot;Airport 1938.&quot;To Follett's credit he wrote in Night Over Water perhaps the steamiest sex scene I've ever read. I almost tried waking up the wife (dangerous). Plus I read this book after being completely blown away by his Pillars Of The Earth, so a let-down was inevitable. The book is better than most and probably deserves four stars. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Night Over Water harkens back to the end of the golden age of flight, concluded with the silencing of the PanAm Clipper. On the eve of World War II, the story follows a diverse collection of passengers who fly this luxury craft's final revenue flight from England to America. On the single night they spend over the Atlantic, their lives become intertwined in ways none of them imagined. The story of passengers escaping to a new world, running from an old, or eluding the present one is tangled with deceit; mystery; suspense; and love lost, found, and rediscovered. Night Over Water is a gripping story that is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Ken Follet takes you back to Pre-World-WarII in, Night Over Water. Through the eyes of different characters, Ken Follet shows you an imaginary flight on the Pan-American Clipper. The flight never happened due to the breakout of war in Europe but the flight depicts what the author thought would have happened on the final flight of the Pan-American Clipper from Europe to America. The story begins with several small stories, stories that all end up on the Clipper. It carried rich celebrities to royalty to businessmen. In the story, it carried movie stars, criminals, detectives, a journalist and an exiled landlord. Ken Follet takes you through the lives of different passengers all fighting different battles.The clipper was the most luxurious plane of the time. Only a few people in the world could afford to ride in it. There are no longer any of the clippers, they all were scrapped and the parts used for other planes. The clipper had different compartments, all had at least 2 used. The main compartment changed from a lobby to a dining compartment. The seating compartments changed to sleeping bunks. The only rooms that didnt change were the operating rooms and the bathrooms.During the course of the story, the characters all face many problems. There are disagreements in a family, betrayal in a family business, a summer affair and a scientist kicked out of his country because of his religion.There were a few things I really liked about the book. What I liked most was how the small stories came together during the book. There were also a few things I didnt like. One of the things I didnt like was how the stories switched too suddenly. It didnt give you time to learn more about the story you just read about.Once you start reading this book, its hard to put it down. The plot makes you want to learn more about the characters. The characters are all very interesting. They all have interesting stories that make you want to know more.To anyone that wants an interesting book to read, I would definitely recommend, Night Over Water, by Ken Follet."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"&quot;Night Over Water&quot; was a highly enjoyable read. Eventhough the book starts out slow and uneventful, Ken Follett does an exceptional job developing the characters. I rated this book a 4 (which should be 4 1/2) because for the first half of the book I found it hard to concentrate and stay entertained. Follett jumps from one character to another explaining their life history and how they have ended up on the plane. Once the plane takes off, the story really begins to soar. Much to my surprise, the author also incorporates a series of romantic adventures. This was the first Ken Follett book I've read and it will definitely not be the last!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Once again, Follett weaves an intricate tapestry using history as its background. He has an uncanny ability to use real settings in historical times as a backdrop for rich, entertaining characters.As with any follett book, the characters are what drives the story. This is a story of people who seemingly have nothing to do with each other. The reader will see, as the story progresses, that all the people in the book are tied together in ways they can't possibly imagine.Each character is beautifully written as are the various relationships that form throughout the book. And the ending! Talk about a page turner.I've read many of Follett's books and this one is definetly up there with A Dangerous Fortune. It might not be as majestic as Pillars of the Earth (my personal favorite Follett book and my favorite overall book that I've ever read to date), but it's just as entertaining."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Well, there are plenty of other reviews telling you about this book and most of them at least give you a pretty good idea of what it's about. Someone wrote that Follett's work is noted for having strong female characters. In \\"Night Over Water\\" the female characters are all out of the feminist's handbook. There is the dummy wife who can't make up her mind who she's in love with. Of course, she's never worked in her life, so she has to be a dummy and a victim of her cold, business-oriented husband. Then there is the corporate biatch. She's all about being a champion of corporate life and she is cast as nobly plotting revenge against her wimpy, conniving brother and his slimey attorney (well at least we agree on lawyers.) Note, this woman has far less redeeming qualities when juxtaposed with, say, Dagny Taggart in \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" And, the movie actress who is well-adjusted to the man's world because, well, I guess just because she's an actress and we all know that in the 30's an actress had to be a champion to survive in a man's world. But, Follett's male characters are all wimps, weasels, chauvinists, or some mix of all three. There is a scene where the biatch, who's quite attractive, leaves a room where the air crew are planning their flight. The author writes that as she closes the door behind her she hears the sounds of the crew talking and, although she can't make out what they're saying, they must be commenting on what a fox that was who was just in here. Are you kidding me? I mean, c'mon Follett, maybe they were talking about the flight.If what you're looking for is a soap opera that does very little to capture the anxiety and sense of danger of early trans-Atlantic flight or World War II, \\"Night Over Water\\" is right up your alley. I strongly recommend Alan Furst's novels over this one."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This novel takes place in 1939 just after England has entered World War II. It's told from multiple points of view, all from people who will take a flight aboard a Pan-Am Clipper (a truly luxurious (and historically accurate) airplane in the second 2/3rds of the book. This is sort of like a \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" set-up although more thriller than who-dunnit mystery. Passengers include business people, aritocratic families, a debutante, a film star, a petty thief, etc. They all have reasons for being on this luxury plane ride across the Atlantic, some of them because they want to be there and some because they have to be. The thriller/action part of the plot surrounds the lead engineer of the plane who is forced to sabotage it in order to save his wife who has been kidnapped in America. Follett leaves the reasons for this unclear at first as well as who the kidnappers are but uses it to build the suspense. In the end it turns out to be quite a complicated plot but I won't spoil it for you.This is a well-plotted novel; the suspense builds as we make our way through the story and we get to see events from several perspectives. Mr Follett does a great job building his characters and even though there are quite a lot of them, it is easy to follow the action because we know them so well. And he does a fantastic job of establishing the atmosphere. The descriptions of the scenes and especially the dialog of the characters really brought me in to the era. Sometimes it was like I was watching a Humphrey Bogart movie. I count this among the very best of Ken Follett's work and highly recommend it for fans of WWII era historical/thriller fiction."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Typical Ken Follett. Great characters built around well researched history with a \\"cheeky\\" ending. I wish there was a sequal. Fast read and a good break from serious throught provoking novels."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I am a big Ken Follett fan. I will most likely read all his books with time if ever stops writing them so I can catch up. However this book was a a little predictable. I still enjoyed it very much as it is so well written. I read to relax and this story did just that."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This was the first book I read by Ken Follett. Based on this read, I have read almost all of his other works! Well done and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Most of this book is set at the outbreak WW2, on a Boeing B-314 flying boat during a transatlantic journey between England and America. There are a multitude of characters and much of the story is centred on the dynamics of their relationships with each other, which do become quiet complex. The story includes a Lord who is a fascist sympathizer and very controlling towards his family. There is also an American gangster being repatriated with an FBI agent, a thief and con-man who is on the run from British justice, an industrialist pursuing his wife who has run off with another man and a Jewish nuclear physicist who has escaped from Nazi Germany. There are also a number of other characters. The main thread of the story is centred on Eddy, the flight engineer who unbeknown to the other crew members has had his wife kidnapped. Eddy has been ordered to bring the plane down in an isolated bay on the East coast of Canada or he will never see his wife again. Who the baddies are, and who or what they want from the plain, remains a mystery until the end of the book. I do consider Ken Follett one of the best writers of historical fiction that we have. Many of his novels are fast paced and entertaining. Even with his epic novels like \`Fall of Giants,' he has an excellent way of blending his characters in with the historical contents of his story. However, I have to say I did not find this book up to his usual high standard because there is far too much baggage. Although the book was based on an original idea, the story tends to drift too much in and out of the various romances, conflicts and other issues the characters face. This tends to slow down the pace of the story, which in turn does not suit his style of writing. The book was 640 pages long, I felt it could have easily been cut by 250 pages and it would have been a much better book."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I'm a WWII era buff, so while this was a work of fiction, I appreciated the intrigue. Plus I always wondered what those first trans-Atlantic flights must've been like. Well written: gripping, suspenseful, and an all around great read!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This is a very entertaining read in true Ken Follett style which is a page turner you can't put down. Follett creates such excellent characters and interweaves them magically in this book. Do not let the title or the thought of an WWII aircraft passenger liner put you off thinking it can't be exciting, as this book has it all. It is seriously brilliantly written with a fantastic plot, story line with plenty of twists and turns, nothing is as it seems, you are immersed into a different time. Follett excels in bringing to life England at the out break of WWII, it also highlighting the difference in attitudes of American and British classes as well as opinions accurately. MUST READ, feel confident purchasing this for an entertaining read that presents great value. I have now read 10 of his books and he has always delivered, some titles I have first thought should I? But each time he has surprised and entertained me this is no different."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"TThis was an amazing story , with many twists . It was so captivating i didn't want to put it done because i just had to see what was coming next."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I have loved all ken Follett's books. The only downside is that he isn't writing fast enough to keep up with my reading.The plot is superb and all the great period details are there. So informative-most of it was a steep learning curve for me."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Not as great as some of his other novels, but entertaining. Slightly predictable and loose plot.An easy read. Not typical Follett."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Ken Follett does not disappoint yet again with this novel. His ability to write the stroies of peoples and times that we can only dream of makes his writing something that you'd like to go back to time and agian."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Ken Follett strikes again with this intriguing historical fiction which captures the mood of Europe and America at the start of WW2. Even if you're not a history buff, you can't help but turn the pages to find out about the fate of the core group of characters, who are cleverly intertwined in each other's lives."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"By some strange reason, I went on a odd diet of four Follet books in a row:&quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot;,&quot;The Third Twin&quot;,&quot;The man from St. Petersburg&quot; and &quot;Night over water&quot;. The reason for this is probably because my daily commute allows lots of time for reading and as an adlolescent I enjoyed &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;. Suffice it to say that it will be some time before I read a Ken Follet book again. Four in a row, is more than enough to recognize the Ken Follet recipe for a best-seller and it is more than enough fluff to realize that my brain may suffer from some sort of &quot;inteligence&quot; decay. So, may I reccomend this book to all who are seeking a nice mindless trip into fantasy land, where little is required of you and you are under no threat of learning anything. This, and the rest of the books mentioned are the perfect vacation novels. Enjoy, no thinking required!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"An excellent novel. Follett once again combines history with suspense, love, sex, and treachery. He has a way of getting into each character and developing truly believable people and situations. In the end, you are glad that you read the book and you feel that you were there!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This book kicks! There is no other way to describe it. Follett's character development is precise, and his ability to tell a story is rivaled by no other. I was enthralled by the story from beginning to end. END"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This book is basically that of several stories all brought together on one huge airplane. The author (Ken Follett) manages to intertwine all of the individual stories superbly. How dothe rich daughter of a facist and a very lucky theif fall in love? Will the shoe insdusrialist beat her brother back to New York? Will she fall in love? To find the answers to theses and more, even greater mysteries read the book. It is deffinatly worth it!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Not only did this book create a passion within me to read more of Follet (which I have! And I love his style!) but he also made me fall in love with the Boeing B-314 and revised B-314A which were ordered by Pan Am from Boeing in the 1930s. It's sad only 12 of them were build (six 314's and six 314A's) and that none exist to date. The story in the book reminds me of the movie Titanic in many ways. I'm going to read this book again *just because* of its simularities with Titanic, the movie. I'm no airplane nut. Thanks, Follet, now I not only have another favorite author...but I also have a favorite aircraft!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"It was the beginning of World War II , a group of people boarded a Flying-Boat from Southampton to New York to flee from troubled England. It would only take a night to cross the atlantic but unknown to them that it was to be a very long night ! Ken Follett was at his best in Night Over Water , must read ."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Ken Follett knows how to tell a good story, and this book is no exception. Take this book to the beach and lose yourself in it"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Tastes vary, but to me this is one of Ken Follett's best. As usual, a collection of colorful and realistic characters are assembled at a pivotal moment in history. As usual, Follett carefully aims them toward a collision. But in Night Over Water the characters are achingly real, and the beautifully crafted maze of sub-plots just have to coalesce. They are all on the same plane!Night Over Water is one of the rare mysteries that merits reading more than once."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I enjoyed the light tension of the many story lines that Follett has again imbedded into this book. Not only is this book's story entertaining, but also somewhat educational, as usual. I was somewhat dismayed by a mistake in the last two pages: there is no large City of St.John north of the Bay of Fundy, but rather a City of Saint-John (the people of Saint-John would tell you and so would the post office)! This book was a reasonably good one to read after &quot;Pillars...&quot;,&quot;...Freedom&quot;,...Needle&quot; and &quot;...Fortune&quot;"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This is an interesting story. The details about the Pan Am Clipper are fascinating - the author gives us the feel of what it would have been like to take this 30 hour luxury flight. The dilemma faced by flight engineer Eddie Deakin is heart-wrenching, and the story of the thief is interesting. I don't think that this book is as good as Pillars of the Earth, but then that's a pretty high hurdle.One distraction was the fact that a main characters, Margaret, was such a conceited, brainless little twit. We had to hear over and over again about how she was superior to her sister Elizabeth, because Elizabeth had mindlessly adopted the beliefs of their father, while Margaret had mindlessly adopted the beliefs of the first guy she had sex with. Not surprisingly, by the end of the book she has sex with someone else and conveniently forgets her earlier convictions.This brings up another distraction - the author portrays people of the time (1939) as being obsessed with an arcane, pointless debate between two virtually identical political philosophies - communism and fascism. This is like debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, or trying to choose between two flavors of vanilla. (Of course, there's a difference in the two philosophies in terms of track record - communism in the last 100 years has killed far more people than has fascism. But we all know that fascists would have killed more if they'd only had the chance.)Perhaps the author was trying to show how muddled people's thoughts were at the time, and how little perspective they had. However, reading it today after all we've seen in the last century, it seems odd to hear people debate whether communism or fascism is better, as if there's any real difference!Other than those points, it's a good story, and I recommend the book."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"As a lover of history and aircraft, I knew this book would appeal to me. Follett recreates the luxury of flying on the PanAm Clipper beautifully. I appreciate the time taken to build up the backstories of several of the passengers, as well as engineer Eddie Deakin, who faces a heart-wrenching decision when his beloved Carol-Ann is kidnapped. I looked forward to diving back into the suspense and love every time I had to put the book up. The ending maybe is a bit too pat, with coincidence playing a big part, but for the enjoyment of the ride, I can forgive that. Just sit back and fly back into the elegance of 1939 air travel!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This is the first time I have ever read a book by Ken Follet, after many suggestions from my husband and I really enjoyed it. Not my usual genre, I like non-fiction he reminds me a bit of Sidney Sheldon, but not so corny (sorry, Sidney). But I really enjoyed this book, a very quick, light, read.Try it, I bet you will enjoy it, you feel like you really know the characters and want to get to another chapter to find out more about them."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Ken Follett can write better than this, and he has on several occasions. That said, this is still a better thriller than 95% of the novels in the genre - the rating is based solely on that comparison.As other reviewers have pointed out, Follett gives the reader an excellent course in the design, interior, and the &quot;feel&quot; of the Pan Am Clipper; I didn't know anything about this aircraft before I read the book, and Follett's lessons are designed so that any layman can understand them.But while the plot of this story is well-designed and totally logical, the people come off as cartoon characters. None of them are fully developed human beings in any sense of the word. And the conclusion is curiously incomplete - something unusual in a Ken Follett novel.As an introduction to Follett's work this would turn anyone off of his other, much better, works - &quot;The Key to Rebecca&quot; and &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;, to name two. I would recommend this book only if you've read some of his other novels, so you can judge for yourself what he's really capable of writing."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This book, like all of Follett's books kept me reading until the end but compared to his other novels it..didn't. The story had all the components that make a Follett novel great but that may have been the problem, it did seem like Follett was trying to force out another book as per contractual obligations. Good but not great."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Ok, this was no Pillars of the Earth, but it was a decent read anyhow. Just before the outbreak of World War 2, a Clipper - a large luxury plane akin to the Spruce Goose - is taking off from England for America. Some passengers are ordinary people, some are upper class people, some are movie stars, some are police, some are criminals, and some are Nazis. Moreover, someone has kidnapped the wife of a crewmember, and will kill her unless he brings the plane down in the Atlantic and release one very special passenger.There are many characters, with many intertwining plots, and Follett does a decent job in managing it, however, there were times when he would quit switching points of view, and continue with the more interesting characters. Also, the ending is a tad forced, in that everything ends a little too prettily, otherwise this book would have gotten 5 stars for being a real page-turner.Get this one next time you have a long flight.Relic113"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"What a crappy book. I read this after just finishing &quot;Pillars of the Earth.&quot; I thought that was such a great book that I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into &quot;Night Over Water.&quot; I wish I was wearing dentures so I could take them out and wash them. This book was a huge disappointment. Once I start a book I will finish it, but it was a chore finishing this. The characters are one dimensional. There are no surprises. The story would have been better off remaining in Mr. Follett's mind. It says nothing and goes nowhere I was interested in going. I'm amazed that a man capable of other great works could try to foist this off on the reading public. Guess he needed a few bucks. Read &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; again, instead."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I thought this story was interesting enough to keep you reading and I found the concept of a flying overnight boat to be interesting. I love books that take place during world war 2 so I liked the setting as well. The characters, to me, acted fine, they were much better drawn than people in some of the other books I read and they acted understandably. Diana got jealous, and sulky, Margeret had surprising dimensions as you read through the book ( at the beginning she seems like a good little crusader), I liked Harry's character, I thought he was really amusing. I didn't think Nancy was that interesting but she gave the book flavor, and I liked Mervyn more than I liked Diana's other lover. The political situations and beliefs added spice to the story, as well as the conflicts."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I love the research put into how the Pan Am Clipper operated, and the evocative description of people's emotions on the eve of Britain's entry into WWII. Unfortunately, the characters are mostly cardboard cutouts and their storylines are not particularly engaging. There's enough here to keep you reading -- for me, mostly because I love the descriptions of *how* things were done on board the planes and how the various British classes interacted at that time."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I read this book right after reading &quot;Pillars of the Earth.&quot; That might have been a mistake. I thought PotE was a great book. I thought Night Over Water was just awful. Trite, poor characterizations, uninspired. I can't believe others raved about it. I can't believe it's by the same author as Pillars, Eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca, etc. I have read Pillars several times and feel it is a great read. I gave Night Over Water away right after I read it. Read at your own literary peril."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Any fan of Ken Follett would have read The Fall of Giants before entering his second in the triology. Having been a child born near the begining of the Second World War, this one shed light on my formative years. I clearly remember my father, as a Warden, taking his turn at checking the black-out curtains in the neighborhood. I am looking forward to the final book."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This is a second read of this book, Night over Water, and enjoyed it so much on my Kindle this time. The Pan Am Clipper was an amazing airplane and is such a memorable place in aviation history. Ken Follett has captured the total essence of this majestic means of pioneer travel. It is a shame not one was saved."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It is evocative of WW11 events clearly showing how, before Pearl Harbor, it definitely could have been lost. Most of the characters, as usual with Follett, are believeable and very human. Lovely read."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I've enjoyed reading other Ken Follett's novels -- recently &#34;The Pillars Of The Earth&#34; -- and found &#34;Night Over Water&#34; a change from his more serious novels. It &#34;trips lightly&#34; making fun at it's characters. Simply enjoyable reading.I would recommend this for someone who could appreciate a light humorous novel."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This was a delightful read from beginning to end. Ken Follet is one of my favorite authors, and this book is one of my favorite Follet stories. I found myself laughing aloud while reading...and then feeling tense at certain points. Mr. Follet presents his characters so that they seem like people we know (or would like to know), and makes the reader feel involved in the story."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Although not as good as other Follet books, this is a well put together story. Some of the characters are left unresolved, but perhaps that isn't important. I found it hard to make the stretch on the action, but I still liked the read."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"At the moment I am only 40% along the way. I have read most of Ken Follett's books and rate this amongst his best. A fascinating read. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Not one of his best. Fanciful plot that doesn't hold up, weak characters, cardboard figures, improbable actions. Save your money, it's not worth it."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I enjoy Follett's writing style of building separate story lines in their own chapters and eventually tying them together. Reading some of these earlier books while awaiting \\"Winter of the World\\", the sex seems a bit repetitive but that does not interfere with the story lines and character development."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I read this book quickly - it is much shorter than his other books that I've read. The store is told from different point of views and they all come together on the PanAm plane. Defintely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I could not put this book down and just spent a very pleasant July 4th weekend reading it. Follet is an excellent storyteller, making this more than just another spy novel.The glamorous setting of the Pan Am clipper in 1939 is illustrated with vivid description- allowing the reader to truly feel the plane. Follett creates an ensemble plot with diverse characters with interesting backgrounds and now intersecting lives.This novel is very well written with lots of twists, great dialogue. I didn't want it to end and recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"The author, Ken Follett, obviously researched \\"clippers\\", the passenger seaplanes that crossed the Atlantic just before the outbreak of World War II, very well. He also did a very good job of providing detailed and interesting information about them to his readers. However, a strained story line into which many misplaced sex scenes are injected just to keep the book going, along with very shallow and undeveloped characters greatly undermine the value of this book. As a nonfiction, it would have rated five stars, but as fiction, even three stars is a stretch."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This book tells you or let you know how were the firsts trips to Europe by plane so you can compare them with our days, the book is really easy to read and have some internal good jokes, maybe I will keep away 2 or 3 sex scenes but in general is a good book."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"It is a thriller with much new information about how Boeings' ugly duckling took from water to flight. Well all ducklings know how to swim and how to fly. They should have come up with \\"Duckling\\" rather than with \\"Boeing\\" or \\"Airbus\\". The Clipper is a sea-going vessel that becomes airborne. It can only land in tranquil water or burst to pieces. It cannot land on the ground... hey, ugly duckling! It wasn't so ugly, because it had more luxury than any of our modern passenger crafts. Would I have flown with it? Heck, no! But nobility, snobility, and greedability enter in 1939 to fly or hijack such craft? You bet on it! Even then..... Hijacking is just a modern word for bucaneering, pirating etc. Clippers have throughout history been prone to it whether on water or in the air. This is a Ken Follett masterpiece. ..."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I read a lot of books but do not often write reviews. Mostly only after being completely disappointed and trying to be benevolent towards my fellow reader...warning them against wasting time. Time that I'll never get back.The author has written some real stellar works (Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, which many other reviewers note, plus Triple which was left off reviews but I found to be a nice read).This book, Night over Water, is easily one of the worst books I've read in the past couple of years. What an embarrassment to the author...really, Mr. Follett...you need to come forward and admit that you didn't actually write it. It's pathetic. Other readers commented on one dimensional characters, obvious plot lines, predictability, etc. but trust me, it's much worse than that. This book reads exactly what I would presume a drugstore romance novel might be. Just awful, shallow, and incredibly unrealistic from start to finish.OK, so maybe in the late 1930s there were a lot of 40 year old millionaires out there but there's no possible way people in such situations act as they do on this flight into the point of no return. Well, unless they're on the set of a soap opera. Several places in the story I was inclined to toss it aside...but then gave it another chance as the plot shifted (albeit a gnat's breath) but then when the sex scene happens in Newfoundland near the end, that was the final straw. That was just too stupid. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a sex scene. But this was cribbed right from a tv soap opera or a Harlequin Romance. Very amateur. That was as far as I got folks...I have no more time to waste on this crap.By the way, my title has to do with a couple of words that were strung together repetively in the story. Another tip off that this was not actually written by the author of Eye of the Needle; not his style. (Please please please Ken tell me I'm right!)"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"This is my sixth historical fiction by Follet, and he's now six of six as far as writing an entertaining story with enough twists and turns to drive(or fly haha) you wild. I do agree with one other reviewers comments about the introductions of the character's taking a bit too long, however, each storyline is entertaining in it's own right.The only other smalll complaint i have with this book is that it does end rather abruptly, but i'm not going to let that ruin the other 95% of the book that i enjoyed so much. Also, the ending does contain a twist that i didn't see coming, and after reading it i felt like i should of seen it, so Follet does a good job of not letting everything out in the open until the ending.The book is classic Follet. It involves: scandal, romance, theft (or lack there of actually), power, the struggle for rights, and a good assortment of real life character's. The boook has many similarites to the other historical fiction's that i've read by him, which is absolutey fine by me. Another great book from Ken Follet. Can't wait for \\"Winter of the World\\"!"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"It's 1939. England has just declared war on Germany! And, the luxurious Pan Am Clipper, a gigantic seaplane, is set to make its final flight from Southampton, England to New York. That is the setting of this exciting, nostalgic thriller written by Ken Follett, the famed author of Eye of the Needle and The Pillars of the Earth. Being a fan of World War II movies and novels, I loved this book! My only disappointment was that Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet were not on the passenger list. But, this $675 round-trip luxury flight does have nineteen interesting guests that rival any Bogart movie cast.The guests include a fascist marquis and his family, a grumpy Russian princess, a talkative movie actress, a Jewish nuclear physicist fleeing Germany, a baron, undercover British and American police, four American industrialists, a British millionaire chasing his wife, and a jewel thief. Add to them, terrified flight engineer Eddie Deakin, who is under orders from his wife's kidnappers to await further instructions from passenger Tom Luther. Believe it or not, Ken Follett manages to develop all of these characters, making the reader either root for or against every person in the novel...Great job!Tom Luther informs Eddie Deakin that his mysterious boss expects Eddie to cause the thirty hour flight to land short of their destination, so that they can remove a passenger. But who, why, and how? The guessing game begins here and ends at the Bay of Fundy, Newfoundland. This is the main plot, but there are many delightful subplots.The subplots include: the shoemaker owner, Nancy Lenehan, trying to maintain control of her company from her treacherous brother, Peter Black; Mervyn Lovesey trying to win his wife back from American, Mark Alder; the Oxenford daughters trying to escape the control of their fascist father; the jewel thief, Harry Marks, a.k.a. Harry Vandenpost, wooing Margaret Oxenford, while pondering the theft of famous jewels owned by her mother, the Marchioness; the fates of the fleeing German Jew Carl Hartmann and gangster Frank Gordon. And finally we have the wishy-washy Diana Lovesey flip-flopping between her husband Mervyn and Mark Alder. There are more, but these are the most noteworthy. Somehow the author ties all of these events together into an amazing climax!This novel reminded me of an airplane version of Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, but without Hercule Poirot. This is a must read for historical fiction and Ken Follett fans alike."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"I'm a big Ken Follet fan. He's one of the best suspense writers of our time. That being said, it took a while for the story to get going. Nearly the first half of the book is spent in character development. One of Follet's strong points is his character development. Unfortunately it took too long, well past the \\"100 page rule\\". I'm glad I didn't abort the read, as the story really picked up pace after that. There were some \\"yeah, right\\" moments, but then again it's fiction! Follet shined in the latter half of the book."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"[spoilers]Despite the fascinating premise and extremely interesting setting of this novel, Follett's execution is poor.The prose style is straightforward and dull. None of the poetry and elegant descriptions of Eye of the Needle.The characters are mostly irritating or stereotypical. Marks is notable for his contempt for unattractive women; Lenehan allowed her incompetent brother to ruin her company and now whines about the decision she made; Deakin nearly kills the plane's passengers; the Oxenfords are insufferable.The book is full of ridiculous anachronisms.Hartmann was being pursued because he was a nuclear physicist, but at that time England did not recognized the value of fission. It is absurd to believe that Mervyn Lovesy, with little background in theoretical physics, would know so much about fission and its importance at the time - in fact, the British generally ignored Leo Szilard at that time period (which is one reason he emigrated from Britain to the U.S., in fact, after fleeing Germany).Elizabeth Oxenford's political ideas are completely out of date for that time period and that class (e.g. her musings on all the people the Fascists disliked, ca. p. 102).Finally, the attempts at American dialog are laughable or embarrassing. Deakin self-consciously utilizes obscure American slang that must have come from some slang dictionary; the \\"gangsters\\" talk like American gangsters from bad foreign movies.The book also interjects some execrably written graphic scenes, to no clear purpose."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Some research went into the aircraft, which is interesting so far as it goes.

However that is all the good news I have for this book. Too many of the characters are photocopies from 'The Man from St. Petersburg', which is one of his best novels. As such I found the characters transparent. The plot is also contrived, with its resolution a bit forced.Having said this I must point out that a three star Ken Follet is a better read than a five star of many other authors.

Do not leave the bookfor too long alone can forget the characters"},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"\\"The Eye of the Needle\\" is on of my favorite novels set during World War II. Subsequent works by Ken Follett have always disappointed me, but for the reader who is looking for an escape and is willing to accept implausible plot development, \\"Night over Water\\" is an engaging read.Characters are two-dimensional at best, and the storyline melodramatic. Where Follett succeeds is in his descriptions of the Pan Am Clipper and the almost claustrophobic sense of the many hours (30 total) that it took for the journey across the Atlantic. At one point, a scene described the morning meal served on the trip, and I thought \\"how many more meals can these passengers eat?\\" Within a paragraph, there was a reference to how tired one of the characters had become of the endless food and luxury of the trip, instead simply wanting the trip to be finished.The book is enjoyable in the way a 1940s movie would be - slightly dramatic and almost campy, but engaging as an escape.I beg to differ with one reviewer who felt the sex scenes \\"steamy\\" - if you want steam, don't expect it in \\"Night over Water.\\""},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"the WWII setting is what drew me to this novel as i am a WWII history buff. the romantic stories were great. it was a bit slow at first, but i really got drawn into the characters and loved the way events unraveled on the flight over the atlanric."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Ken Follet is one of my favourite authors, if not my favourite, and this is one of his best - in my opinion.

I personally wasn't engrossed in the story, but I appreciate there is an audience for richly detailed, advertised suspense stories, even if they aren't exciting reads to this reviewer."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"Follett really fleshes out his characters.

Unfortunately, this is a mediocre one. In fact, it reminded me a great deal of those early WWII 'B' movies that studios used to turn out every couple of weeks, where the characters and the plot were pretty predictable and the outcome mostly certain. This book has some points of interest, mostly historical detail. Follett obviously has some kind of keen interest in the big flying boats of the period, but he doesn't use that fascination to advance the story well. The characters are stereotypes and the action is melodrama. The reader doesn't come away from this book with much to remember fondly."},{"Title":"Night Over Water","review":"The only other Follett book I've read was PILLARS, which i consider one of my favorite books ever, this one however doesn't even make the top 500. Here's why?1)it read like a bad soap opera than a good thriller, people fall out of love then run into someone else and fall in love with them and so on.2)I couldn't care less about the characters, the only one who was interesting was the thief, then that got ruined by this lovey/dovey soap opera junk too.3) then ending was so ridiculous that I actually laughed out loud. I found myself saying &quot;Ya right&quot; way too often and that is never good.I did,though, finished it and at times some of the multiple stories do grab you but overall it's trash and I'll know one day I'll see a movie version of it on the lifetime channel."},{"Title":"The adventures of Jimmy Skunk (Bedtime story-books)","review":"My 6 years old told me it was one of the greatest book he ever read!!"},{"Title":"The adventures of Jimmy Skunk (Bedtime story-books)","review":"This review applies to the edition published by Dover. Unfortunately all reviews show up under all editions, regardless of publisher.This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. However, the prospective buyer should be informed that the illustrations in this Dover edition are NOT by the original illustrator, Harrison Cady. Instead, they are crude redrawings by another artist, Thea Kliros. Although they are better than the illustrations in the Dover titles for which artist Pat Stewart did the crude redrawings, they are not as charming as Cady's work.Some of the other titles in this Dover series of Thornton Burgess books do have original Harrison Cady illustrations.To get real Harrison Cady illustrations of this title, you'll have to buy a used book. There were three sets of original Harrison Cady illustrations for this title:-- Published by Little, Brown, with 6 full-page grayscale illustrations.-- Published by Little, Brown, with 10 full-page color illustrations.-- Published by Grosset & Dunlap, with 14 full-page B&W; line drawings, including line-drawing versions of all 6 original grayscale illustrations in the Little, Brown editions, plus many smaller line drawings.The redrawings in this Dover edition are of the 6 grayscale Little, Brown illustrations.On the other hand, the front cover illustration is by Cady. It's a color version of Little, Brown first edition cover. It was also on the 1964 Little, Brown edition, and on the Canadian edition, published by McClelland and Stewart.I recommend the Grosset & Dunlap edition. Cady did them decades after he did the 6 grayscale Little, Brown illustrations, after he had grown as an artist. Even though the Grosset & Dunlap line drawings are simpler than the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations, they are more charming. On the other hand, the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations better show Cady's remarkable vision for Burgess' creatures, so if you can get both, that's ideal. But either one is better than the drawings in this Dover edition.The Little, Brown edition with the 10 full-page color illustrations was done about the same time as the Grosset & Dunlap drawings, but it is not a well-made book, and is not as enjoyable to hold and read as the Grosset & Dunlap."},{"Title":"The adventures of Jimmy Skunk (Bedtime story-books)","review":"Hello.

Jimmy Skunk is slow, dresses well and is widely avoided by his neighbors due to his special bag of perfume that he carries with him provided by Mother Nature. All of these factors however don't stop his friend, Peter Rabbit, from trying (and succeeding) to pull a prank on Jimmy at his and Reddy Fox's expense. During the outcome of this trick, we learn of the stinky possibility that awaits anybody who dares to mess with Jimmy Skunk. Unfortunately, Reddy Fox learns this tragic lesson on account of Peter Rabbit's prank. However, due to the fact that Reddy is a predator who tries to catch and eat all of Jimmy Skunk's friends, Jimmy doesn't fret too much over his mistake. He just makes sure in his own mischievous and witty way that Peter Rabbit gets what's coming to him as well.That sense of wit comes into play again when Jimmy and Unc' Billy Possum have a dispute later on in the book. Due to Jimmy's smarts, he walks clean away from Farmer Brown's boy when both he and Billy Possum are trapped in a hen house, and he leaves Billy to face the music, so to speak.This tale is told in a very mischievously clever way that my daughter enjoyed. I hope you give the book a try.Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."},{"Title":"The adventures of Jimmy Skunk (Bedtime story-books)","review":"These series of books by Thornton Burgess were written about 100 years ago. They are delightful stories for young readers to expose them to the lives of animals. Very fanciful and not serious, they perk the interest of young readers that animals have social lives, have adventures and perils, and allow the young reader a feeling of intimacy with animals. My 9 year old daughter truly loves these books. We've found a big adventure together trying to collect most of the books. There are more than 20 of them, many long out of print. I believe this is better reading than the current popular books which are for teenage readers. Try reading these books to your 5 year old, a priceless time together for father and daughter. When she became 8 she began reading them for herself. No finer children's books for young readers."},{"Title":"Schaum's Easy Outline of Biochemistry","review":"This little review and outline packs a lot of information into only about 130 pages. This means it makes for fairly dense reading given the technical level but it's obviously intended for the biochem or serious student. The book consists of 15 chapters ranging from 5 to 20 pages in length, depending on the subject. Key concepts or facts are emphasized and often highlighted in dark gray boxes throughout the text, and some chapters include solved problems. A sampling of the chapter titles includes Proteins; Lipids and Membranes; Enzyme Catalysis and Kinetics; Carhohydrate Metabolism; the Citric Acid Cycle; Nitrogen Metabolism; and Gene Expression and Protein Synthesis.There are about 100 illustrations ranging from graphs and tables to the usual molecular structures and also diagrams of more complex molelcular reactions that require several steps or mechanisms such as the elongation step of polypeptide synthesis, the metabolic pathways of beta oxidation, as well as illustrations of longer ones requiring many steps, like the citric acid cycle, the role of amino transferases and glutamate dehydrogenase in nitrogen metabolism, the urea cycle and metabolism, and others.Overall this is a useful little book that is one of the most concise and informative presentations of the most important concepts in biochemistry that I've seen, and at only nine bucks the price is right too."},{"Title":"Schaum's Easy Outline of Biochemistry","review":"I was hoping for a supplemental to my undergrad biochem course.

I am glad I read this one first. It is a well-documented and scholarly book, yet full of passion and feeling about the City of the Angels. It focuses almost exclusively on \`Downtown', whereas Davis's book ranges more widely.I was left in no doubt about Klein's feeling for that part of LA - he lives in Anegelino Heights - the first suburb just north of Downtown. Klein brings to life through personal anecdote the vitality and multiculturalism (and problems) of his, and other neighbourhoods.You get to boo and hiss at the villains who have alienated greater LA from its Downtown, but you also get a sense of Klein's affection, and sense of hope for the city.Davis's view is much bleaker and perhaps nihilistic - he rails against the racism upon which LA is foundered, and upon which the powerful thrive, but I note in passing that he lives in the uppermiddle class enclave of Pasadena. Klein, on the other hand (at least at the time of writing) remains part of the inner urban fabric of the city. I get the feeling that Klein is a supporter of urban renewal, whereas Davis views it as another alienating con on the part of City Hall.I agree with a previous reviewer that the novella within the book doesn't quite work. I think it contains the seeds of a good story in another genre, but is misplaced here. One problem may be the attempt to speak in a voice for which he has respect, but which is not his.If you are interested in all things LA, film and fictive noir, the great upheavals and crises of a city such as the Rodney King affair and the LAPD, apocalyptic LA, and more - all of which penetrate the consciousness of many way way beyond the city (through globalised media, which is part of the fabric of LA) , then you will be enthralled by this book. Read it alongside Davis, by all means, but don't neglect it in favour of Davis!If you like discussion of film and fiction set in LA, there is lots in this book to ponder.Note: Klein cites Davis in his work. I have not seen Klein cited in any work of Davis (understandable in City of Quartz, which predates Klein's work, but he also does not appear in the index for Davis's later work Ecology of Fear - which at the time of writing this I have not yet read)"},{"Title":"The History of Forgetting: Los Angeles and the Erasure of Memory (Haymarket)","review":"The History of Forgetting is among the best of the newly bourgeoning genre of LA urban history and theory. Much of the information within is presented in an engaging, if leftist style. This book fits well alongside Mike Davis' landmark City of Quartz, though it's rather self indulgent chapter of fiction (written from the point of view of a Vietnamese immigrant), is tiresome and ultimately incongruous with Klein's apparent desire to expose the rewriting of LA's various histories. A strong, if flawed book."},{"Title":"The History of Forgetting: Los Angeles and the Erasure of Memory (Haymarket)","review":"The the text is full of concepts that put LA into historical and theoretical perspective. The only part of this book that doesn't shine is the middle chapter, seven, where Klein attempts a novel set in LA. This should have stayed in his notebook.Academic yet accessible, The History of Forgetting gives readers an essential vocabulary through which they can filter their understanding of LA.&quot;Social imaginary,&quot; &quot;trace,&quot; &quot;simultaneous distraction,&quot; and other ideas help reinforce the central idea that LA exists as a series of what the subtitle calls &quot;erasure(s).&quot;I'm using this book with my college class, and while they occasionally struggle, they've gained a sense of power in their ability to take the ideas Klein puts forth and use them to interpret fiction set in LA.The text is more compelling that Mike Davis's latest, book, and certainly of interest to anyone who studies popular culture or contemporary literature."},{"Title":"The History of Forgetting: Los Angeles and the Erasure of Memory (Haymarket)","review":"If you love L.A. don't read this book. If you don't want people to come here -- have them read it. This book was really a good read and made me realize why I used to dream of fires and floods about this city. It can really give you nightmares and make you a little sad that this city is indeed void of soul. Why though? Why? It's in a prime location, has lots of promise, etc., but just can't equal up to other great cities. Maybe because it just tears down things over and over again? If this city becomes like Blade Runner I'm a'leavin' for sure. Yet, when I look at the palm fronds glisten in the sun and the ocean waves sparkle against a vivid blue sky, I feel as if my heart is stuck here. Los Angeles is like an orphan who gets shuttled around. &quot;...Forgetting&quot; is a haunting expose' that left me blue so I had to rent a gut-splitting comedy (filmed elsewhere USA) from my neighborhood video store which used to be four other stores before that one. But of course I don't know what they used to be since all signs of former tenants have been erased."},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"In this best and clearest of her works Margaret has spelled out what was lost from the very start in Christianity and why this loss of Mary Magdalene's correct place next to Jesus, as his beloved, matters still. This book is not a feminist tirade about women's rights, although it upholds the valid need for this sort of reformation. It goes beyond that point to expose damage done to the human soul/spirit because the paradigm of wholeness or union of the human soul with God was skewed early on. She teaches us about the customs and prevailing mindset of the peoples surrounding Jesus and Mary in first century Palestine and we begin to see that there was surely a heiros-gamos or sacred marriage between Jesus and his beloved. This sacred union should have been the model, since it truly reflects the image of life itself. She has rightly stated that her research and her premises are based on the gospel stories themselves and on a solid Judeo-Christian heritage. They cannot be debunked. This is important, breakthrough work that should be considered seriously for the healing and refreshment it can bring to Christianity. Margaret has brought to light challenges that will not easily be overthrown. It is only lack of information about the era that keeps us ignorant of the importance of her work. While no one can prove or disprove an actual marriage between Jesus and Mary, reading this book may convince one that history is not always the way it has seemed for all these years!"},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"With her latest book, Bride in Exile, Margaret Starbird joins a few very select biblical scholars (e.g., Spong, Schoenfeld) whose work remains steadfast at an extremely high level. The current book continues the work she started with Woman witn the Alabaster Jar (1993), the Goddess in the Gospels (1998, and Magdalene's Lost Legacy (2003). Her main theses are that Jesus and Mary were married and that knowledge of this marriage was not included in the gospels. This denial of the \\"sacred marriage\\" has left Christianity, particularly Catholic Christianity, lacking the feminine counterpart, and thus incomplete. Some lesser themes center around the true meaning of her name (Starbird believes that it is \\"Mary the Great\\" rather than Mary of Magdala) and the many myths and legends about Mary that gave birth to the plethora of artwork in the Renaissance.Comparing this book with her other works, some readers may be disappointed that the role of Mary in legends and folklore and her portrayal in artwork have been placed somewhat on the back burner in favor of a more scholarly approach to establishing the veracity of her theories. Personally I enjoyed the change and find that this book should silence any critics who harp, unfairly, about her lack of scholarly acumen.This isn't to say that I am in perfect agreement with Starbird on all her points. For example, I don't believe that \\"James the Lesser\\" refers to James, the brother of Jesus (p. 21), or that \\"the other Mary\\" is Jesus' mother (p. 75). Nor am I convinced that Mary's marriage to Jesus was purposefully kept from the gospels to protect her (p. 31 and elsewhere). I'm more inclined to believe that the mentions of the marriage were removed by competing Christian sects, just as they removed favorable mentions of the activities of other members of Jesus' family (see Jeffrey Butz' The Brother of Jesus for an excellent exploration of this area). But any disagreements with Starbird are minor compared to the evidence she marshalls to support her main views, and on these points she can't be faulted.Of all her books I think this is the best all around summary of Mary Magdalene. In addition, it may be the best all around summary of Mary by any author. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in Mary, from beginning students to advanced scholars. It's well written, has good notes, a chronology, and a CD with a one hour lecture."},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"If you feel you need other detailed historical research to back up Margaret's story here, Custodians of Truth, The Continuance of Rex Deus, by Tim Wallace-Murphy and Marilyn Hopkins, 2005, will give you wonderful back-up history!!! This is just such an important piece of history to understand thoroughly if you want to appreciate the fascination with the DaVinci Code type stories. This was info subjected to the various Inquisitions over and over again, sadly by some of my own ancestors; but more of my ancestors had Margaret's \\"story\\" passed on to them in their Initiatory organizations, and know there is plenty of truth here that now needs to be made public. Thanks to Margaret for helping with that process, as it should make the world a gentler place when we realize we do not need an exterior authority to \\"save us from sin\\" and to exterminate those who disagree; we need to realize The Kingdom is Within, and get on with understanding our Oneness with the Quantum worlds now being explained by great physicists like Michio Kaku.Another great new book written by someone who's studied this for more than 30 yrs. also, is Stephen Mehler's, From Light into Darkness. The connection of Jesus and Mary to ancient Egypt is made clear. This is important information that will be coming out more and more now as it is imperative for our evolution into the higher quantum worlds around us!!"},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"Based on historical, symbolical, and mythological records and interpretations, Margaret Starbird examines evidence from the Judeo-Christian scriptures and other early writings that supports the claim that Jesus was an essential partner of a time-honoured sacred relationship that was at the heart of his spiritual message. She argues from both a logical and intuitive perspective that the sacred union of Jesus and his bride was the very cornerstone of early Christianity, and the key ingredient for solving many of the ills still faced by Church and Society today.The significance of understanding and applying the integrated objectives and values of these teachings to both personal and societal practices and pursuits, while maintaining the necessary balance between the two gender-related components, was subsequently lost and distorted by the unbalanced perspective of the male-dominated Church leaders who sought to institutionalize and control the traditions and teachings for almost two millennia. In the wake of this continuous domination, the voice, role and perspectives of women in the Church have become severely curtailed. The Church became the powerful, dominating Bachelor served by the humble, intimidated Maid, rather than a sacred, balanced union of the Groom and Bride in equal partnership. As a result, balance shifted, strict incomplete and distorted interpretations and practices were imposed, and dissent became punishable by imprisonment or death.Through a careful examination of the disregarded evidence concerning the exiled bride Mary Magdalene and the feminine archetype, Margaret Starbird elevates the reader back to a conscious awareness of what the Church taught in the very beginning - the Sacred Union, and the intimate partnership of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, reflecting the principles of union and love which are necessary to begin the eventual achievement of all levels of personal and societal advancement.Margaret Starbird's research traces the esoteric origin and development of the Sacred Union or Hieros Gamos wisdom; how it was reflected in the Old and New Testaments; how it went underground for almost two millennia following the patriarchal impositions; how it survived as an underground stream of esoteric wisdom expressed through art, philosophy, literature and religion; and how it continues to struggle into conscious awareness today, as an important archetypal principle, filling and healing the many forgotten voids left in Church and society alike.Margaret Starbird skillfully brings the principle of the lost feminine archetype back to awareness, restoring Mary Magdalene to the preeminent and intimate position that she once held as the favoured companion of Jesus. She thereby resasserts the forgotten, balanced view of Christianity based on the sacred union as taught by Jesus and expressed in the Gospels. It makes little sense that any responsible rabbi would not teach what he himself did not fully embrace.For anyone who feels affronted by the continuing reluctance of top male-dominated Church leaders to once again embrace the feminine principle and change the unbalanced, distorted and disrespectful gender attitudes and influences implicit in the administration of many of the institutionalized Christian Churches, and who seeks a healthier, balanced and respectful understanding of the earliest Christian teachings, this well-written and thought-provoking book is one of the most encouraging and sensible on the subject that I have encountered.The book is written in a style that can be easily understood and appreciated by a man or woman, regardless of the amount of his or her biblical background. It contains 24 colourful, informative plates of Mary Magdalene-related artwork throughout the centuries, a chronology of key events, an index, and a CD which contains an inspirational one hour talk by Margaret Starbird, elaborating on some of the important parts that were raised in the book.After reading this book, the reader will be inclined to agree with Margaret Starbird that even if Jesus and Mary Magdalene were not intimate partners of a sacred marriage, then in order for the Christian message to be complete and understandable, they should have been."},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable read. However, I found the argumentation was from a very Catholic perspective, despite the author's conviction that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married. What I mean is that Margaret Starbird does not question the virgin birth doctrine or the \\"divinity\\" of Jesus, and accepts the theological view that Jesus came to die for our sins. All these things are contradicted by the idea that he came to be a husband and make a family. Put bluntly, only a psychopath marries one day and commits suicide the next. A rational understanding of Jesus is long overdue, one that incorporates the idea that he was a real man with real physical and emotional needs, but also that his premature death was a disaster for mankind - as history proves on a daily basis. But we don't get that here. So while I recommend this book, and think it is a step in the right direction - it is nevertheless a baby step."},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"Definitely a worthy read from the point of view of quality of research and writing. The author is obviously as erudite as she is eloquent. However, the claims she makes are pure speculation, without any historical proof outside the New Testament, which is very ambiguous to say the least, and can be interpreted in a variety of ways.Margaret Starbird goes out on a limb by making some bold interpolations, that Jesus was married, by citing the Jewish Law that all Jewish men had to be married, and that since Mary anointed Him, which is clearly enough stated in the New Testament, she must be his bride, because of a pagan rite practiced in the medirranean, where only a wife can annoint her husband. Well, we can clearly see the depth of Mrs. Starbird's learning in mythology and lore, but superimposing myth on scripture and finding that it fits, can hardly be considered as historical proof. Margaret herself admits that this is pure speculation, despite her strong belief in it. I think that she deserves a great deal of respect because this frank admission is what sets her apart from charlatan historians who make wild claims about the Holy Grail and Jesus' legacy and all the stuff that sells junk books like \\"The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". The book is worth buying for the mythology and the lore of the early and pre-Christian periods, containing fascinating stories about Mary Magdalene and Jesus.On the other hand what I found more interesting are the political implications of what's termed by the author as \\"alternative Christianity\\", [mis]labeled as heresy by the orthodox institution in its struggle for the spiritual monopoly. The fascinating research on medieval and renaissance art reveals many references to heretical ideas, such as Magdalene as the Bride of Christ. This can hardly be seen as unusual, because artists and intellectuals have always been dissidents under oppressive regimes, and have ridiculed the repressive institutions and ideologies. Jesus himself can be seen as a spiritual dissident in his own time, which has earned him the dealth penalty. Have we not seen that sort of thing before, under the Soviet Regime? However, one must be careful not to get carried away in interpreting these references and symbols, lest we fall into speculation (a la Dan Brown). The author appears to be quite knowledgeable in symbolism and mythology so she is well-qualified to offer her interpretations, inconclusive as they may be.She also makes some poignant statements about the opression and marginalization of women in that period in general and in the church in particular, Mary Magdalene serving as a perfect example this sad fact, and expresses her hopes that the in the future the church will embrace the feminine, and reinstate the respect that Mary Magdalene deserves.In short, buy the book - it is a very good book - if you cannot get it from the library, but do not expect any amazing new revelations about Magdalene's spiritual teachings."},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

Amen"},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"I'm baffled by criticisms of Margaret Starbird as a scholar. It almost feels faddish to bash her. Her critics seem compelled to accuse Starbird of doing unscholarly work. Odd.Starbird is an independant scholar, no longer teaching, now devoted to full-time writing and lecturing. Her academic work is impressive. She completed both a BA and MA in Comparative Literature and German at the University of Maryland. After that, she studied for a year on a Fulbright Student Fellowship to Albrechts Universit&auml;t in Kiel, Germany. She then pursued Doctoral studies in German, Comparative Literature and Linguistics at the University of Maryland. Following that, she studied at Vanderbilt Divinity School in Theological Studies.Margaret taught university German as full-time faculty at the University of Maryland and North Carolina State University. Following that, she was faculty, teaching religious education and scripture course for a variety of schools, including U.S. Army schools and Roman Catholic parishes. While Margaret was doing her academic work and teaching, she was also moving around the world with her husband and rasing their five children. It would be interesting to see the credentials of her critics.Meanwhile, experts don't agree about the Magdalene; all we have are glimpses of scriptural figures in the texts. Scholars don't try to \\"prove\\" historical facts about figures in the gospels. They know that the gospels, whether orthodox or apocryphal or gnostic, are not historiography but stories written to persuade, convert, or inspire the reader.Scholars examine the texts to see what they reveal about those who wrote them -- the religious communities and traditions that produced the texts. Each text represents a perspective or version of the Christian story. None of the texts are seen as literally historical, even if containing historical glimpses or references. Scholars evaluate the texts in comparative ways, posing different texts against each other to see how they comment on each other.Starbird's work has merit as comparative literature. Her books deal with literary interpretation, not history. It's illogical to say her work is \\"not history\\"--she isn't claiming to write history. She is interpretating biblical, Christian, Medieval, and literary texts, analyzing them from a rhetorical approach, engaging rhetorical and creative interpretations.Margaret knows her texts well, she has compared them extensively, and quotes them from memory. She has a gift for finding deeper meanings embedded within texts. She connects the texts, stories, symbols, and traditions to our 21st-century mindset, making them live in contemporary culture. She knows how to use textual figures, such as Jesus and Magdalene, to teach symbolic or metaphorical ideas.When critics accuse Starbird of claiming an historical marriage of Jesus and Magdalene, they are missing the point of her work--from her first book to the latest. She is trying to teach a concept, a symbolic idea, which lies at the heart of religious and spiritual imagery--the sacred marriage of opposites. Her point or thesis is that this marriage or union of opposites is a truth that transcends and inhabits material forms, affecting them.Starbird's message was obvious in _Woman With the Alabaster Jar_, and blatant in her most recent book, _Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile_. Both books offer the thesis of sacred marriage as a central principle of religion. If readers think she's trying to lodge an historical proof that Mary and Jesus were married, then they've missed the point."},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"OK. Before Dan Brown, there was Margaret Starbird. Brown used the MM story to move his plot. His belief in it was questionable.

I expected to read about the essences of the sacred feminine, but I was not expecting to be convinced. The discussions about Mary Magdalene after the crucifixion were speculative but not wildly so. The discussion about Sarah and other activities in southern France of that period were informative."},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"Don't pick this book up expecting a scholarly, factual account of the times of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ. What is here is interesting and it's clear that Starbird is well-versed in the New Testament and various Gnostic texts as well as in the mythical and artistic references to Mary Magdalene. She knows her Greek, she knows about the Egyptian mythology and the mystery religions of the ancient world and their similarities to some Christian rites. What she does in this book and in other works I've read is to piece it all together into a theory of how a possible marriage between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene could have fit into her theory of the \\"sacred feminine\\" and how much more kind the Church would have been to women if her vision of this marriage had prevailed instead of what actually happened. It's a beautiful idea but she's doing an awful lot of guessing and speculation to get there. Read it for what it, but don't take it as fact."},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"Riding the coattails of The Da Vinci Code, Starbird wrote yet another book on Mary Magdalene. This time, Starbird focuses on the legends of Mary Magdalene and how these legends must lead back to an ultimate truth. She looks at an ancient prayer rug, at Sarah the Egyptian, the Merovingian fish, and even Isis, to prove that Mary Magdalene was the bride of Jesus. While this book does contain new material, and while I agree with the idea that legends often come from a true story, I thought the book could have been more scholarly and better researched."},{"Title":"Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile","review":"I've read a few books by Margaret Starbird to see what evidence has been gathered to support some of the more far-fetched theories surrounding Mary Magdalene. I was disappointed to see that each outrageous claim that she made was poorly supported and neither proved nor implied anything factual. While I am a complete advocate of new interpretations of this biblical figure, I feel that Starbird is the leading cause of misinformation on this subject. I can not deny that the author provides an entertaining and thought-provoking read, but if you are a stickler for the truth and probability, you would be best to check out Karen king's the Gospel of Mary Magdalene before looking at this book."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"It was ok but the author (Joseph Campbell) of this book was from the 1960s and I do have the DVD by the same author on the same subject.. I enjoy reading about Myths and the possible connection with some of its concepts with our Major Religions.

The book then begs the question &#34;Are religions (specific ones ) and Myths more or less one and the same and does that trump peoples faith....a question perhaps that cannot be answered with certainty....so that is the eternal question for our struggling humanity- it occurs at some many levels and perhaps the answers are found or looked for in books and in the general intelligence of each person....but we slog on and read and try to understand. Also, in closing, my reading of the book was on my Kindle and the book was quite long and having a hard copy may be easier to read slowly and think along the way.

He described the period as a \\"new age\\" where \\"..we are...participating in one of the very greatest leaps of the human spirit to a knowledge not only of outside nature but also of our own deep inward mystery.\\"At the time he wrote these essays, Campbell was a professor on a campus, surrounded by young people whom he found hard to understand at times. For example, in his essay \\"The Moon Walk--the Outward Journey\\" he relates his own feelings of awe on viewing the Apollo moon landing and contrasts them with the reaction of a student who wrote \\"So What\\" on a photo of the moon landing posted on a campus bulletin board. In another essay \\"Schizophrenia--the Inward Journey\\" he contrasts the use of mind-altering drugs by shamans and psychotics (including the LSD induced version) as the difference between divers and non-swimmers in \\"the waters of the unviersal archetypes of mythology.\\"I find Campbell's essays are very relevant, 30 years later. The most obvious example is \\"Mythologies of War and Peace\\" which addresses the underlying belief systems of participants in the Mideast crises. Campbell says the cruel fact is that \\"killing is the precondition of all living whatsoever: life lives on life, eats life, and would not otherwise exist...it is the nations, tribes, and peoples bred to mythologies of war that have survived to communicate their life-supporting mythic lore to descendents.\\" He suggests that \\"we\\" in the West \\"have been bred to one of the most brutal war mythologies of all time.\\" He then goes on to cite Deuteronomy and Isaiah and follows with excerpts from the Koran such as Sura 2, verse 216..\\"Fighting is prescribed for you.\\"Campbell does not condemn myths nor does he say myths are not literally true. He suggests creation myths and myths about love and war and peace contain the essence of the truth. Myths are to humans what kangaroo pouches are to baby kangaroos, they provide a \\"womb with a view.\\" Being born simply isn't enough. We need myths to help us organize and guide our lives. However, our current myths arose in another era and were shaped by tribal mentalities that sustain the notion of GROUP differences. We need new myths for the journey of life."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"I read this book while on a cruise, and found myself spending a lot of time reading. Of all his works, this is the most down to earth. The others are too 'professorial' as if intended to impress, while this one simply lays it on the line. Psychology and mythology relate to each other very nicely, as Mr. Campbell realized when asked to share his concepts with those of a Psychologist. Jung was a favorite because of his concept of Universal Mind. Contrary to what might be thought, the book is not anti-religious, but it does explode particular Christian beliefs. Rather, it reveals the Universal meaning of 'life' which each community resolves in its own way, frequently as not, in similar ways. Boil away the variety of customs, etc.,and you have the essence of Joseph Campbell's work, and a better appreciation of man's universal mind."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Campbell selected and compiled a selection of a talks on mythology from a series of discussions that he delivered between 1958 and 1971. There is an academic quality about his style, but this will not be a barrier to most people who enjoying thinking and reflecting about what humans share in beliefs. The ancient mythic themes come alive as he weaves the observations of 20th Century everyday living with flashbacks of times ago. He storytells and teaches using 13 broad topics such as love, the beginnings of Humankind, War and Peace, schizophrenia, and the moon walk. Campbell's text reads as if he is in your home; quite possibly having a glass of wine; discussing love relationships in the theater of Life; balancing the ideas of such people as St. Paul, Shaw, Sarte, Persian poets, Buddha, and Lord Krishna. He is at his strongest in his chapters on journeys: inward and outward. A word of caution: Your mind's ear will be listening to a Master Teacher. If you liked Bill Moyer's interview with Campbell, you will appreciate Campbell's theme choices and style. His art of making sense of human potential and challenging its boundaries is a stimulating reflective exercise."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"I am glad that I finally got around to reading this collection of Campbell's lectures delivered between 1958 and 1971. Since they deal with eternal subject matter there is little chance of them being \\"dated.\\" The common theme running through them all is the deep power of myth on the inner, spiritual lives of human beings throughout the ages. This includes our own age, whether we personally want to admit or recognize it.The Lectures include:1) The Impact of Science on Myth (1961),2) The Emergence of Mankind (1966),3) The Importance of Rites (1964),4) The Separation of East and West (1961),5) The Confrontation of East and West in Religion (1970)6) The Inspiration of Oriental Art (1958),7) Zen (1969),8) The Mythology of Love (1967),9) Mythologies of War and Peace (1967),10) Schizophrenia- the Inward Journey (1970),11) The Moon Walk- The Outer Journey (1970),12) Envoy: No More Horizons (1971),The reader will recognize much of the subject matter from the later talks with Bill Moyers in the \\"Power of Myth\\" series. All in all there is enough material covered to make this an excellent introduction to myth, true spirituality, and depth psychology.One of the topics that stuck with me was the fundamental difference in the nature of religion in the East, the Near East, and the West. Traditional Eastern societies were seen as governed by one great cosmic law through which all members were seen to draw their purpose, their worth, their meaning. God was in all things and the divine spark was in all individuals. Union with the divine was possible to those that transcended their ego. In the Near-East human beings (including the King) were seen as the groveling \\"tenant-farmers\\" of God. Men were the slaves of the Gods and could only beg and sacrifice to obtain boons. Man was in no way a part of God- matter and spirit were artificially split (mythic dissociation.) Finally, there was the Greek model- mankind as the rivals and competitors of the Gods. The Greek had turned ego into God, laying the foundation for the total denial of the very existence of spirit. That is, except for the initiates of the Mysteries....There is a section of reference notes citing sources in the back of the book, as well as, a full index for quick reference."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"&quot;Myths to Live By&quot; is one of those books which makes me wish I did not have to assign a star rating. For while it is, as the title of this review suggests, a very eloquent and powerful exposition of the Myth that forms the bones of our Psyche, Campbell clearly has some predjudices that make some of his points difficult to see.First, however, I shall focus on the positve aspects of the work. Campbell begins his book with a story about the conflict between a myth (in this case the story of Adam and Eve) and the facts discovered by science. The little anecdote serves to present the key thesis of the book: that our old religious idea that myths are literally true is no longer servicable, and that we must now, in an age where the world is coming together in ways unprecendented, seek the pattern that underlies all myths and discover our oneness as a species. Campbell explains why myth and ritual are neccesary in concrete, psycholgical terms. If there are no myths, individuals will become alienated from their society, since myths contain affect images that speak to not the rational mind, but the psyche. His argument is essensially Jungian in tone. Through a comparitive look at the worlds &quot;major&quot; religions, he shows how all myths are variations on the theme of self discovery and rebirth as a person engaged with the Universe and society.All that is wonderful. What is not wonderful, however, is the vaugley reactionary tone underlying some of the books passages. Campbell seems to share the imperialist view that all of human history naturally culminates in modern, technological, Western Civilization. He dismisses the youth movement of the time he wrote this book (the sixties to early seventies) as folly. The cultural contribution of &quot;Beat&quot; poets such as Ginsberg an Kerouak is completley ignored. In fact, the &quot;Beats&quot; are never even mentioned when Campbell throws out an all encompassing statement like &quot;we have no artists...of such power today&quot;.Equally troubling is the statement that &quot;all life is suffering, all societies are opressive, and we just have to learn to live with it&quot;. Now, while it may be true that life is sorrowful and that social orders have, throughout history, tended to be unjust, it does not follow that we have to accept the latter fact with the same passivity as the former. As Campbell points out, we make the choices that determine the direction of our society. If everyone, or a strong majority at least, were able to come to the understanding of universal Myth and Divinity, the opression that exists today would decrease, if not dissapear. The book comes to a climax with an expose of the mythic dimensions of the first moon walk. The chapter illustrates how we are indeed one planet and one species. Juxtoposed with &quot;all societies are opressive, and we just have to live with it&quot; however, the chapter's beauty becomes terror. In this light, the chapter is a prophecy of slavery, not oneness.Still, this is a very important book, marred as all great works are by the author's prejudices. When reading this book, remember Buddha's finger pointing at the moon, and which one was more important."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"What is a mythology? What role does it play in modern society? Does it have any positive effects in our culture? Campbell's book explores these questions, by giving a clear account of the different mythologies around the world and throughout the ages. This comparative study of our ancestral and modern beliefs and views of the universe not only enlighten us as to how our forefathers confronted reality but it, as well, teaches us how we can deal with the world of experience around us.To state it bluntly: our adventures in the world teach us about ourselves, just as going into ourselves we learn about the world. By going into one you simultaneously explore the other.Please enjoy this delightful book as it will engage you in a journey of over 10,000 years and the voyage of inner discovery."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Joseph Campbell was among the sharpest of human minds in the 20th century, and his unique style and wisdom can be found throughout this magnificent book. In Myths to Live By, he concentrates on the myths of various global traditions which apply to our day to day life. The stories set forth in myth truly encapsulate the human experience; the way we both see the world as well as respond to it are all there in these ancient stories. Campbell explores Christianity, Buddhism, Sufism, and Zoroastrianism - all within the contents of this deceivingly thin book. This is a must have for any Joe Campbell fan, as well as anyone looking to unearth the rich meaning of this thing we call life. Get pleasure from this book, and have fun on your mythic journey!"},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"This book is based on a series of lectures, and as such, has more of a direct, conversational tone than the author's more academic works, which though no less forceful, contain numerous allusions to artwork, artifacts, and other specifics that make it harder to follow. It helps to have familiarity with these prior works - like the MASKS OF GOD - or prior experience with the study of myth. Such background gives the reader a depth of perspective that would make the concepts more difficult to grasp otherwise; and gives the vantage point of a summary or review.From my point of view, a special appeal of the book concerns comparing and contrasting the mythology of East and West. The author notes how mythical elements such the serpent, the tree, and the garden of immortality have a common, deeply rooted past. In the Biblical myth of the Garden of Eden, the serpent is the enticer, the one who leads Adam and Eve astray with the knowledge of good and evil from the tree, the cause of all the trouble. In the Buddhist myth, on the other hand, rather than being cursed, the serpent is accepted as being the protector of the Buddha; and the tree of immortality is not out of reach in the same way that it is in the Bible. Rather than being banished from the Garden or Paradise because of disobedience, what is keeping mankind alienated from the original source is ignorance, a mistaken attachment to the impermanent.Also, reaching into the past, the author notes that the first ever cities were based on a astronomical order that was applied by priests, who wielded a special religious authority, to all of social life. The East, he maintains, has never really strayed very far from holding onto the necessity of a cosmically based order. Everyone has a pre-ordained role to fill, and it is folly for anyone to step out of his or her role. The West, on the other hand, although it has had long spells of religious suppression, has valued the individual as being worthy of development and expression. This humanism can certainly be seen in the Greeks in their laying a foundation for modern science; and finds it's most extreme expression in the myth of Prometheus. It can also be seen in the Tristan and Isolt myth, and the remarkable daring which the poet Gottfried expressed in \\"challenging hell\\", in defying the imposed religious order of the Middle Ages.A chapter of special interest, especially in the unfolding of world events, is the \\"Mythologies of War and Peace\\". As revealed in myths of primitive planting and hunting cultures, humankind does not extend itself in this world in any appreciable way without killing. One would think that planting cultures would be the most life-revering, but throughout the tropics and in the ancient world, the most horrific sacrifices have been made in the interest of extending fertility. Even kings have been sacrificed. A comparison is made between the war mythology of the Greeks and Hebrews, who were roughly contemporaries. The Hebrews had no consideration for their opponents, thinking that their way was the only sanctified way and even worth slaughtering for (the author quotes passages from Deuteronomy and Joshua). Zoroastrianism, a cosmic conception of the forces of light against the forces of darkness, became the basis for the Jewish and Christian apocalyptic traditions, providing further justification for fighting and killing an enemy. With Jesus Christ, however, there is a clear break with the traditions of war and the drive to eradicate the evils of an enemy. \\"Love thine enemy as thyself\\" represents a very different approach from much of history. The author compares Jesus with Buddha and the ascetic tradition of the East.Picking out some of the salient myths gives me a sense of how much depth and breadth is involved here. In this attempt not to over-generalize, I have barely scratched the surface."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"This book is a series of Lectures given by Professor Campbell.Campbell's writing style is very accessible to scholars and non scholars alike tho. For anyone interested in not only research and theory on world mythology, but also human pyschology and any kind of insight into the human condition should read this book.Although there is no clear thesis stated in the beginning the lectures/chapters have a very nice and logical flow to them. To conclude I can't say this book changed my life, but it made me think and as his writing/lectures progressed it became obvious he had clear objective in mind which he met an a concise and clear manner. An interesting read."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"This book reads like an essential afterword to the great video series. The chapters on mythologies of love, and of war and peace are especially effective. Campbell's teaching is direct, and honed to a useful, beautiful glow. He's a courageous thinker, able to order considerable insights with impeccable ease. Leaves us the richer. He's hailed for the scope of his vision, yet it's the inevitable intimacy of Campbell's teaching genius that makes his books so effective. Read this book and find a realm vaster and more intimate than one that brung ya! --that's effective spiritual reading, the fruit of clearly intense scholarship, and Campbell makes it immediate and consoling. Delivers what it promises. It's difficult to be disappointed by stuff this fine."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Came in on time and was as just like it was detailed in it review. And dont forget to get a dictionary the books wording is out of this world."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"....by any means, though Campbell's erudition and clarity are always interesting and impressive.To the well-stated critics of other reviewers I would add that Campbell's view of war as instinctive (a very Freudian notion, of course) does not prove helpful or illuminate the social conditions that create class and power imbalances characteristic of warlike cultures. He is correct, however, that the American Eagle is an appropriate symbol for our nation: not for the reason he states (arrows in one talon and olive branch in the other), but because the eagle ours resembles, the Imperial Eagle of Rome, flapped its wings over another militarized and hubris-infected empire bent on political and economic domination (nowadays called &quot;global leadership&quot;).Books like THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES and THE POWER OF MYTH provide less biased introductions to Campbell's thought...and in fairness to him, he did grow beyond some of those biases, as is evident in video interviews conducted in his later years."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Not sure if it is just this kindle edition but I was really looking forward to this but found it to be disappointing.Makes an interesting topic rather boring."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"The problem here is not with Campbell's writing but with the place from which his writing originates. It is a 1960's academia entrenched in a Western cannon, believing itself capable of interpreting the cultural relevance of myth to non-Western peoples through the same lens it uses to critique western, and specifically Biblical, myth. Repeated references to &quot;primitive cultures,&quot; a complete dismissal of African myth tradition, and a clear implication of a Western superiority make the insightful commentary on myth a challenge to isolate.If you are really interested in comparative study of myth, look at some original texts and avoid internalizing Campbell's bias; Campbell schematically interprets the Indian Vedas, Zen texts, Navajo stories, Norse mythology, the Bible, and works by Dante, Jung and Freud.A discussion on the mythical implications of &quot;last year's&quot; moonwalk, or the Kennedy assassination, for instance, don't help much."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Best book ever. I bought several copies to give to friends and family.The chapter on schizophrenia makes more sense than any thing I've ever read.Primitive mythology is harder to read, but more informative.Joseph Campbell is a national treasure."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Joseph Campbell was obviously a special person with a deep and profound interest in mythology, and reading this small sampling of his speeches and papers was a treat. I wasn't expecting to find myself so interested in what he had to say regarding the world's various myths, but Mr. Campbell's insights into human nature and religion compelled me to crack a smile numerous times as I was reading this book. Revelations abound in these pages, but be warned: if you are a fundamentalist adherent to one of the Abrahamic religions, you probably won't enjoy it nearly as much as someone with an open mind will. Campbell makes the case that religions and mythologies are merely reflections of the hidden human psyche, and he makes his case well. Anyone interested in theology (from an academic standpoint) would be doing themselves a disservice by not reading what Campbell had to say about mythology and it's role in society."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Joseph Campbell is among the great spiritual thinkers of the 20th/21st centuries. His prolific writings draw their inspiration from the myths of the world. In &#34;Campbellian &#34; terms the world myths ( imagination expessing ultimate truths via metaphor) tie all humanity together. Through Campbell's works I have come to appreciate the truth that humanity shares a common spirituality expressed in different religious traditions. He is brilliant in his his vast appreciation of global cultures and how these culures deal with what Campbell calls the &#34;Great Secret;&#34; otherwise called our collective concern with our mortality. Joseph Campbell is a teacher par excellence. Through him I have grown in my own religious tradition which, in itself, is rich with legend and myth recounted in its stories that deal with ultimate truth.Highly recommended along with Richard Rohr who is also a gifted teacher of spirituality."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"I must admit...I only starting reading this book because Scott Stapp from Creed said he was reading this book and they are my favorite band, but when I starting reading it I couldn't stop. When you start to read the book you will quickly understand how it reflects in our everday lives. It is a collecection of powerful lectures that makes you continue and want to keep reading.I will recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Without a doubt Joe's best book. I have given it as a gift to several friends. Some are ready for the message and get it, but truthfully, some do not. But if you can get the message, it will liberate your faith, raise your thoughts to a new, better level and help you let go of your old way of thinking about all religions.I have read six of Joe's books. The Masks of God series will give much more detail. The Hero With a Thousand Faces concentrates on the classic hero journey. This book is a combination of all of them. The essays are transcripts of lectures and are very easy to read. His stories are funny, timely and, like dreams, \\"they shine of themselves\\". Joseph Campbell will change your life.

Campbell's exhaustive study of our myths reveals how they tie us together."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"I was lucky enough to meet Joseph Campbell in the 1980s when he lectured at Salve Regina in Newport, Rhode Island. Campbell, America's premier mythologist, spoke for just under an hour and just that short amount of time, he had me hooked. In the years that followed, I read many of his works and found that his writings have gradually shaped my own thoughts and greatly influenced my own career as a history teacher. He has opened my eyes to many of our common experiences as human beings and now I find that when I look at people and their cultures, I see more commonalities and fewer differences. Meaning no disrespect to those immersed in diversity, I prefer to see things that people have in common. Campbell did that.Myths to Live By is a great introduction to the works of a great writer. Read them, think about them, React to them. It's time well spent by anyone."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Most were likeable. The best item I've received was the Kindle 3G which was not a part of these 10 items."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"I know that Joseph Campbell speaks against adopting a guru in this book. But he is as close to a personal guru as I have found (aside from some others, like Carl Jung, Thomas Berry). That sounds cheesy. But in fact, it is very profound for me. He is one of those rare people who is so wise in his understanding of life that you can trust him and truly listen to what he has to say. And he writes clearly, which is not always the case for strongly intuitive types. He brings you closer to what really matters in life, his writing makes you feel more alive."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Joseph Campbell may have died a while ago, but he truly lives on through his books and writings. There truly is no one more special."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Myths to Live By is, I believe, Joseph Campbell's finest single volume book for the lay public. Dr. Campbell's comparative study of mythologies/religions/cultures both of the east and west is revealing, instructive, compelling and ultimately devastating. Devastating because (almost forty years ago) I discovered in this little book the intellectual catapult I needed to liberate myself and forever abandon the trappings of Judeo/Christian/Islamic 'baggage' for the greener shores of Buddhism and zen. For me this book was pivotal as it clearly pointed me towards the works of D.T. Suzuki and subsequently to those of Paul Reps, Nyogen Senzaki, Nakagawa Soen, Thomas Cleary and R.H. Blyth. I am deeply grateful to all (deep gassho). Is it possible to reach enlightenment by reading the works of others? I have pointed you in the direction of these Buddhas. Now you add your forty years and let's see..."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"How should myths be used in our personal lives? Are they important? What Campbell did for this book was to take a bunch of lectures he had given in the 60s and early 70s and collect them for this book. Therefore, to my mind, they seemed a bit disjointed. Some chapters were much more interesting and relevant than others (heck, some of them I didn't really feel even related to the theme of the book). But overall, there were a lot of good ideas and thoughts in this book, especially the chapter on schizophrenia."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"This book, like other Campbell works really speaks to your soul to help you grasp the nature of our times. As one reviewer said, if you read it at the right time of your life, it can completely change you.I highly reccomend this or any Campbell work."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"If you feel you are not fullfilling your souls quest and this book catches you at the right moment, it can change you life"},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"This anthology is a collection of lectures given by Campbell at Cooper Union from 1958 to 1971, and covers such topics as love, war and peace, zen, schizophrenia, and the differences between East and West. Anyone already familiar with Campbell's work won't find anything new here, but newbies may find this a good place to get started. Some of Campbell's books can be intimidating, but in his public lectures, Campbell was able to reduce even the most complex issues for general consumption. Hopefully this will encourage them to pursue his work in greater degree. So, definitely a book for a newbie interested in Campbell or mythology in general, but not particularly helpful for people already acquainted with his work."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Opening a book by Joseph Campbell is like emerging from a cave and seeing the world for the first time. It is not a light read, but it is well worth the effort. Have you ever wondered why the tale of Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty resonates as deeply with your daughter as it did to children four centuries ago, or why Beowulf, The Illiad, and The Odessey, stories so old that they cannot be traced to their source, are reinterpreted generation after generation?Campbell's idea is simple. The stories that we love and that we tell are what define us. We must all, for example, come to terms with the fact that we kill plants and animals in order to live. We must all explain what lies beyond death, and why we have been given the gift of life. We need to know what is worth living for and what is worth dying for.This book is not for the devoutly religious. Campbell uses religion and myth as synonyms and gives equal credence to Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, and plains Indian religious beliefs. The truth here was not written by an angry God on large stone tablets; it is found in the stories that we tell ourselves and our children.Campbell examines the way people around the world have dealt with these questions and what happens when the myths we live by are swept away and replaced by nothing.In many ways, this book is like a rich cheesecake. It cannot be consumed all at once. It needs to be savored a little at a time, and digested before moving on."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"This is my favorite of Joseph Campbell's books, and I liked most of them. I found it quite readable, but my wife thought his writing style was too academic and dry. I recommend reading a sample before you buy to see if you like it. It was written as a series of lectures before it became a book. Myths from many cultures are represented here along with a discussion of why a mythology for modern times could make life more meaningful, less scary."},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","review":"Great book to read if you are a fan of philosophy, myths, and psychology.

Myth stories in and of themselves are rather confusing, strange, and often boring. But Campbell has a way of bringing them to life and making them seem relevant and important. He has shown us what myths are for; it is up to us to choose to stop seeing myths as accounts of literal, historical events and see them for the symbolism they are."},{"Title":"Feathers in the Fire","review":"Feathers in the Fire plays on the primative human fear of the humanoid monster, depicted by the evil Amos.Amos becomes evil and twisted because of his childhood--his father's refusal to recognize him and the fact that he was almost put to death just after birth. This mirrors Janie Gibson's birth circumstances in The Maltese Angel, but Janie gets to have a happy future, not the tragic, if well-deserved ending of Amos.A gritty, great read."},{"Title":"Feathers in the Fire","review":"Tho forty years old, this novel still has the capacity to wow. Cookson really outdid herself with this one. Not only is there the usual Cookson scandals, love triangles, and \\"upstart\\" stories, but this novel also explores what can happen if a handicap is not handled properly, with love, patience, and care. It can destroy a family as well as the emotional well being of the one with the handicap. Cookson, with an Alfred Hitchcock style, introduces us to a family in 1880s England that is having some typical marital strife associated with the day. In the middle of all this family tension, a child is born and he has no legs. This child, Amos, spends the first 5 years of his life locked in an attic room. He is called \\"it\\" by his mother and father, who have nothing to do with him at all. His sister, Jane mothers him and dotes on him and provides him with education and as much outside companionship as she dares. Despite Jane's efforts, Amos grows up with some major emotional scarring that we see throughout his childhood and into his adult years. Amos becomes filled with rage and as a teenager commits his first appalling crime. Can we really blame him tho?It is later on in the book that readers may finally lose sympathy for Amos as his crimes become of a deeper nature, hurting all those on the farm whether they love or hate him. His character becomes most sinister. Meanwhile, throughout the novel, Davie, a farmhand who left to be a seaman, comes back and is torn between Jane and another woman named Molly. Molly had hurt Davie long ago, causing him to leave the farm in the first place. Can he ever forgive her? Will Miss Jane ever find happiness and escape the emotional chains Amos has wrought on her? How is Amos going to handle her leaving?The last quarter of the book was like a drumroll leading to a most shocking, climatic ending. One of Cookson's finest."},{"Title":"Feathers in the Fire","review":"I read this book in only a few days. I could not put it down. The characters of Davie, Molly, Jane, and especially Amos were written so vividly that I could imagine them in my mind as I was reading.

I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Feathers in the Fire","review":"A wonderful tale of love. Catherine Cookson brings the era to life.Her knack for bringing the language of that era, takes the reader into the heart of the story."},{"Title":"GHOSTS FROM THE COAST","review":"One of the reviewers on here said that this book had a few inaccuracies. I can't comment on that because I have no idea. The one thing I do have an idea about is that like so many other which claim to be about ghosts, this is a travel guide.Unlike a ghost book where it says \\"this happened and this happened\\", the book will give you 5+ pages of the history of a tavern, inn, hotel, or whatever and then the last paragraph will give you a brief overview of the ghostly happenings such as \\"To this day, every now and then a glass moves or an apparition is seen\\" or if you get specific it would be \\"To this day Ms. blah blah is still seen at odd times of the night\\"....this one paragraph after 5 pages of travel guide information on the history of the tavern.Like Haunted New Jersey, which I just rated on Amazon with the same problem, I bought a history book rather than a ghost book, though looking at other reviews it fails to even be a history book with its inaccuracies...I don't know.I am not trying to be rude to the author who does have a great style of writing. I am just tired of buying alleged ghost books only to have them be history books of people begatting other people and talking about slaves and whatnot. This should be a book on ghosts, not people 200 years ago. If you are going to write a ghost book, give a few sentences about the history of the place and a few pages of the ghosts, not visa versa!John McAdam, author of:Enoch and the Extraterrestrials"},{"Title":"GHOSTS FROM THE COAST","review":"Nancy Roberts is a good storyteller, but where 'Ghosts from the Coast' runs into trouble is with the history of the area. The story about Moon River Brewing Company ('Mystery at Moon River') is a typical example. She states that pirates walked the streets of Savannah, a statement which is more myth than fact anyway, but she goes on to claim that Edward Teach, Calico Jack Rackham, and Captain Charles Vane were once in Savannah. Well, Edward Teach (also called Blackbeard) died in 1718, and Savannah wasn't founded until 1733. Rackham was hanged in 1720, the same year Vane died. So the history of the area does not support her story.In another instance, she talks of slaves at the Olde Harbor Inn (also in Savannah). But the structure was built in 1892, and slavery had ended with the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865. The construction with beams on River Street also wasn't built out of salvaged wood from sailing vessels, at least not in that time period, which is another claim in the book. The seaport was established enough by 1892 for enormous heart pine beams & rafters to make up the majority of building materials, and they are obviously milled expressly for that purpose.Nancy Roberts is not a historian, but then again she doesn't claim to be one, either. She is a very good storyteller, with a whole host of books to her credit. But the historical innaccuracies will bother those readers out there with a grasp of history and a craving for a correctly-told story set in a specific time period."},{"Title":"GHOSTS FROM THE COAST","review":"I have been a fan of Nancy Roberts for quite a few years. This latest book of hers is a great addition to her body of work. Covering ghosts in three states (coasts) North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, Nancy Roberts is her spine tingling best. Whether mean ole pirate ghosts haunting a tavern in Savannah, or a tragic lover endlessly driving his coach on the annivesary of his death, the collection of stories is truly varied. You'll want to read this book with others around you."},{"Title":"Danny","review":"Sturgis - one smells a pseudonym here - seems far more interested in creating a polemic for &quot;free speech&quot; and &quot;teen autonomy&quot; than a novel. Ostensibly this is the story of a high school English teacher's affair with his most gifted student, Danny, a poet of unusual promise (the sample verses don't back up the claim), and the efforts they make to conceal their love. Things unravel, of course, thanks to Danny's candid journal, and the teacher is thrown out of his job and basically run out of town. Taking precedence over this love story, however, is the idea of McCarthyism in the schools, with irate parents wanting to ban works of literature on the grounds they are obscene. Sturgis takes the point too far, as though parents should have NO say in what their children read and study; he/she buys into the mindset that children are smarter than adults. It is a dangerous and erroneous notion and, unfortunately, hurts any sympathy this reader might have had for the main characters. The teacher is such a pious, self-righteous sort, he left me cold. I would have rather Sturgis concentrate on the love story. I must say, though, the last thirty pages or so are genuinely suspenseful and kept me hooked to the end, when my sympathies by then were exhausted. The book is competently written but nothing remarkable."},{"Title":"Danny","review":"This book is not an easy one to get through. It raises a lot of questions and also raises a lot of warning flags. Set against the background of a censorship battle and the efforts of right-wing fundamentalists to intrude into the minds of school aged children, a romantic attachment develops between a teacher and a student. The fact that the student, Danny, is almost at the age of consent does little to stave off the stereotype that could be drawn. The teacher, Tom York, shows us how not to respond to a student's advances. The actions of Tom and Danny give the censors the ammunition they need to become a permanent fixture in the educational system. Still, the story is not one to be dismissed. At issue are an educator's responsibilities, the needs of young people, ethical behavior, and the age of consent."},{"Title":"Practical Feng Shui for the Home","review":"As of now, Amazon hasn't got it yet.

It has completed my collection of Process books!I almost gave up on getting this important book-THANK YOU, AMAZON!"},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"This book will be remembered not only for its eloquence and poetry, for its accuracy and precision, but also for the silence with which it was received in 1997. Along with Joni Seager's &quot;Earth Follies&quot; and Terry Tempest Williams' &quot;Refuge&quot;, &quot;Living Downstream&quot; paints a picture of our behavior toward our planet as nothing less than genocidal. For those who believe Rachel Carson was right, this book is a must-read update and a reminder that faith is not enough. We must live as if we believe the consequences of toxic pollution to be predictable and avoidable."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"It is rare to find a book on a scientific subject that is both accurate and precise in its science and beautifully written. It is no surprise to find that Sandra Steingraber, author of such a book, is both a Ph.D. biologist and a published poet.&quot;Living Downstream&quot; is a superb blend of rigorous analysis and poignant memoir. Steingraber documents the increasing evidence of a strong link between rising cancer rates and environmental contamination. At the same time she tells her own story--that of a woman who suffered and survived cancer while only in her 20's. This book has justly been compared to Rachel Carson's &quot;Silent Spring&quot; and may, if read widely enough, have the same worldwide impact that Carson's book had forty years ago."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"This book is chock-full of important scientific information about the connections between cancer and the environment, yet it is very easy to read. I couldn't put it down. You will be shocked by the evidence she puts forth. All her information is well-documented."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"With her heart and science Ms. Steingraber gives us the history of how products (including agricultural ones) made of natural chemicals increasingly have been remade with synthetic chemicals since the last two world wars. Restrictions on newly created dangerous chemicals were not considered for fear of causing another post war depression after 1945. Some of the synthetic chemicals find their ways into our cells by being similar enough to natural hormones, yet alien enough, that our bodies' defense mechanisms are fooled, sometimes becoming cannibalized to turn malignatly against us.She gracefully does not point the finger at individuals, and usually not at specific companies, but gives us a scientifically based (with nearly 300 references) ecological picture of what's going on to needlessly make some people sick and die. There are approxamately 7,500 synthetic chemicals in use. Only a small fraction of them have been tested for health risks. Usually these risks are calculated only after exceedingly high percentages of us die.Some chemicals like Benzene (an additive to gasoline) despite being known carcinogens, are still allowed to be used. Instead of using us as guinea pigs, Steingraber explains, the &quot;precautionary principle&quot; should be adopted. This means new chemicals should be tested for what harm they may cause. They should not be used when they are indicated to be harmful. Absolute proof, usually a body count is not necessary. &quot;Reverse onus,&quot; is a similar principle, meaning chemicals should be demonstrated to be safe. For dangerous chemicals that seem indispensable, &quot;least toxic alternatives&quot; should be developed. For example, there are already alternatives to using chlorine for eliminating pathogens in our drinking water. Chlorine does not have to be used.Ms. Steingraber grew up fast after innocently HAVING BEEN GIVEN CANCER at a young age. Perhaps that's why she cherishes children, who are more susceptible to carcinogens than adults. Our Govt. only sets standards for carcinogens based on adults' more sluggish metabolisms -- that is, when &quot;economics&quot; doesn't overide human health. Also, fetuses and young children should not be blamed for their unhealthy lifestyles when they succumb to nasty chemically induced afflictions.Walking along the toxic yet beautiful Illinois River with her sister's children, Ms Steingraber points out the absurdity of the EPA writing reports about keeping children away from that river. Rivers are like The Wind in the Willows to children, even when the wind is poisened, and willows, most ducks or talking toads don't live there anymore. Instead of letting us continue to ignore these problems she offers this advice, &quot;Maybe we adults need only demonstrate an attitude of passionate attention about where we live.&quot;"},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"As a scientist, I must say that this book is extraordinary. You'll realize from this well researched and analyzed text that given the trends in environmental contamination, we are all highly vulnerable to toxicity related cancer. What is more terrifying is that there is not a responsible/objective/non-political entity that has enough power to change this trend near-term (10-15 yrs). After having read the book, I feel obligated to do something (its my nature). In hindsight, I wish that I had never read the book - ignorance may be bliss."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"Here is a great book I think we all should read. Steingraber's thesis is relatively simple: environmental factors play a much larger role in the increase of cancer than hitherto assumed by individuals, public health officials, and regulators, and we should act accordingly. Her argument is well-researched and takes into account many of the pollutants we find in our air, water, earth, and bodies, and is presented intermittently as narrative and analysis.I like the structure of the book, the organization into chapters titled &quot;time,&quot; &quot;space,&quot; &quot;war,&quot; and the like. I also like her alternating personal narrative (she is a bladder-cancer survivor, a native of Illinois, a graduate student, a researcher--we find out lots of things) with the cold hard facts and sometimes the fuzzy facts of cancer research and regulation of chemicals. The only thing that holds me back, which is why I gave it four stars, is that the book is a bit too long for my taste at almost 400 pages--I, a layperson, could have done with a bit less detail (though I understand she's covering her bases) and a bit more politics (though I understand she's being careful, not naming too many names).The best chapter is the final one: if you come across this book and have other things to do, at least read the last chapter--most convincing is her deconstruction of the public policy of 'personal responsibility': sure, some cancers may be associated with personal lifestyle, but more important are the things we have little individual control over, such as the air we breathe, the land our kids play on, the streams we swim in. Blame, Steingraber implies/states (she's not always so outspoken), lies less with us citizens, taxpayers, cancer patients, than with the companies that manufacture products and byproducts that may be carcinegous and are simply allowed to do so until proven otherwise, and the regulators (our government, at all levels) who let them do so. Bravo--it needed to be said, and I'm glad Steingraber did it."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"Then you need this book.For me the most shocking thing about Living Downstream is how little known it is, given the life or death issues it addresses. I had never heard of it until I attended a lecture in support of the author's new book, Having Faith: An Ecologist's Journey to Motherhood.What Living Downstream does is explore the connections between the toxic chemicals found everywhere in our environment, and various cancers and other diseases.Examined are various mediums of transmission: earth, air, water, fire; chemicals from vinyl chloride, to pesticides and insecticides, to PCBs--even dry cleaning fluid (PCE); and scientific evidence of their connections to cancers, immune deficiencies and reproductive problems.Pulling all this research together is in itself a tremendous service. Science so often involves narrow fields of research with little communication between fields.Still, though it's hardly a \\"light read,\\" it is nothing like those dry science textbooks you remember.The author is also a poet, and she uses metaphor and imagery to explain in easy terms anything unfamiliar to the non-scientist. This makes the book intelligent-user friendly and even, at times, beautiful. The personal narrative keeps it human.However, I won't lie and say it is a \\"fun read.\\" The truth is, I found it educational and even life-changing, but also deeply unsettling and even frightening.No longer can I dismiss cancer as genetic, or easily warded off through diet and lifestyle, or see environmental cancers as the problem of those poor souls unfortunate enough to live near some toxic waste dump.The book gave me knowledge, and yes, it's true: knowledge IS power. It gave me the motivation to buy organic, to use filtered (NOT bottled) water, to take a very serious look at any chemical I use around my home.It also helped me understand why this is not the whole answer, that the real answer lies in taking serious steps to address the poisoning of our environment. The first and most important step, however, is awareness, which is why you should read this book."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"The author is an articulate ecological biologist who is herself a cancer survivor. My eyes were tempted to gloss over the pages and pages of statistics (they were hard to face up to), but I resisted the urge and instead forced myself to digest the haunting truth standing behind each of the seemingly endless reports and case-studies representing scores of individuals who traversed the cancer ordeal before I did. I thought of the author, poring over her keyboard, obsessed with what seemed to be a morose subject matter, but I became relentlessly engrossed in the gravity of her cause. In her book, she highlights environmental and industrial travesties, and she argues that, as a species, we are vastly contributing to our own high rates of cancer incidence."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"Because of the immense importance of the subject matter- chemical contamination of our environment, this book was written for a general audience and Ms Steingraber's writing style flows with easy to understand, but alarming expose' of the hazards of chemicals in our environment.It is a beautiful continuation of Rachel Carson's work of environmental responsibility and the examination of the dangers of chemical contamination of our shared world.Ms Carson's famous book, \\"Silent Spring\\", published in 1962, opened up to the public the hideous side-effects of chemicals, i.e., cancer causing, biome pollution and disruption, and killing of non-targeted species. Remember the Brown Pelican and Bald Eagle almost being killed-off from DDT poisoning? Carson's work eventually led to the banning of that harmful chemical, but as Ms Steingraber so expertly points out, there is a plethora of other dangerous chemicals on the market that tests have shown should not be.Sandra Steingraber wrote her book over 35 years after \\"Silent Spring\\" and having the benefit of a huge amount of accumulated evidence of chemical side-effects and personal experience with the serious health problems caused by chemical contamination of our environment, she has put together a powerful indictment of the irresponsibility of industry and government alike in their continuing agenda of down-playing the dangers of chemicals and this constitutes one of the most irresponsible and insidious snake-oil scams ever perpetrated against life.Huge corporate profits from the sale of deadly, often-time untested or inadequately tested chemicals purchase lackadaisical government over-sight and slick advertising on the \\"benefits\\" of chemicals.This book is well researched and concise, yet will give simple explanations of such topics as \\"biomagnification\\"- the accumulation of chemicals the higher up the food chain we go. Most importantly, is the topic of \\"risk as recklessness\\" in taking dangerous chemicals to market without proper safety testing, but especially allowing known carcinogens to remain on the market long after they have proven to be harmful, hence, government complicity.And the governments stand on this? They publish guidelines for changing one's \\"lifestyle\\" to help reduce chemical exposure! In other words, they attempt to shift responsibility for health on to the public who has no control over or proper warnings of where these chemicals are and most ludicrous of this is the fact that the spread of chemicals cannot be controlled once released into the environment, so they're everywhere and unavoidable. A good summation of this irresponsible nonsense is quoted from the anthropologist, Martha Balshem: [In the end, Balshem came to believe the lesson she was transmitting-\\"accept authority and accept blame\\"-was the wrong one]. (p 262) Indeed!The Epilog starting on page 285 is a good resource guide for finding out more about chemicals, government agencies \\"responsible\\" for monitoring their use, where chemicals are concentrated, educational materials, etc.Sandra Steingraber has put together a beautiful, important and educational statement in this book and it is one of the most profound publications of it's type since \\"Silent Spring\\". I found it to be a great honor to Rachel Carson's legacy- thank you Ms Steingraber!"},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"This is a powerful and moving account that dissects, piece by piece, the system which allows cancer-causing chemical agents to be released within the United States, primarily by corporations.Cancer survivor Sandra Steingraber is a poet at heart, and a scientist by trade. For me, the weakest parts of the book were the ones in which the poet takes over, speaking in deeply personal dramatic tones that, quite frankly, made me a little uncomfortable.Much more interesting is the scathing indictment of the processes by which chemicals are regulated in the United States. With impeccable logic, Steingraber frightens the bejeezus out of us by demonstrating that, when it comes to protecting the environment and public health, no one is driving the bus.The vast majority of chemicals released into the environment have not been held up to proper scrutiny. For chemicals that are suspected of causing cancer or other problems, there is an almost impossibly high burden of proof put on those who seek to have the chemicals banned.Steingraber builds the case, simultaneously removing all doubt that certain chemicals are responsible for cancer outbreaks in certain areas while showing us that the case cannot be proved to the satisfaction of the regulatory agencies (who are themselves heavily influenced by the offending companies).A detective story, an expose, and a lyrical narrative all in one, Steingraber has given concrete form to the sometimes-vague notion that Corporate America is behind many of our country's biggest threats."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"I think the book was good and thorough, but I wish the author had put in more drama. Will her friend live? What about a court battle? What can be done, seriously, about the problem of living in a toxic environment? Addressing these concerns in dramatic fashion would have made the book better. Still, it was a good book. I wonder why the traditional medical community refuses to go after the chemical industry the way they've gone after the tobacco industry?"},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"I am not a scientist, nor a rocket scientist for that matter, yet I found Ms. Steingraber's book fascinating. It has given me the realization of the relationship between chemicals in our environment and cancer. I had tears, anger and frustration upon learning this information. However, I now have the knowledge, determination and ammunition to do something thanks to Ms. Steingraber. This is a must read!!"},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"The cancer business is booming. All types of cancers rose 49.3% between 1950 and 1991. In 1950 an American woman faced a 1 in 20 lifetime risk of breast cancer; today that risk has more than doubled to 1in 8. The incidence of cancer in 1982 was 90 out of 100,000 people. In 1990 it was 112 out of 100,000. There is a 26% increase in brain cancer in children and testicular cancer in teenage boys has doubled. Bladder cancer increased by 10% between 1973 and 1991. According to Sandra Steingraber the author of \\"Living Downstream\\" there are reasons why the nations leading cancer organizations make no mention of cancer prevention. There are reasons why they won't talk about the connection between pollution and cancer.Steingraber uses her own story as an example. \\"Cancer runs in my family,\\" she says. \\"I have an aunt who died of the same kind of bladder cancer I had, my mother had metastatic breast cancer, I have many uncles who had colon cancer.\\" She pauses. \\"But I'm adopted. So cancer runs in my family, it doesn't run in my genes. That leads us to ask, what else do families have in common? We drink the same water, we breathe the same air, we have the same dietary habits, we often work in the same places.\\" She states that only 10% of cancers involve inherited mutations and that studies see more correlates with adoptive families not biological ones.Steingraber says blaming the cause of cancer on our genetics, life style and behavior rather than the exposure to disease causing agents obscures cancer's many environmental roots.Steingraber's research supports the connection between pollution and cancer:In 1996 scientists isolated the carcinogenic agent in tobacco smoke that causes cancer.In 1978, when the Israeli government banned pesticides-benzene hexachloride, DDT and lindane, breast cancer rates dropped by nearly 8% in all age groups by 1986.Industrial countries have disproportionately more cancers than countries with little or no industry.Families exposed to a dioxin suffused cloud from a pesticide manufacturing plant in Seveso, Italy in July 1976 have three times the rates of liver cancer and increased incidence of leukemia, multiple myeloma and soft tissue sarcoma.In Finland there was an increase in non-Hodgkins lymphoma where the waterways were contaminated by chlorphenols from local sawmills.Urban lung cancer rates are two to three times higher than the surrounding countryside.People in cities with chemical plants, pulp and paper mills and petroleum industries show elevated rates of lung cancer.People living near hazardous-waste sites have an increased risk of cancer.Women employed in the chemical and plastic industry have higher rates of breast cancer.Bladder cancer increased by 10% between 1973-1991 for workers in pharmaceutical plants and in the dye industry. Workers in the dry clean business have two times the rate of esophageal and bladder cancer.Why has The World Health Organization recently attributed 80% of cancer to environmental influence?Eighty thousand chemicals have been registered with the Environmental Protection Agency in the last 60 years. Twenty new chemicals enter the market a week. Few are properly tested. In 2000 The Center for Disease Control measured 27 industrial chemicals in most Americans and admits that there is very little data to prove that the majority of the chemicals are safe-especially with children.Chemical companies are placing hundreds of new synthetic chemicals in the market each year-far faster than toxicologists and regulatory agencies can test them.Yet the leading cancer organization make no mention of environmental causes of cancer. Why? The answer is simple-money. Industrial chemical have become a major sector of the global economy; any evidence linking them to serious human and ecological health problems is met with opposition.As Steingraber says, \\"It's impossible to live safely in a toxic world. We need to get political.\\" We have to clean up the toxins in our environment to clean up the toxins in ourselves. No human should have to suffer and die to prove that industrial chemical cause cancer."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"This book is a page-turner, exciting and scary and above all educational. At its heart is the nature of the \\"vast national irresponsibility\\" concerning the toxic mixtures of chemicals released into our environment. It explains what the chemicals are, where they come from and the effect upon our bodies and our babies. As Public Health agencies keep telling us to change our \\"lifestyles\\" to prevent cancer, they are hiding the fact that over 90% of cancers are caused by the environment. Of the 75,000 chemicals now in commercial use , barely a fraction have been tested for cancer causing agents. Nor are they regulated.Basically, manufacturers can introduce any number of chemicals into the environment without those chemicals having been tested! These chemicals enter our soil, air, and water supply. Finally they enter our bodies via eating, breathing, and drinking.While our government researches \\"cancer genes\\" and promotes \\"Lifestyle changes\\" , waiting for dead bodies as proof of environmental causes of cancer is \\"tantamount to running an uncontrolled experiment using human subjects.\\" In other words, our government allows many people to die from a carcinogen before they label a chemical a carcinogen! Our own government is allowing us to die of cancers and other diseases just so corporations can have their way. (my words)The author promotes \\"The Precautionary Principle: indication of harm, rather than proof of harm, should be the trigger for action.\\"Reverse onus: it is safety rather than harm, that should necessitate demonstration.Read this book if you would like to know more about these findings: \\"A 2005 report by the Environmental Working Group found an average of over 200 industrial compounds, pollutants, and other chemicals in the umbilical cord blood of newborns - including 7 dangerous pesticides - some of which were banned in the U.S. 30 yrs ago.\\"2005 Univ of Rochester, NY report higher phthalate levels (from plastics) in pregnant women were associated with changes in the genitals of baby boys; specifically, they had lower levels of male hormones. 'the Centers for Disease Control's Jim Pirkle says 'The big concern of the phthalates is that they have anti-androgen activity. They get rid of things that are in the testosterone line , the things that make a man.'\\"This book further solidified my conviction that Americans must stop relying on the government to protect us. Many of us believe that our government is protecting us from poisons when in fact it is promoting the further use of poisons. I don't believe that our government is interested in health care when it runs smack into money-making corporations. We can't go on trusting the government to keep us safe in any area, be it health-related or economic. Do we really believe the new national health care plan is for our benefit? Or is it for the benefit of the bio-engineering corporations? This way they will have all of our medical records available for even better use of the American people for experiments. They will be better able to pinpoint the effects of their Frankensteinian creations, and not for our benefit, for theirs. (opinion not in book)When Public Health agencies are more interested in confusing folks with \\"lifestyle change\\" and other propoganda when they know the truth;, that we are living in a toxic environment, why should we believe them when they tell us that the national health data base is for our own good? Read this book and find out just how much our government is protecting us."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"There's an image that stands out from this book, that encapsulates its heart and soul... the image of a petri dish with a deceased nun's \\"immortal\\" breast cells. These cells live on in cancer research, continuing to divide and offer themselves up, though the nun has since passed on. Regarding these cells, Steingraber makes the comment, \\"This is my body broken for you.\\"A body broken for us. That is Steingraber herself, who was diagnosed with cancer, as a young woman still in college. A heart broken for us. Again, it is Steingraber, as she loses her best friend to cancer and reveals some of her most intimate thoughts about the experience. And it is all the bodies that still pile up in brokenness... one in three Americans now get cancer, she reminds us.It is also the brokenness of animals, soil, earth, water, and air--each of which she examines with a keen scientific eye, loads of research, and surprising poignancy.Reading this book, one questions not so much why we, or our fathers, or our sisters get cancer, but why we as a society let this brokenness go on and think we can be immune from its effects. I wish that we'd all read this book and begin to put the pieces together again."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"This interesting, easy-reading book gives sound scientific information on many of the reasons cancer is so rampant today and what can be done about it. Yes, searhing for the cure for cancer is important as is treatments - but the MOST important thing we can do is to PREVENT it in the first place. We must encourage our leaders to stop compromising the public's safety for the corporate bottom line."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"Anyone who has ever wondered about the environmental causes of cancer will be fascinated by this book. Steingraber is a gifted writer and a solid scientist (a rare but good combination) and she weaves scientific research and personal story together in a skillful way. The gist is that damning results from initial studies on the environmental causes of cancer need further study, but when all these initial studies are brought together like this it surely seems we are our own worst enemy when it comes to these terrible illnesses."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"The author presents the case for an issue that has only recently come to light in mainstream media. An extensive analysis by the Associated Press has documented that as many as 43 million Americans (and this is actually true worldwide also)are exposed to a wide array of contaminants that are currently unregulated and which researchers have shown to have serious health affects.The key take away from this book, in my opinion, is a way to look at your own surroundings and to then take action to protect your family by learning what invisible toxins are assaulting you and what to do about it. If you care about living a long and vibrant life this is a topic to be aware of."},{"Title":"Living Downstream: A Scientist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment","review":"A biologigist, objective view of the multiple foci of carcinogenic forces in our environment that absolutely boggles the mind.

It goes through a number of studies that provide a high level understanding of the issues. It is these sections of the book that had me reading over a sentence twice and sometimes three time.Buy the book. Read it. Read it slowly, but read it.

Being and avid fantasy reader, i try to explore a wide variety of books in the genre. So far, the best world i have found, is the world of Dragonlance. The books are to the point, and without the common &quot;fillers&quot; like a lot of authors are using now days. By this, i mean the chapters upon chapters were nothing happens to move the story forward. I have yet to find a dragonlance book that has done this. they are usually all full of excitement, humor, and intrigue. This book is no exception. I found it very funny, thanks to Tas, and full of action and adventure. It also shows the growth between Tanis and Flint, showing you their life before the chronicles series. All in all, i recommend this book if you love fantasy. Buy it, Read it, Love it."},{"Title":"Wanderlust (Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet, Vol. 2)","review":"By far one of the most amusing Dragonlance tales ever told in the series. The story deals with the meeting of Tanis Half Eleven, Flint Fireforge and Taslehoff Burrfoot. The writing is easy on the eye and the action paces nicely older readers, my however find it a tad tedious in places. The writing by Kirschhoff entertains the reader with her clever use of words as well as her interesting plot development. She doesn't seem to bore the us with overly large sentence and paints clear decisive pictures for the reader. How ever she tends to extend a bit to the extreme. She introduces too many elements and characters with out the necessary subplot to sustain them or she fails justify their existence in the greater scheme of things. However, the book is kept interesting by likeable characters, witty and often laugh out loud writing and a genuinely interesting plot. A MUST read for all fans of Taslehoff and His friends. -Craig Michael Julich-Serventy"},{"Title":"Wanderlust (Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet, Vol. 2)","review":"I found this book funny, which is more then I can say for most Dragonlance books. So why didn't I rate it 5 stars? Let's just say I've read better. I rate most books 4 stars, with an exceptional few getting 5 stars.This was about a kender, Tas (again), who stole a bracelet from a dwarf. Oh, Tas's excuse was that Flint had just left the bracelet 'laying around' so Tas was inclined to pick it up and keep it in his care until he saw the dwarf. Anyway, Flint gets the bracelet back, but then the two of them and Tanis half-elven go to the Inn of the Last Home to have a drink, and when the Dwarf and elf leave, Tas finds out that the bracelet just 'happened' to 'fall' into his pocket. He then goes to sleep, and in the morning remembers nothing about the bracelet. He leaves town, and when he's miles away, puts the bracelet on. He then finds it shows the future. Bad things, that is. Tas saves a man from hobgoblins, and then gives the bracelet to him to return to Flint, for the man was going in that direction. Tas then goes on. The farmer, in town, gets robbed, the bracelet included. Then the woman who had Flint make the bracelet comes up and wants her bracelet, and Flint is forced to tell the whole embarrassing story. And then they have to go on a journey; just a little one, to solve a few mysteries, save a squire, castle, and almost the world- nothing much."},{"Title":"Wanderlust (Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet, Vol. 2)","review":"Good read if you are into fantasy books.

These 3 adventurers couldn't be more different, but together, they make magic happen. Flint reminds me of my Pawpaw, always grumbling and bellering about some inanity or another. Tanis is very quiet and deliberate - an introspective leader who thrives on Pawpaw's poorly concealed kindness and wisdom. And Tas... my favorite character in ANY fantasy book EVER! Yep... even including Tolkien's clan. Blasphemy. I know. But that little mischievous scamp has a fantastic way of making OMGs seem like W/Es and W/Es seem like miracles. If you haven't read Kindred Spirits, the first book in this series, I highly recommend it. If you have, and are wondering if this is a good follow up to a brilliant read or a colossal disappointment, then you have severely underestimated Tasslehoff Burrfoot!"},{"Title":"Wanderlust (Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet, Vol. 2)","review":"I actually enjoyed this book a little more than the first of the Meetings Sextet \\"Kindred Spirits.\\" Perhaps it is because this book includes the addition of the Kender named Tasslehoff Burrfoot. If you know the Dragonlance Chronicles along with other Dragonlance books you are likely familiar with this character. He adds a happy-go-lucky silly atmosphere. He ends up stealing (accidentally taking) a special magical bracelet that Flint Fireforge had made specifically for some one. They leave their village, Solace, to retrieve this bracelet and meet some unexpected adventures on the way. The story is well told and it is one of those books that you don't want to put down because you want to see what will happen next. While obtaining the bracelet is the main focus, the authors do a good job at weaving in the companion's relationship since that seemed to be one of the intended goals of the Meetings Sextet. Even though the authors are different, the characters are kept....well, in character with the original series.It is one of those stories where different characters from different races have to work together for a common purpose, a concept that runs throughout many of the Dragonlance books. Tanis is the even keeled character that thinks before he acts and generally gives the benefit of the doubt to the other person. However, he also has certain triggers with elven royalty than are related to his childhood. Flint is the motivator as he continually pushes the characters on in their quest. Tas is the one always getting in trouble, but also is the one who seems to be in the right place at the right time, and man, he is the character you want around if there are possible traps being set. The story line is interesting and well told, the characterization is great, however it is dwarfed in comparison to Dragonlance series that are written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. It is a good read if you want to get more on the background of the characters and just want a fairly simple fantasy story."},{"Title":"Wanderlust (Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet, Vol. 2)","review":"(So far) This is the only Dragronlance book I have not liked. It is the second I have read that is not by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman.This book is written like a poorly run D&D; game (not like a novel), complete with 1-dimensional NPCs, and nonsensical random encounters. The authors demonstrate a lack of knowledge about the series, world, & characters, including information in Chronicles (which I would care less about if it were written better).The worst part is that I was expecting a book about Tasslehoff (like Meetings 1 was about Flint & Tanis), with a focus on him becoming friends with Tanis & Flint. Instead the book is about a magical ring, as it passes through the possession of various characters, most of which are the 1-dimensional NPCs. Tas, Flint, & Tanis (who should be the main characters) end up being no more important to the story than Gaesil, Delbridge, Selana, Balcombe, & Blu, and all are secondary characters to the ring.Update: Having continued on through The Meetings Sextet, I have found Vol.3 to be much better written and more enjoyable. Knowing Tina Daniell has written several more books in the Dragonlance series (including Meetings Vol.6), I now look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Wanderlust (Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet, Vol. 2)","review":"\\"Wanderlust\\" by Mary Kirchoff and Steve Winter is yet another addition to the seemingly endless Dragonlance saga (this is the second book of the \\"Meetings\\" sextet) but, unlike many of the books about the Companions not written by Weis and Hickman, this proves to be a solid book. Kirchoff was one of the key editors of the original Dragonlance team and she knows the material which is more than one can say about some of the other writers who play in Weis' and Hickman's sandbox.The book focuses on less than half of the Companions--Flint, Tas and Tanis with Tas getting most of the attention. Kirchoff certainly knows the characters well and that is enough to guide the reader along a solid, if unspectacular, book which is a bit lighter in tone than many of the Dragonlance books. Kirchoff and Winter do not try to stage an epic in \\"Wanderlust\\"--they know their limits which is more than one can say about some of the other Dragonlance writers.The editing seems a bit off, especially with the use of too many pronouns and some odd sentence structure. There are some funny scenes but the book often tries a bit too hard--especially with a plethora of subplots that go nowhere and odd races that do not appear in any of the other Dragonlance books. The end seemed a bit rushed and anti-climatic.But this book was not a failure or even below average. Was this a great book? No. But it was readable and did not take away from the saga as a whole. Still, with the exceptions of some funny scenes and wordplay, there was little in \\"Wanderlust\\" that stood out. Fans of Tas will like this book and probably rate it higher than I have. Fans of the saga as a whole may give it more average marks."},{"Title":"Wanderlust (Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet, Vol. 2)","review":"If you love Tas read this book because this is Tas at his finest!

She has very specific instructions (we find out later) as to how this is to be crafted. Needless to say that Tas enters the picture and winds up beginning the quest of a lifetime for Flint and Tanis.\\"Creatures\\" that (to my knowledge) haven't shown up before in DL novels come into play here... especially the firey-winged humanoids, there's an appearance of a hill giant, golems in the form of minotaurs, and we get to know a little of the Sea Elves.Magic is abundant in this novel, but the action in no way seems hampered by the lack of hack and slash (apparent in most DL). Tas is however more 'crafty' and 'take charge' than I'm used to, though... but he's still portrayed quite well.All in all, if you like the Heroes of the Lance, or if you're interested in starting Dragonlance (heck, if you're in the mood for a good fantasy)then pick this one up... but remember to get Part 1 of Meetings too."},{"Title":"Wanderlust (Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet, Vol. 2)","review":"Following with the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; legacy, I felt that this book had a strong storyline and was very exciting (not that any &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novel featuring Tanis, Flint, and Tasslehoff isn't) At some parts it moved rather slow, and the ending occured rather quick.

The plot was well enough written (Mary finally veers off from being a Weis/Hickman clone) . The characters , or should i say ; sub characters to the overall DL saga , were easy to process. The half elf , hill dwarf and kender characterisation remained faithful to the original Weis/Hickman. Not a lot of discrepancies to &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot; not to make it an indirect tie in.

I am a spiteful man.&quot;Notes from Underground is one of the most influential pieces of fiction in Western European history. It contains an all-out assault on Enlightenment rationalism and the idea of progress which foreshadows many such assaults in the mid-to-late twentieth century. An outstanding example of Dostoyevsky's psychological skills, depicting a character motivated by many contradictory impulses are found in the novel. One of the most salient characteristics of the Underground Man is his profound self-contempt combined with an exquisitely sensitive ego--a combination that is much discussed these days. Portraying him as one of the first anti-heroes in fiction, a protagonist utterly lacking every trait of the Romantic hero and living out a futile life on the margins of society. Such figures were to dominate much serious fiction in the mid-twentieth century, notably Albert Camus' Meursault in The Stranger. Dostoyevsky thus makes clear that the underground man's irrationalist solution is no better than the rationalists' systems."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Notes is the story of a person who all his life goes unnoticed by others. But, as the book unwinds we get a clue as to why. Any time someone does interact with him his self loathing causes him to drive that person away. It is a very existential book. Here we have a person that leads an absurd meaningless life living in his catacomb of a home. I really see why the book has stood the test of time as in my opinion it is tremendously sad. It reminds me of the Beatles song Eleanor Rigby in that it makes want to reach out and show kindness to people like the protagonist in the book."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"One of the most insightful character studies crafted by man. What Michealangelo did with stone, Dostoyevsy does with words, only rather than give us something as angelically beautiful as Pieta, Dostoyevsky offers us its grotesque opposite--the image of a man broken and twisted by one of the most tragic depictions of self-loathing ever brought to literature. In a word, beautiful!"},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Notes from the Underground, written in 1864, is generally considered to be the first existential novel ever written. The themes, the settings, the dialogue, and the somewhat scandalous climax contribute to an essential work by Dostoevsky that is, perhaps, a half century ahead of its time. The whole work is somewhat depressing and written in an unconventional style. It is presented as the diary of a 40 year old man who lives alone in Petersburg, in his \\"corner\\", in his room that is \\"nasty, squalid, on the outskirts of town\\". The first part is the Underground Man's musings and ideas and the second part is a diary of the events of his younger years. Walter Kaufmann points out that in addition to rejecting the Greek or classical philosophic system, \\"Dozens of other themes are sounded in these pages, too. Reading how the underground man \`could not even become an insect,' we think of Kafka's Metamorphosis. The analysis of resentment is developed by Nietzsche. Section VI anticipates the psychology of Sartre's \`Portrait of the Anti-Semite'\\".Notes from the Underground was written partially as a response to socialist author N.G. Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, What is to be Done? In Chernyshevsky's novel, a utopian socialist world is envisioned, one that Dostoevsky most certainly disagreed with. The novel, upon reading excerpts from it today, is a work of socialist drivel: a piece of pure propaganda, similar to the second half of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle in its tone and vision of a new civilization, or \\"Tower or Babel\\" as Dostoevsky would have called it. It introduces a new socialist society, one in which all people, \\"Spend the morning engaged in very hard work,\\" and then make merriment and engage in sexual promiscuity in the evening together because, \\"[There is] no danger of grief or need, only the recollection of free and willing labor of abundance, goodness, and enjoyment.\\" Dostoevsky had great scorn for socialism, and as is evident in almost all of his other works (The Devils, Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov) he thought it destructive, deluded, and completely incompatible with Russian Orthodox Christianity.With the underground man Dostoevsky has created one of the world's first overtly existential protagonists; he is full of anxiety or despair, he rejects conventional ways and wisdom, he is obsessed with the possibility of his death, he is completely free in his actions, and he is hopelessly alone by secluding himself from society. His ideas are counter-culture and show a definite rejection of reason, science, and conventionality. He acts according to his own whims and emotions giving no thought to how others feel or what others think; his individuality (or thoughts of his individuality) is so stark that he hardly regards others as being individuals. Above all, he has an acute insight into the human condition; as Vasily Rozanov writes, \\"The man from the underground is a person who has withdrawn deep within himself. He hates life and spitefully criticizes the ideal of the rational utopians on the basis of a precise knowledge of human nature, which he acquired through a long and lonely observation of himself and of history\\". The key to understanding Notes from Underground as a whole is to realize that not everything the Underground Man says comes from Dostoevsky's mouth as well; while some of his characters are mouthpieces (e.g. Elder Zosima, some of his women characters), others merely serve as examples whose actions and words are to serve as critique of their philosophies and others' as well.The existential or proto-existential literary themes and devices stand out strong in Notes From Underground. Once again, Dostoevsky did not mean for this novel to be an autobiography. Therefore one must not only look at what the underground man says, but one must look at where his philosophy leads him. If his ideas lead him to madness or cruelty (as they clearly do), then one must examine which of his ideas led him to do these acts. It is possible that Dostoevsky was speaking from the underground man's perspective at some times, and if this is true then one must also compare the underground man's philosophy to the philosophies of other characters created by Dostoevsky and clearly meant to expound his point of view, e.g. Dounia, Sonia, and the redeemed Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment, to see whether or not Dostoevsky is speaking his personal philosophy through the underground man or not.All in all, Notes is an essential book for any Dostoevsky fan, any student of existentialism, and anyone who loves to think about deeper issues."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"After a fast reading, I realize that I still do not fully understand the implication and meaning of this book, which is so famous that I feel that I should read it otherwise I might feel lack of something.In this regard, the second part of novel appears to me a story, while the first part I still need to find the time to re-read it and digest it.Anyway, I will try to read the original Russian version in future in order to see whether I can get more understanding of this book."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"First, this is a great translation. Having first read it in Russian a decade ago, it was a pleasure to come back to it in a different language. The effect was the same. You so many times find yourself exclaiming in your head, Oh man, I never knew that it was possible for someone to be this witty, this insightful about human nature, and this good at communicating it all in an entertaining way. As other reviewers have pointed out, the thinness of the book should not mislead you. This is as thick of a book as there is. So many thoughts, so many thought-provocations are piled on top of each, in each other, and across each other. And all of it delivered in a very funny plot. It is like reading a book written by a council consisting of Larry David, Nietzsche, Michel de Montaigne, and Freud. The only other book I can compare it to in terms of getting from it an entertaining philosophical kick in the mind is Thus Spoke Zarathustra of Nietzsche."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Another masterpiece by one of my favorite authors of all time. This is so raw, candid, poignant and very very dark portrait of a pathetic man (representing mankind of his time and the future) that is ruled, not by reason but volition (in neutral sense) and hysterics when the truth forces its way through.

I found the Underground Man's constant rambling on about his life in the first part of the book to be extremely boring and eventless, while the second part was altogether irrelevant. I do think that the symbolism and Dostoyevsky's frustration with the period in which he lived is well written, though. If I was not forced to read this book for school and waited until I was a bit more intellectually mature to read it I do think that I would have appreciated and admired Dostoyevsky and his work."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Amazon keeps sending me e-mails hyping these \\"1st Editions\\" of classics, which look to be the very latest in worthless trash.

It is the story of some deranged lunatic who boasts of his inability to adapt to society. He is indeed sick, as the opening line, one of the most famous in all of literature, suggests.In many ways this book is a dark parallel to St Augustine's *Confessions.* But unlike Augustine, this is not a book of praise. The first part of the book he explains in a few thoughts what is wrong with him and society. IN the second part of the book he illustrates that by a dinner party with some worthless people who have happened to have found some money in their position in life. The most (anti) climactic part is at the end, in his conversation with the prostitute Liza. Does he save her? Or does she save him? At any rate, we soon see that it is not the narrator but society that is sick.This is a very important read, but it is not an enjoyable one. It is the part of Dostoevsky that the more liberal (and I use that in the original sense of the word, that of 18th-19th century Enlightenment philosophy) elitists do not want to see: this is where Slavophilism enters its more deadly phase."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"It is somewhat ironic that usually the people who pick up thislittle book are going through a personal crisis. This is probably thelast thing they need. This is not a cheer-up book, although they may find some commiseration in the narrator's life.Who is this narrator? Like the protagonist of Dostoyevksy's -The Idiot-, he is someone who believes himself to be superior to &quot;the great mass,&quot; but who is so superior that he must live &quot;underground&quot; (much like living as an &quot;idiot&quot;). He is something of a voluntary outcast, who nevertheless manages little personal moments of stickin' it to the man... perhaps the funniest subplot is how he plays &quot;chicken&quot; with important people who are walking down the sidewalk...A Russian literary critic is rumored to have said &quot;Dostoyevsky is the nastiest Christian I've ever met.&quot; And indeed, you would be mistaken if you expected something overly life-affirming, even in an existentialist way, in this book. It is life-affirming only in a fatalistic Russian sense, of &quot;No matter how bad it gets, we can always laugh about it.&quot; Even the one scene that is set up as a messianic, optimistic scene, turns into something ugly and spiteful.Still, this novel is interesting and brilliant, and a great introduction to Dostoyevsky's psychological studies and his anti-rationalist, anti-Enlightenment crusade. If nothing else, it shows Dostoyevsky before he wrote he had written his major novels, and before he had been sent to Siberia (an experience that made him significantly temper his anti-establishment views)."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"halfway through the book so far. quite a clinic on 19th century russian literature. very introspective i have found.would recommend to others."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"The Underground Man. Do you want to know him? Prepare to enter a sharp, claustrophobic, hot and stifling mental basement; prepare to meet someone who can smell the cancer of mediocrity and the moral tumors that most of us possess. You really want to go down into this stinking and acid grave? Ok, here we go. But first, let's talk a little bit of the author of the book: Dostoievsky.Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky are usually mentioned together in the volumes of history of literature as some kind of two genius brothers, two companions in greatness. This view is exaggerated, because Tolstoy is a superior artist, endowed with greater technical expertise, stricter organizational ability and better formal perfectionism. Moreover, the scope of the work of Tolstoy is greater than that of Dostoievsky: the characters are more varied, there is a greater number of philosophies; female figures are more perfect, sick young man are exposed at the same time that healthy young man, there is a greater variety of scenes, places and situations. In Dostoevsky, however, we are always among the same type of figures (troubled minds, sick spirits), the scenes are constantly repeated: always the same places, the same atmosphere. Tolstoy excels Dostoevsky in this regard: variety.Justice, however, has to be done. There is a very important aspect of literature in which Dostoyevsky surpasses Tolstoy: psychological depth. Dostoevsky's characters are gigantic figures, as if the man invites us to walk through the mazes of his creatures brains, over the mental veins of his characters. Tolstoy never penetrates so deeply into the bowels of his creations; we never become this familiar with their souls, as if we could smell and taste them: only in Dostoevsky this phenomenon occurs. Dostoevsky opens a deep incision in the flesh of those who he creates; he opens the skin, the muscles, exposing the organs, and then pushes us into the cavity: he makes us plunging into the flesh, into the guts of his creations.One of the most appropriate comparisons in terms of art is that between Dostoyevsky and Michelangelo, and although such a comparison contrasts two arts that are in principle so different from one another, it seems to me that Michelangelo is the closest twin to Dostoevsky, closer than any other writer in the history of world literature.Dostoyevsky and Michelangelo have much in common as artists. Both are fascinated by human beings, and make them the central theme of their works. But it is not a normal humanity, the humanity of people around us, the humanity of our daily acts, no, not even the humanity we find in our own thinking about ourselves, the humanity that we shredded to ourselves when we lie down in our beds at night, this warm and sleepy picture modeled by auto-contemplating the actions that we did during the day; it is not the humanity of an eventual philosophical activity, a simple indigestion of self-analysis, it is not that more intimate portrait of ourselves, that image in which we pride, that depth which we all believe to have: no! Humanity portrayed by such artists is huge, enormous, magnanimous. Mountains of muscular meat collide and weave in the frescoes of Michelangelo, embrace themselves, become enmeshed, devouring space with its tentacles of flesh, swallowing with starving nostrils all the existing oxygen; his sculptures throb with swollen muscles, gorged with blood, as if itching from extreme and recent effort, where exposed veins run like the sap of some kind of primordial rivers. The anatomy of these behemoths and leviathans is not biologically possible; the mind of Michelangelo fed nature with his own dreams, made her eat the bread of his visions, and so he mixed the blood of men to that of the giants, of the titans; human flesh germinated, as if fertilized by the seeds of beasts and angels.So Dostoyevsky. His main characters in their monologues, in their moments of ecstasy and fever, in his meditations about heaven and hell, possessed by the intestines and the bowels or the most delicate veil of soul and spirit, speak a language that will never be spoke by common mankind. The mouths spew torrents of incandescent words, sometimes balmy, sometimes toxic, such as volcanoes spitting out lava; metaphors and images gallop out of the throats, over the tongues, filling the air with thoughts never conceived by normal minds. The neurons of the characters of Dostoyevsky are eternally attacked by the plague of a strange fever, a particular craziness, at the same time bestial and cherubic: its majestic storms are crystallized and frozen by the author in wonderful passages of dialogue. Dostoevsky seems to have paced the deepest depths of silt and mud of the obscure deep, he seems to have paced over the clouds in the chilly air of the atmosphere: the details collected in such trips were those with which he tempered his main creations, whose roars, howls, prayers, confessions and threats will be forever remembered. Like Darwin, he examined in detail all the landscapes of the human spirit, collecting beetles, worms, crustaceans, reptiles, mammals and birds nested in hidden burrows of the spirit, unknown, strange, but at the same time wonderful.Michelangelo and Dostoevsky: here we have two brothers in the art of sculpting monsters and angels. It is not strange that their works disdain landscapes, forests and mountains, cities with buildings, streets, avenues; such details appear as little as possible, only when absolutely necessary: there is no room for scenery, for useless details, for titanic humanity, in its hunger, devours any spaces, requiring all the light and all the focus to itself.As for the book Notes from Underground, firstly it should be noted that it is divided into two sections: the first is a great monologue of the main character (not named in the book), and the second a kind of short story, also in first person, in which the very narrator is also the main character.The first part is rather confuse, convulsive: a garbled of sentences and thoughts that do not follow a rigidly logical and linear progress. This effect seems, at first, to be sought by the writer, but the knowledge of the works of Dostoyevsky reveals that this confusion is one of his mais characteristics: it is as if the author had several things to say but could not find the time or patience to do it neatly. In certain cases, such as the Underground Man, the convulsive style fits that purpose well: it reflects the personality of the sitter. On other occasions, however, the style of Dostoevsky does not appear to have a functional character and resembles more mere sloppiness. That was something that bothered Tolstoy, as you can see by reading some of the notes in their journals:October 12, 1910. (...) After dinner I read Dostoyevsky. The descriptions are good, although some jokes, very talkative and not very funny, stand in the way. But the talks are impossible, completely unnatural. (...)October 18, 1910. (...) I read Dostoyevsky and was impressed with his sloppy way, artificiality and manufacturing (...)October 19, 1910. (...) I read superficially the first volume of the Brothers Karamazov and finished it. There are many good things in the book, but it is so disorganized. The Great Inquisitor and Zossima's farewell.In the opening monologue of Notes from Underground the narrator's character seems to deal with three main ideas: first his suffering and his desire to suffer, as well as his desire to make others have to tolerate his pain and anguish, to force them to bear his agony cries; a second idea deals with the inertia, with inaction, characterizing them as one of the defining characteristics of the superior man, as the superior man perceives that there is no reason to act, so that all men of action are actually lower than the passive beings who base their inaction on major philosophical truths; there is also, in the initial monologue, a critical to reason based on logic and scientific truths, where the underground man argues that anyone at anytime can decide to act the way he wants without guide his actions by any logical and mathematical truths.The second part of the book, entitled Apropos of the Wet Snow, chronicles the relationship of the narrator's character with some men known to him in high school, with his butler and a young prostitute. In passages truly distressing, we realize how difficult it is for the underground man to relate to others. One gets the impression that a too acute intelligence captures the defects of all people in all situations, and an extremely rigid moral sense is unable to forgive such faults.The underground man suffers, it seems, because he cannot bear the stains on the character that are, in society, concealed and omitted. Normal people (in so that they can relate themselves) pretend not to notice faults in others, and also not punish themselves for their own defects; the underground man, however, cannot pretend that there is no such blemishes, and also does not condone his own faults, his own mediocrity.The tolerance that everyone have in order to be able to keep in pursuit of their interests is something that does not exist in the underground man; for example, to position themselves well in society, many of his friends pretend to like other influential friends, pretending to have fun with their jokes, pretending to enjoy their company, pretending to like to hear their stories, pretending to be happy for the success of others; as for the underground man, he cannot pretend, he cannot hide de rotten taste that some people make him feel in his heart, and the perception that others pretend is something that makes him even more ferocious.The social relations actually require a large degree of tolerance, because we are naturally selfish (we generally don't care about success of others, about the achievements of others); even more complex is the situation for someone with wide intelligence, someone who can read, behind every act or phrase, the hidden and occult intentions: to such mind the capacity to discern the thoughts of others and tolerate them is very challenging, and the underground man is not able to do so. The notion of our own mediocrity is also something that is more present in broad minds: the knowledge of human history and its main geniuses and exponents shows how far the human mind can reach, and how small it is usually in the overwhelming majority of the existences. The underground man never loses track of his mediocrity, and, because he is not able to tolerate falsehoods, he tortures himself all the time by chewing his own faults and weaknesses, without ever dreaming of hiding them. If at times he demonstrates pride in his intellect, he soon reports again how wrong was that auto-compliment, grumbling one more time about how he is incapable and mediocre; it seems that to exhibit his intelligence is a kind of defense mechanism used by the narrator at all times that his reasoning borders on sheer desperation.The underground man seems to be, in short, a soul scarred by the general mediocrity of the human race, being also an angry soul, whose hatred stems from the fact that everyone feels proud to be who they are, without any regard or preoccupation for their own limitations. It irritates him the fact that people in general think that they are important, that they are irreplaceable, that they have qualities, and that, to be treated with respect by others, one should pretend to like them and have fun with them: the narrator cannot stand that everyone simply do not despair by contemplating their own inferiority; it irritates him to the extreme that people are mediocre but do not realize it: he seems to want everyone to perceive their one lack of value, their one lack of meaning and importance, in such a way that everyone would sink once and for all in the sadness and despair that they deserve for being so limited, so empty of qualities.One cannot say that the underground man is mad: it's just a man with great intelligence and a keen perception, lacking, however, the tolerance and the ability to accept things, serenely, as they are. If someone wants to accuse this unhappy being: to say that he cannot point the mediocrity of others since he himself is mediocre, that will just make him smile with bitterness, because he himself is aware of his mediocrity, while we tend to forget our own."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Fyodor Dostoevsky was an author renowned for his ability to portray the intricacies and sublime aspects of the human mind in a wholly unique and compelling manner. His characters exhibit such a fullness and vitality of verisimilitude that they seem to have more substance than your average next-door neighbor. In addition, he has long been considered a forerunner for the philosophical movement known as existentialism, where the focus lies solely on the colossal implications of human existence and the purpose of life (if any). So, it should come as no surprise that a novel from a man of these credentials is certain to pack a whollop for its readers.Notes from the Underground is not only a masterpiece of Russian and existentialist literature, but all literature in general. I know, I know, \\"That's some high praise there, pal,\\" you say, but go on -- give the book a try.The first part of Notes serves as a monologue of sorts for the underground man (who is never named), and introduces themes and ideas that will play heavily in the second part of the novel. Weighty issues such as man's desire to always choose free will, even if it's not in his best interest but merely for the fact that he CAN choose free will; and the moral and intellectual estrangement of hyperconscious man from himself, are discussed here. I would be remiss not to say that the narrator is also probably going to be one of the most spiteful, self-loathing, and purely disgusting characters that you will ever meet in your literary life.The second part is more of a conventional narrative (and I mean no disrespect by saying \\"conventional\\") that finds the underground man pursuing his own utter and complete humiliation and contempt for humanity and himself in a series of misadventures with a police officer (who doesn't give him the time of day), old schoolmates (who absolutely hate him), and an unfortunate prostitute (who really shouldn't have gone to work on the night that he visited her brothel). All these train-wrecks of social interaction end in either tears, laughs, and/or profound thoughts on the nature of humanity for the reader and narrator.All in all, I found Notes from the Underground to be a sheer delight -- and horror -- to read and mull over. I hope that you get just as much pleasure from it as well!"},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"As my title implies, this was my intro to Dostoyevsky. This was an interesting book, it was a bit off kilter from what I normally read, but I am thankful that day when, for what ever reason I decided to buy this book before all others. Call it divine providence. I liked this book more than I ever imagined I would, the first half was a bit disorienting since unlike most books I dove into the frigid waters of Russian literature head first. It was well worth the effort, and I mean it, if I don't Like a book enough to see it through, I have no issues with putting it down and seeing what is next. This was a rare treat, I don't know if I will ever make it to some of his meatier works, but after this I certainly hope so. This is about a character that has stayed with me for many years now, like a creepy neighbor you can't move away from but ever minute of your life you wish you could. It also in a strange way makes me appreciate my dental plan."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"\\"Notes from the Underground\\" is a brilliant satirical attack on \\"European ideas\\" as received in Russia, in general, and on one Nikolai Chernyshevsky in particular. It was strange, and hard to understand, so it was widely ignored until the 1920's, when someone finally began to notice that Dostoevsky had been RIGHT. Russians took the road of Chernyshevsky (an idiot, and a utopian socialist who denied human free will) and they wound up living the life of the Cockroach Man, where nobody was guilty of anything, and everybody was guilty of everything, and the blood flowed like water.It is important to understand that the narrator, the Cockroach Man, is not Dostoevsky, not even Dostoevsky on one of his bad days. He is definitely a literary creation, but what is he meant to represent? When people began taking this novel seriously, they imagined that the Cockroach Man (\\"I am a sick man...I am a wicked man...) was some lunatic opponent of Enlightened Ideas. But Dostoevsky was a step ahead of them, and it took a long time before people began to realize that the Cockroach Man was the direct result of taking Chernyshevsky's ideas seriously. In particular, the Cockroach Man's \\"hyperconsciousness\\" seems to serve as a code word for accepting man's lack of free will; this idea is something that philosophers bandy about easily, but they never seem to stop to think what it will mean if the human race takes them seriously. If that happens, \\"hyperconsciousness\\" comes into play, and ALL moral codes, ALL OF THEM, are erased. A man slaps you in the face!So what? He has no free will; he's just a robot. If you feel angry and slap him back, you're no better off. If you \\"decide\\" to ignore it with \\"compassion,\\" it's the same thing: you are a robot as much as he is. No sin attaches to your actions or thoughts, but neither does any glory.To simplify and summarize: the Cockroach Man is Dostoevsky's acidic, sarcastic portrait of a man who takes Chernyshevsky (and his like) seriously.If man sees his own good and follows it automatically, why is history a non-stop affair of men slaughtering one another? Why do some men see the good path and deliberately take the evil path? If you rob mankind of his soul, his God, and his freedom, what kind of creature are you left with?\\"I am a sick man...I am a wicked man...\\"Highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"\\"I'm better than everybody else. No one is treated as poorly as I am.\\" Sound familiar? 150 years ago, Dostoyevsky discovered the modern mind. The perfect guide to understanding the jerks who surround you--and your own sorry self!"},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"There are two parts to these 'Notes'; the first (shorter) part is a philosophical diatribe which most interesting discussions revolve around the Underground man's challange to 'rational egoism' and defense of free will. The second part is a biographical account of the Underground man's relations between some old classmates and a prostitute named Liza.Ultimately, the Underground man is a complex, condtradictory, and fragmented character thoroughly alienated from society. His interactions with his classmates illustrates this well: simultananeously, he desires to become best chums with them but just as quickly would challenge one of them to a duel. He believes himself to be superior to them intellectually but never fails to utterly humiliate himself in front of them. The story climaxes with the Underground man's meeting with Liza who he at first shows some sort of kindness but then in the future refuses to treat her humanely or build any sort of decent relationship. He seems to be incapable of love or compassion.While not a long read, it is hard - especially the first part. It is a story that should probably be read more than once to be able to comprehend it."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Dostoyevsky's pessimistic, deeply disturbing novella, Notes from the Underground (1864), presents a rather atypical protagonist - one that describes himself as a sick man, a spiteful man, an unattractive man. In an introductory footnote Dostoyevsky argues that the fictional writer of these notes not only may, but positively must exist, when one considers the circumstances of current society (i.e., Dostoyevsky's mid-nineteenth century Russia).Notes from the Underground consists of two fragments from a diary. In the first the writer rather incoherently defends his motivation for his self-destructive behavior and defiant suffering. In the second he relates actual events from his life that clearly illustrate his irrational, capricious, self-degrading actions. This man of intellect is completely aware of his destructive behavior, and yet he deliberately and calculatingly makes no effort to change.The first fragment has overtones of a Socratic discussion. The protagonist argues incessantly that his apparent irrational behavior is actually quite rational and that it is popular rationalism that is misguided. Dostoyevsky's character enjoys challenging conventional wisdom, making outrageous statements, strongly arguing his viewpoint, only quite abruptly to deny his own argument. I found myself sometimes shocked, sometimes amused, and other times simply confused by this verbose, academic manifesto.Contrastingly, the impact of the second fragment was disturbingly emotional. At points I felt sympathy and pity and even embarrassment with Dostoyevsky's protagonist's inability to avoid angering others. At other times I was frustrated and angry as he recounted in detail his carefully orchestrated efforts to diminish and demean others.It is difficult not to agree with this character's earlier self-assessment; he is, indeed, a sick man, a spiteful man, an unattractive man. What I found most surprising is that this emotionally disturbed protagonist is immensely compelling and darkly fascinating. Perhaps, we unconsciously recognize elements of Dostoyevsky's rebellious creation in ourselves.My copy of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Notes from the Underground (1864) is an inexpensive Dover reprint of Constance Garnett's translation (originally published in 1918)."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"_This is the first book to accurately describe the mind-set and situation of the modern man. This is because the sort of 19th century man that Dostoevsky described here is modern man- the differences are only superficial. A Western European could not have written a book like this- he would have been too close to the problem, since western European rationalism is the problem. A Russian like Dostoevsky was still close enough to Feudalism and the land that he could feel in his bones that something was profoundly wrong._The \\"underground\\" writer of these tales is a man that has come to loath himself. He loathes himself because he knows that he is not a true human being in any sense. He knows that he is a cog in a machine. He is told that logic, rationalism, and materialism are everything. He has been told that he has no free will that everything is predetermined by natural laws and statistics. He has even been told that he is no more than an evolved ape, so even his religion has been stripped from him. All that is important is profit and comfort- and to serve the machine in his own minor soul killing way as a petty bureaucrat. This is what has convinced him that it is better to resign from society and live as a recluse. Far better not to contribute to the great, inescapable soul-killing system._But that is just it- Dostoevsky is making a point in order to forcibly shake his reader out of his or her complacency. He is trying to demonstrate the unnatural nature of a materialistic life lived neurotically and pettily from the head and not the heart. He is also trying to point out those events in ordinary life that hint at there being something more- things that cannot be described with a formula or a chart. Dostoevsky had found the truth in his deep mystic faith in God. This book was a wake-up call to put others on the transcendent path by demonstrating just how inhuman the modern westernized mind-set was._This is not an existential novel- it is a transcendent one. This book demonstrates what a hell results when you forcibly amputate the Holy from Holy Russia. It is what happens when you exile the sacred from all our lives."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Eventually all of the great writers quote this short novella or pay homage to the character. Arguably, Dostoevsky is the greatest writer of all time. This book is one of the many reasons he can lay claim to that title. This has been barked about as a bible for existentialists and I feel it qualifies. Few books hit the cord in you that make you feel like the writer is sitting across the table from you and simultaneously knows your deepest and darkest thoughts. The opening page is a killer in dialogue alone. The underground man is exceedingly spiteful to the point that he'll let his liver hurt him before going to see any doctor. There is nothing likable about the main character. He is a joke to some, laughed at by some military men when he challenges one of the them to a dual. Scorned by his coworkers, taking delight in ruining their day and quietly hounded by his housekeeper for back pay. The honesty in the dialogue reveals something you know about yourself, but are afraid to admit to it. One of the greatest works of all time. Read \\"Notes\\" you will never be the same."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Notes from Underground is by far the best book I've ever read. You are quite intrigued when you read the first lines of the book: &quot;I am a sick man... a mean man. There is nothing attractive about me. I think there is something wrong with my liver.&quot; (There are different translations, however.) He goes on with his, I will call it &quot;pessimistic criticism&quot; (I know some of you will disagree) that keeps you reading until the unfortunate end. The Russian author's way of thought and philosophy cannot be matched and his experiences through everyday life are entertaining. I cannot believe this masterpiece only costs $.80. It led me to making Dostoyevsky my most favorite author."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Well I enjoyed reading Notes From Underground, by Fyodor Dostoevsky/Dostoyevsky, I found the structure of the book a little inhibiting. Part one and part two simply do not belong together; each could stand on its own as very short books - but read together I feel they are too dissimilar...although I understand this is a literary device employed by the author and one that was necessary, because the book as a whole can be interpreted as the rationalizing or rediscovering in part one of what happens in part two. But (in my mind) part one simply overpowers part two; part one being philosophical and musing well part two is more of a traditional narrative. I found myself laughing out loud at moments in part one and not really caring as much what happens in part two. The protagonist seems witty, personable, and philosophical in part one, and in part two just loses it - granted in the second half of the book he is describing himself as a much younger and therefore more foolish man - and that seems to go great lengths towards making the book's point - but it is a little disconcerting to see how distanced we become from our youthful selves...although this could be one of the works greatest contributions! And, as different as we become, we still harbor memories of our most shameful experiences, these helping to shape who we are today...they can never be completely overcome. The author has every intention of exposing just how base and emotional humans can be, how irrational and spontaneous, and this idea rises sharply in part two. In fact, both parts insist greatly upon the idea of human irrationality...Overall, not a bad little book, and if you can take each part independently, it becomes a great little book. Just be ready to pay close attention to what the author has written in part one, and realize that part two, after reading part one, will feel, at the least, anti-climactic."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"It's Dostoyevsky, whats not to like.

The un-named narrator etches an image of the \\"sick\\" and \\"wicked man\\" that he invariably chooses to be. A masterpiece no doubt."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"In this book, Dostoyevsky presents a character that is self-possessed, vain, subject to bouts of depressive arrogance, yet seems to be looking for some good to do. He recognizes many of his faults, yet is convinced that they are merely character traits. He lives in poverty, yet has a servant that he treats in a petty and poor way, even though the servant is clearly his moral superior.The character voluntarily associates with vain and simple men, simply for the opportunity to feel intellectually superior. When slighted, he pouts uncontrollably, talking about a duel with one where he openly states he will fire into the air and give the man the opportunity to kill him.Continuing his fit of self-centered pique, he visits a young prostitute and treats her as a person. He learns that she was sold into prostitution and has a medical student boyfriend He talks to her and adopts the attitude of someone who will rescue her, giving her his address. However, when she arrives at his residence, he is cruel, telling her that he was only ridiculing her when he was apparently giving her the offer of aid. After he does this, he collapses in tears on the sofa and she holds and comforts him.I read, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" several years ago, so I recognized many of the character traits so prominent in that novel. \\"Notes From the Underground\\" was written before his greatest novels yet you see that same very alienated person who has simultaneously adopted the air of complete superiority inextricably bound with feelings of hopelessness and self-loathing. It is a difficult story to read."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"The views of Underground Man (UM) are directly related to those of The Grand Inquisitor of the Brothers Karamazov, and the outlook of many other characters penned by Dostoyevsky. In any case, this is an excellent approach of the rational being to the whole concept of existentialism . . an approach exaggerated to absurdity.In his search to bring some happiness, albeit some meaning, to his life, UM is portrayed as an arrogant, inadequate, socially unacceptable, sadistic and morally corrupt individual. Was Dostoyevsky telling us that even in such an \\"insect\\" one can find self-worth through the power of one's own will and decision making. Or was he saying that existentialism itself is absurd, and leads to the existence of the UM. I would tend to think the latter, that he is placing his remarks into the mouth of such a despicable individual to try to show where the self-absorption that is the hallmark of existential philosophy will lead.He used just this tactic in The Grand Inquisitor where Jesus kissed the lips of the Inquisitor at the end of the tale, in essence telling him that Jesus had gotten it right, not the priest. And he used this same technique, although with a twist, when Prince Mishkin participated in the killing of Natasha in The Idiot (if Mishkin was as good and as holy as he was painted, would he rally have done what he did?)"},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"With this review, I'll probably reveal myself to be an unthinking boob, but I have to be honest. I didn't particularly enjoy Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Notes from the Underground. The writing is sometimes brilliant, the language (in translation, of course) is compelling at times, and the depth of the main character is occasionally intriguing. But the story, well, there really is no story. I am such a simple-minded reader of fiction that I like to see some semblance of a plot thread. I enjoy seeing the transformation of a character or the resolution of the problem. But I didn't see that here.The novel, if we can call it that, is a rambling, first-person, account of an embittered, self-loathing civil servant. His self-loathing leads him to, seemingly intentionally, attempt to make the lives of others miserable. The first portion of the book, about a third, is his own reflection on misery. It's not until almost halfway through that anything actually happens, when he becomes obsessed with an officer who refuses to give way when they pass on the street. He then imposes himself uninvited on a social gathering of acquaintances, who clearly despise him (and whose antipathy the narrator seems to relish). He leaves them for a brothel, where he convinces the prostitute to leave her life there and come to him. But when she does, he turns her away, continuing to spread his misery around.I'm no Dostoyevsky scholar (obviously), but I know some of his other works are much better than this. It's almost as if he decided to try something new and experimental, which, arguably, he did. Notes was first published in 1864, and can be seen as a precursor to the existentialism which gained wider readership in the works of Camus and Sartre (but those two writers actually told stories).In the last paragraph, the narrator writes, \\"Why, to tell long stories, showing how I have spoiled my life through morally rotting in my corner, through lack of fitting environment, through divorce from real life, and rankling spite in my underground world, would certainly not be interesting. . . .\\" Amen to that. Not interesting, indeed. Call me ignorant, call me stupid, call me obtuse, just don't call me to read this boring, depressing book again."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"I wish I could rate books with question marks...not for lack of understanding, but rather a lack of surety on the part of my own feelings.\\"a novel needs a hero, and all the traits for an anti-hero are EXPRESSLY gathered together here\\"I couldn't agree more. Part I of the book is barely-comprehensible rambling that is absolutely painful to read. Dostoyevsky, or the narrator, has a much stronger gift for storytelling than philosophizing. Even so, let it be said that there isn't anything resembling a structured plot...rather a random sampling of recollections that all end with an inane predictability. By the time you get to Part II (the more narrative section), the narrator's ramblings and actions become so repetitive that it's positively trite.Whatever brilliant passages and lines there are to be found (and there are quite a few), they do nothing to redeem the narrator, mainly out of a sense that if given half the opportunity he would instantly change his mind about whatever he just said. Perhaps we can count that as phenomenal characterization...in the 2 dimensional sense.But as I said, there are some ideas and some passages that are worth taking note of, so I can't call it a total loss. Yet it's not a good book via structure or moralizing...which is why I can hardly bring myself to give it any rating. I don't feel indifferent about it, nor do I feel anything as strong as love or hate. What more can I say?Read it if you dare?"},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"This is one of the finest books I've read in a long time.

What we have been given is angst, confusion, loneliness, and boredom. This is Dostoyevsky's idea of modern man's modern-day dilemma. A character is portrayed whose sense of detachment is all pervasive and simultaneously, exhausting for the reader. Who are this man's 'notes\\" written for? They appear to be written for someone 'out there', but, who? Are they in fact written by our man to himself? Is this a pretend dialogue or a lonely monologue? Is it both? His truth seems minimally coherent, while his correspondence with reality, profoundly elusive. The author is asking us to ask ourselves, \\"Is it better to do nothing? Is conscious inertia beneficial?\\" Does our man really envy \\"normal\\" men? First he says, \\"Though I have said that I envy normal men, yet, I shall not care to be in his place, though I shall not stop envying him\\". \\"It is absolutely no matter whether I am going away or not going away\\". What is our man's plight really about? Does he know, do we know? Does Dostoyevsky know? Why the creation of such a \\"characterless\\" man? Throughout this novel we have the suggestion of rationality. But do we have a real context? Apart from himself, can we say that anything else exists? Meaning has been drained of vitality. Our man appears to be alienated as well as fragmented, self absorbed, and detestable. Things in themselves appear insubstantial, mere fragments of subjectivity. There are echos of other, more recent, books which appear to mirror the characteristics of this modern man's psychosocial dilemma. I'm referring to \\"The Minimal Self\\", \\"The Culture of Narcissism\\", and \\"The Master and His Emissary\\". I'm also reminded of Kekes' concept, \\"the dissolution of the evaluative dimension of personality\\" (Kekes, \\"The Human Condition\\") and Kernberg's concept of \\"identity diffusion\\" (Kernberg, \\"Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism\\")."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Guess my earlier education had been sadly short on more than one level.

The main character gives us many views on everyday people and their actions that should cause us, the reader, to evaluate our own understanding of the people who surround us. (Example: Why people will moan for days before seeing a dentist.)The writing is absolutely brilliant. Dostoyevsky does not seem to have created this character but instead pulled him from the street. The character was not one dimensional, an attribute that I found personally refreshing . The thoughts and emotions are complex and real and were constantly understated, adding to the impression that the book was written by the character himself, who lacks writing experience needed to capture these feelings.The main character views himself cut off and removed from society, rejected by all in nearly every way. He has become so obsessed with this notion that he has created this exact situation as a result of searching for justification of this impression. He has in fact created most of his own misery, and only continues to propagate more. Yet he seem himself as miserable and rejected and finds pride in this image. He imagines himself to be pitiful and also to be strong and fiercely independent as a result of his social isolation. He feels he poses a strength of spirit for being able to endure the loneliness and envisions himself as a martyr.This fuels his ego and he plans heroic acts in order to show the proof of his worth or to win attention and love. He however lacks the courage to complete the monumental self serving tasks he set before himself. Through a strange twist of logic these failures are also seen as something to be admired. It only makes him more pitiful and thus a greater martyr. When these failures are personally humiliating he retreats within in himself. Hating everyone and again fortifying his independence, claiming that all who depend on others are weak. Only to re-emerge more hungry for the affections of a companion.An emotional ebbing between pride of independence and ability to bravely endure the suffering quickly switching to the opposite pole of resenting people in general. Sustaining himself on the imagined praises or pity that he thinks would be lavished upon him if he were to be seen by others as he sees himself.A terribly tragic tale that emphasis the importance of perspective and removing one's self from a problem in order to perhaps gain a helpful assessment of it. The ideas and emotions presented give a haunting impression. The book should be read slowly and turned over in ones mind again and again."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"\`Notes From The Underground' is a formidable work of philosophy and of psychology, not to mention its worth as a novel. In the space of around one hundred pages, Dostoyevsky manages to expound theories on reason, alienation, suffering, and human inaction. The book's importance and influence on generations of writers cannot be over-emphasised; Sartre and Camus are only two examples of people who have been directly influenced by this book.The book is presented in two parts. Part one \`Underground' is written in the form of the nameless narrator's rambling thoughts on reason and his claim that throughout history, human actions have been anything but influenced by reason. Underground Man's charge is that man values most the freedom to choose to act in opposition to reason's dictates. Dostoyevsky's critique of reason then, although it demands attention and is somewhat difficult to follow, sets the philosophical foundations for the rest of the book.Part two \`A Propos of the Wet Snow' is much easier to read, as the narrator recounts three episodes which happened when he was fifteen years younger and working as a civil servant in St. Petersburg. The first considers an incident in which an army officer insults him and goes on to detail Underground Man's subsequent internal anguish at his inability to commit an act of retribution. The second episode takes place at a farewell dinner for an acquaintance named Zverkov. The narrator is utterly disgusted with the company in which he finds himself but despite this, he is unable - even though he desires it - to make them realise this. The third episode details Underground Man's brief, painful and emotional relationship with a prostitute.Dostoyevsky is refreshing in this book thanks not only to his incredibly powerful prose, but also for the intense but subtle way in which the stories reflect and indeed embody his philosophical theories. This dark and pessimistic portrayal of the nature of man may not sit very comfortably with many readers, however the ideas expressed in \`Notes From The Underground' are as relevant and worthy of deliberation now as I am sure they were in 1864."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Even though Doetoevsky's underground man perceives himself as a deep, conscious, brilliant man, he still knows that he is skeptical of every thought or feeling he might have. He tries to convince himself of being smarter than any body he encounters, but in reality he has a deep feeling of inferiority that ultimately manages to isolate him from people and society.The underground man never had any experiences of love or emotional relationship, thus he relies in his youth on literature and drama where he gets high expectations of ideal relationships and morals. However, real life interactions and relationships traumatize him with reality that he doesn't know how to accept.In his forties, the underground man doesn't crave human interactions or attention any more, or have passionate ideas about any thing like he did in his youth, and he knows no other way than anger and bitterness to deal with people. Even though his intimidating way of dealing with people brings him humiliation and pain, he still enjoys thinking that he is practicing his free will. Ironically, the humiliation he brings down on himself is empowering and satisfying to the underground man. As long as he has choice and free will, he is still alive and active like others, regardless of the consequences of the choices he makes.Whether Dostoevsky wrote notes from Underground as a scream against rationalism and utopianism, or if he was symbolizing his own alienation from the modern Russian society, he just did a great job. Every detail in the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"This is the first book of a series of novels that form Dostoievsky's \\"second period\\" works, which includes \\"Crime and Punishment\\", \\"Karamazov Brothers\\", \\"The Idiot\\" and others. Though a short novel compared to the ones mentioned, we can find here the seeds of many subjects Dostoievsky was to develop further in his subsequent works.The book is divided into two parts. In the first one, the main character -an obscure student whose name is not even mentioned- introduces himself as a sick and spiteful man. He makes a long diatribe against subjects such as free will, rationalism and romanticism. He attempts to explain his ideas of life and the quest of being, relating man with a piano keyboard: man does not want to think of himself as an instrument that can be played by a superior force without having the power to use his will; rather he has to demonstrate he is a human being with an inner and singular self and not just a piece that belongs to a bigger mechanism.In the second part, this troubled man engages in telling us his difficulties to relate to other people. Here the author brings some characters into the scene, whose principal role is to show the main character's incapability to interact in society. The scene in which he delivers a wordy speech to a young prostitute in a dark cubicle is particularly touching.Dostoievsky is great. What else may I say?."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"This is my third novel by Fydor Dostoevksy and I don't think I could rate it any less or more than the other two. All of his books seem to be landmarks in literature. All of them unique in thier own way. None of them can be overlooked. All of them are also way ahead of there time. And they are all not for the closed-minded 'logical' reader.Notes From Underground is one of Dostoevsky's shorter works, it is very intriging so you will find that you finish it very quickly.The first part of the novel offers little to no plot. It is basically just philosophical rambling from the first-person narrorator. Don't let the world, 'rambling' confuse you, this book is very serious and thought provoking.In the second part of the novel we are introduced to some characters beside the narrorator and we see the reason for the rambling in the first part of the novel.I think that most people who read Dostoevsky can relate to his feelings around other people. He is alone, he feels like people are judging him. People don't want him around, but he is too proud to admit any of this.The novel deals with how much we can know before it becomes dangerous. When we know too much we might find things that we do not want to know. Does this mean we should stop our search for truth? What if in our search we discover that there is no truth? This is a very thought provoking novel.I highly reccomend this latest translation, it is very easy to read, much better than the old translation of Crime and Punishment that I read. I am in fact considering re-reading these novels just because these new Translators do a very good job.Buy this book alongside Hunger by Knut Hamsun as they deal with a lot of the same ideas and were written very close to each other in a timeline.Now I will rate the book from A-F like I do in all my reviews:Character Devolpment: APlot: BThought Provoking: A++Suspense: AWith an overall grade of an A, this book will be one that I will definetly return too."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"I probably wouldn't have had the benefit of knowing this book if it weren't for this audio CD. It was difficult to start reading, but as with many of Dostoevsky's books when they are read out loud they really come alive. They are almost more theatrical as they are written than prosaic, in a way.Notes from Underground is considered the book that lays out Dostoevsky's philosophy for many of his subsequent books. I had read Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov. This background helped me to feel more comfortable with this book.You should also know that the women Lisa with whom the Underground Man (as he is called because Dostoevsky never tells us what his name is) spends some time with is a prostitute. This isn't very clear because writing about this subject at the time was considered taboo and shocking.George Guidall's narration was excellent, right on target for this character. I'll never forget his voice."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"This book is superior to Nausea. I hope that everyone gets a chance to read it. This is a crucial doctrine of 19th century despair and anguish and a facet of individualism. It shows a man who is agonized by his own hypersensitive self-consciousness. The story is of course riddled with Dostoyevsky's trademark contradictory piety and skeptcism, redemption through fallen souls, etc. It's not the story of a particular man but a vision of modern man and his need to go underground. Read this book and go underground with him!"},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"_This is the first book to accurately describe the mind-set and situation of the modern man. This is because the sort of 19th century man that Dostoevsky described here is modern man- the differences are only superficial. A Western European could not have written a book like this- he would have been too close to the problem, since western European rationalism is the problem. A Russian like Dostoevsky was still close enough to Feudalism and the land that he could feel in his bones that something was profoundly wrong._The \\"underground\\" writer of these tales is a man that has come to loath himself. He loathes himself because he knows that he is not a true human being in any sense. He knows that he is a cog in a machine. He is told that logic, rationalism, and materialism are everything. He has been told that he has no free will that everything is predetermined by natural laws and statistics. He has even been told that he is no more than an evolved ape, so even his religion has been stripped from him. All that is important is profit and comfort- and to serve the machine in his own minor soul killing way as a petty bureaucrat. This is what has convinced him that it is better to resign from society and live as a recluse. Far better not to contribute to the great, inescapable soul-killing system._But that is just it- Dostoevsky is making a point in order to forcibly shake his reader out of his or her complacency. He is trying to demonstrate the unnatural nature of a materialistic life lived neurotically and pettily from the head and not the heart. He is also trying to point out those events in ordinary life that hint at there being something more- things that cannot be described with a formula or a chart. Dostoevsky had found the truth in his deep mystic faith in God. This book was a wake-up call to put others on the transcendent path by demonstrating just how inhuman the modern westernized mind-set was._This is not an existential novel- it is a transcendent one. This book demonstrates what a hell results when you forcibly amputate the Holy from Holy Russia. It is what happens when you exile the sacred from all our lives."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Notes from the underground is a wonderful book that helps expand the mind into things one might never have challenged before. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys overanalysing ideas to the point that it hurts. If you do plan on reading this book, I recommend you read just a few pages a day so as to keep yourself fresh and not overloaded with stuff. All in all i htink it is a genious book, hilarious at parts as well, and it deserves a salute from me!"},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"For those readers who are interested in Dostoyevsky but aren't willing to commit to one of his more verbose works, this is a good one to try. The plot is classic Dostoyevsky but tends to read a bit easier. As with all of his works, be prepared to reflex on what you've read and even read certain passages repeatedly."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"A vivid depiction of the dark side of human nature, Notes is a great classic that perfectly evokes the feelings of isolation, despair, narcissism, and paranoia that continue to afflict the masses. Though very short, one feels on completing it that one has read a very profound book. It is one of the best and most essential short novels ever. Dostoevsky is known for stunning penetration into human nature, and his mastery showed here for the first time. Notes touches on many profoundly important issues: philosophical, religious, social, political, etc. Indeed, it was right at the heart of the era's prevalent intellectual modes and remains relevant today. It also works as a springboard for Dostoevsky's later, more ambitious novels. Part of the reason it works so well is that the narrator is so recognizably, touchingly, and pathetically human. Anyone who considers him or herself an outcast, who feels as if he or she has never been able to fit in, who is uncomfortable in social situations, feels morally or intellectually superior for unknown reasons, is overly emotional and susceptible to constant depression - or any such thing - will undoubtedly identify and sympathize. Another reason it works so well is the writing style. Far from traditional novel or documentary style, it gives the impression that one is reading a record of a person's private thoughts. We see the thoughts as they come to the character, not in any linear form. He may well be neurotic, psychotic, manic depressive, bi-polar, or egocentric - but is human nonetheless. This is a singular, profound, and important literary work of unique value that sticks a penetrating and insightful knife straight through human nature's heart. It is an essential read for all; even those who will despise it must deal with it, such is its importance and influence.It is important to realize that, like all Dover Thrift Editions, this is bare bones - only the text and a short headnote. Anyone wanting more will need to look elsewhere. The book has numerous contemporary, historical, literary, and philosophical references, many of which most readers will miss without help. However, Dostoevsky's genius shines brightly even in isolation; this edition was the first Dostoevsky I read, and it kindled a spark that has never died. One may want to move on to more deluxe editions, but this is an excellent place to start, especially considering the unbeatable price. The important thing is to read Notes in some form, and this will work well for many."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"A psychologically fascinating fiction in a fraction of the size of Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishment. Enter this man's psyche and examine his philosophy and perception of the world above the ground. Contradictions, self doubt, and wavering between introversion and extroversion make this a thought-provoking read, and an essential existentialist text."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Stark prose*, immediately accessible - Dostoevsky at his direct, and unflinching, best. This account goes a long way to help with my understanding/grasp of the difficulties encountered by some few of the more thoughtful of us who make their way in the daily life of this world of ours.* Unfortunately, the name of the translator used for this edition (Valde Books) is nowhere to be found. It's important to know, my opinion; and I want to know. Any help out there?-JL"},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"Word-for-word, perhaps the greatest work of fiction ever written. It embodies and reflects the dawn of modern sensibility, eternally wed to human passion. It is an incomparable evocation of the force of the unconscious, but without the scientific overlay that would make the unconscious seem somehow a manageable fact of life. In Dostoyevsky, nothing is manageable, and that is both terrifying and liberating."},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"....aunque cada obra literaria seria esta fundamentada en principios filosoficos y cada filosofia es una historia de nuestras luchas, esta obra es una mezcla perfecta de ideas entre los pensamientos del literato y del filosofo. anuncio de sus mas grandes y extensas obras, como son crimen y castigo y los hermanos karamazov. este antiheroe es una voz muy liberal para su tiempo y a veces fue incomprendido, pero todo aquel que desee leer a dostoievski y quiera adentrarse en sus obras deberia leer esta en primer lugar como una introduccion y ya tendra la mitad del trabajo hecho, la otra mitad consiste en lidiar con los nombres rusos que dan un poco de trabajo..

Certainly one of the most profound and revolutionary works in literature, the keynote to existentialism, and modernity. There was simply nothing like this book in literature before it came along( of course there were works similiar to it afterwards, since it was so influential, e.g., Ellison's homage to NFU &quot;Invisible Man&quot;).Dostoevsky's prescience blooms in this work, as this work foreshadows the fractured nature of the modern world.

As his \\"underground\\" condition replaces occupations with preoccupations, he becomes the acute spectator of his absent life, tormented by questions, and maddened by the diseases of excessive consciousness and morbid self-awareness.In his numerous emotional vollies, no one and nothing is sacred; his acquaintances, his whore, even his reader are attacked by this utterly detestable protagonist, if one can call him that. This anti-hero is not a figment of Dostoesvky's poetic imagination or penmanship, but rather an exaggeration of us furtively despondent readers. From this subterranean reality, our nameless anti-hero writes. \\"Let me out, kind people, to have another try at living in the world!...\\""},{"Title":"Notes From Underground","review":"I was looking for the Pevear/Volonkosky translation since I've enjoyed their other Dostoyevsky translations.

Someone had to turn this into English. After I'd ordered this I found the Pevear version elsewhere, read the first page (nice feature of Amazon) and wish I'd gotten that one. Ah well. It's an okay version and the general story won't change--but the style, verve, and wonderfully sly comedy of Dostoyevsky is captured so well by P/V that I will always wonder what I missed."},{"Title":"How to Know the Insects","review":"I bought this book for my summer Etomology class. It is a very helpful book when you are trying to identify insects, however some of the insect characteristics are hard to see in the diagrams compaired to the real insect. A disecting microscope is strongly recommended when useing this book, since most of the characteristics deal with segments on the legs or antennae, as well as wing veins. These structures hare very hard to see with the naked eye. If a mistake is made in classification it is easy to back track and find your mistake, becuase each step has the number of the previous step. This book also gives you a good description of the insect's charachteristics, habitat, and other usefull information to verify the insect being classified. With this book I was able to classify all of my insects for my collection. I did need some help from the professor and the proctor, however most was just to double check myself. I also used the Peterson's Insect Guide to double check my classification. If you are looking for a book to identify insects for a collection, I strongly recommend this one. However, if you need a book for quick identification in the feild, this isn't the best book for that purpose. For feild purposes use a insect feild guide."},{"Title":"How to Know the Insects","review":"I have owned a copy of this book for many years and consider it to be the best classification guide available for undergraduates and serious amatuer collectors. An index\\\\glossary provides hundreds of terms related to external morphology that can be memorized and the identification procedure is both simple and efficient. There are plenty of detailed illustrations.The only downside is that this book has not been revised in many years. It most likely contains errors, because systematics is an ever-changing field. Most of it is accurate, however, and any serious insect collector can compensate for the outdated information by visiting a public library or museum.This book is probably out of print.

This book is a great aid in identifying your incests."},{"Title":"The Coming of The Civil War","review":"To me, the dullest part of the Civil War began at Fort Sumter. The greatest deficiency of Ken Burns' celebrated documentary (enough to make it almost useless)is that he spent almost no time on the causes. I have always found the political maneuvering between North and South, between the two great parties(and within them as well), the occasions when secession and war almost happened, and the dramatic compromises that held off disaster to be essential for understanding the war and why it was fought the way it was. The political battles over the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Lecompton Constitution are more interesting to me than the dramas of Antietam, Chancellorsville or Gettysburg.Avery Craven was one of the so-called &quot;revisionist&quot; school of American historians, those academics who asserted that there was blame for the war on both sides, that condemned radical abolitionists and Southern fire-eaters equally. Although he may not have intended it, Professor Craven makes an even more interesting assertion. There were not two sides in this affair but three. The West(what would now be the Middle West)was a region with its own economic interests. And this region, for the most part, wouldn't have gotten all that worked up about slavery if its farmers could have gotten their goods to market. But Southern political ineptitude and indifference to Western interests alienated that region from the South and probably cost the South the war.All in all, an excellent history of the antebellum United States. Whether you agree with Professor Craven's ideas or not, this book is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Coming of The Civil War","review":"I believe it was Avary O. Craven who once said that in depth exploration of the social, political and economic factors which led to the war do not have \\"the entertainment value of harrowing tales of runaway slaves.\\" He was right of course. Readers will not find any moralizing in this book. That alone will make for a refreshing read. It's not easy reading - but then, understanding the various undercurrents that propelled America to this war isn't an easy thing. But if the reader perseveres, he will emerge with a better understanding of the event, and a realization that the drivel that contemporary historians (for the most part) peddle, is a simplified and dumbed down version of the facts, written, most likely, for a population that has itself been dumbed down."},{"Title":"The Coming of The Civil War","review":"MANY HISTORIANS SEEM TO RELEGATE AVERY CRAVEN TODAY TO A POSITION OF PRESENT IRRELEVANCE.

I FULLY AGREE. THIS BOOK GIVES A FRESH LIGHT ON THE MOST INTERESTING PERIOD OF AMERICAN HISTORY--THE ANTEBELLUM PERIOD. A GREAT BOOK WELL WORTH READING. sIMPLY LOOK AT THE TABLE OF CONTENTS."},{"Title":"The Coming of The Civil War","review":"This book is interesting in that it not only examines the key political issues of the antebellum period but also delves into the culture of the time, especially that of South. But the author's views are tilted toward those of the antebellum South. He goes to great length in describing the Southern plantation system with its incorporation of slave labor and compares it somewhat favorably with the industrialization and the \\"so-called\\" free labor of the North. In addition, the exaggerated Southern claims of social superiority seem to strike a chord with the author.A great deal of the book is consumed with describing the reactions and views of leading spokesmen and of various publications in the North and the South concerning major antebellum political developments. The question of the Mexican Cession and the Wilmot Proviso in 1846 moved the question of slavery squarely into the political system resulting in the formation of the Free Soil Party and talk of secession in the South. The Compromise of 1850 quieted some voices, but only until the next expansion of slavery.Interestingly, of all of the political crises of the mid-1850s where slavery was front and center, that is, the Kansas-Nebraska bill, the bleeding Kansas crisis, and the Dred Scott decision, the author claims that the Southern response was relatively moderate compared to the extremists of the North. Yet that moderation seemed to have evaporated with the John Brown raid at Harpers Ferry. And the Southern reaction to Lincoln's election the next year was beyond shrill and ultimately self-destructive.I think it is fairly obvious that this author regards the Civil War as occurring as a result of emotionalism and opportunism run amok. And despite the fact that the South was unwilling to honor the untainted election of a President and failed to comprehend that all of the conservative candidates together far outpolled the Republican, I believe that the author holds that Northern forces largely provoked the Southern secession and then were unwilling to accept that fact by offering some kind of compromise.This author fails to grasp, or at least state, that slavery and its ramifications were the great moral issues of the day. Of course, tremendous emotionalism was evoked by the issues. And those issues could not be simply managed or downplayed in the Second American Party system. Slavery was conceptually wrong for America and produced an unsustainable divide between two sections of the country. Emotionalism may have obscured that fact then and now, but it is superficial as an explanation for the Civil War."},{"Title":"Father to Daughter: Life Lessons on Raising a Girl","review":"I ordered this book for my husband.

In this primer on parenting, Harrison helps us remember some basic things that are very valuable.Some of the pages deal with advice on things that are your role as a parent. Others contain insights that will make readers smile in remembering events they have experienced in child rearing.Some of my favorite of the included 'lessons' are these:1. Take part in her life now. Don't wait until she's 15 to try to develop a relationship.2. Tell her from day one that she can accomplish anything.3. Be prepared to watch Walt Disney movies with her some 200 times. Each.4. Tickle her, play with her, give her piggyback rides. She's not breakable.5. Realize that as you shape her, she will shape you.6. Read to her often. Very soon, she'll be reading to you.7. Talk to her about what she wants to be when she grows up.Continally reinforce the idea that anything is possible.8. When she's old enough, sign her up for karate lessons. This is more for your sake than hers.9. Think before you speak. Even when you don't mean to, you can end up hurting her feelings.10. Take her out of town to somewhere she's never been at least once a year. This will develop her sense of wonder.11. Remember, teenage girls spend hours in their room doing something. No man has ever really figured out what that something is.12. There will be days when you think you've raised an alien. Those are the same days she feels she's being raised by one.13. Remember, it's a good thing if the boys in her life think you are slightly unstable.Frankly, I never would have bought this for myself. It's a very small, 'cutesy' looking book. It's just not the type of thing that attracts my attention. Fortunately, my wife saw it and bought it for me. It is a real little treasure."},{"Title":"Father to Daughter: Life Lessons on Raising a Girl","review":"I just happened to pick this up in a book store one day and loved it from the first page. It is a wonderful book filled with a short paragraph or even just one sentence on each page. Some make you laugh, some make you think and some make you cry. A perfect gift to get for a husband, son, uncle, brother, friend whatever. Will make the Daddy and Daddy's little girl bond even stronger!!"},{"Title":"Father to Daughter: Life Lessons on Raising a Girl","review":"At first, I thought this was a silly gift my husband received when I was pregnant with our daughter. I decided to take a look at it, and its such a beautiful book.

It claims to have life lessons on raising a girl and all I found was a collection of sayings. Some of them were good suggestions, but most were just sentimental \\"warm fuzzies.\\" Maybe this is all that some guys need to help them raise their daughter, but I have four and I need much more help than this book was able to deliver. Also, before you buy check the dimensions of the book. It is really small and each page contains about a sentence. It is really not worth the money you will spend on it. Sorry, but that's how I see it."},{"Title":"Father to Daughter: Life Lessons on Raising a Girl","review":"I received this book in the mail recently and read it in about 20 minutes.

I certainly don't agree with everything in here, but it's an easy, fun read and there are certainly insightful nuggets. If each of us were to write this book, it would have as many versions as writers. I feel sorry for anyone intolerant enough to condemn the book for not completely agreeing with their values and take on the world. As I mentioned, I don't agree with every point, but it obviously was meant to serve as an inspirational read for dads (and moms) who love their daughters and truly believe they can achieve anything they set out to do."},{"Title":"Father to Daughter: Life Lessons on Raising a Girl","review":"I got this for my husband as a cute little \\"Congrats on being a father\\" gift, but I never really read it, since, after all, it was for fathers. Our daughter is 3.5 now and found it, and I started flipping through it. I could not BELIEVE the extreme sexism throughout this book. In fact, you probably don't even need to read this whole review. Just click on \\"Search in this book\\" and read it for yourself and it will be pretty obvious.It's not just the constant comparisons of girls vs. boys and moms vs. dads that is bothersome, it's the fact that those comparisons are so inaccurate. Yes, there ARE legitimate differences between genders. But the differences he attributes to gender, such as sensitivity level and tastes in toys and music, are NOT solely gender based. For example, he writes: \\"Remember, if you yell at a boy not to play with a wall socket he'll either stomp off or do it anyway. A girl will cry.\\" I personally know boys who cry when yelled at and girls who get mad or do it anyway. Another nugget: \\"Mom will introduce her to classical music- you let her listen to the Beatles.\\" Good grief. How many women do you know whose favorite music is classical? That is my own mother's favorite genre, but the Beatles were also big favorites and I grew up listening to both. And my father plays classical recorder. BOTH of my parents introduced me to ALL KINDS of music. And we have done the same with our daughter.In addition, the author indicates that all girls will display the same type of \\"girly\\" behavior, and that this behavior is something subnormal that one has to learn to tolerate and accept. Like, \\"When you take her to the movies, be ready for her to take along five or six of her favorite stuffed animals. When fathers of boys look at you strangely, act as if her behavior makes perfect sense.\\" First of all, I've never seen any girl of any age with stuffed animals at the movies. Second, no normal father (which the author clearly isn't) would ever look at another father strangely because their child is carrying several toys around. Here's another: \\"She will want a pet. She will also want to dress her pet in costumes and take it for strolls in her doll carriage.\\" Why does he assume that all girls will do this? And why did he think it was important enough to devote a page to? Oh, I get it. It's because he assumes that all girls are the same and that other men are chauvenistic like he is and think that feminine behavior is really strange and aberrant.As I write this, ironically, my 3yo daughter is playing with a dinosaur and snake toy she got yesterday. When we got to the doll aisle she said, \\"No, mom, not the dolls.\\" She doesn't play with dolls much, just stuffed animals and figurines. And last I checked some boys enjoy playing with dolls and stuffed animals too (Christopher Robin, anyone?). I guess not in HIS family though! Another case in point: She took the aforementioned rather realistic snake toy with her into Home Depot yesterday and was waving it proudly at the big burly guy helping us. He seemed uncomfortable and told me, \\"I don't like snakes.\\"The author seems to think that a father will be surprised when his baby girl's diaper is \\"as challenging as any boy's\\" and \\"her screams will be as loud as any boy's.\\" As if men think that girl babies aren't going to poop or cry as much as boys because they are so delicate and dainty or something. If the author thought that before his daughter was born, I have to wonder if he's actually from the 50s and came to this decade in a time machine.The author writes as if the most important thing about your child is their gender. It's so sexist that the page that tells you to start saving for college seems out of place. Isn't it better for a girl to just marry a rich man?Most of the book reads like the examples above. The few times his \\"advice\\" isn't gender-based are just so simplistic that one certainly doesn't need a book to know it, like \\"sing to your baby\\" and \\"let her sleep on you.\\" Duh.It is so ridiculous I'm amazed this stinking pile of baby poop ever even got published. I mentioned the sexism to my husband and he said he just blew off that aspect of it as being wrong and tried to just look for the good parts. Hope he found some!"},{"Title":"Father to Daughter: Life Lessons on Raising a Girl","review":"After stumbling upon, at a relative's house, this collection of corny attempts to be witty and creative, I was shocked at how blatantly stereotypical and sexist this book was once I read it cover-to-cover.Although there were one or two cute trinkets, I particularly remember the following lines much more strongly:* Mom will introduce her to classical music- you let her listen to the Beatles* Remember, if you tell a boy not to play with the electrical outlet, he will stomp off or do it anyway. A girl will cry.* Cheer for her team. Even though they may be called the Pansies.* Teenage girls spend hours doing something in their rooms. No man has ever figured it out.* She may look cute, but her diaper can be as challenging as any boy's.There was also another about letting her mother have time alone with her, and one about protecting her from boys.In conclusion,Sure, this book is wonderful- if you live in the 50's......"},{"Title":"Father to Daughter: Life Lessons on Raising a Girl","review":"Contrary to what this book would have you believe intelligence, confidence, dependability, and problem solving are NOT gender specific. Nor are they absent from the female gender. Follow this book and fathers are certain to become an obstacle to their daughter's development of independent thought and healthy self esteem. Most of the books single statements are trite and unoriginal but the more disturbing ones reveals the author's (with highly unlikely name of Harry Harrison) many bias. Sexist: \\"Monitor her TV and movies. Or else she just might believe she should be sexually active or dangerously thin, experimenting with drugs or hanging our with rock stars.\\" Infantilizing: \\"Insist she go to bed at a reasonable hour. Teenage girls need more sleep than babies do.\\" Creepy, cultish and inappropriate: \\"Talk to her often about decision-making and sex. About peer pressure, about love, about romance, about God. You never know when it will be just the thing she needs to hear.\\" More disturbing is the basis of thought that a daughter is a weak and feckless being that is incapable of independent thought or action and should expect the world to use her as a doormat: \\"Sometimes (ok, many times), she may not know what she wants. Your job is to help figure it out.\\" Follow this book's advice and you will cultivate a helpless dependent for life. Repeated mentions of boyfrieds, makeup, and effete behaviors build up to the stunning conclusion that the father is the only person a girl can trust. As the daughter of a single mom and holder of a college diploma and post graduate degrees I am strongly offended by this point of view. It seems to be based in author's own distrust of women. I would never raise a daughter any differently than a son regarding these specific traits. My husband and I found the book so fundamentally flawed and mired in bias we threw our gift copy away."},{"Title":"Father to Daughter: Life Lessons on Raising a Girl","review":"I bought this book for my husbands first fathers day this year.

I bought this book because I have a one year old daughter and was searching for some insight on how to better bond with her as she ages.

The book is written on a middle school reading level and did not go into specifics about raising a daughter, it only gave very broad advice. I bought this book for only .46 cents and it was a waste of money. Since the book measures 6 inches by 6 inches I guess it will make a good paper weight ! Not recommended"},{"Title":"Addy Learns a Lesson - Hc (American Girl)","review":"For the first time in her life, Addy Walker attends school. Her mother (unable to read or write herself)gave her daughter a special dress to wear so she can successfully represent the family's rapidly rising expectations in Philadelphia.In addition to formal educational instruction, Addy learns that not every person is friendly and bigotry is not confined to white southerners whom she had escaped from in the first book (Meet Addy). For whatever reason, some other African Americans look down upon people trying to escape slavery and obtain their freedom.A classmate named Harriet openly pretends she is better than other classmates because her family has enjoyed freedom longer. The teacher's quick intervention reminds students in 19th century America that all African Americans are subordinated and freedom depends on each student working together inside their community. In this high pressure environment intra-communty attacks are not appropriate because all African Americans (including the attack initator) will be rendered vulnerable to discrimination.Thus, Addy practices her lessons by teaching her mother how to read using dough in their boarding house room. Possessing maturity beyond her physical years, Addy understands her mom also needs to read. In addition to increasing her employability this will enable the mother/daughter relationship to remain as the two live and work in Philadelphia. If only Addy knew how to read, the mother would become disproportionately dependent upon her own daughter for basic survival needs.The segregated northern schooling where Addy recieves the coveted education might be difficult to explain to some young people who had grown up believing the South only had the practice, but this title is another prize addition to the American Girls series.Examining American history through the eyes of a young girl, Porter reassures her pre-adolescent target audience things are not always supposed to be easily understood upon first encounter. The most endearing lessons have several moral and ethical angles."},{"Title":"Addy Learns a Lesson - Hc (American Girl)","review":"This is a wonderful story that brings a part of the past back to life. It is told from a view point that is not often heard from, a young black girl who was a slave and has escaped, but doesn't know how to read or write. It also tells a story of the hardship of a black family during this time and the story of friendship that applies to all races. I think the character Addy is one girls will enjoy reading about, I don't think boys will like it very much. The story is told in a way that children can easily read and understand. At the end of the book is a short description with actual pictures of life at that time for a young black girl and what school was like back then for black children."},{"Title":"Addy Learns a Lesson - Hc (American Girl)","review":"I Liked this book because a girl in my class did the same thing to me as Harriet did to Addy.

The first part delves into the broad knowledge base you'll need to acquire in order to do a good job in your chosen profession. Running a restaurant involves everything from accounting to cooking, dishwashing to equipment repair, and while you'll rely heavily on the advice and aid of professionals, you also need to know as much as possible on your own.No matter how early in the process you are, you'll find something for you here. Cannon describes business plans for restaurants, site choice, finding investors, hiring staff, managing risks, purchasing your equipment and materials, marketing, and so on. There's even a series of checklists in the appendices describing the things you should have done by certain periods before your restaurant opens.Whether you want to open a fast-food franchise or a fine dining establishment, this book has plenty of advice for you. It covers all the various restaurant-type options and the issues dealing with each. A large portion of the book deals with the operation of your restaurant, from the kitchen, to the dining room, to hospitality, quality, service, cleanliness, and even the serving of alcohols--whether you're talking fine wines or a bar.One of the book's strengths is its approach toward finding, keeping and coaching staff. Cannon strongly believes that the restaurant business is all about people--both your customers and staff--and that the best way to do a good job in these areas is to care about people.Finally the book deals with growing your business, optimizing your profits, and, if things go well enough, deciding when and whether to expand or open a new restaurant.The appendices include all sorts of calendars, checklists, forms, guidelines, and lists of additional reference materials.If I planned to open a restaurant I would read this book at least three times and make copious notes. I found myself nodding along frequently, impressed by the common-sense suggestions and Cannon's application of them to the specifics of the restaurant world. The writing style is engaging and interesting, including fascinating stories and entertaining tidbits to keep some very thick reading from becoming boring. Cannon has run many restaurants himself and consulted for many more, and his copious experience certainly shines through."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting A Restaurant, 2nd Edition","review":"This book was a little too basic for really offering much help in the restaurant business. I was hoping to read about a few examples or case studies but the book seems geared more for devising cutesy by-lines and adages for select basic points. Instead of comparison figures for food costs or start-up costs, the book describes clean-up hints that seem common sense. The author also devoted a large section to franchises and opening up second restaurants that seemed geared for McDonalds franchisees versus independent restauranteurs."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting A Restaurant, 2nd Edition","review":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Restaurant, 2nd Edition (The Complete Idiot's Guide)Starting with the back cover -- and where else would a book buyer start? -- I find The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Restaurant, Second Edition, both entertaining and useful. \\"You know it's a restaurateur-eat-restaurateur world out there.\\" The author, Howard Cannon, is the president of an international restaurant consulting firm specializing in startups and turnarounds. I am convinced that he knows his subject and wants to help people make it big in the restaurant business.Mr. Cannon serves us a big plate piled with--Smart marketing and public relations tips--The basics of purchasing and accounting--Customer strategies to increase return business--Simple ways to expand a customer base--Restaurant checklists, forms, and guidelines--Secrets for building and keeping a strong staff--The lowdown on creating a policy and procedures manualThis Idiot's Guide follows the basic format of any Idiot's Guide, and yet I find it more helpful than some others. How often do you eat out? Chances are that you have developed an interest in how the restaurants do things. A book such as this one is useful to help any public eater determine how things are supposed to be done. Since there is a need to get the most for every dollar, this book is good enough to tuck in a bag and read while sitting in an airport. As Chapter 2 says, \\"Everybody Eats.\\" While this book may appear to be suited to a limited audience, it has material of interest to everyone who eats in a restaurant.My individual interest in the subject of restaurant organization and administration is that my business partner and I review restaurants. We work to approach this business in an ethical and objective fashion. In Appendix C there is a Secret Shopper form. That form alone has made the book worth our purchase of it.Since Champ d'Oiseau, the first restaurant on record , was opened in Paris, France, in 1765, by a chef named Boulanger, there has been a growth in the number and types of restaurants throughout the world. The atmospheres vary. The author assures the would-be restaurateur, \\"If you are great, you will succeed.\\" Yet we know that people fail in this business at a dizzying rate.Anybody interested in opening a restaurant within the next year should rush to buy this book and follow the time lines in Appendix B.Because of all the wonderful suggestions about cleanliness, organization, and employee training, I would buy a copy of this manual and give it to all my habitual eateries if I had the money!

Personally, I have conducted professional assignments to Scapa on a number of occasions and, as a \\"guide,\\" I have yet to find this book lacking in any way. It also served another very important purpose in that it is a very good read.\\"Dive Scapa Flow\\" measures a little under 10\\" x 7\\" with a hard cover and comes from \\"Mainstream Publishing\\" of Edinburgh. There are 160 pages of narrative - all well supported by a large number of black and white photographs (most of which are historic), diagrams and maps plus a further eight pages of colour photographs in the middle. The book is well laid out. The first 2 chapters are devoted to historical events - the scuttling of the Imperial German Fleet and the incredible salvage operation that took place in later years, with the remainder of the book being dedicated to diving.1919 was a time when Europe was coming to terms with the revelation that \\"millions\\" had died on all sides during the carnage of WW1. The Imperial German Fleet had been defeated and was interned in Scapa Flow with a skeleton crew on each vessel. The German Navy itself was in complete disarray with lawful orders being ignored and workers co-operatives running most of the ships. This was a time when all sides awaited the outcome of the Armistice from which the final decisions with regard to the disposal of each German ship would come. Basically, the ships would be distributed amongst the victorious allied navies with the Royal Navy getting the lion's share - thus making the British Fleet so large as to be unassailable throughout the world. Despite his many difficulties, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter retained overall command of the fleet - and he had other ideas. Knowing he could rely on sufficient people on each vessel to carry out his final command, Admiral von Reuter ordered the German Fleet scuttled and that order was executed on 21st June 1919 - right under British noses.Rod Macdonald's account of those historic events is a fine pr&eacute;cis and most relevant to this book. The same comment applies to the following chapter describing the incredible salvage operation which explains why so many of the scuttled ships are no longer to be found in Scapa Flow.So, after two chapters of well-researched material and some equally excellent historic photographs, we now get down to the diving. This commences with an overview of what the diver can expect to find. All the ships are listed and this is followed by information on such important factors as; bye laws, visibility, seabed, equipment, photography, decompression and the various means of getting to and from each site.The scene is now well and truly set and it's time to get down to cases. In chapter 4, each shipwreck is fully described in excellent detail in which there are 4 elements; An historic photograph of each vessel, a sketch describing her attitude underwater, a painting which shows the entire vessel as she lies on the seabed and a narrative which not only gives the technical details of the vessel in question but also goes on to describe the specific diving conditions relevant to that ship.Of course, the wrecks of the Imperial German Fleet are not the only shipwrecks in Scapa Flow and the next 3 chapters are entitled; Alternative Wreck Dives, Diving the Blockships and Scapa's War Graves - all of which are self-explanatory. With a final chapter reserved for travel, accommodation and dive boat charters, this book is as complete a guide as one would hope to find.NM"},{"Title":"Dive Scapa Flow","review":"When people talk of ship graveyards, typically Truk Harbor comes to mind. Yet Scotland's Scapa Flow contains a number of sunken World War I and II British and German warships including High Seas Fleet units and HMS Royal Oak. Professional diver-author Rod Macdonald provides a fascinating travel guide/history to Scapa Flow's wrecks in this 1998 Mainstream Publishing release.The main part of DIVE SCAPA FLOW deals with the German High Seas Fleet who scuttled their ships in June 1919, the subsequent efforts to salvage those ships and diving on the remaining wrecks circa 1998. Macdonald also details other ships resting in Scapa Flow such as numerous blockships, the battleship Royal Oak, which was torpedoed and sank in October 1939, and the battleship HMS Vanguard, which suffered a disastrous magazine explosion and sank in July 1917. The last two ships are 'forbidden wrecks' with no diving allowed; they're classified as war graves. Lastly Macdonald also details the loss of the cruiser HMS Hampshire in June 1916 and the loss of over 600 officers and men including Lord Kitchener.Along with relating a great deal of fascinating history, Macdonald also discusses diving on the wrecks, their appearance, diving facilities/services, nearby motels, etc. Black and white and color photographs and diagrams of the sunken ships compliment the text; it's a very thorough and appealing package.Even though the book is a bit long in the tooth (1998), DIVE SCAPA FLOW is a fascinating and well-done travelogue/history to the history and ships of Scapa Flow. Recommended."},{"Title":"True Colours","review":"I very unique story that is beautifully written. I started this novel one afternoon and couldn't put it down until finished.

Intending to right the wrongs, TJ, with the help of two friends, proposes to bring prosperity back to the area by restocking the ranch and modernizing the packing plant. When TJ's prized horse becomes ill, a local veterinarian is called to treat the animal. The vet, Dr. Mare Gillespie, has lived in Meridianville for the past ten years and has seen the poverty caused by Thomas Meridian's withdrawal from the area. Like most of the native residents, she harbors a great dislike for the family, yet she and TJ are each intrigued by the other woman and a relationship develops. Together they discover love and friendship that endures through personal misunderstandings, a night attack on the ranch, and an ecological disaster that could destroy the town and surrounding lands.

How many novels do you read where the heroine starts out paralyzed? It's a very reaffirming story though to believe that you can find love even if you suffer from a terrible handicap. I think too many unknown relatives are popping up just to provide a story line, but the story itself is engaging. You'll like this book, but you'll have to be prepared to buy the sequel when it comes out to get the end of the story."},{"Title":"True Colours","review":"I found that the author's pulled you into the story from the very first chapter. The main characters are flawed people dealing with their everyday lives. This story shows that each person is indeed unique and that you should not judge others based on what your family is known for. The ending was not complete to me. I am hoping the reason for this is that another book is in the works. These characters can continue to keep me reading about them in other books. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to see love transform another human being into a happy person despite the difficulties."},{"Title":"True Colours","review":"This story is addictive. I loved it. I bought it as a fill in between other book releases and I loved it."},{"Title":"True Colours","review":"Again I am a fan of this series. If you like horses, Vets, and strong coporate types who hate to show their compassionate side this is for you."},{"Title":"True Colours","review":"Personally I like this book because it is very well written and it is easy to read. The story is pretty intrested and the characters are great. In this book you can also find informations about life of a handicapped person who's name is TJ. Her struggle with daily activity,her good and bad days,about her pain and dreams.She has great friends who make everything they can to make her happy and when her new friend and lover cames they all become family and care for TJ together. It is a great story for those who have to deal with any kind of situations in life. I recommend this book and the other part too."},{"Title":"True Colours","review":"I really enoyed this book. It is full of love, determination, loyalty, and hope. True Colours is a book full of strong women that face many adversities and some are faced with struggles that they will never be able to overcome. TJ Meridian is a woman that is battling not only a town that is sure she is like her father (S.O.B Meridian) but her own demons. TJ struggles with tragedies that have made her the woman she is today. She is a miserable and very unhappy woman until she has a run in with the fiesty vet, DR. Mare Gillespie. After Mare gives TJ a piece of her mind, it turns TJ's world upside down! Mare is a very driven woman and the only vet within the town's 50 miles. Love is not on her mind when she meets TJ. As we all know, life is subject to change with a blink of an eye. Erin Scott and her partner Paula Tanner are the other amazing women in this heart warming story. Erin and Paula are TJ's best friends and caregivers. They really look after TJ and help with her business affairs. Even when TJ is not the nicest person in the world, they are always right by her side. Friends through thick and thin! All of the chracters are likeable and real. If you are looking for a good romance...this is your book! True love and soulmates no matter what!"},{"Title":"True Colours","review":"I've read Nann Dunne before, but the collaboration with Karen Surtees has turned out a uniquely refreshing outlook on relationships.It was interesting to see the dynamics between TJ Meridian, Mare Gillespie and the folks living in Meridian, TX. How hate can turn to trust? How confrontation can turn into love? How friends stick together no matter what?Refreshing read with many eye openers on how life should be.I've already ordered my copy of \\"Many Roads to Travel."},{"Title":"Elementary Statistics (5th Edition)","review":"As an instructor, this is the only basic statistics book that I have found that the students actually used the book. The author does a good job of explaining the background of &quot;why&quot; we use particular procedures rather than focussing on only the &quot;how&quot;. He also incorporates easy step by step outlines of each procedure. The book is well organized, includes a multitude of problems, and includes a data CD. Untill I write my own, I'll use this one."},{"Title":"Elementary Statistics (5th Edition)","review":"It is a great book.It helps me with all my math homework. It's also very detailed and easy for me to follow."},{"Title":"Elementary Statistics (5th Edition)","review":"Not that I think things should be dumbed down or anything, but this book was too complicated! It made simple things more difficult than they actually are. I never read this book and still got an A in Statistics. Instead of reading this, I just went over each problem once with a friend or tutor.If this book is required, I guess you are stuck and have to get it, otherwise, don't buy it!"},{"Title":"Elementary Statistics (5th Edition)","review":"This book looks great when you're browsing throught it in a bookstore, but when it is actually examined, it is unclear and non-directional. I don't recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn Statistics. The examples are extremely long and drawn out, I contiuously found myself asking the question: what?"},{"Title":"Elementary Statistics (5th Edition)","review":"product was received in great condition, shipped and arrived faster than one of my prime orders"},{"Title":"The Front Of The Family","review":"This book caused me to lose a few nights of sleep - yes, because I didn't want to stop reading it, so I stayed awake to continue. I found the story delicously riviting, from beginning to end. It is too rare to read of the inner lives of this special subculture - Polish Jewish immigrants living in Australia. Oh, but these are not stereotypical Jewish immigrants preoccupied with suffering and the horrors of the Holocaust - these are vibrantly alive human beings, with sexual and intense, complicated interpersonal relationships and friendships. It's also a story of a middle aged assimilated Australian woman seeking out the personal mysteries of her recently deceased mother, paralleling against the backdrop of her own personal drama - coming to terms with her own sense of self and the changing nature of her own marriage, re-evaluating what she wants in her own life. Every person in her family and exended family plays a deep role. Yet, it reads so easily, so flowingly... Previously, I'd encountered some insight into part of the world of pre-WWII Jewish life, as *modern* assimilated intimate tales, only by reading certain of the novels and stories by the Nobel prize winner I.B. Singer (of no relation). After reading all the I.B. Singer I could get my hands on, finally comes \\"The Front of the Family.\\" I hope Ms. SInger is writing another one. I can't wait."},{"Title":"The Front Of The Family","review":"These are the stories we hear too rarely. The central characters are middle-aged Jewish women, whose complexity as people and whose struggles to come to terms with both the past and the present are rendered thoughtfully and naturally. The book is an engrossing read but not an easy one, challenging the reader to reflect on the role each generation plays in the lives of those before and after it, a question made urgent in these years as the last Holocaust survivors die. The characters in this novel attempt to come to terms with a past that is simultaneously too present and deliberately obscured: ultimately, finding the truth is not so much the point as understanding the reasons why lies are told, an understanding which makes living honestly in the present finally possible."},{"Title":"How to Make Money with Your Camera (The New Photo Series, No. 2)","review":"This was probably a good book in 1975, however, it is just too out of date. The pictures in it are not that hot to start with. There may be a good idea or two in it but I would look at other more recent offerings."},{"Title":"Mermaid's Gaze, Vol. 3 (Mermaid Series)","review":"This manga is not for children under 13, if you ask me. It is violent and macabre. The stories would probably be traumatizing to a little kid. I thought they were strangely enchanting, though. (Not in a pretty fariy tale way!) This manga contains two stories; Mermaids's Gaze and Mermaid's Mask. Mermaid's Gaze was my favourite of the two. It had more plot and more purpose in action. The second, Mermaid's Mask, was good too. It was just a little more gruesome and weird, with a woman who has eatenthe flesh of a mermaid and gains a painful scar from its poison, forcing her to cut of her face and switch for others. That's kinda icky, ya know? The first story has to deal with an homicidal manic who ate the mermaid's flesh and has become immortal. But there is something he wants more than immortality; a mysteriously life-like doll! And he'll kill to get it. Both stories are, of course, staring our two favourite immortal lovers: Mana and Yuta, who risk themselves in their travels to help those affected by the poison of the mermaid's flesh. Very good artwork by Takahashi-sama and thrilling, hard-to-put down plots! Great for any manga lover or anyone willing to read something new!"},{"Title":"Mermaid's Gaze, Vol. 3 (Mermaid Series)","review":"The third of Rumiko Takahashi's mermaid volumes is &quot;Mermaid's Gaze.&quot; Her undying not-quite-couple Yuta and Mana return, encountering more twisted immortals and macabre problems, in the darkest and bloodiest of Takahashi's fantasy stories.In &quot;Mermaid's Gaze,&quot; an old woman is forced to kill a young man over and over, only to have him turn up alive every time. Yuta recognizes the man -- Shingo, a rich young psycho who died with his sister Akiko long ago. But actually, they ate mermaid's flesh with differing effects. Now Shingo is immortal, and Akiko is still alive, trapped in a living doll's body. Now Shingo is trying to find and kill his sister -- because so long as she is alive, he is pursued by a horrifying vision...In &quot;Mermaid's Mask,&quot; Yuta and Mana come across a little boy called Nanao who escaped from a moving car. When Nanao takes some &quot;medicine,&quot; his scrapes instantly heal, and the immortal pair suspect that he's like them. But the real truth comes to mind when they learn that the boy's mother has kidnapped him from her own son -- and that because of the mermaid's flesh, she can tear off her own scarred face and replace it with another...Don't expect humor and lightness in Takahashi's Mermaid Saga. There's the occasional moment of dry humor, like Mana constantly referring to Nanao as &quot;squirt.&quot; But overall it's even more violent and gruesome than the other Mermaid stories, such as when Nanao's &quot;mother&quot; skins her own face, though Takahashi keeps it tastefully shadowed.Mana and Yuta have changed a little over the course of the series -- Yuta is a little happier and less haunted, and Mana has become less clueless. They mesh well together, although they are not explored quite as much in this volume as in the previous two. And supporting characters -- like the insanely possessive mother, or the evil Shingo -- are chillingly well-drawn.Things get nasty and bloody in the third excellent volume of Takahashi's Mermaid Saga. &quot;Mermaid's Gaze&quot; is a good horror-fantasy read -- just don't read it after dark."},{"Title":"Mermaid's Gaze, Vol. 3 (Mermaid Series)","review":"I read this and my first thought was: Whoa, Takahashi wrote this?! This is a departure from her normal, light romantic comidy into something rather spooky...I enjoy all of her works and this one was no exception. Delightful and surprisingly wicked, this book kept me awake, and wanting more."},{"Title":"Mermaid's Gaze, Vol. 3 (Mermaid Series)","review":"She had made Yuta a promise to meet him in the Red Valley. If he had come, she wouldn't have died waiting for him. Now that she was resurrected by some guy who thinks he can control her, Mana struggles to keep her head on her shoulders as they struggle to the Red Valley for rescue!"},{"Title":"Mermaid's Gaze, Vol. 3 (Mermaid Series)","review":"This third instalment in the mermaid series is a bit shorter. I still enjoyed it, but it may not interest someone who hasn't read the others."},{"Title":"Mermaid's Gaze, Vol. 3 (Mermaid Series)","review":"Mermaid's Gaze was a good book though it is somewhat gruesome. There is a lot of blood shed and it contains some violence(especially when they kill lost souls). Over all, it is a great book if you like the other Mermaid Series books."},{"Title":"Mermaid's Gaze, Vol. 3 (Mermaid Series)","review":"This was a pretty good book. I'd recomend it to anyone looking for a nice fantsy story with a little horror mixed in for good measure. However, if you don't like The Highlander television show or movies, you probbaly won't like this either. On the other hand, if you do like The Highlander, you'll probably love this."},{"Title":"Mermaid's Gaze, Vol. 3 (Mermaid Series)","review":"This is the best book I've ever read! Even though I've only read one, it is by far the best in the world. The way the author writes it, you never want to put it down. Inu-Yasha, I've read volume 10. There are some things I still don't understand but that goes with that I've not read them all yet. My friend, introduced these series to me and I've become infatuated with them."},{"Title":"Aristocratic Liberalism: The Social and Political Thought of Jacob Burckhardt, John Stuart Mill, and Alexis de Tocqueville","review":"This book is about the shape of intellectual perceptions in an era which was much more unsettled than the present, with preparation for a major war dominating the form of politics that were commonly perceived as getting along by going along. The index, pp. 215-228, covers a range of topics, and is good on the correspondence and works of Burckhardt, Mill, and Tocqueville, the major writers on the political situation of their era that form the basis for this book. The notes, pp. 167-206, are as expected for a book which began as a doctoral dissertation at the University of Chicago. Note 5 on Chapter one admits, &quot;Burckhardt left hundreds of pages of lecture notes on the Revolution, but his own opinions are so enmeshed in unattributed quotations and paraphrases that determining from the notes which thoughts are his has proved impossible.&quot; (p. 169). Reading the text of ARISTOCRATIC LIBERALISM with an eye on the notes in the back soon leads to sources that are from multiple authors. Note 33 is pretty clear that it is setting up a context. \`For a few of many references, see Burckhardt . . . See also Mill, &quot;De Tocqueville on Democracy in America&quot; [II] (1840), CW, 18:167; Tocqueville, L'ANCIEN REGIME, OC, 2, pt. 1:47, 53;' etc. (p. 170). Note 34 cites both Tocqueville and Burckhardt in support of the statement, &quot;The result was its destruction and the encouragement of a passion for unity and uniformity, for the elimination of special privileges and of independent groupings within society.&quot; (p. 16).This book was published in 1992, long before 9/11/2001 became the dominant symbol of destruction that is such a contrast to the situation faced by Tocqueville, Mill, and Burckhardt due to &quot;the social and cultural leveling carried out by the Old Regime gradually weakened and even destroyed all the bonds that had formerly connected individuals in a society of orders.&quot; (p. 16, citing note 33). This situation was taken seriously, but associated with &quot;Individualism, in this negative sense, was intimately connected with political centralization. The destruction of political liberty--that is, of a political system based on local self-government--was the worst result of the Old Regime in Tocqueville's eyes.&quot; (p. 17). Calling a belief in any established order ARISTOCRATIC LIBERALISM, as this book does over and over, is almost quaint. Consider the choices faced by intellectuals of that time. &quot;Too many of the ideas of the Revolution and the Enlightenment could easily lead to despotism, whether by a party or by a military dictatorship, for the aristocratic liberals to be comfortable.&quot; (p. 33). Perhaps we who regularly demonstrate and vote against such dictatorial tendencies have escaped the need to confront such fears, now that society is organized mainly for work and pleasure, so that now, the only form of order more important than entertainment values is the form of corporate hierarchy which people expect to submit to on the job.Chapter 2 of ARISTOCRATIC LIBERALISM, with its emphasis on the hegemony of the middle class, the commercial spirit, stagnation, and mediocrity, comes close to a description of the current situation, though it doesn't consider how popular the link of home entertainment could make such modern adaptations as movies and sports, typically ersatz activities which create the illusion that localities have some grasp on the attention of the people living in a particular area. On a national level, it is easier to believe that those carrying out policy are not quite following orders as much as they are following Donald Rumsfeld, an old man who could be replaced any minute, like the Secretary of the Army, who didn't have to give up his job because of anything he did at Enron. He just submitted his resignation anyway, quite recently, when he found out who didn't want to see him around anymore. If anything, we have advanced from aristocracy to a *throw the bums out* mentality that is likely to be applied with little or no link to reality, whenever the majority finds itself hurting. Chapter 3, &quot;Despotisms: The State and Its Masters,&quot; tries to consider the dangers of Public Opinion, Suffrage, the Prussian Constitution, Socialism and the Fear of Socialism.Chapter 4 is on &quot;Modern Humanism: The Values of Aristocratic Liberalism.&quot; A theme of much of the book is that no one took the side of the aristocrats for their sake; they were merely valued because they were not perceived as being pawns. &quot;On the grand scale, diversity within a culture played a parallel role to the diverse character of human nature and particular individuals. A specialized society which allowed expression to only one aspect of humanity was repugnant for the same reason a purely one-sided specialized individual was: it was not fully human.&quot; (p. 104). &quot;Burckhardt's Renaissance man was no example of calm balance and symmetry, in classical fashion, but of powerful, even demonic diversity of talent. As such, the Renaissance was in this way too the beginning of modernity for Burckhardt.&quot; (p. 105).Chapters 5 and 6 still cling to the time frame of 1830-1870, in which &quot;the priority many liberals put on preserving private property did not make them conservatives or reactionaries, at least not by choice, although when sufficiently frightened by the specter of socialism they tended to run for the authoritarian government, as Tocqueville lamented.&quot; (p. 141). Liberals in 2003 are still frightened enough of being called liberals to have much to say when confronted with long-term trends that could wipe out the prosperity which they claimed as a result of their policies in the 20th century. Liberals must be used to reading insults by now, but I'm not sure it will do them any good to read more of the type this book contains. &quot;One element of an exclusion principle is contained, as I have noted, in the statement that liberals are not democrats, and that anyone who believes in immediate universal suffrage is not a liberal.&quot; (p. 140)."},{"Title":"Aristocratic Liberalism: The Social and Political Thought of Jacob Burckhardt, John Stuart Mill, and Alexis de Tocqueville","review":"Kahan is obviously one of those so-called historians who disregards the particular elements of individual nations histories,which make their growth and development somewhat different than other nations, by imposing a broad theoretical framework on his subjects.I can imagine his poor students struggling with notions of how in the world do I explain all of human history in Burckhardian terms. Kahan is not a historian; he is a social theorist with few insights concerning the actual \\"currents of social change\\" within individual nations or nation-states that explain their development."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"The fact that this book ( and the earlier, but equally brilliant, Radix ) is out of print shows just how far the author is ahead of his time. Like the Gnostics before him, the author recognizes the power of myth in telling us things about ourselves that our everyday mundane lives fail to reveal. If you get this book, keep it, because you will want to read it again and again. This is one of those amazing stories that seems fresh in every telling."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"I love this book. I read it years ago and forgot the name of the book, the author and only now do I realize it was part of a series of books, and yet I have never forgotten the story. I think for me the most powerful part is how limited humans are relative to the Tryl (a species on Earth that evolves to an intelligence and grace greater than humans 1 billion years after we kill ourselves off) and yet we keep on, going on. Attanasio gives us the big and little of humanity sometimes within the same sentence. I read a lot of science fiction and generally the harder the better but Attanasio, like David Zindell's Neverness series, is an exception to the rule. There is enough \\"hard\\" science, like Gai's jumping up from basically the zero point dimension into a dimension much less dense and at much lower energy, to be fascinating in its own right. Another great book it reminds me of -- the Oddessy. The relationship between Gai and Ned O'Tennis (the fighter pilot) is very similar to that between Athena and Oddyseus. All in all, a great read."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"The last legends of earth is a wonderfully fantastical story were the classical limitations of time and space are broken. Aliens of the future interact in a bid for god-like supremacy long after the civilizations of man have been lost in the dust. Humans become the fodder for spider-like beings and a battle for human freedom ensues. The worlds Attanasio describes are imaginative and timeless. This is a story is a classic Sci-fi adventure but also has retains a sense of humanity, love and the human spirit. This is one of my favorite books by the author; I also recommend his Arthurian series."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"Attanasio has spoiled me. Even since reading Radix in 1984, I've been hooked. No other author comes close to conjuring the images that Attanasio creates in his work. Last Legends of Earth is simply one of his best."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"I can take it from the book cover &quot;as complex and spellbinding a bit of science-fiction storytelling as I've ever come across&quot;!..SO TRUE..I'm reading this for the 5th or 6th time and the depth of the story, &amp; the images the words create in my mind are simpy astounding!...How in the world can someone even think of all these things, let alone in write them all in one book. WHERE ARE THE OTHER NOVELS IN THE RADIX TETRAD!!!!"},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"It is difficult to describe how good this book is. The concept is mind-blowing, drawn from the fuzzy edges of quantum physics, yet the human characters are real and ordinary, trying to live their lives out caught up in a beautiful but unfair and cruel world in which they were never meant to live. As far as world creation goes, there is nothing like Chalco-Doror, not even in Attanasio's other works, but it is not the invention and the imaginative flair that is the best part of Last Legends, it is the quality of the writing. No-one in sci-fi (or beyond) writes like him. His style is brilliant and baroque, defined by a pure artistic force that overwhelms the reader, and forces you to be inside the book. Reading this book WILL make your life better! It should have won awards by the bucket-load- how this can be ignored while the likes of Orson Scott Card get recognised is beyond me..."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"There is only one other book which is of same calibre as this one - and that is &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. &quot;Last legends of Earth&quot; melds complex subjects such as creation, civilisation, decay and time-travel into a stunning, haunting piece of literature that is impossible to forget. What other worthy books of sci-fi only manage to hint at, this book provides in copious quantities from start to finish."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"There are more original ideas in this single volume than found in ten average Sci-Fi novels. A.A. Attanasio is simply one of the most brilliant and talented writers ever. Though it is the final book of a series, &quot;Last Lengends of Earth&quot; can be read and appreciated alone on its own merits. A rich and broad tapestry of human values set against truly alien worlds in a far, far distant future."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"I just wanted to say that I though the storyof the last legend of earth is amongst the most compeeling I have ever read. After reading this book in Israel in 1995 I have spent three years trying to find another by him"},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"I've read this book over 5 times, and I still find something new everytime. Time travel, aliens, other realities, this novel has it all. Humanity is recreated from it's DNA and brought back to life along with EVERY other species that ever lived on Earth. I cannot say enough about this book! READ it! If you love sci-fi this one cannot be passed up! Attanasio's poetry helps move the story line along, and in some places, makes the novel. I'll leave you with this example from the start, where the being about to return humanity to life after billions of years, ponders her actions.&quot;Plucked whole from the stride of oblivion, you spirals of ascension shall climb again into flesh- and your black silence shall unwind into light.&quot;"},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"I want to add to the positive reviews. I don't write glowing book reviews as often as I should, since it often seems that the authors are being piled on with praise, but here, given the relative obscurity of the title, I want to add my voice. Yes, from time to time, the author's use of language clangs on my ear but his prose is ambitious, to say nothing of his unearthly ability to plot a story. This story ranks as one of my all-time favorites. I will return to it every decade. This is about the highest praise I can give a book."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"This book simply blew me away with its audacious imaginative content. Extremely recommended by anyone who is looking for something different in science fiction. Though a little inconsistent some of AA Attanasio's other novels are recommended as well, such as the loosely linked \\"Radix\\" and \\"Centuries\\"."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"In my opinion one of the all time science fiction classics,along with Radix.You can skip the other two of the quadralogy.The story and the science are top notch.attanasio at the top of his game.I recommend this to all science fiction buffs and a great introduction to the work of Mr.Attanasio."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"For sheer imagination, this book is without peer. The story is vast and compelling, spanning centuries and a myriad of ideas. No other book comes close in terms of the imaginative ideas, not even &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; or &quot;Dune&quot;. A.A. Attanasio's mixture of hard sci-fi and epic quest is also compleeing. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good science fiction."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"Every time I see this book on it's shelf, I am drawn to it. Nowhere have I seen, or heard of, a more fantastic literary work. I have tried endlessly to find the other books in the series, (In Other Worlds and Arc Of The Dream), in bookstores, so that I may know the whole story. I can only say, try to find these books yourselves, as if your life depended on it. it's that good!"},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"The characters are intense, the events go beyong imagination and Attanasio makes this book something to remember. The way the scenes change and intersect is truly a sign of the author's genius. The struggle of the characters is presented in such graphic detail that it invites you to crawl inside and live with the characters in their world."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"This, without doubt, is a movie waiting to happen. The scale, the dizzying scenery, the torment, the sheer concept spurs the imagination and stimulates the mind. From the darkness and gigeresque locations of the evil zotl, to world creating machines - and a whole solar system engineered as bait for a trap. Attanasio propels you forward and backward in time, covering thousands of years in a breath, yet maintaining a single plot thread throughout. One of those few books which gets read again... and again... just for the thrill of it, and just to go there - one more time."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"......except the other volumes of the Radix tetrad. Although hard to find these books are must for anyone who enjoys metaphysical SF."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"Even after the fourth time read, this novel still thrills me again and again. An amazing mixture of hard sci-fi, action-adventure, quest, and love story, I highly recommend this book along with the rest of the Radix Tetrad. My only regret is that the author doesn't write more!"},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me a bit of Lord of Light but with believable science. This was, I believe, the fourth book of the Radix tetrad. Attanasio wanted to write a book based on each of the dimensions and time was the final one. What was interesting was his science, it's hard to make a novel about time travel and have it make sense on a technical level, but I found this novel quite plausible.He writes in a lyrical manner, almost mythical in nature. It was pleasing, but left little in the way of characterization. The book follows many stories (since it encompasses such a huge timeline) and that also left little room for character development. However, my biggest knock against the book was the last 100 pages. I felt the book climaxed too early and just kind of fizzled out in the end.Overall, though, a very solid outing. I strongly recommend the book and will be trying others by this author."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"This book is simply one of the best. Nothing I have ever read in all of the 500+ books I have consumed (at least half being sci-fi) has come close to the depth and entertainment of this book. Not only does it entertain, but this is one of those few books that truelly makes you think. The sheer scope of the epic is unbeleiveable. It goes through 2 very different primary species on Earth, a group of beings that literaly eat the pain of lower races, an aloof group of beings from another reality out for revenge, it goes on and on. Throughout it all, the central thread is humanity itself.When you finish reading this book, you won't put it down and pick up another. For days at least, you will just sit back thinking about the book saying &quot;wow that has heavy, but SO great&quot;. It is unparalleled at what it is, one of those small genre of Sci-fi books all by its self. The end of time/universe/etc book. Besides the central plot of the book, and all the many subplots, the story actually strives to tell something in its completness and complexity. The book shows the unstoppable power of the human spirit, and humanity as a race's unwillingness to give up or surrender. Infact, at several points thoughout the book, the Rimstalker actually handycaps humanity against the high tech Zolt, fearing that humans would prove too difficult of prey. That would cause the solarsystem sized trap to be unsucsessful.In summary, simply a beatiful master peice, long neglected. Honestly, I have no idea why this book is not considered one of the great &quot;must reads&quot; of the science fiction world. If you ever see a copy, BUY IT because this great (and unfortunately rare) book is out of print. Enjoy it while you can. One for the ages."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"As a rule I will not touch Fantasy and this one had several elements of fantasy - the ridiculous, unpronouncable names, the wild beasts, castles, etc But it was packed with science fiction ideas - indeed, it was a mesmerizing, visionary work that seemed written in an exalted, transcendent state.First of all, the premise was startling. To reassemble living creatures that had been dead for 2 billion years from traces of burned DNA was just so...original. And what made such an impact was how &quot;human&quot; our makers turned out to be and what literal devils the spider foes were. There has never been a more sinister enemy, none more horrifying (the slasher monsters look tame in comparison). For once, the author does not attempt to show understanding or concern or empathy for such evil creatures but treats them like the unimaginable horror they are.The love affair was wonderful as was the story of the female explorer (the alien) who came to not only understand but empathize and finally side with humanity. The understated character of the story was the captured school teacher who alternated between moments of temporary memory and sorrow and excruciating torture. The novel was a grand experiment that succeeded mightily."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"I've just finished this book, and fireworks are still going off in my head. I've never been more swept up by a work of literature as I was by this. The author delivers a book that covers 7,000 years of history, billions of years after Earth's sun goes nova. This is the story of humanity's second chance, under the most unlikely and mind-blowing cause. It won't let you go, from beginning to end. Totally original and mind-blowing. Filled with philosphy about life, death, and time, this is one of the most uplifting sci-fi action adventures ever written.-- JJ Timmins"},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"In my opinion, this is (along with the first book in the Tetralogy, Radix) one of the finest sci-fi/fantasy novels written in the past 30 years. It's a rollicking good time, with good vs evil, heroes and villains, interesting scientific concepts, a romance that even manly men could appreciate, and a tempo that speeds up and slows down at just the right times.Heavily influenced by Lovecraft, Attanasio writes stuff that is not intended to be the joy of English majors or grammar prudes but is deeply fascinating and tells great, highly imaginative stories. This book is no exception. If character is the end-all and be-all of literature to you (ugh!) and story and plot are less interesting to you, then you may not find most of Attanasio's work to your tastes, although his characters are certainly believable. Certainly in LLoE there are some highly interesting characters to add to a mind blowing story that spans billions of years.After having read the original book in the tetralogy, Radix, when it came out so many years ago, and being so impressed by it, I was disappointed by the next two books in the series. They were interesting but lacked stories that sucked you in. Not so with LLoE, which is a page turner of the highest order. I don't think you'd have to be a sci-fi fantasy buff to appreciate it, but if you are it's one of the best. It certainly has one of the most evil races of monsters in ALL of literature, the zotl. If you can read about them and not get the creeps, you should probably be in an institution somewhere.In fact, if all you read of the tetralogy were Radix and LLoE, you would be well served, but you might want to read the others for the sake of completeness."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"Tolkien for the sci-fi genre; that about sums this one up.

You really should make an effort to find and read this book.To whet your apetite, this is an excerpt from the intro (an &quot;Instruction Manual&quot; for humans who find themselves in the planetary system of Chalco-Doror): &quot;Two billion years ago, it [the Sun] blew up, and the Earth was blown apart with it...The exploding Sun shattered the Earth and cast the hot debris into the cold darkness of the void...A few thousand years ago, an intelligent being from a reality we had never suspected found our dust.

And not just our bodies. You remember Earth because your consciousness, which is in fact a wavepattern of light emitted by your brain, was retrieved from the vacuum, where it had been expanding at the speed of light since you died...The alien is not a spiritual being...The truth is, this being regenerated you to serve as bait for yet another alien intelligence, its enemy, a species of sapient, winged spiders called zotl.

I read just about anything, from Horror, Sci-Fi,historical and thrillers.

By the time I finished the book I realized that it was realy a love story. I could not believe that I had endured a story of lost and gained love.The bad guys in this story are the most evil villans ever to come across in any format. Darth Vader and Satan have nothing on the Zotl. Keeping someone alive for a thousand years in overwelming agony so they can feed off of the endorphins is just...mean.The idea of a whole solar system being set up as a trap and humans as bait was fantastic.

I had never heard of the author, but I noticed that they were smoothly worn without sharp corners. They seemed to have been kept lovingly. I took a chance on not just one, but them both. They made me a life long fan of Mr. Attanasio. The last book of his I read was \\"Crow, The: Hellbound\\" which had no science fiction at all, but the biting description of Hell and its demons was equal to his earlier works.Now I have read \\"In Other Worlds - A Radix Tetrad Novel\\" from the library, which one could feel was a dress rehearsal for \\"Legends,\\" which is not as complete, but still satisfying. I only need to read \\"Arc of the Dream - A Radix Tetrad Novel\\" to complete the series. I will have read them out of order as I've found them.I have to agree with everything James Donnell's favorable review covered regarding \\"Last Legends of Earth.\\" I haven't read it for 20 years now, But reading Mr. Donnell's comments brought it back to me so forcefully I shed a few tears thinking about the story. It is one of the greatest science fiction books ever written. I loved it as a adult like I loved Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\" in middle school. A.A. Attanasio affects me like \\"The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition\\" did in the fantasy category when I was in high school. They were both worlds in themselves that a reader develops an emotional attachment to, and like Tolkien's masterpiece, I consider it to be an almost impossible act to follow. I hope I live to see it brought to life on the big screen, or even as a television series. I deserves a wider following than just us readers."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"I'll put it simply this way, I have read hundreds of Science Fiction books and I have kept exactly ten, this being one of them and probably my favorite of all time. The only other novels I've read in the past fifteen years that have captured me so completely were Ilium and Hyperion by Dan Simmons. Still, this is probably my favorite of all time. The sheer scope of the story is amazing and the many characters drawn out distinctly are impressive. Add to that one of the all time best villainous races ever imagined, a truly alien yet human like central character, landscapes from the microscopic to the gargantuan, the rebirth of the human race, the rebirth of another race from Earth. Well, you get it, it draws you in and starts you thinking about the universe it creates. A very gifted writer and very much under appreciated.

If you liked Radix, you will love this book.

I'm very picky about the science in my science fiction, and this author, while coming up with an interesting and perhaps plausible premise, misuses scientific terminology in a way that makes it hard for me to suspend my disbelief. But the most egregious offense, in my opinion, is the frequent and blatant misuse of language in general. A phrase like \\"in the crapulous shadows\\" is a good example from the book -- \\"crapulous\\" means \\"frequently overindulging in food and alcohol\\", resulting in a phrase that makes no sense. I run into this about every other page or so. It was so appalling that I almost stopped reading, but now it's really quite funny, and I'm finishing the book just to see what other crazy phrases he can come up with.The characters are minimally developed, and the storyline seems thrown together, as if twists and turns arise not out of any character-driven motive, but out of the author's wish to just keep coming up with random cool stuff. And the extremely florid and often misused language tends to jolt me out of any semblance of getting truly involved in the story. But if you like that sort of thing, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","review":"A disorienting story, much too contrived. A patchwork of events taking place in both dimensions, space and time. Definitely confusing and surely inconsistent. Consequently, when the protagonists (and the author) are stuck in jeopardy somewhere or somewhen, something or someone appears out of the blue to get them (and him) out of their predicament. I must confess I didn't understand all of it... and I didn't seek to do it."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"Admittedly I err in posting this review. After all, I didn't even become &quot;literary&quot; until I read James Merrill for the first time in 1992, late in his career and well after the world of letters had recognized and honored his life's work. His writing led me to Dante and Milton and eventually to a broad sweep of modern poets. It might lead you there as well.Alison Lurie, on the other hand quickly establishes her credentials in &quot;Familiar Spirits&quot; as both early, close friend of Merrill, and established member of his literary circle going back over forty years. Who am I to question her re-casting of the poet I know only through luminous verse and conversations with the gods, as a mere mortal? She knew the man. It was she, Lurie reminds us, whom he called, even in his sixties, to weep about a quarrel with his lover. She called him Jimmy.James Merrill's poetry seemed so often to be glancingly autobiographical... the people and places (and absences) in his life were a substrate upon which he grew some startling and wonderful poetry. But it was always only refracted autobiography. One wondered at the life itself. Yet, during his lifetime, Merrill rarely obliged with more than the slightest bits of extra-poetic reflection.When Merrill died in 1995 many readers mourned the fact that we would be offered no more glimpses of that life, which had come to illuminate our own in surprising ways. Perhaps, had he lived, his admirers would have eventually, greedily, consumed him. Instead, into the vacuum of that terminated story, came this insider view - a delightful prospect. Reading it, delight turns to dismay as Merrill is, instead, consumed here by a friend.This book is a rambling hodge-podge of disconnected anecdote and amateurish psychology. Lurie trots out sweeping theories of Merrill and Jackson's flaws while repeatedly noting that in 40-plus years of friendship, of observing the damage she documents here, she was silent. I kept wondering, &quot;why didn't you say something to them?&quot; She notices that in the single reference to her in &quot;Sandover&quot; Merrill mentions &quot;Alison's shrewd / silence.&quot; Perhaps she neglects to wonder if Merrill's famously developed pun'ishness wasn't anticipating this shrewish and narrow 'memoir.'Lurie is almost embarrassing in her evident need for us to believe she was a key player in lives and works that she is simultaneously trashing. She hints that her own comment about the lack of prose writers in the pantheon of characters visited in Sandover might account for the &quot;sudden appearance of Jane Austen and Dickens&quot; in the last part of the trilogy. That coy &quot;sudden&quot; is emblematic of Lurie's style here. (Odd, too, that she was such a fine observer of the poem when she acknowledges that she did not ever read the final two-thirds of &quot;Sandover&quot; until setting out on this book). The credits do not roll the other way, though. She is deeply troubled by David Jackson's inability to get his own work published (rightly suggesting that he deserves some form of co-authorship for &quot;Sandover&quot;) and mourns his creative decay. She cites as an example of his &quot;intermittent&quot; creative energy his writing of &quot;proposals for work other people might write.&quot; One of these, &quot;a Key West ghost story that I eventually wrote&quot; - she hastens to assure us, &quot;in a different version.&quot;Doubtless Merrill's relationships were as complex and reactive as life will always provide. It's sad to learn that his lifelong beloved, Jackson, is now an emphysemic and alcoholic ghost. It's instructive to consider how their 20-years-long connections to their muses at the Ouija board might represent a collaboration deserving of more examination. It's troubling to wonder at how Peter Hooten, the last love of Merrill's life, might have manipulated the ego of the poet to gain latecomer entrance to the sanctorum Lurie describes from within. But it's just plain unsettling to be led to wonder at the more complex nature of these deep and abiding relationships in Merrill's life by such a shallow and un-insightful guide.Within &quot;Sandover&quot; itself, Merrill refers to the story as that of &quot;the incarnation and withdrawal of a god.&quot; For those of us whose admiration of the man's work cast a mirrored glow on the man himself, a similar withdrawal toward reality is probably a necessary salting. But for the dose of reality to be delivered in such an arch and artless way would surely have left Merrill himself wincing. Not at Lurie's accusations of his myriad blind spots when it came to love, he centered much of his writing around that mystery, but at the singularly graceless form in which they are delivered, here, decades too late.The appearance of this book becomes something of a commentary on the nature of friendship, on fame, and on the conjunction of the two. Frankly, if Lurie's was as reciprocal a friendship as she would have us believe, that, alone, raises more powerful doubts in one's mind about Merrill's ability to build relationships than any of her psychobabble. But too many, commenting more briefly thus far, have claimed the opposite - have glowed in their descriptions of Merrill as friend - for one not to conclude that Lurie drew some of her conclusions through a darker glass.The book ends with a luridly counterbalancing &quot;afterwards&quot;, waxing eloquent about Merrill's life and work - even to the extent of including Hooten, cast throughout as gold-digger and &quot;B&quot; movie player, in a trio of &quot;beautiful and gifted young men.&quot; It neatly reflects the schizophrenia of this book, or perhaps the post-prandial doubts of its author.If you know little of James Merrill's work, read his poetry first, read &quot;Sandover&quot;, too. If, instead, you know and love his work, you are in for a strange experience if you read this book. The second star in this review exists only because the complexity of Merrill's work and life reflects light into this strange, dark little book in ways its author cannot be credited with."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"Lurie didn't like James Merrill when she first met him. Five years later, when she was an unhappy faculty wife at Amherst, Merrill appeared on the scene as a writer-in-residence. Either he had changed enough, or she had changed enough, that Lurie ovecame her initial dislike of him so that they could become buddies. In the sexist academic setting of the 1950s (Lurie is savage in describing that jail), Merrill and his lover David Jackson threw her a lifeline, treating her like a person with a brain and someone to have fun with, not to mention publishing her first book. Lurie repays their friendship and favors with this odd little book that is so thin it almost evaporates in front of your reading glasses. As we know from her novels and essays, Lurie is an intelligent and witty writer, and from time to time here she gets off a few zingers. The problem is that there aren't very many, nor are there more than a handful of interesting stories of any depth. Were these celebrated personalities and writer/geniuses, really this pedestrian (Merrill chops vegetables beautifully in a kimono and teaches Lurie how to make a chicken stock!) and at sea? Half of the book covers Merrill and Jackson's experiments with the Ouija board (and their use of it in generating the epic poem that became &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot;). A large portion of this section consists of quotes from the poem along with Lurie's diatribe against Ouija boards in particular and the spirit world in general. What's that about? I closed the book wondering if the few dry personal scraps Lurie spreads out on the table constitute the entirety of what she took away from their 40 years of friendship. If they are, her relationship with the two men seems to have been more superficial than substantive. To her undying credit, though, Lurie is merciless with herself about her biases (she took a dim view when Jackson casually discussed his tricking, and their intimacy died at that point; she also didn't like Merrill's last boyfriend and reams him with an acid tongue). The presence of those biases without more juice to offset them, alas, makes the book rather sour. As a chronicle of &quot;friendship,&quot; it clearly broadcasts the age-old warning that in a relationship that goes bad, make sure not to die first."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"In spite of the fact that the author reveals a bit too much of herself in this book (a fact which makes you like and then dislike her sometimes) she does weave an interesting theory about the inner workings of Merrill and Jackson's minds. I didn't feel she presented these men dishonestly, though some fans of Merrill's obviously resented the fact that their god was made to appear as a mere mortal---and a somewhat foolish one at that.Juicy, gossipy, lewd, audacious at times, you had to imagine she was indeed capitalizing somewhat on her friendship with Merrill because she did not wait for her friend David Jackson to die before she began revealing what a mess he had become. Why? If she were afraid SHE would die without having a chance to add her two cents she could have written the book, but not published it until after Jackson's real death.I guess it's hard to quarrel with her motives as I read it in one sitting, lapping up all the strange, weird revelations about these men. My respect for them was not diminished by her lurid details of their intimate life. Nothing in Key West is ever ordinary...What was most fascinating about the book though was the fact that Lurie herself became an equal part of the mystery. Was she obsessed with these men? Secretly in love with Jackson? Jealous of them? Twice she had to say that \\"they were rich and could buy anything they wanted\\". Twice!Sadly, Lurie never did manage to do what she wanted---to comprehend these men. This goal never got quite satisfied, so in the end the reader of this book is not quite satisfied.It is an important memoir though because it is the ONLY one right now offering any insight into Merrill, the man and the poet.I think you have to accept the book for exactly what it is, one woman's perspective about two men she was close to---but not close enough to truly understand them. It was an honest attempt on Lurie's part and a courageous one even and it did reveal Lurie's writing talent. For better or worse, she certainly did create a very vivid yet terrifying tale about two utterly amazing lives."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"How unfortunate that the self-appointed biographer (though she terms it a memoir) of James Merrill should take such a dull and dreary approach, ploddingly setting about trying to debunk James Merrill & David Jackson's decades of experiences with a Ouija board that so beautifully resulted in Merrill's masterpiece, The Changing Light at Sandover.Alison Lurie, by her own admission, recognizes Merrill as \\"supernaturally brilliant,\\" but his intelligence is so other than or beyond her own that she literally likens him to a Martian. Apparently unable to comprehend the content of Merrill's epic work, and making it clear that she doesn't even like it, Lurie instead settles for a tedious dissection. Smoke, mirrors, string, simplistic attempts at psychoanalyzing Merrill; surely something besides the truth of reality must be behind all of this communicating-with-spirits hocus-pocus. And, contradictorily, her broad condemning brushstrokes at once paint the Ouija experiences as the mere summoning of Merrill and/or Jackson's unconscious mind(s) (she's offended by what the spirits have to say about her) and the dangerous communing with devils and demons.Perhaps if she had actually read Merrill's books, instead of mining them for ammunition against him, this mean-spirited little book would have had something of value to offer.Alas, this book reads as little more than a paean to Lurie's dislike of Merrill, and is ultimately more about how SHE feels about her subject than it is about Merrill himself. It's rather sickening to imagine her years of \\"friendship\\" with the man, which seem to have been little more than the collecting of criticisms and private details for future use in this petty volume.This book does a disservice to the passion, commitment and spiritual intensity of the lives and work of James Merrill and David Jackson as so eloquently and painstakingly communicated in Merrill's work. I recommend interested readers go directly to The Changing Light at Sandover, and skip this diluted and negatively biased \\"memoir.\\""},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"A memoir is not a biography, as Lurie reminds us at the beginning of her book. One should be grateful for the revelations that are given, and there are many. Perhaps one should be cheered by seeing the sort of defensiveness a beloved author can arouse, but if the reviewers picked up the book they presumably wanted to \\"get inside,\\" and that is where Lurie takes us. Who wants the sugar-coated anyway? Lurie opens a door on a rather Gothic menage, a very energized and energizing union, which dilapidated all too predictably into disunion and the cliched gay search for May-December love on the Greek travel plan. She writes with candor, but acknowledges the many missing spaces, temporal and informational lacunae, in her decades of friendship with these fellow authors. Her critical exegesis of the poetry is quite good for a novelist unpracticed in such analysis, and she raises some fair, troubling questions about the content of \\"Sandover.\\" The Ouija board seemingly acted as a tap for the unconscious thoughts and wishes of its authors, and we find some of these messages, not all of which are palatable, give one insight into the infrastructure of creative sensibility. Ugliness and egotism are part and parcel. Overall, Merrill and Jackson are depicted as serious, generous artists who immeasurably enriched the lives of those around them. Of course, there are faults too, some of them egregious. Several reviewers acknowledge--rather ungraciously--the veracity of Lurie's claim that Merrill's \\"The Changing Light at Sandover\\" was produced jointly by Merrill and Jackson, via their rather Dantean peregrinations on the Ouija board. I would ask the Merrill idolators this: if J.M. himself could acknowledge David Jackson as co-creator of \\"Sandover\\" in subsequent interviews, why could he not put his lifelong lover's name on the spine of the Pulitzer-winning volume? The charges in other reviews that Lurie is magnifying her own reputation through her friendship with Merrill are shallow and spurious; there is not a single self-aggrandizing sentence in the entire volume, and that is a first for the many memoirs I have read. If anything, Lurie is self-deprecating and respectful of the rigors and liabilities of the artistic life. This book is not the typical memoir but a serious and respectful study of two artistic souls locked in a Narcissus-embrace which ended--as it must--with the mirror permanently distorted."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"I've just finished reading this book. I am glad there are a few astute critics here on Amazon. I am sad to see that others refer to the details in Lurie's account as fact though. The first problem with it is, is it a memoir, or a work of poetry criticism? To try to do both, in this manner; that is, giving a few accounts of personal discussions and shared experiences with the subjects, and, at the same time, presuming to explain Merrill's greatest and most complex works, while viewing the whole enterprise through the looking-glass of their intimate relationship, as she perceives it from the outside, seems false, and rather unpleasant. I simply don't believe Lurie's interpretations, her biases and prejudices grate on my nerves, and I wonder, generally speaking, who she thinks she is? Didn't anybody inform her, before the manuscript was published, that it is rather a low and embarrassing account of a major literary figure? It may be cruel to point out too: but one feels her blistering criticism of Peter Hooten, as riding Merrill's bright star, could easily apply to Lurie herself. She seems rather obsessed, through the (if we are to believe her account) sad figure of David Jackson, with, well, fame. It doesn't seem to occur to her, like a lot of other amateurs, that Merrill worked harder and with greater purpose and concentration at his Art than the people around him, which is naturally why he is better known. She contrasts, in a way that makes me uncomfortable, her ugly, boring life with her husband and children, with Merrill and Jackson's youthful beauty and money and exciting travels. ... The overblown sentiments she expresses at the end seem to come out of the blue and refer to nothing previously written in the short book. It's imitation Art, without much insight, or a sense of humor--so unlike Merrill's poems, which any reader would be smarter to delve into, time and again, for true illumination and a delightful peek into the character of a remarkable poet."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"In print Merrill admits his faults disarmingly. Lurie brings a different sensibility to the task. This is no literary biography. Whether Merrill and Jackson pair more like Pope and Bolingbroke or Auden and Kallmann would be out of place. This memoir invites comparisons to Scott and Zelda, poets and their faculty wives. It's probably the best thing for future biographies that most of the worst and most prosaic things that could be said about Merrill and Jackson have now been said by a friend. Merrill fans will pick up bits of gossip. Readers unfamiliar with Merrill's work will be pleasantly surprised if they follow this book with his poetry."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"Familiar Spirits is a very good, quick read. James Merrill and David Jackson's romantic relationship is lifted up with all its successes and failures.The book, in addition to being a memoir of a friendship, seems to be a warning buoy in at least a couple of areas. First, by employing counter-examples, it seems to suggest to the reader to tend regularly to one's romantic relationship, and to work through conflicts as they arise. Second, it warns those interested in the supernatural to recognize how interactions with \\"the invisible world\\" can drain one's energy and attention from the visible world.It is interesting that Lurie spends a good deal of time offering literary criticism and interpretation on Merrill's The Changing Light at Sandover. There is a good case made that David Jackson is the uncredited co-author of Sandover. Lurie suggests that helping to shape Sandover was Jackson's greatest literary accomplishment.I am hoping that this memoir will encourage a Merrill biography. It would be great to get a full account of Merrill's life, along with some pictures of him and of the people most important to him.Familiar Spirits caused me to want to read Merrill, with whom I was previously unacquainted. My next stop will be The Changing Light at Sandover. I also fell in love with Alison Lurie's thoughtful and easy writing style, and have begun to read her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Foreign Affairs."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"This is a breezy and fascinating memoir of Merrill and Jackson and their relationship as seen through Lurie's eyes. Lurie befriended Merrill, and through him Jackson, and was a witness to their love affair, its ups and downs, and Merrill's literary success with his epic poem &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot;. Lurie gives insight to the epic's origins by describing the couple's sessions with a ouija board. She also elaborates on Jackson's influence on the epic, a fact which the world seems to want to ignore. Merrill and Jackson's relationship deteriorated as the epic poem gained in popularity, and by the time of Merrill's death in 1995, the two men were hardly speaking. Lurie has written a poignant memoir of her friends, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and yet it seemed distant, almost through glass. It was as if the book is just a series of thoughts about the two men, without even attempting to make us feel as close to them as Lurie did. I definitely do recommend it to fans of Merrill, as well as those interested in the lives of artists and writers."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"It is a sort of maxim that a writer, when taking up her subject, should be in sympathy with the topic. You don't want someone who hates fantasy to review the newest Susanna Clarke novel. Or someone who hates Jews and sex to review the newest Philip Roth novel. Unfortunately, Alison Lurie feels important enough or brilliant enough to write about the wonderful poet James Merrill, and she spends much of the book dissecting and belittling and caviling over The Changing Light at Sandover. I would ask her, if I could, why bother writing about him if you had so little nice to say? She even admits she only read the whole poem years after it came out, and had skimmed it initially. That makes you not qualified to talk about it!Ok, so please don't think this is just sour grapes because I love him and she is demeaning what he did. The book is also poorly written. A reviewer talked about Lurie showing her \\"trademark wit.\\" What wit? There is no grace, no charm, no wit, and worst of all, no wisdom. This is almost like a sympathetic, non-poetry loving gossip-monger decided to capitalize on a good but not great friendship with Merrill to make a few bucks and write a short memoir years after he had died.This book is only for those who love James Merrill and will read anything about him; there is nothing else out there. But the first biography or next memoir to come out will definitely replace this superficial, gossipy and unsympathetic memoir."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"Lurie writes a very carefully rendered and bittersweet record of a friendship that was fraught with love, frustration, complexity, and disappointment. She's modest and thoughtful -- nothing like the caricature depicted in some of the comments here of a person inserting herself into the lives of others. In fact, while I've taken a more sympathetic (and less intimate) perspective on Merrill and Jackson's use of a Ouija board, Lurie provides an extremely important, up-close narrative. I read this book more than five years ago and still think of some of its passages today. That's quite rare for any memoir and speaks to the book's depths."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"The story is strongest when she is most generous to her characters and most fully shares her own story within theirs. At times, she writes out of her anger at those who hurt her friends, at them for not staying true to love and beauty, and at the world for its unhappiness. She doesn't have nearly enough distance from JM's spaghetti western svengali and DJ's young black hustlers to write about them for publication.How could two so full of love have come to such a sad end? The answer, it seems at times, is that gay marriage in our world doesn't have the structuring social context to do the work we expect from marriage. But we need to know more about her, her own loves, her children and her novels in order to speak honestly with her about the long haul.The ouija board saves the marriage by holding it together under the burden of professional success and failure. And it destroys them both. It ruins JM as a poet -- he writes a beautiful \\"Book of Ephraim,\\" then two more fat, quick and unreflective books of spirit-writing, then not much else. It draws them away from friends and life into a compelling fantasy they only partly believe in, are afraid of, and that becomes gradually coarser and uglier. As she sees it, James dies bewildered and ruined, while David loses his mind and soul to the devils.She paints beautiful, vivid portraits of her friends in their youth."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"It's about that gay poet with the ouija board.Oh yeah I heard he fooled around.They all do.No dude, it's a serious and respectful study of two artisticsouls locked in a Narcissus-embrace which ended--as it must--with the mirror permanently distorted.Whatever."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"I seldom read fiction, but I've enjoyed three of Alison Lurie's novels. After my attention fell on the work of James Merrill, and I saw that Alison Lurie had written about him, I ran, not walked, to the library to get her book. It was everything I expected: a wonderful gossip, a further stimulus to read James Merrill's poems, and a work of insight about the literary culture of Key West--which I found even more interesting because I once talked with Alison Lurie and several other writers there at a Key West Festival.Alison Lurie knew James Merrill and his lover David Jackson for many years. She doesn't allow us to understand why they befriended her, but we have no trouble understanding why she befriended them. They were fun, cultured, intellectual, supportive, and moneyed, and shared interests with Alison Lurie. Jimmy often swam with her and David cooked with her. If this book seems to contain gaps and mysteries, it's probably because Alison Lurie has held back in her account in respect of their friendship. She has done us a favor to tell as much as she does. I was less interested in the theories about the Ouija Board and actually skipped some of her deconstruction of Merrill's poetry. Her defense of David Jackson as co-author of Merrill's work has merit. Jackson, although she doesn't seem to realize it, was (is) a self-destructive personality. His deterioration is self-evident in the anecdote about his angry driving in Italy in 1978, years before Peter Hooten entered Merrill's life. One is forced to wonder how Merrill died of AIDS and the other two remained untouched by it."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"Alison Lurie celebrates friendship in her memoir of James Merrill, poet, and David Jackson. Her account covers the career trajectories of the two men. She describes their adventures with unknown spirits and the subsequent work product in the Sandover poems. Her description of the lives of the two and the houses they occupied in Key West are particularly alluring. She makes the outcomes of drug and alcohol abuse and an interest in the rough trade on the one hand, and an increasing diffidence and squeamishness on the part of Merrill on the other hand comprehensible and not at all unusual in that individual characters do undergo changes in the course of a span of life."},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","review":"This is a beautifully written long view of the lives of James Merrill, poet, and his lover and uncredited collaborator David Jackson. They dabbled through the ouija board in contact with unseen spirits that supposedly provided the material for Merrill's largest poetic works. The cost to both men of this eerie devotion is trenchantly narrated by Alison Lurie, their friend of many years. The charge that Ms. Lurie is using her connection to Merrill to enhance her own reputation is absurd, as she is far more well known in general than Merrill."},{"Title":"The Easter book;: Illustrated by Robert Frankenberg","review":"This book covers Pre-Lent (Carnival), Lent and Easter traditions. Father Weiser wrote many books thoroughly researching the origins of our feast and customs in the Church. This book is enjoyable reading, but also a great resource, with a few recipes throughout. This was written before Vatican II, so some liturgical things have changed, but it is surprisingly applicable and up to date in everything else. A great buy."},{"Title":"The Biblical World View: An Apologetic","review":"I began my career as an apologetics professor at Trinity College in Deerfiled, Illinois in the 1970s. I have continued to be deeply committeed to this subject. I was very dissatisfied with what was available as text books during that period and sought to publish something more comprehensive. I believe this book succeeds. It covers both philosophical and historical apologetic issues. It also credits miracles today and charismatic expreince as part of the apologetic, which is unique among all texts. In addition, it anticipates the intelligent design movement in the section dealing with naturalistic evolution. Those who have reviewed this text, such as Professor David L. Wolfe, Dr. Dennis Lindsey of Christ for the Naitons, and Dr. Creig Keener, have all been impressed that the book is accurate to their disciplines. I believe it is a trustworthy and coherent apologetics text without parallel. Some professors have chosen it as their text book. However, this is not only for a class room text, but for anyone wanting to read a book presenting a strong case for our faith."},{"Title":"The Biblical World View: An Apologetic","review":"Dr. Juster's book presented is a volume written for students as well as those who are interested in thinking to discover truth. This truth as presented covers not only cultural points on which Schaeffer keyed, but also on philosophical and historical aspects as well. His defence of the biblical faith is not only an apology of what happened in the Scriptures, but also experiential in which there is consistency, coherence and comprehsiveness (p. 27). These three C's must be fulfilled in attaining value pervasity by the power of the Holy Spirit in which He makes the truth of the Bible alive in one's heart.Empirical logic prevailed in moving from the Hebrew understanding of the OT to the Greek mindset of the pervading culture which influenced the world in Jesus' day. The mind and science overtook Jerusalem, which was the center of world religion when the Temple was destroyed in 70 A.D. Without the Temple as the empirical evidence of God for the Jewish people and the world, the new temple of logic and Western thought was its replacement. The world substituted God with theories, hence, the dulling of the human mind and soul to explain reality came to: time plus chance plus matter. Such understanding came to desensitize society of meaning in life and existence which gave rise to increased immorality because there was no objective standard in which society must be gauged. The Bible was made subject to man who was created in the image of God, but an image nonetheless.Dr. Juster looked at the evidence of the world in light of creation. Anselm's ontological arguments of the creation of the world were shown to have been by God because one greater than God could not be conceived (155). Mankind, however, continues to balk at accepting the biblical metanarrative, therefore the emergent naturalism gravitated toward the ultimate incoherence that something came from nothing. From this foundation of sand, Dr. Juster proposes a refocus on the rock of the Bible with fulfilled prophecy as one of its truthful evidences including the highest moral call to return to the Creator and His created order. This was the message of the Prophets of Israel well as the Messiah, Jesus Christ.The simplicity of Dr. Juster's writings in his book is a beckoning to examine the evidence. Israel as God's representative nation for the world has a Messianic Redeemer who came to set the order of the biblical world view strait. Even though some of the apparent prophecies of the OT concerning the Messiah were not completely accomplished (eg. Hos. 11:1), Jesus brought their meaning to the fullest understanding (Matt. 2:15). Jesus filled-full the religious system of Israel also as the feasts were pointing to (191ff). He was the Suffering Servant of Isaiah 42:1-7; 49:1-7; 50:1-11; 52:13-53:12. So much of the Jewish understanding of the Messiah (ben Joseph and ben David) is wrapped up the life, death, burial and resurrection of Jesus that the yet unfulfilled later-day prophecies can be confidently believed.The research and the Spirit with which Dr. Juster writes unveils the heart and passion that God has for His people Israel. Although men continue to try to discredit the Bible as the Word of God, evidence not only from witnesses has proved its veracity, but also the open display of love with which the Savior lived is the greatest defence through which the world and Israel will be disarmed. I would highly recommend The Biblical World View for all in search for truth."},{"Title":"The Biblical World View: An Apologetic","review":"The Biblical World View begins by explaining the word apologetics, the different approaches which are available, and then explains what is meant by \\"truth\\" as well as what criteria is used to determine it. It then goes on to describe the three criteria used in such determinations: Consistency, coherence, and comprehensiveness. The author then proceeds to explain to the ways in which culture point to truth in the Biblical worldview, introducing such topics as the roots of contemporary culture, nineteenth and twentieth century philosophies and theology, and the arts of the twentieth century. He next moves on to objections to the Biblical worldview and positive evidences supporting it from the Scriptures.Juster has a sense of how to explain complex topics in an understandable manner, making his meaning understood at the first reading. I sense a large part of this is Juster's background in Philosophy, which allowed him to explain philosophical concepts I had struggled with previously.This text is organized in a typical chapter format which allowed a logical progression of understanding of apologetics. Each chapter built upon the previous one, and thus taught progressively.I particularly appreciated two features of this book. The first was the summary of the subject after each chapter (those which did not have a summary had a conclusion), which served as an immediate reinforcement of what I had just read; this had the effect of impressing the most important points in my mind. The other feature which appealed to me was the questions at the end of each chapter, which helped further reinforce what I just learned. I have read a number of Juster's books, and I understand why, for they have a way of making topics which are a little difficult to grasp move within my reach."},{"Title":"The Biblical World View: An Apologetic","review":"The Biblical World View, An Apologetic, by Dr. Daniel Juster provides a cogent defense of the faith from a biblical perspective. Even more importantly, the book defends biblical truth as a valid concept in a world that does not even know if truth exists. Dr. Juster demands that the reader engage his brain as he embarks on a journey to discover whether a biblical world view can stand the test of reason, philosophies, and culture.Dr. Juster takes the reader through various approaches to apologetics explaining key elements, then describes why these approaches alone are not adequate to explain truth to the unbeliever or skeptic. He presents an historical overview of a number of the philosophies, theologies, and thought processes. Dr. Juster examines how these philosophies have impacted our modern world in relation to art, culture, music, and how the modern world perceives truth itself. He includes secular humanism, Greek philosophy, Aristotle, the European academies, the impact of science and rationalism, evolution, all which have impacted modern thought and culture today. He also introduces Hebraic thought into the conversation.Dr. Juster presents the superiority of a biblical approach to defining truth for understanding the world in which we live. He uses evidence from creation, prophecy fulfilled, the character of Jesus, and even presents evidence that miracles exist to support the biblical world view.Dr. Juster concludes his book explaining the veracity of the Bible, and why a thinking person can trust that is true, giving justification for Godly inspiration of the Bible. Christians will be able to identify where they have internalized some of the secular philosophies and find a way back to solid Biblical values. Finally, this book will provide Believers with a \\"craftsman\\" tool set to discuss and defend Biblical truth."},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"satisfied with product. It's supplementing my own French class and is very helpful."},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"As a teacher of French, I drill my students all the time. I have found that the students don't experience being drilled as monotonous, if you drill them at a fast pace. Some of the slower students can't really handle it, but you're fooling yourself if you think they'll ever move past the F side of the bell-curve, so I say drill away with those who can.The drills in this book are superior practice for all verb tenses. They're organized by verb endings, frequently used irregular verbs and verbs with prefix differentials that could be called regular.It works. My students kick derriere (except the morons who can't find their own derrieres) thanks to this drill book."},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"This terrific (and bargain priced) book gets my vote for Best Supplemental French Text.

This book clearly and systematically explains how the French verb system works, providing numerous and varied exercises to practice each point.There are also countless mastery and review exercises throughout.Just a fabulous text -- very logically put together and very thorough. It has helped my understanding and mastery of French to increase by leaps and bounds."},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"If you're trying to teach yourself French, you may find the numerous verb tenses intimidating. This book will help you to overcome many of those fears. While the French use verbs in a more complex way than we Anglophones, they generally do so in a logical and orderly fashion. Once you've learned the future tense or the conditional tense, for instance, you'll find that it applies to most verbs.De Sales helps you to understand those basic building blocks; the lessons are clear and basic, and if you follow them you will be well on your way to mastering French. The only nit I might pick is this: perhaps he could give the definition of a verb *before* using it in a sentence. There are cases when he will ask for a conjugation of a verb that has not yet been introduced... or a translation. You will definitely need another text or two along with this one... but if you use this you'll find the Mystery of French Verb Conjugation to be much less mysterious."},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"There are too many erros in the given solutions, too few examples of how to use verbs in context, and too little explanation.Spend an extra 3 bucks and buy the superb Ultimate French Verb Review and Practice."},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"As a book for verb drills, this book is alright. It has a nice glossary in the back, and it has complete conjugations of many irregular verbs. It's set up so that it deals with all of the tenses first in their regular forms, and then later there are exercises for irregular verbs, which quiz you on all tenses/moods at once. Personally, I think it would be better for the book to have longer sections about each tense/mood, which deal with irregular and regular verbs at the same time.In other words, I would rather practice one tense at a time, rather than, as the second section is set up, practice irregular verbs one at a time in all of their different tenses/moods. Most classes (high school or college) are set up so that you deal with one tense at a time (regular and irregular at the same time) as you eventually learn all of the tenses, and unfortunately this book isn't set up that way. That's my personal preference, and, perhaps, once I have learned all of the tenses, this book will be more useful for me.I would really recommend this book instead, for it presents the verbs by their tense, and it provides lessons about prepositions and useful verb expressions (ex. faire la cuisine, avoir de la chance) as an added bonus.Check out this book:The Ultimate French Verb Review and PracticeAlso, by the same authors, but it covers all of French grammar, not just verbs:The Ultimate French Review and Practice: Mastering French Grammar for Confident Communication"},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"This book is great the layout is simple and direct and the exercises are terrific reinforcement.

I have not come across any on Mother Cabrini either that are targeted at adults."},{"Title":"Trouble In Tombstone","review":"Traditionally I have been somewhat leery of fictionalized accounts of Earp history. That may not be a fair way to characterize this particular book, but it is however what I perceived it to be when I was considering the purchase. A reader's opinion of this book will be determined greatly by their expectations, and how they view interpretation of historical data. To understand the premise of this book you should read the author's notes first. In his own words, author Richard Wheeler states that he sticks reasonably close to historical events, but also admits that he supplies motivations to the people involved that \\"historians can only guess at.\\" So Wheeler makes no bones about what he is doing or not doing. I have read enough reviews on Earp books to know that some people will not be able to stomach that, especially if they have preconceived notions of say for example, Wyatt's manner of speaking, or how he looked upon Mattie's death. Personally, there were a few things like that that were distracting for me. That being said, those moments of distraction were balanced out by my appreciation of Wheeler's depictions of moments that are not (to the best of my knowledge) recorded anywhere, but undoubtedly occurred in some fashion. For example, there is a scene where Wyatt and Doc connect in silent friendship in a bar as the barkeep goes around blowing out the lamps for the night. I think many readers will appreciate moments like that. This is not a book for the avid Earp buff who wishes to learn some startling revelations about Earp. Most of the information is well known and previously recorded. This is understandable as Wheeler's intenion was not to unearth buried facts about the events at Tombstone, but rather to add some flesh to the characters and the events tied to them. He covers this in his author's notes. Overall, a good read, and worth the time. I commend Wheeler for giving readers an opportunity to explore the story from a different perspective, a more personal perspective, but at the same time keeping true to the general facts of what actually happened. He does not stray far, and for that I was thankful. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Trouble In Tombstone","review":"I began reading Trouble In Tombstone expecting to be disappointed. I've never been a big fan of westerns, I've never been intrigued by the gunfight at the OK Corral, and I've never been starstruck by Wyatt Earp. The trouble I would find in Tombstone, I thought, would be finding the will to finish the book. Add that to the long list of things I've been wrong about.Instead, I found myself mesmerized. Written as an autobiography of an aged Wyatt Earp, the story centers on his adventures in Tombstone and their immediate aftermath. The narrative begins soon after the arrival in Tombstone of the Earp clan and describes the interplay of forces that led to the famous gunfight, and just as importantly, to the vendetta afterward. As the Earps are drawn inexorably into the showdown with the Cowboys, the reader is drawn into the tale. The Earps are outnumbered, the police are corrupt, and the Cowboys have no qualms with shooting a man in the back.Wheeler's prose brings alive the places and characters of the story. Intrigued, I found myself researching the life and times of Wyatt Earp and Tombstone, and to my delight I found that Wheeler's book is true to both, capturing them so accurately a reader might come away dusty and sunburned. In the end, the book is a story of love and loyalty, of faith and friendship, of corruption and redemption. Wheeler draws Wyatt Earp as a man who knows his own flaws and accepts them. These traits are as winsome today as they were in the old west, and perhaps that is why the book resonates so well across the decades. The trouble I found in Tombstone was putting the book down to get some sleep."},{"Title":"Trouble In Tombstone","review":"If you have been interested in what took place in The Old West;you'll have read or watched many accounts of The Earps,Batmasterson,Doc Holliday,Tombstone,Dodge City,the Clantons,the McLaurys,Johnny Ringo,Frank Sitwell,Luke Short,John Behan,Kate Elder,and a host of others who were part of the scene,particularly in the late 1870's and the early 1880's.Richard Wheeler,the author of more than 40 novels and the winner of several Spur Awards from the Western Writers of America ,has written this book through the eyes of Wyatt Earp, as if it were Wyatt writing his own autobiography and attempting to tell what really happened and more particularly why.There are a lot of people,places and events to sort out and Wheeler has done a supurb job of doing it,and in a remarkably coherent and easy to follow manner.He does it so well that one tends to put aside everything you have read and heard and just sit back and let him tell it to you the way Wyatt saw it. This is called a novel;but it could well be considered a history,an autobiography or anything else.As you read this book, you will quickly realize that Wheeler has a great deal of knowledge on the subject,has done a great amount of research,has sorted out the wheat from the vast amount of chaff;but more importantly has tried to look into the minds of all these people and tell us how they were thinking and what motivated them.While the prime subject of the book is Wyatt Earp,the situations that were in place before Wyatt came to Tombstone and the situations after the Shootout at the OK Corral are important to understand and that is what this book is all about.When you have finished this book;you'll probably come to the conclusion that Wheeler has gotten the story just about as correct as it's ever likely to be.At the end of the book there is the Author,s Notes. I think it would be beneficial to read these notes befor reading the book.He even discusses what he feels are other worthwhile books to pursue for further information.As a fan of the Old West ,I found this an excellent account of the period ,characters and events around Tombstone ,and highly reccomend it,even if you've heard the story many times."},{"Title":"Trouble In Tombstone","review":"Richard Wheeler writes about the best western stories and histories you can get. He scores again with the Wyatt Earp and his brothers, with Doc Holiday, and their combat with the infamous outlaws. This is a story written so many times, who can tell how many. But Wheeler makes his characters real and understantable.Joe Spear"},{"Title":"The Land and the Book: Or, Biblical Illustrations Drawn from the Manners and Customs, the Scenes and Scenery of the Holy Land","review":"The Publisher has reprint Thompson's classic The Land and the Book. However, the reprint is shorten version, including only Southern Palestain and Jerusalem. At least in my copy the printing is very poor, it lacks pages, one page is printed two times and the book is partly copied by dark pages hard to read. I most warmly recommend The Land and The Book by Thomson for all those who love their Bibles and love to study the culture behind it, but not this shorten reprinting."},{"Title":"The Old Testament Documents: Are They Reliable and Relevant?","review":"Most books dealing with the reliability of Biblical documents focus on their transmission history, and usually that of the New Testament, as we know more about it. How much less we know of the textual history of the Older Testament, however, is seen in that only 35 pages of this book are actually devoted to it! The rest of the work is filled out by discussions of whether or not the history and message recorded in those documents is reliable and relevant to today. These discussions are introductory and survey the field in a manner that seems to skate over some rather prickly issues, particularly in the areas where Kaiser argues for the reliability of the recorded history. Given that this work came out some six years after the first major public salvo from minimalist interpreters, who deny the historicity of the events Kaiser argues are historical, there should have been more interaction with them. Their views are becoming general public knowledge and should be interacted with. There also seems to be a tendency in the later sections on the reliability of the messages in the documents, to jump from the fact that something in the text is historically accurate to the view that the message is therefore reliable. The message of Ezekiel, for example, may or may not be reliable, but it isn't proven by the fact that other people at the same time also used bricks as writing materials. On the positive side, however, the discussion of the textual history is concise and informative, as is most of the book. There is also useful information on how many critical views of the text, which remain prevalent in the popular conscience and media, are actually either passe, dead, or under serious fire on the academic end. Over all, the book is worth reading as long as one keeps in mind its introductory survey nature and are willing to pursue the issues to greater depth via the footnotes. The book will give you a good foothold in and understanding of the field to make a solid start at it."},{"Title":"The Old Testament Documents: Are They Reliable and Relevant?","review":"Kaisers work with the Old Testament Documents is an interesting read. I had the belief that the Old Testament documents were both reliable and relevent before I began to read this book, and after reading it my belief still stands. There are only two arguments that I would like to confront after reading Kaiser's work. The first thing that I dislike is how Kaiser skims over some topics of debait and basically just says that they are historically accurate because they are found in historical documents from more than one source. This could easily be construed by simple &quot;word of mouth&quot; or lack of an eye witness. A rumor or tale could be believable and convincing and yet not true or precise. The second thing that I noticed about this book, is the fact there is very little evidence to go by in regards to the Old Testament, and Kaiser does not thoroughly discuss this problem. Although further discussion of this topic might hurt Kaiser's points, it would only be fair to show how small the stack of evidence, even though convincing, really is. Overall, this book was very informative and serves as a great introduction to how the Old Testament can be both &quot;reliable and relevant&quot; today."},{"Title":"The Old Testament Documents: Are They Reliable and Relevant?","review":"Walter Kaiser believes that the Old Testament documents are both reliable and relevant for Christians today. While he does not try to \\"prove\\" the infallibility of the Old Testament scriptures, his argument in favor of their reliability and relevance is generally persuasive. Especially fascinating is some of the supporting archeological evidence, such as Baruch's bullae and investigations into the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Kaiser also notes problems with the evidence when applicable; for example, the dating of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and various \\"missing people.\\" His argument is weakest in regards to Genesis 1-11 for several reasons. First he argues against those who hold that certain portions of early Genesis are \\"scientific impossible.\\" But the main problem with these portions is not their scientific impossibility, but the lack of scientific evidence in favor of the biblical account. While this is problematic for the long lifespans and early iron-working, nowhere is it more devestating than for the universal flood story-a story that Kaiser overlooks completely! Moreover, while arguing in favor of Moses authorship for the Pentateuch, Kaiser dismisses the various \\"strands\\" that provide the support for the JEDP hypothesis. Kaiser does rightly expose some flimsy assumptions of the JEDP hypothesis; however, the existence of various strands in the text do not necessarily undermine support for Moses' authorship (for which Wright argues). It certainly seems plausible that Moses collected various written or oral traditions when writing and compiling the Pentateuch, and so a wholesale dismissal of the JEDP hypothesis might be hasty. Despite these flaws, this book remains a good introduction to the topic."},{"Title":"The Old Testament Documents: Are They Reliable and Relevant?","review":"This book gives good evidence for the reliability of the scriptures as we have them today. This book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Old Testament Documents: Are They Reliable and Relevant?","review":"I use it daily. An essential tool in my relationship building with Christ Jesus, I highly recommend for the believer and non believer alike."},{"Title":"The Old Testament Documents: Are They Reliable and Relevant?","review":"Kaiser presents the argument that the Old Testament is crucial to a full understanding of the New Testament. The concept of the Old Testament no longer being treated as a historical document, but rather a story book, is appalling. Kaiser points out that under the American judicial system, we have the code of \\"innocent until proven guilty.\\" In scientific evidence, we start with a hypothesis and test it to determine if it is false. If it passes the test (not false), then we can certify it as Law, or Truth. Where does this fit with our regard toward the scriptures? There have been no examinations as to the veracity of this historical document, but rather a condemnation simply because of the implication that we are held responsible to a Creator. \\"In an indictment of this so-called objectivity, the judgment of history has caught up with that bit of Enlightenment hubris and has exposed such claimants to objectivity as a plurality of subjective relativizers. And the rest, as they say, is now history>\\" (28).The implications of regarding the Old Testament as no longer relevant, no longer reliable, are huge. Without the Old Covenant, we have no purpose for the New Covenant. And thus, we have a church born not out of sacrifice and repentance, but out of freedom and selfishness. We no longer have a church that seeks the Creator, but rather one that become their own creator, and in doing so, commits idolatry. But, after all, the Torah holds no ground, and thus, the Emergent Church can continue their sugared cereal breakfast, lacking all life-sustaining nutrients and health. In the end, they will hunger more.See the Rest of this review at [...]"},{"Title":"The Old Testament Documents: Are They Reliable and Relevant?","review":"I am not able to review this book since I have been waiting for weeks to get it and to date I still have not received it or the other book I bought."},{"Title":"Introduction to Political Science","review":"When I arrived at the university where I am currently teaching, this book had already been selected as the textbook for my Introduction to Political Science classes.

Being a current grad student, I have read many books that beg to be used as a paperweight. They are either way off topic and monotonous, or so incomplete that one feels empty after going to the effort to read them. This book gives the reader neither of those feelings. The author knew who his audience would be and wrote for them. Its content is rich in history, theory, and practicality. I highly recommend this book to anyone who either wants to reacquaint themselves with government and its purpose or to those who are deciding if they want to learn more about their societal/governmental systems."},{"Title":"The Insider","review":"A look at the past from the vantage point called present. That aptly describes The Insider.This semi-autobiographical work from PV Narasimha Rao manages to engage you throughout.The former Prime minister of India displays superb story telling skills combining facts with fiction with post independant India serving as a vast canvas.PV takes the reader with him to the journey into the past 50 years starting from Nizam movement in Hyderabad till the destruction of Temple/Mosque at Ayodhya.You'll get an understanding of post-independant India,more specifically the state of Andhra Pradesh where PV served as the Chief Minister.PV should have been more upfront about the characters that he has used to reflect the real persons in Indian national Congress.He ducked various important issues that changed the face of India throughout these years.Most important of them are Emergency and Indira Gandhi's assasination.He also chose to ignore the rise of Indira Gandhi after the famous split in the Congress.What PV has effectively done is make the reader yearn more of his work. May be the active nature of his politics restrained him to be more forthright in &quot;The Insider&quot;. He has promised a sequel.That should be more interesting since he has retired from active politics.In summary, a good engagaing work but could have been a lot better."},{"Title":"Changes of Heart (Montana Skies Series #1)","review":"A heart warming story of a woman overcoming loss.

CHANGES OF HEART reflects her skill as well as her keen understanding of relationships --- relationships not only among friends but also between horse and rider. Woven in and through these relationships is a deep belief and faith in God that binds it all together.Set on a horse ranch in Coldwater, Montana, the story begins with Maggie and Rich Locke preparing for the birth of their young mare's first colt. It is just before Christmas, and excitement is running higher than usual. As Elliston describes the miracle of birth, on that frigid Montana morning, you can almost smell the barn and hear the sounds of life. Joy runs high as Maggie silently prays: \\"My cup runneth over, Lord, Thank you for all this.\\"But before the week is over, tragedy strikes and Maggie's world is shattered. Her greatest fear is realized when Rich's jet goes down while he is testing a new aviation fuel. Her hopes are crushed like the wreckage of his plane, and instead of leaning on her faith and turning to God, she pulls away, separating herself from His comfort. Indirectly she resents God and blames Him for not answering her prayers for Rich's safety.Though Maggie feels her life is over, the needs of her horses do not come to a stop, so she continues to care for them and receives some solace from her grueling work. Gradually she begins to allow people into her self-imposed isolation: Dan Pulver, friend and veterinarian, was a frequent visitor who had always admired Maggie and now longs to become closer to her; Dr. Sarah Morrison, whose daughter Tessa desperately wants to learn barrel racing despite her handicap; and Ian Lane, the new pastor whose good humor and eagerness to learn about horses is infectious.Eventually Maggie realizes that God is healing her broken heart through the people who he has placed in her life. And she begins to understand that her new heart is strong enough to hold love again.CHANGES OF HEART reminds us of the fragility of life and the grace of God that gets us from point A to point B on any given day.

The 1st Changes of Heart was a bit confusing and left much wanting especially in the end. I got lost in the last few chapters wondering if I missed reading a chapter.

The Author has woven heartbreak, humor and faith. I loved the interaction between characters in the book. Each added something special.

The beginning started out well - her grief is palpable and felt real to me.At some point she started to heal a bit, and I felt that as well.Otherwise though, the supporting characters felt wooden to me, except for Danny Pulver and Tessa, the teenager. Those two were real and I felt like I could relate to them.It felt to me as if Ian was a minister just because that'd be cool to have a minister in the story. He didn't do anything that a pastor would do, he wasn't described as a real pastor would have acted. A pastor attracted to a woman in his congregation would have had more of an ethical dilemma on his hands than was described here - even as a single man perfectly within his rights to date a woman. So really, I felt like his job was just that, a job that happened to take place in a church. It wasn't real.**Spoilers**The woman is portrayed as working very well in any crisis with the one man, yet no mention of her entering the other man's life's work is made. In reality if a woman were to make the choice she did she would be entering into his life's work more than most other jobs that men have - yet nowhere is it indicated that she even considered that fact.Which is such a big part of why I was disappointed in the ending.The author proves to be a good enough writer, yet in the end it's like it became rushed and the ending was forced. I agree with the other reviewer that said her choice didn't seem to make sense at all, since to me the other man was so much more believable and fit her so much better.

We aren't told how she made her decision, nor do we get to hear any declaration of love or see any romance, not even the wedding. She is trying to make a decision, suddenly she is watching her husband, and we never see anything that happened between. In addition, I felt she chose the wrong man for her. The novel painted her as practical and down to earth. I felt the man she rejected fit her personality much better in every way.

I was disappointed in the ending."},{"Title":"Changes of Heart (Montana Skies Series #1)","review":"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't even finish this one. It just seemed like the story dragged on and on and on..... I also couldn't for the life of me figure out why she went into such great detail on some things that, in my opinion, didn't help develop the story at all. Like detailing the engine in her truck or like the truck is only 4 years old, but sounds like it is about 15 years old. My personal favorite was when the snow storm came and the vet drove them out to Maggie's farm because he was a super talented driver and had a 4 wheel drive truck that would go through any snow drift. Now come on, I realize this is a fictional story, but seriously? I don't even live in an area that gets a ton of snow, but on the rare occasion that mother nature unleashes her fury with a snow storm/blizzard, there is no 4 wheel drive truck in the county that could ever go through drifts like that! Wow! I'm so glad I didn't pay for this one!"},{"Title":"Changes of Heart (Montana Skies Series #1)","review":"I loved reading this book until I got to the end. It was the most abrupt ending I can remember in a novel. It reminded me of short stories with a word limit and when the writer gets to the specified length, bam! the story is over! I was reading it in electronic form and actually thought there was a malfunction and I'd missed some pages. I went back and checked; the story really does end suddenly!"},{"Title":"Changes of Heart (Montana Skies Series #1)","review":"I liked this story a lot because there was more depth and character development than most romance novels. The other reviewers give the writer a hard time about the ending. However, while I agree that the ending was abrupt(like the author was told to finish the story or else), I thought in general that the writing and story line was good. It would have been nice to have seen the character go through decision making process to see how she picked \\"the one\\"."},{"Title":"Changes of Heart (Montana Skies Series #1)","review":"The 2 stars are for a well written story, for what was there at least. The ending as many reviewers have said was abrupt and I could not believe she married the man she did, and of course no reasons were given as to why..so my main reaction to this book is what the heck?? This could have been a good story, but it fell of a cliff at the end!"},{"Title":"Changes of Heart (Montana Skies Series #1)","review":"I wish I read the reviews before I read thebook because I completely agree with them. When I got to the end had to go back to the last chapter because I tought I missed something. She married the wrong guy and the author didn't explain wy she chose him. It was a very abrupt, dissapointing ending. I thought about putting it down several times, but I don't liketo leave a book unfinished. Now I wish I had!"},{"Title":"Changes of Heart (Montana Skies Series #1)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I don't read a lot of Christian fiction because sometimes it is too 'sunshine and lollipops' but this had meat on the bones and was good to read. I had a few issues with not feeling the story had been rounded out at the end, but I'd still recommend it as a Christian romance."},{"Title":"Changes of Heart (Montana Skies Series #1)","review":"At the risk of sounding like so many other reviewers, this book started out terrific. The author did a really nice job of describing the grief of the main character when she lost her husband. Unfortunately, it went downhill for me from about the snow storm to the end. Actually, the whole snowstorm part could have been pared down to a few pages. I had little interest in reading about the Monopoly game.Besides the glaring error about Arabian horses, I felt like I was reading an advertisement for GMC trucks. Absolutely no GMC pickup - or any pickup - would go through ten foot drifts of snow, no matter what kind of tread was on the tires (and we read about the tread numerous times).Then the ending, if you can call it that. As others have done, I checked my Kindle thinking I missed some pages or something was wrong with the device. It was like, poof! The husband just appeared at the window.Two stars for the beginning and the beautiful Montana setting. Certainly cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"Fifty hikes in Connecticut: Short walks and day hikes around the Nutmeg State","review":"Gerry and Sue Hardy hae put together a basic guide to fifty hikes in teh State of Connecticut. Its easy to scan through and pick out easy hikes from hard ones as they ordered well. Some basic maps are provided and light overview of the trail.However, if you want more information, you are based served to research on the Internet. You will discover that some of the Nature Centers are part of other organizations. And these larger organizations offer different and alternate hiking trails. In other words, the book is a bit outdated.The moral of this review is for you to investigate these trails further as only a basic overview is provided here. Therefore, the three star rating sounds appropriate."},{"Title":"If Not for the Cat","review":"For years and years now a curse has been floating over Jack Prelutsky's head. The curse reads, and I am quoting here, \\"Thou shalt make no silly poem books without being compared, first and foremost, to Shel Silverstein at all times\\". Mr. Prelutsky has labored under this curse for years, finding his own way to express himself but undoubtedly gritting his teeth whenever someone, however innocently, says, \\"It's good. But I think I like 'Where the Sidewalk Ends' better\\". View now Jack Prelutsky's greatest hour. In this, quite possibly the best book of haiku for children, he has teamed with remarkable watercolor artist Ted Rand to bring us one of the most beautiful, most well-written, and most deeply moving books of poetry to hit the market in a long long time. I don't usually bite my cheek in frustration when a book is not awarded a Caldecott Honor after publication, but I do so now (painfully) in spades.The book contains seventeen sweet and simple haikus. The titular poem reads, \\"If not for the cat / And the scarcity of cheese / I could be content\\". This sort of sets the tone for the rest of the book. For once, Prelutsky isn't afraid to bring out the big guns. He throws out large words that kids will learn simply by reading the poems in the context in which they occur. Says a jellyfish of deep blue, \\"Boneless, translucent / We undulate, undulate, / Gelatinously\\". The humor of these poems is of a slower sweeter nature than you'll find in books like, \\"Baby Uggs Are Hatching\\". A particularly Yoda-like sloth comments with baby on its chest, \\"I am slow I am / Slowest of the slow I am / In my tree I am\\". I better stop copying down these poems word for word, but you get the idea. They're all remarkably well-written and some carry a slight philosophical bent. Of these, the sweetest and most meaningful comes from the surprising source of a mother kangaroo and her joey.The pictures? The pictures are breathtaking. It's no wonder that the image of a hummingbird sipping nectar was taken as the cover of the New York Public Libraries Best Children's Books of 2004. Using a mix of sumi brush drawings in India ink, traditional watercolors, chalk, spatter (no idea), and printmaking techniques on BOTH rag stock watercolor paper and rice paper ... well let's just say a lot of work has gone down here. I could literally flip through this book all day just staring at the images. Whether it's a small delicate white moth nearing a homey if dangerous candle flame or a sweet playful otter cracking red spiky urchins on its tummy, Rand has given us a book that is truly worth reading.At a certain time of year teachers will enter my library and ask for recommendations of haiku for their children. Before, my suggestions were always half-hearted well-I-heard-this-was-goods. Now I have a book to be excited about. Even if you don't particularly like haiku as a form (like myself) you will adore this book. It brings out the best in its author, its illustrator, and the style itself. One of the few must-purchase picture books currently in stores."},{"Title":"If Not for the Cat","review":"A visual feast.A literary delight.(You'll feel for the mouse.)Haiku is simple enough in theory: it's three lines, each with five syllables, seven and then five again. Here, poet Prelutsky and illustrator Rand show how the simple can be made sublime in the hands of true masters.A third-grade friend, having looked at the book and heard the 'rules' of Haiku, immediately composed a poem to her pet hamster:We scurry like mice.We run from nighttime to dawn.We are soft and cute.(I'd mention that my friends are now e-mailing each other in Haiku, but if you hadn't read the book, you wouldn't understand...)This book is a treasure for children of all ages.And would someone PLEASE get that poor mouse some cheese!"},{"Title":"If Not for the Cat","review":"This anthology of poetry includes a variety of haiku poems by Jack Prelutsky. The poems share a common theme of creatures including both animals and insects. An index at the back of the book details each creature's name.This book was extremely interesting to me because I enjoy writing Haiku, but I know it is often disliked by young students because it is often quite symbolic in nature. In contrast, Prelutsky's collection is somehow insightful enough to keep adults intrigued, yet simple enough for children to enjoy. I think Prelutsky's work in this collection might inspire some young writers to try Haiku poetry.In the classroom, I might use this book as a morning mystery reading...reading one poem aloud each day and encouraging students to guess the animal being represented. Then I would reveal the animal at the end of the day. I would also encourage students to find the patterns in the words and attempt to write their own animal Haikus."},{"Title":"If Not for the Cat","review":"I use this book when I am teaching forms of poetry and when I am teaching the Word Choice element of the 6+1 traits of writing. Beautiful illustrations and the haikus are absolutely lovely."},{"Title":"If Not for the Cat","review":"Jack Prelutsky, If Not for the Cat (Greenwillow, 2004)The problem with If Not for the Cat, Jack Prelutsky's marvelous book of guess-the-animal senryu, is that there's not nearly enough of it. It runs forty pages, which is about right for the preschool set, but couldn't we have done one senryu and awesome illustration per page, instead of giving each a two-page spread? Yes, this is very good stuff indeed, introducing toddlers not only to animals but to (pretty well-crafted) poetry as well. Sequel, please! *** 1/2"},{"Title":"If Not for the Cat","review":"This is such a sweet book..................even though it is aimed at children, it caught my attention in the waiting room of our vet's office. I was recently involved in an arts exhibit where writers in our community wrote haiku poems and we visual artists made art to express our reactions to or interpretations of the poems. It was very successful and so is this collaboration between Prelutsky and Rand."},{"Title":"If Not for the Cat","review":"elegant textfinely illustratedfun with haikuMy 6th grade students loved the book and were very motivated to write their own haiku riddle poems."},{"Title":"If Not for the Cat","review":"This was a great book to teach inference, syllables and poetry.

I use it in my 3rd grade classroom to use while teaching poetry and the kids love it. I usually introduce the idea of haiku, then read them the poems in this book, keeping the pictures to myself. As I finish each poem I have them guess the nature-related subject the poem is referring to. Then we discuss how haiku poetry is generally about nature. After that I have them write a haiku of their own. It usually comes out in the style of this book! The kids love to guess each other's animals from the poems.Great book, really! The kids love for me to read it to them over and over again, even though they already know what animals the poems are about."},{"Title":"If Not for the Cat","review":"This is a collection of haiku poems. There are 17 in all. Each poems is about a different animal.

In this novel, against a background of violence and fear. When I first read 'Fair Stood The Wind For France' as a schoolboy, I was attracted by the story of the heroic RAF bomber pilot shot down behind enemy lines in France, and his efforts to escape back to England. As I read it I realised that war was not heroic and glamorous, but filled with fear and disfigurement. Hardly an unique epiphany to be sure! But what brought it home to my fifteen year-old mind was Bates' simple illustration of his hero contemplating his inability ever again to open a bottle of wine and pour a glass. A banal task whose infinitesimal pleasure is usually lost against the noise of our lives. Bates brings home the happiness we can glean from the everyday, through his ability to conjure beauty from the mundane. Read this book for the beauty that Bates can evoke. Read it again to learn the value of a moment."},{"Title":"Fair Stood the Wind for France","review":"Bates write so well, i am starting a project to read everything he has written"},{"Title":"Fair Stood the Wind for France","review":"I would recommend this book to anybody, as it would appeal to all ages from teens onwards.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"Before writing this review, I browsed to see what other readers thought of this book- I agreed with most and was happy to see that others have gotten out of it what I have. But Richard Bexborn, poor unfortunate soul knows nothing about what he is reviewing; apparently he hasn't read many books on the subject or he would have known that no other book in print matches the techniques, spiritual ethic, or experiences of the author. I have been astral projecting for 20 years and wish this book had been in print when I began; it would have spared me many dead ends. Ms. Druhan has written a deeply informative and beautiful book that contrary to its back cover, ascends all New Age hype and nonsense other authors have attempted to make an intelligent seeker-reader swallow. Bravo, Marlene Marie Druhan for Naked Soul, an antidote for all those &quot;other&quot; books out there that make us think that &quot;daydreaming&quot; is astral projecting or make us fall asleep. Thanks for the poetry, too. Your book stands by itself and speaks for itself. I will spread the word!"},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"I have been searching for a good book on spirit loves, and this book turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. The details she gives of the planes she has explored is beautiful and encouraging. She manages to weave her own personal experiences expertly into the book, and goes beyond the cut-and-dry writing found in many other projection books. I love the way her techniques focus more within than without. I have been trying to conscious project for a couple of weeks now. I used the Heart Center method given in her book the day I got the book, and managed to get into a state that induced one of my first conscious astral projections. And even though I was only out for a few moments, it was worth all the effort I've put in it! I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more on astral projection or spirit lovers."},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"Why can't I find more on this book or this author? This book was the only book that spoke to my heart both as a reader and a spiritual seeker. I've read the most popular books on the subject and found them disappointing (didn't work for me) or b-o-r-i-n-g. Not this one. I can proudly say that I have had two successful out-of-body journeys since using the author's techniques. Fantastic read. Can't wait for her next one!"},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"I read and then bought the book out of respect for the author. I really enjoyed it. It's specific, and full of insight. Plus she describes some very wonderful adventures. I have yet to Soul Travel. One of the things that bothered me is that even though she writes out of love and care, I became very fearful at some of the things she describes. I can't help but think that if i have to take so much precaution, then there must be some very nasty things out there just waiting for me to leave my body. Particularly of the experience she had when a entity tryed to take posetion of her body. It made a big impression on me. I did not enjoy her lower astral experiences, it scared me shitless. I have thought about suicide in the past as an alternative to coping with life. NEVER AGAIN! In many ways this book is a must read for anyone wanting to Astral travel. Nontheless, I suggest you read atleast two or three more books on the subject. Get some different perspectives. Thank you Marlene for sharing your woderful experiences. I feel your love and care. J.Z."},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"This I have found to truly be one of the best book written on astral projection. The writer gives full detail and is not vague on any subject. The writer herself is a wonderful person who I have had a chance to meet, because she is a patient to my father, a chiropractor. If u are looking for a book to tell you all you need to know with personal experiance this is definately the best."},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"Excellent! What's most amazing is that I know I was meant to read this book. (I'd tell the crazy story, but I've been asked to stick the the book's content.) I love the chapter on preparation and protection--although the possible negative situations can be discouraging. I especially love the outline of planes and subplanes. Marlene's explainations are clear and she has answered MANY questions. I am just beginning the second half on the soul traveler as lover--which was never my interest to begin with, and if I would have paid closer attention to the cover I probably wouldn't have bought the book. But I'm so glad I did! One question to Marlene: is there ever a language barrier? (If I went to France would I understand French?) I say to you all, &quot;Buy this book!&quot; Thanks Marlene!"},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"I have been very interested in Astral Travel &amp; Projection for a number of years . And I just have to say that this book is one of the best that I have read yet. It has more than just information on how to do so,It has what to be careful of &amp; What to look for when you are ready to do the exercises. I also think that &quot;Marlene Marie Druhan&quot; is a Great Author because by the time you are through reading her work you not only feel close to her , but you want to continue reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"This book was astonishing. If you wish to astral travel and find out about the subject, this is the book. This book will never bore you because Miss Druhan avoids cliches and uses detail and metaphors to describe what some astral travelers only feel. Miss Druhan also adds panache to book with her own personal experience. The book is somewhat divided into two parts. The first and larger is devoted on insight and how to achieve astral travel. The latter is about romance and love (even if you don't wish to develop romantic relationship when OBEing, you don't have to read the love part and the first part will tell you about and on how to achieve OBE's)."},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"Druhan is a great writer. She is very emotional in her way of expressing her own experiences on the astral planes. She is no doubt a veteran traveller, and explains thoroughly what the reader can expect and what to watch out for. It is precisely for this reason that I take a step back with only three stars to give her. I am sure that many people, certainly children, might find it comfortable to have someone holding their hand while crossing the street, but I just get a bad taste in my mouth. Hold the reader's hand she does, sometimes so hard that it hurts. She tells you about all these horrible, evil places you must avoid, how you must act when meeting the various denizens, and actually warns you from getting too intimate while in the planes (I thought that this was the purpose of the book)! She rambles on and on about her guardian spirits who watch over her and protects her from all those &quot;evil&quot; forces. Her writing-style, however, is entertaining and her descriptions of the astral environment are very colorful. The techniques for leaving the body are excellent, although they can be found in any book about astral projection (quite a number of repeats, given the amount of such books available). So where does all this leave us? My advice is as follows: If you are looking for a sensual ride full of &quot;new age&quot; love, kindness, and moral whatchamacallits, written in a open-hearted and earnest way, then this book will hold your hand throughout its contents. If you practice the exercises regularly and follow Druhan's advice, you might soon be a successful traveler, however candy-coated your experiences might be. If romance is what you are looking for, you will find it here. If astral lovemaking is your main interest, and you want to &quot;meld&quot; your astral body with other entities, this book will inspire you to it. If you want a more &quot;carnal&quot; sexual intercourse where anything goes, however, this book will be hard to read and Druhan hard to agree with. I say learn to project, through this or any other book, and then find out for yourself. Go where you're not supposed to go and do whatever you like. The matter ultimately isn't between you and Marlene Marie Druhan, but between you and the denizens you might meet on the astral plane of your own magickal universe!"},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. It's loviest book I've ever read on soul traveling. Very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"I bought this book originally because I became aware that I have been experiencing astral projection since a very young age without my knowing what it was, and upon having a bad experience - realized that I needed to learn how to protect myself. This book has explained things that I have already experienced, validated that I am indeed NOT crazy LOL and helped me to feel a lot safer doing what comes naturally to me. Miss Druham's beautiful words are utterly inspiring, even when describing that which is truly indescribable. I cannot recommend that anyone buy this book over any other or anything of the sort, because this is the only book that I have read on this subject. All I can say is that I feel that I have been wonderfully blessed by this book coming to me like it did. I am empassioned, empowered...I am full of life, love and essence! I thank you, Miss Druham, for the encouragement, inspiration, compassion, wisdom of your experience and for sharing that which is so personally you."},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"This book is a classic in its genre- no wonder why it is out of print.

I question how she could have guides with her, supposedly to protect her and yet have to wrestle with some evil entitiy. Where were her guides at the time then? This just will not do.I am left wondering where she did actually go. I have read so many different accounts of other dimensions and the after life that I am sure now that no one on this side of life has the truth. I know that the spirit world does not want us to know the truth. I say this because I personally have been lied to by spirits from the other side and have been the victim of fraud and deception from them. They only wish to spread discord and disharmony amongst people on earth by making them all disagree with one another and keeping them in ignorance. The only truth I know is that there is no truth over here.To conclude : I could only read this book as a work of fiction and as such it was entertaining and diverting."},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"This book is just a bunch of romantic bs.

So if you got no one to sleep with, the internet is too impersonal and expensive, well then you can astral travel and see if there is someone out there for you. The author's intention is certainly not to treat the astral plane as a dating service, but rather for the experience of losing yourself in the embracement of energy with another soul. While sex is not the same, it is a union of energy, be it atomic, molecular, or even electric. The aurhor, Marlene Marie Druhan, gives some elementary, yet clearly stated, preparations in order to achieve the out of body experience. Once this discussion is over, she moves to her experiences of astral travel, various forms of spirits and so on. To me, all of this is subjective and cannot be quantitative data as she stately puts. What she describes in some cases sound less of an astral experience and more of hallucinations. There is nothing wrong with hallucinations, however, she fails to differentiate between the astral or hallucinations. Her descriptions of possessive spirits and incubuses and succubuses seem as though the body is being pushed by other spirits own wants and desires. There is no doubt experimenting with mind expansion of any kind can be scary as it unlocks secrets chambers of the brain and body, as well as creates a unique connection with the spirit, I would hesitate to rely on Ms. Druhan's perceptions as accuate. Once we are in the astral world, there are things we can describe, however, it would be foolish to believe that others would be able to see them with you. But if you are regularly entering the Astral Plane on Friday nights, then by all means, prove me wrong. Validate what the author wrote."},{"Title":"Naked Soul: Astral Travel & Cosmic Relationships","review":"Almost all mystics from the Sufis to the the Tibetans talked about a &quot; City of a Thousand Lights &quot;.

The killer looks right at Susan, knowing she might be able to identify him.

Susan learned a recent lesson of what happens to a good Samaritan when she gave a statement to the police identifying a thief only have the cop shout out her address. However police officer Gene Udell knows she is hiding something, but will risk his life to keep Susan safe beyond the call of duty as he has fallen in love with her.THE HUNT is a solid police procedural romance that will keep the audience on the edge of the seat as Susan finds avoiding her responsibility fails to protect her. The \\"Assassin\\" is an intriguing protagonist as he is a cold-blooded killing machine treating murder like a day at the office. Though the FBI acts like the stereotype of the old image and not the \\"improved\\" model as related to Congress, Christie Rose's tale is a fine novel that will spur readers to desire more romantic suspense novels from this budding star.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Hunt","review":"Holy freaking cow.

I started reading it for that reason only. I was so glad I did. It's been a long, long time since I picked up a book and didn't put it down all day until I was done! Thoroughly enjoyable. Ms. Rose paints a very realistic picture of an everyday woman who is forced to change herself in order to survive. The suspense and turns in the story kept me guessing until the very end.

I understand that point -of- view. There is so so much in Russell's life and thought that inspires admiration. He is by all accounts a great philosopher. He was a truly masterful writer, and his 'History of Western Philosophy'did the seeming impossible and made reading about the subject interesting and entertaining. Russell was a maverick and went his own way in the world of political thought. He may have been a fool when it came to Communism but he surely was right to see the dangers of a nuclear world, and courageous to fight against them. His zest for life, his ability to appreciate and enjoy so many things in life is certainly an admirable quality. He wrote with vigor and clarity and often great wit and humor. He could recognize the value of others, as for instance in his championing of Wittgenstein. He did seem deeply disturbed by human suffering and care deeply to somehow lessen it. Yet the personal cruelty stands strongly against him, and he would seem to join a long list including Marx and Gandhi of ' cruel humanitarians' . His atheism too disturbs me because he shows so little emotional understanding of the needs of religious believers. Russell was very thin and that thinness seems to me to somehow capture something of his essence, also his prose. He lacks a certain complexity, a certain kind of depth that comes in going deeper inside the heart and soul. He was a very great thinker, and writer but I do not believe that as a human being he had the highest kind of feeling and understanding for others. Perhaps one of the greatest 'flat characters'of the twentieth century, a century which also had a few 'rounded ones' of greater human complexity and intensity."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1914-1944","review":"It's Bertrand Russell.

Simple yet deep, elegant and unadorned, always fresh and looking at things objectively yet with deep feeling.The book is always informative, engaging, and frequently hilarious.One of the nicer things about the book is the inclusion of some letters from others. Usually these are luminaries. The one from Will Durant, together with Russell's curt rejoinder, is marvelous.Russell has the knack of taking what could become boastful incidents--his imprisonment for objecting to WWI, his hair-breadth escape when his plane went down near Norway in WWII--and turning them into humorous, self-effacing ones.He also has the knack of talking about horrendous personal difficulties in a way that is objective and nonjudgmental."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1914-1944","review":"One may hypothesize that all works of philosophy are in essence works of self-reflection. From blatant examples such as Augustine's &quot;Confessions&quot; to more subtle parts of Descartes' &quot;Meditations,&quot; philosophers have often used their own experiences to help us understand the world we live in. In this sense, we can contrast to the former works the works of philosophers such as Aristotle or Heidegger who shy away from using the first person and deal with subject matters not only strictly of interest to the writer, but which seek to gain popular understanding. Bertrand Russell is a curious mixture of the two approaches. His committment to objectivity and to rigorous thought that is arguably impossible without a certain degree of &quot;common ground&quot; frequently seems to overshadow his own subjectivist foundations in which he approaches the questions of philosophy. In what is perhaps the most powerful two pages of the book, at the introduction, Russell outlines three primary principles that have motivitated him to do what he did in life. In a sense, then, the autobiography provides the reader with comforting answers as to why anybody would wish to live such an amazing life. In this sense, it is perhaps Russell's most self-reflective work of philosophy. The book is entertaining, the stories enjoyable, and the message deeply profound: how Russell came to appreciate the fields that he was interested in, and how he found the principles that guided his life. He had also been kind enough, in the edition I read, to include copies of letters of correspondence and pages from his diary as a youth. While this may have been motivated by a less-than-humble desire to provide future scholars with primary source material to study himself, they are themselves works of philosophy, and many of the doubts about life Russell struggled with as a youth strike a chord in all of us. Indeed, Russell's Autobiography is an entertaining and personally illuminating approach to one of the most fundamental philosophical questions of how one's life is to be lead."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1914-1944","review":"+++++\\"Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind...Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth.\\"This is how philosopher Bertrand Russell's (1872 to 1970) autobiography begins. This book (first published in three separate volumes) is brilliantly and simply written, emotionally charged, witty and wise, honest, and historically interesting. It spans almost a century of social and intellectual change. I would say that it is one of the great autobiographies in the English language from a man who was a towering intellectual and humanitarian figure of the twentieth century. As well, this book confirms why Russell, who authored more than seventy-five books, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950.His prize according to the official Nobel Prize internet site was awarded \\"in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought.\\"Throughout his book, Russell describes his philosophical disputes and quarrels, his rise to honors, his many friendships with high profile people, and his religious and social self-questioning. He was a maverick that stuck to his convictions even if they got him into trouble (he was jailed at age 46 and again at 88). He never failed to stand up and be counted on any matter that stirred his conscience and ideals.A highlight of this book is that it includes the actual letters between Lord or Earl Russell and a long list of influential people of his time (many whose names are easily recognized today) at the end of each chapter. As well, illustrations (mainly in the form of black and white photographs) are found throughout.Even though this autobiography is to me brutally honest (for example, \\"I used to...watch the sunset and contemplate suicide. I did not...commit suicide because I wished to know more of mathematics\\"), I felt that Russell was holding back on revealing certain aspects of his life.Finally, the last words in Russell's autobiography are found in the postscript:\\"I have lived in the pursuit of vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, and for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe.\\"In conclusion, be sure to read this autobiography and learn more about this extraordinary and unique man!!(first published 1967-1969; acknowledgements; introduction; 17 chapters; postscript; main narrative of 730 pages; index)+++++"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1914-1944","review":"Russell lived a long and fruitful life, and for most of it he had been a very controversial figure. You shouldn't read Russell just to agree or to disagree with him; you should read him to know what he has to say about a topic. The great historian Arnold Toynbee compared him to Plato's philosopher who is responsible for descending back to the cave to enlighten those that have not seen the light. One of Russell's most important characteristics is that he was a great writer, and this truly shows in his autobiography. Reading this book, one is inclined to ask himself over and over again \\"what have I done so far?\\" It's probably not fair to try to compare yourself to Russell because the only thing that would lead to is insanity.

Passing from the same Bodhissattva-like musings elsewhere, he relates, on the next page or so, how he tried to strangle a friend in a rage. He can be sympathetic and even kind, but for a would-be Boddhisattva and fighter for the rights of women, he seems to have hurt a lot of ladies, in particular, rather badly. Yet his friendships in general, with both sexes, seem warm and affectionate.I docked the book a star because the version I bought (Bantom) seemed dishonest in its packaging. The front and back covers show an old man, though this version only covers the period to 1914. On the back cover, it promises \\"more exciting episodes than most novels, details more intimate than most exposes, and more intensity of emotion than most fiction writers would dare ascribe to a single hero.\\" Largely hype. This is not Dumas, or Augustine. It's a different kind of story.Someone else on the back cover calls Russell \\"a Genius-Saint.\\" Genius, maybe, but the second accolade implies very low standards for sainthood. The book did make me think Russell a more balanced figure than I thought. But part of that balance appears to have been something like madness, and something like cruelty.

He began this 1951 book with the statement, \\"Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind... I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy... [and] because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined.\\" (Pg. 3)He recalls that as his older brother was tutoring him in Euclid, Russell was \\"disappointed that he started with axioms. At first I refused to accept them unless my brother could offer me some reason for doing so, but he said, 'If you don't accept them we cannot go on,' and as I wished to go on, I reluctantly admitted them pro tem. The doubt as to the premisses of mathematics which I felt at that moment remained with me, and determined the course of my mathematical work.\\" (Pg. 40)He observes, \\"The [1900 International Congress of Philosophy] Congress was a turning point in my intellectual life, because I there met Peano... in the space of a few weeks, I discovered what appeared to be definitive answer to the problems which had baffled me for years... I was introducing a new mathematical technique, by which regions formerly abandoned to the vagueness of philosophers were conquered for the precision of exact formulae. Intellectually, the month of September 1900 was the highest point of my life.\\" (Pg. 232-233)Interestingly, he records what can only be described as a mystical experience he had in 1901: \\"Suddenly the ground seemed to give way beneath me, and I found myself in quite another region. Within five minutes I went through some such reflections as the following: the loneliness of the human soul is unendurable; nothing can penetrate it except the highest intensity of the sort of love that religious teachers have preached; whatever does not spring from this motive is harmful, or at best useless... At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person. For a time, a sort of mystic illumination possessed me... The mystic insight which I then imagined myself to possess has largely faded... But something of what I thought I saw in that moment has remained always with me...\\" (Pg. 234-235)He admits, \\"The strain of unhappiness combined with very severe intellectual work, in the years from 1902 to 1910, was very great. At the time I wondered whether I should ever come out at the other end of the tunnel in which I seemed to be... in the end the work was finished, but my intellect never quite recovered from the strain. I have been ever since definitely less capable of dealing with difficult abstractions than I was before. This is part, though by no means the whole, of the reason for the change in the nature of my work.\\" (Pg. 244-245)He wrote (perhaps surprisingly, to some readers) to Gilbert Murray on December 12, 1902, \\"From heaven we may return to our fellow-creatures, not try to make our heaven here among them; we ought to love our neighbour through the love of God, or else our love is to mundane. At least so it seems to me. But the coldness of my own doctrine is repellent to me; except at moments when the love of God glows brightly.\\" (Pg. 260)Russell was one of the greatest intellectuals and public figures of the 20th century; his story is essential reading for anyone interested in philosophy, mathematics, politics, and modern history."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1914-1944","review":"I already owned the later autobiography, which was excellent, but this earlier account really 'fleshed out' who the man really was."},{"Title":"'Ohana O Janet Stewart, Visual Songs of the Islands","review":"A tropical cornucopia of beautiful images and good feelings awaits you in this visual celebration of Hawaii and &quot;Ohana&quot; - family life.

There is also a belief that a natural flow of energy exists which should not be blocked and that all elements- living or non-living- should be aligned in a way to facilitate this flow of energy.Vaastu shastra is an old Indian text that contains the principles of building construction and placements of objects within it, in accordance with the principles above. But in view of the religious nature of the Indian people, this text explains these principles more in terms of Gods rather than energy. It uses eight directions instead of just the cardinal four. This ancient text contains instructions on things like the shape of the plot, timing of construction, placement of various rooms around the house, home decoration and even the direction in which the inhabitants sleep.&quot;Vastu in 10 simple lessons&quot; has been written as a starter book. Ancient Indian text allows some flexibility and suggests some alternatives, but only to a certain degree. The author, on the other hand, allows wide latitude- maybe rightly so. After all, the rules of vaastu are not binding but are suggestions. The more principles the readers incorporate, the better- vaastu shastra claims- will be their life. The author explains various principles in context of their traditional significance and relevance to modern day life. Some people confuse Vaastu shastra with feng shui. In spite of the goal being the same, the principles in these two tomes are entirely different and may be at conflict with one another. The practitioners can practice one or the other but not both.

Really, this is just a variant of Old Earth Creationism, adding the phenomenon of process. We read in the Bible that God \\"formed man from the dust of the earth...\\" (Gen. 2: 7 ). The word \\"formed\\" is also used in verses such as Jeremiah 18: 4-6 for the potter and the clay and implies step-by-step building rather than instant creation.The author of this book advocates theistic evolution. Also, I do give him credit for his goal of trying to integrate science with the Bible.However, the end result here is a very flawed and not-well-thought-out book that needs to be extensively reconsidered and rewritten. I have actually met the author and told him of my concerns but did not get very far. His book HAS POTENTIAL to be good, but only with substantial reworking.The problems come in two broad categories. The first has to do with the corruption of the creation. Callahan has no problem acknowledging the fall of Satan. Fine. That's a Biblical concept. But even here he makes questionable assertions. He assumes the fall happened billions of years ago before the Big Bang. However, it is very doubtful that Satan rebelled before the universe even existed. After all, the angels are part of the creation! We really don't know at what exact point Satan rebelled. We do read in Gen. 1: 31 that the completed creation was \\"very good.\\" It is actually possible the fall of Satan happened after the finished creation. Callahan also estimates that there are \\"100 billion, trillion angels,\\" based on the idea of one angel for every star. Why would there be one angel for every star? He gives no explanation and his estimate is purely arbitrary. He also seems to be contradicting himself there, since he also claims the fall of Satan (an angel) occurred before the universe (including the stars) was created.But a key omission is that the author says absolutely nothing about the Genesis account of the Fall of Man. This issue is absolutely crucial and a foundational element of the Christian faith. We read in Romans 5: 12: \\"Therefore, just as through one person sin entered the world, and through sin, death; and thus death came to all...\\"The \\"person\\" here is not Satan. It is Adam. Why did Christ come to earth? To reverse the effects of Adam's fall (which of course was influenced by Satan). See Romans 5: 18.The issue of the curse is further elaborated on in Gen. 3, explaining the results of the Fall. Callahan does deal with the creation of man in Chapter 5 of his book, but the fact that the Fall of man is irrelevant to him frankly amazes me. His idea that the corruption of nature came purely from the fall of Satan is incomplete and inaccurate. For a short but effective effort at integrating the creation and fall of man with evolution I highly recommend the chapter \\"The Fall of Man\\" in C.S. Lewis' book \\"The Problem of Pain.\\"The other part of this book that is very problematic is his chapter titled \\"Is the Bible perfect?\\" Callahan writes that the Bible \\"is flawed both in its communication of religious and philosophical principles and recording of objective facts.\\" This is not only a heretical statement but a very dangerous downhill slope that can potentially result in one not believing anything in the Bible.I think Callahan could benefit by doing two things: 1. Take a course (or read a book) in hermeneutics to learn how to properly interpret the Bible beyond a surface-level reading and 2. Read \\"When Critics Ask\\" by Norman Geisler which explains many of the supposed contradictions in the Bible.Callahan gives some example of what he considers to be \\"flaws.\\" A satisfactory explanation (showing they are not \\"flaws\\") can be given for any of them. He quotes Eccles. 3: 19 saying \\"A human being is no better off than an animal...All is meaningless.\\" He claims such a statement would not be inspired of God and dismisses the idea that the verse is out of context. First, he apparently isn't aware of a particular rule of hermeneutics: The Bible shows many of its characters, warts and all, and includes some verses in which God sovereignly allows fallible humans to express their frustrations. That is the case here and there are other examples such as David in the Psalms. We don't embrace their passing wailings of unhappiness. We embrace what God does or can do in their lives. So Callahan's example is hardly an example of a \\"flaw.\\"He insists that the verse is not out of context but ultimately it is. Eccles. 3:19 is talking about all being meaningless WITHOUT GOD. It has to be read in the context of the entire book and particularly chapter 12, especially verses 1 and 13 that pull it all together and talk about man's duty to God. The latter verse tells us to fear God and obey his commandments. If we do so, our life will not be meaningless.He also refers to three passages in Acts-9: 3-19, 22:6-16 and 26: 12-18 all of which have Paul relating the story about his conversion experience on the road to Damascus. Callahan claims the third version is a contradiction because it has God directly telling Paul about his mission as opposed to Ananias doing so as explained in the other two versions. But an explanation for this is that Paul was simply giving a condensed version of his story in the third account. God had previously spoken THROUGH Ananias to Paul, but when Paul speaks to King Agrippa, an unsaved king whom he was evangelizing, he simply said God spoke to him, which ultimately He did.Another example by Callahan is his claim that a contradiction exists in the Genesis account between 1: 24 and 2: 18-19. The first says animals were created before man while the second (according to some translations) has God forming animals after the creation of man. But let's look at this more closely. The NIV translates 2: 19 in the \\"pluperfect\\" (past perfect) tense, as saying the Lord \\"HAD formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field...\\" (emphasis added). Commentator H.C. Leupold in his book on Genesis supports translating the Hebrew word \\"yatsar\\" this way as well. This is consistent, therefore, with the account in chapter 1.Callahan also sites the passage in Genesis in which Cain is banished but has a fear of people. He says \\"There is no mention of Adam and Eve having any other children until after Cain killed Abel.\\" \\"No mention\\" does not prove there were no other children. Callahan is making an argument from silence here. Adam and Eve may very well have had many children that were not mentioned. I know that is an argument to support where Cain's wife came from as well.So in answer to Callahan's question: Is the Bible perfect? My answer is: Yes. It is perfect according to God's sovereign plan and purposes-even if we don't fully understand everything in it.Three books I recommend that are far better than this one are: 1: \\"The Language of God\\" by Francis Collins, 2. \\"The Christian View of Science and Scripture\\" by Bernard Ramm, and 3. \\"Genesis and the Big Bang\\" by Gerald Schroeder."},{"Title":"The Case of the Backward Mule","review":"The Case of the Backward Mule, by Erle Stanley GardnerA big steamer arrives at San Francisco. When Terry Clane disembarks the police take him in for questioning. A friend of his girlfriend was arrested for murder and convicted, but escaped on his way to San Quentin! Chapter 3 describes a sample \\"lie detector\\" session. Questions and answers are recorded on wax records. Clane uses his imagination to stymie the questioning [instead of a tranquilizer pill]. We learn about one of the eight Chinese Immortals, seated backwards on a mule. It may symbolize life where you can see the past but not the future. When he is released Clane visits the Stacey Nevis Investment company. Chapter 4 gives the background to this story. [The dollar figures are way out of date, but were a small fortune then.] Clane goes to Cynthia Reston's apartment, and is caught in a \\"mouse trap\\": the police are watching (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 takes us for a visit in San Francisco's Chinatown, and the contrast in culture. Chapter 7 tells of the murder of Howard Farnsworth. Edward Harold was convicted on circumstantial evidence.Chapter 8 explains the politics and publicity in surrendering a wanted man. Terry Clane goes to meet George Gloster at his office, and finds him dead (Chapter 9). The questioning of Clane is as interesting as a courtroom scene (Chapter 10). Clane explains the Chinese philosophy that good or bad fortune is relatively unimportant, it is how you react to it that is important. The story continues (Chapter 11). Clane meets Bill Hendrum and explains why Edward Harold must surrender. Clane surmises what happened to Gloster (Chapter 13). Inspector Mallory shows up, and Clane's apartment is searched again (Chapter 14). Clane follows the \\"back trail\\" of Edward Harold, and locates him only minutes before the police arrive (Chapter 15). Clane's involvement leads to his arrest as an accessory (Chapter 16). This provides a way for Clane and Harold to discuss this case while in jail (Chapter 17). [Could the police be listening to their conversation?] Have the police been following and using Clane as a bird dog to flush out the game (Chapter 20)?This book shows what a fast-paced story Gardner could write when not doing the \\"Perry Mason\\" novels. You will note the presence of legal details not found in the works of Hammett or Chandler. The story could be an example on the proper or improper handling of fortune. It provides a snapshot of that era (arrests without a warrant). San Francisco, with one of the largest Chinatowns, had no police officers who could speak Cantonese!

My main concern is that Clavell glosses over the immense human misery that was the opium trade and really doesnt do justice to the selfishness and cruelty exhibited by the people involved, many of whom are the ancestors of prominent families in England and American today(Just Say NO!

Tai Pan is part of Clavell's History about Japan and goes well with ShoGun.This book was a previously owned copy, but for our purpose that is just perfect. This was not a collector's item, it was meant to be used and enjoyed. The hard cover edition is better since it will hold up to the teenager who is reading it.

You have to read this book!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"A very good book, too bad that this kindle versions has so many typing errors. It should be reviewed. On some pages there are two typing errors."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"The first time I read Tai Pan was in college 30 years ago. I picked it up reluctantly, despite a strong recommendation from a friend, because it was about China and Hong Kong about which I had little interest. But I read it nonetheless and was absolutely transfixed. I've just finished reading it again at age 54 and can heartily still recommend this book.This is the story of the founding of Hong Kong as told through the fictional characters of Dirk Struan, his son Cullum, their arch-enemy Tyler Brock and many others. Dirk Struan is the Tai Pan (supreme leader) of the Noble House, the largest and strongest of the China traders. Tyler Brock is his sworn enemy since Struan first served aboard an English man-of-war and experienced the lash from Brock's hands as a \\"powder monkey\\" at Trafalgar aboard the 110-gunship Royal Soverign.Clavell uses Struan as the embodiment of the best virtues of the English system with her rule of law and the Chinese system. Brock, while not without redeeming qualities, reflects some of the worst features of the English system. Struan is receptive to the virtues of the Chinese culture while remaining a patriotic Englishman.Struan has acquired many of the habits of the Chinese including bathing 2-3 times a day (as opposed to the rest of the English who believe that bathing renders one susceptible to the \\"flux\\") wearing light cloths and boots, and many others. He takes a Chinese concubine, May-May, and has children by her. His eldest half caste son, Gordon Chen, from a previous concubine plays a major role as well.Struan is no saint, particularly when viewed from the perspective of the 21st century, or for that matter even when viewed from the perspective of his own time. But he is one of the most intriguing fictional characters you're likely ever to come across. This book was first published in 1966 so the idiocy of PC had not yet reared its ugly head. And this book pays little heed to the silly PC concerns of our time and is correspondingly refreshing.If you like your characters strong, raw, unadulterated, and realistic and love a great story line this book will not disappoint. My only misgiving about the book was that it had to end at 732 small-print pages. The good news is that the book Noble House, though it takes place 120 years later does continue the saga of the Noble House and provide the follow-up on the characters that you come to know and love in Tai-Pan."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I just finished reading Tai-Pan for the second time. The first time I read it was nine years ago. At that time I was sure it was one of the best epics ever written. Now with nine more years of wisdom I am convinced. Clavell writes a fascinating tale of ruthless men and women in 19th century Asia. The dialogue is at times witty and the ending is the best I have ever read. I am now faced with the grim task of trying to find another book to read that comes close to the grandeur of this novel."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This thoroughly enjoyable historical novel captures the atmosphere of China and Hong Kong in the mid 1800's. Dirk Struan, hero of this adventures, is a strongly written character who you can't help admiring and cheering on. I loved the way Clavell weaved together a compelling story with such descriptive details and historical facts that advance our understanding of characters and events. Because of this book, I read Jonathan Spence's history &quot;God's Chinese Son&quot;, which I also recommend. I can't recommend the novel strongly enough for fans of historical fiction"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Despite being overshdowed by it's suposedly better books in the Asian Saga, Tai-Pan is the best novel Clavell wrote. Having read all of the series more then once I can truly say that Tai-Pan is far better then Noble House and even Shogun. It's Clavell's shortest book(except King Rat) but still has all the magnificient plot lines. Dirk Struan is the Perfect Hero. He is not perfect but his power is felt even by the reader. Despite sevrel reviews that said that Clavell shouldn't have written in pidgin this from gives credabilty to the novel. The ending is Clavell's best, it is the perfect soultion and the book ends still in a climax. Tai-Pan is captiviting from the start and the 732 pages flow by as if they were just a few. I give this book 10 stars out of 5. A MUST READ"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"In our age of cultural decadence, political correctness, contempt for Western Civilization and the general destruction of the \\"hero\\" as an ideal - there stand a few voices that recall a time when Men still understood what honor and virtue meant, and acted upon it.James Clavell's Tai Pan is a book to read for all those starving for a vision of life possibilities and for the hero within us. Dirk Struan is a man who should be every boy's Father once in their lives, and for those of us not fortunate enough to know a man like this, Tai Pan fills the void perfectly.While not living by an expressed written philosophy, Tai Pan Dirk Struan is a man who stands for reason, individualism, science, objective ethics and free trade. In essense, Dirk is a Classical Liberal or Humanist in the true sense of the word.The story itself is a brilliant one and I find myself reading the book again every few years to remind myself of what a man Clavell was and what a wonderful world he created for us to live in.P.S.For those who believe that Clavell was a racist because he accurately transcribed what \\"Pidgin\\" (chinese-english lingo) sounded like, you are not reading the same book."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Not as great a read as Clavell's Shogun, it is still a good read and an absolutely necessary read if you are going to enjoy Clavell's \\"Gajin\\" and \\"Noble House\\", which follow the descendants of Dirk Straun, the original Tai-Pan. Unlike most books in a relaqted series, Straun's Asian series gets better with each subsequent book.Best way to read these books is in chronological order, not in publishing date order. Start out with Tai-Pan.If you like historical novels, Clavell is the James Michener of Asia."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Being in China at the time made James Clavell Tai-Pan even more special than the book by itself already is. It was no coincidence that I bought the book while being in Shanghai. I already read the book in a destant past. And I could clearly remember that I thought it was great. And it still is. Tai-Pan tells the story of a man called Dirk Struan who is the owner of a big trading house called Noble House. The setting is Hong Kong 1841. The island has just come under British rule and everything is not yet well. China is at that time still a big mystery for Europe and the different world powers of that time strife to conquer it. It's a bit the same as our present time in fact. The book is truly a masterpiece. I can really recommend it to anyone who like this kind of book. The good news is that the other books by James Clavell are as good as this one. The only one I havent read is Whirlwind because that doesn't especially appeals to me. It's also the only one which isn't set in the far East. Anyways if you haven't read any of his work yet, start reading!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Do not be discouraged by the book's seemingly overwhelming thickness. The pages will melt away down to the last word thanks to the riveting story and the realistic, enjoyable characters. Clavell has successfullly combined two things that I have never seen woven together so skillfully: grand setting and intricate story. The book takes place in newly acquired British Hong Kong, the Age of Sail is at its glorious peak, and the nations of Earth are converging on China with hopes of garnering a profit from one of the most isolated governments in the world. The story involves a prolific cast of characters, each one distinctly colorful with his or her own unique flavor and mannerisms. Clavell carefully chronicles subtle interactions between the characters, allowing the reader to feel very personally involved in the story. I expected many dull moments in book. Usually when authors try to combine big settings with detailed characters and events, the story gets either 1) stuck in endless details and minutae or 2) so generalized and impersonal that you might receive greater stimulation from Cliff Notes. This, however, was never the case in Tai-Pan. Every word and sentence and dialogue in the book is necessary and tantalizing. Each detail either develops a character or moves the plot or paints the setting. There's no &quot;filler&quot;, in other words.A novel of this scope that is wholly riveting and &quot;fat-free&quot; is a true gem. This was my first Clavell, and I look forward to some more of his work. Tai-Pan is an experience for the mind and the imagination."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This is a fictionalized account of the life of William Jardine (called Dirk Struan in &quot;Tai-pan&quot;)- founder of the trading giant Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Ltd. This is the &quot;Princely Hong&quot; which is refered to as the Noble House of Hong Kong in Clavell's books.This book is riviting- and somewhat illuminating historically. If you long for the good old days- take a peek into the 19th century- you will change your mind real fast!This book grabs you from the first pages, and holds you till the last- it is a masterpeice!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"James Clavell began his Asian Saga with &quot;Tai-Pan,&quot; and in doing so brought the Far East to life in an unparalleled fashion.&quot;Tai-Pan&quot; tells the story of Dirk Struan, Tai-Pan (&quot;Supreme Leader&quot;) of Struan's, more popularly known as the Noble House. First in everything (money, influence, panache, daring, etc.), the Noble House has tied its future to the rise of Hong Kong, which is &quot;founded&quot; in the book's first chapter.Struan, who has founded the Noble House with the vast fortune he built as an opium smuggler along the Chinese coast (many of the trading houses in &quot;Tai Pan&quot; owe their fortunes to opium smuggling, although they euphemistically refer to themselves as &quot;China Traders&quot;), has used his influence in Britain and with certain Chinese figures to take Hong Kong for the British crown as a toehold in China. Guided by his near-mystical vision of the importance of China to the world's future (at this point, China is considered by many Europeans to be a profitless wasteland populated by &quot;heathens&quot;), Struan will fight and kill to defend Hong Kong.Newly widowed, Struan is comforted by his Chinese lover, May-May, who is also one of Clavell's most wonderful characters. Teetering on the verge of a stereotypical &quot;dragon lady,&quot; May-May is a woman of courage, cunning, refinement, humor, and great beauty. Clavell lets May-May speak in both English (hilarious malaprops abound) and in Chinese so the reader gets a true picture of May-May's intelligence. Prejudices being what they were, Struan is forced to keep May-May under wraps, as it were, although the legend of the Tai Pan's Chinese mistress abound.In addition to the loss of his family, Struan must contend with Tyler Brock, his one-eyed nemesis and leader of the second most powerful trading house, Brock and Sons. Brock and Struan have a deep-seeded hatred that is doomed to head for a reckoning. Brock, constantly maneuvering to best the Noble House, has quite a few tricks up his sleeve, and he forces Struan to make a dangerous gamble with the future of the Noble House.In the novel's most intriguing sub-plot, Struan can ensure his financial status only if he accepts four half-coins from his Chinese mentor, Jin-Qua. Anyone who presents the other half-coin to the tai pan can have one favor granted -- no matter what it is. A chilling bargain, and one that flows through Clavell's future novels (Noble House).Through it all, Clavell goes to great lengths to capture the clash of cultures on Hong Kong -- from the British, American, Chinese, and Eurasian perspectives. The sheer scope of man's prejudice is staggering!As pervasive as the racial conflicts may be, ulterior motives also abound. Virtually every character in the novel has a wide range of goals, ambitions, and plots they are trying to weave, and Clavell handles this vast plot with great skill.Struan, clearly the dominant character of the novel, does not quite reach superhero status, which shows proper restraint by Clavell. Struan is forced to cope with Culum, his resentful, conflicted, naive son, as well as his brother, Robb, and of course May-May. Struan struggles mightily, but he demonstrates that even the Tai-Pan is all too human.All in all, a wonderful tale of the founding of one of the world's great cities, Hong Kong, and an expert treatment of the clash of cultures between East and West. A must read!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Last summer, I re-read James Clavell's best seller, SHOGUN. After a quarter century, I had forgotten what an exciting adventure this was about the English captain, Blackthorne whose ship crashed/washed ashore in 16th Century Japan in a land torn by tribal/clan warfare; ruled by warlords, kingpins, and the mighty shogun Toranaga. Clavell brought to life the culture of the Orient with vivid detailed accounts about the lives of common villages, slaves, and noblemen who ruled by harsh and long-held cultural tradition. After re-reading, SHOGUN, I was ready from more exciting historical adventure about the Far East. Yet, I had to put off purchasing another of Clavell's novels, because I was committed to reading a series of non-fiction literature to prepare for an lengthy essay I had to complete.Finally, it was time to purchased, TAI-PAN!Clavell did a great job with TAI-PAN. This novel was as good as SHOGUN. It is a tale [set in the mid-nineteenth century] about the founding of Hong Kong, told from the perspective of two ruthless adversaries who fought for control of the obscure island along mainland China; the Englishman, Dirk Straud and Tyler Brook. Both are bitter rival traders who compete for the spoils of the Orient. Yet, it is the wit and determination of Dirk Struan who emerges as the founder of Noble House during the height of the Opium Wars.Again, Clavell tells a story as rich, complex, intricate, and colorful as fine Asian tapestry, which lures the reader into the lives of the characters. And it is Clavell's expert creation of exciting characters, which makes his novels all the more enjoyable. We meet the cunning, the treacherous, the exotic, the witty, the boastful, the loyalist, the proud and the brave. With each character we meet, we come to learn about the history of the Orient and the era; and the cultural, political, and social circumstances, which shaped the characters motives and made them so very fascinating.I also applaud Clavell for his ability to untangle the webs of prejudice, contradictions, superstitions, and customs when characters are thrust into cultures which are so foreign from their own. Yet, he manages this superbly.TAI-PAN is another fine novel by James Clavell. And, for those who enjoy historical fiction, I recommend that you add this to your collection.Maizie Lucille JamesMay 24, 2010"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"A great read about the Far East.I purchased Kindle because I'm on the road often and Kindle is perfect, especially the scalable text.

I had a harder time reading this, because the conflict centered more on the Westerners than what was happening in China (as opposed to Shogun) but it is still a good read, and I am now reading Gai-Jin."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I did not expect to find another novel by James Clavell that I liked as well as Shogun or King Rat. But Tai-Pan is, indeed, that novel. This is a magnificent saga of the founding of Hong Kong by powerful British trading interests, which manipulate the British government towards establishing Hong Kong as Britain's trading outpost in the Far East.Even more, this is the story of an unforgettable fictional character, Dirk Struan, founder of The Nobel House, the leading British trading combine in China. Struan is determined to open up China to Western trade, and to \\"bring China into the family of nations.\\" This novel is his story, and it is wonderfully told. Struan and the other characters in this novel spring to life, and this is an absorbing novel that is almost impossible to put down. Struan struggles to combine the best traits of the British democratic system and the wisdom of China, of which he notes, \\"the Chinese are a wise smart people, even if they don't build good cannons like Europeans...\\" and he admonishes his ship's crews to adopt Chinese practices of good hygiene and other sanitary practices. In this novel Clavell explains the opium trade, and how it came to be an evil that was nevertheless central to the China trade in these times.This is a novel of intrigue. Struan and his Noble House are locked in a life-and-death commercial and family blood feud with Brock & Sons, another powerful British firm that vies with The Noble House for primacy in trade with China. And the intrigue does not stop there--Clavell introduces us to a breathtaking 19th Century Russian scheme for world dominance in which Struan manipulates Britain, Russia, and the fledgling United States as the world of this time, the 1840s, is seen to be racked with war and political and economic conflict.This is a fabulous novel of China that no one should pass up. Five stars."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"\\"Tai Pan\\" is, of course, one of the books in James Clavell's \\"asian sagas\\" and in my opinion it ties with \\"Shogun\\" (chronologically the earlier of the two) as the best. The later books forego some of the adventure and get too involved for my taste...Its about the opening of China to world trade in general, and the development of Hong Kong in particular. The main character is Dirk Struan, a Scotsman, adventurer, and self-made man of his time.There's lots of good reviews about the plot already posted here, so I won't review that other than to say it moves VERY well... I will offer a few thoughts by way of a review:I haven't researched it, but wonder if Struan is based on a real life character in the way that John Blackthorne (the Angin-san of \\"Shogun\\") was based on a real Englishman named William Adams (look him up on Wikipedia; fascinating life). I would not be surprised if there is a historical basis for Dirk Struan.Some of the opulence described in \\"Tai Pan\\" is a bit fantastical, but thats ok - it does not harm the book. Clavell also does a great job of simplifying a complicated subject, namely the world trade of the era, the opium-silver-tea trade, and really hits on the 'clash of cultures' of Asia vs the expanding Western world.I mentioned opulence above. I've noticed that in both \\"Shogun\\" and \\"Tai Pan\\" theres a definite pre-occupation with the subject of cleanliness and food. Interestingly, Clavell as a kid or young man was a prisoner of the Japanese in WW2. He was held in the notorious Changi Prison where he experienced the brutality, neglect, and culture clash between Europeans in Asia and the militarism and rascism of the latter years of the Japanese Empire. These POWs - military or civilian internees - all experienced hunger, filth, neglect, random violence, lack of medicine, etc etc in a horrible environment... Seems to me this is the source of Clavell's recurring descriptions of food and cleanliness. I think this definitely shows in his earlier \\"asian saga\\" books. So I can't help wondering if in his books, CLavell was dreaming of an Asia adventure as he wished he could have experienced it, as opposed to the ordeal he himself went through in prison... Just an idea.Great book; I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I have probably read this book around four times through the years. Clavell hooked me with Shogun and just when I thought it could get no better he gave us Tai Pan! This is a book that makes good use of the history of the time to weave a tale totally believable about all too human characters. Whereas at times I found the characters in SHogun to be a bit one dimensional and whereas I found the characters in Gai Jin to be just plain without any redeeming qualities (aside from several of the Japanese characters) in Tai Pan Clavell blends in just the right amount of humanity (for all it's good and bad points) with some actual movement in the story and it does move fast! Dirk Struan, the main protaganist, is a man who has had to work for everything he has in life and due to a quick mind and ruthless drive he has built up a lot in the prosperous Noble House. Yet he has made enemies on his rise to prosperity and the character of Brock who bullied him in childerhood as the belligerent first mate on his earliest voyages now resents Dirk for having passed him and his own shipping company by. Two men who are but a hairsbreath of being in actuality the same now must strive against pompous British officials, crafty Chinese mandarins and ultimately each other all for the honor of being the one Tai Pan!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"As a sailor I am blown away by this book.

Shogun and Noble House are wonderful reads but to me Tai-Pan is James Clavell's masterpiece.These novels were written by a man who lived an extraordinary life. He was an ardent believer in free trade capitalism as a way to improve life for all and peace between nations."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Taipan: this remarkable word has two different print characteristic choices, two different meanings, and two different species attached to it, and both of them are venomous. Easy to read, hard to put down, Clavell pens an intricately spun tale, obviously familiar with his subject, based on historical events - of how Hong Kong became the central trade center for the East, and of the diverse and complicated men who made it happen. As with most big money, it's roots grew first in the dark, taking nourishment from human misery in the second oldest profession - drug smuggling. It's first potential power mongers emerged like reproductive spores exploding from the fungus of Opium; and the fierce, mercenary elimination of the competition moved relentlessly until only a few remained. The strong and the nasty overwhelmed the lesser rivals, the vast wealth and greatness subsequently influencing trade throughout the world while being controlled by just a few men. Rising from such a nefarious beginning, it naturally followed that the \\"cream rising to the top\\" in such an environment would be of a nature incomprehensible to most of us; and the corruption that bred and nurtured it during it's rise lends well to an exciting tale indeed.The conflict consolidates between two ruthless, ambitious and narcissistic men. Dirk Struan, the larger-than-life human lion with his personal trademark of red-gold mane flowing behind him in the headwind of his ship, and his one serious adversary Tyler Brock, with whom he shares an initial history of hatred and abuse that shaped him - hatred that matured savage and calculating in it's intensity. These two rough and self-made men, one dictator, one of a diplomatic persuasion, are locked in a deadly competition for all of the money, power and privilege to be had at the top of such a food chain - not just part of it, but all of it. Within the first few pages, the reader gets the impression that it is about much more than all of the above; it is inherently about male ego, pride, dominance - the absolute evidence of who is \\"the better man\\" and nothing less will do. They are professional rogue merchants of the high seas that operate under a loose and dubious \\"code of honor\\", even going so far as to be partially civil to each other if the occasion warrants it, but the true nature of their blood and death conflict is never hidden from the other.Struan is of a different, broader business discipline than is Brock, even as his personal involvement knows none - having several Chinese mistresses and at least one acknowledged offspring from one of them that is being groomed within the Noble House, although there is slim chance he will attain the stature needed to take full control, at least for the moment. Struan also commands an intimate (very) knowledge of everything else Chinese, even as he is carefully guiding his power and political clout toward a foreign government he feels will better serve his trading activities; his one obsessive thought that takes precedence over his own personal gain, even as it is intimately tied to it, is to be an influencing factor in establishing China as the major trade and shipping point of the East - and under British Rule rather than the oppressive edict of the Chinese dictators. Possessing clairvoyance as well as the intelligence and diplomatic mien to make these ideas happen, Struan surges ahead and the two adversaries become fiercely locked in a personal and professional power struggle to attain the title of \\"Tai-Pan\\" (foreigner who heads the business) - the Number One. Naturally, It is a quest that never sleeps; the vigilance can never relax, but the outcome is never really in question. But how the torch is passed is unexpected, even as it should be expected - and the reading of this monster of vice, greed and slippery dealings requires reader commitment, as it is almost 600 pages in length.Central to the tale, and the part that I found most intriguing were the \\"four favors\\" that were exacted of Struan by a Chinese merchant in exchange for an unexpected financial backing after the banks failed and left him penniless with his entire empire at risk. The uniqueness of how they are granted and protected against deception, as well as how the markers are called in, is very effective in holding the reader's interest. Favors owed span generations - and are like seeds tossed by the wind, lying dormant, but ever waiting for the timely moment to take root again.There are a lot of difficult names to keep track of as would be expected in such an environment and I found myself back tracking to make sure of who was who and why they were doing what they were doing."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I read this book 25 years ago, enjoying very much reading it again.

It takes the reader back in time when Englishmen first were coming to China. A &quot;Tai-pan&quot; was a leader. Like leaders in all places and times, those who would be leaders here have more risks and rewards, then the common man.This is the story of one such leader, a very uncommon man, a trader who son has suddenly come to him from England. As such, while he is struggling with his competion, and the Chinese, he is also struggling with his willful son.The story, by itself, is well written and very interesting. For me, what made it fascinating, was the detail about the culture and times, in which, it occurred. For example, we learn that Chinesse women liked to paint their teeth black - to be sexy. They also brushed their teeth, with tea. Strange as it sounds, it was better then the English, who did not brush at all and usually lost them all by age 30.Where does Clavell get these facts? I don't know if everything he wrote, as such, is true. But, based on the way it was written, it certainly seems to be the case. These details, which flow from this book, add to its charm and made the read one of the more enjoyable experiences I have had in years."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I never thought even Clavell himself could come close to matching Shogun, but he did. This book was great from cover to cover and now ranks #2 on my list of all-time favorites. I can't do the book justice by trying to describe it here. Read it! Disregard the poor review by Gigounas below...he can't even spell the main character's name correctly!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Of course, that's just my opinion. None the less, TAI-PAN is a wonderfully written book that delivers in all the right areas. The characterization is great, the setting is great, the action is just right, and the whole thing is well researched. Clavell's my favorite author, and I thought nothing could beat SHOGUN until the last 20 pages of this book. A supreme ending for a supreme character."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"You may read a novel as good as this one, but you will not read one that is better. The characters are rich, and realistic. For some reason I was rooting for the bad guys, the Brock family, until Clavell made the son to be some kind of sexual monster. There are lots, and lots of well defined characters to love, and hate, and plenty of conflicts to make the book hard to put down. I loved the way the characters were always challenging each other to duels. I laughed frequently, at the entertaining dialogue. When Brock accused a naval officer of having so much wind that if he farted doors across the island would be blown out, I had to reread the page in enjoyment several times. The book was also educational in giving the reader some idea of the historical background to the settlement of Hong Kong."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"While Tai-pan is not as good as Shogun, it is still one of the finest books around. It provides an insight into the history of Hong Kong, and the British empire in the orient. It is also the story of a man's quest for money and personal glory.What I especially liked about this novel, was the fact that Clavell did not use a sterotypical, saintly, knight in shining armor protaganist. The book's main character, Dirk Struan, is a power hungry, manipulative opium tycoon, who is willing to do anything to succeed.I highy recomend this novel to anyone who has an interest in the time period, or to anyone who likes a good story."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"As a Eurasian (english-chinese, no less) born and raised in Hong Kong, I was brimming with anticipation when I bought Tai-Pan (especially as I had already read the even more brilliant Noble House-- see its reviews! that book is an easy 5 stars).Anyway, Tai-Pan is amazing in many ways and flawed in others. Clavell really captures a lot of the underlying tension, stereotypes, and often unfortunately true feelings of the british towards chinese culture (and vice-versa). Clavell tries very hard to present a fair view of the era and culture of the time, even so far as to really truly develop a genuine and believable love story between the Tai-Pan and his Chinese mistress (I think he MUST have had experience himself to understand the chinese female psyche so well!).Anyway, besides certain comments that I did not like (that seemed to put down the chinese and especially 'half-caste' eurasians), the book is eminently readable and cannot be put down until finished!Nevertheless, Noble House is even better-- but read it second!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This was the first James Clavell novel I read. I still find myself coming back to it to re-read. Yes, it's that good. In all his works, Clavell writes on a grand scale but from an individual perspective.This book centers on character Dirk Struan, a Scot China trader and \\"Tai-Pan\\" - supreme leader of China traders - of the Noble House. This is a tale of the founding of Hong Kong colony and the opening up of China to the rest of the world. Struan admires China and adopts many of their customs. His adversary is the one-eyed Tyler Brock of Brock & Sons, another China trader who will do anything to become Tai-Pan and vows to destroy Struan.This book is truly literature on a grand scale. There's history, politics, culture, action & adventure, romance...you name it! Clavell's dialogue is brilliant and his command of the languages used is marvelous. It's a joy to read as well as a real page-turner! I thought this book was better than Shogun, personally.Great book! Five stars!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"The review posted below is in error. I have an old version of Tai Pan published by Dell. The current version is published by Random House and I have no reason to believe that it contains the typos that my Dell published version has. My apologies. I have just purchased the Random House version of 'Noble House' and have every hope that it will be as professionally produced as other titles that they have produced for the Kindle.The Kindle version is riddled with typos as a result of a flawed print to digital file conversion process coupled with a lack of proofing the converted file. Lazy and nonprofessional on the part of the publisher. Clavell deserves better. An excellent read otherwise."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"One of the great historical novels ever, a superb story, tremendous character development, a fascinating look at western and Chinese cultures at the time and very well written. I may be in the minority but I think this was Clavell's best work, even better than \\"Shogun\\". The character Dirk Struan is unforgettable as is his nemises, Tyler Block. Clavell is a master story teller. I wish he was still alive so he could write more."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Tai Pan was incredible. This was the first Clavell novel that I read, so I didn't quite understand his genius. Tai-Pan is a historical novel, meaning the events in the book are loosely based on true happenings.

Please read this book, shortly followed by the rest of James Clavell's novels."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This fascinating story of the founding of Hong Kong is a Clavell masterpiece, next to Shogun, my favorite novel. Clavell once again shows his amazing talent in crafting an intriguing cast of characters, so easy to fall into step with."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I read this on the pretext that it was next in line from Shogun. and I was expecting Shogun stuff. But there is not much (except for stuff about ships). This may sound dissapointing for a Shogun fan. But to my pleasant suprise that is not the case, this book has a magic of its own. Plus the book is mostly character driven (except for a typhoon who likes to make his presence known) and I liked it. Good love story too"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Look up any of Clavell's books and you will find a well deserved string of &quot;10&quot; ratings (I'm just stingy). If you have any interest at all in Asia and its history (admittedly sensationalized), you will love all of the &quot;Asian Saga&quot; books.Do yourself a favor and read ALL of the books, in chronological order"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I am wondering if this book might be a little dated. It was written about thirty years ago and in some ways was a precursor to many of today's swashbuckling thrillers. The scenes of action here feel a little tepid in comparison to what Clavell wrote in Shogun. I kept feeling like the story was building towards a great climax, but instead it ends softly and slightly unresolved. The ending is not terrible by any means, mainly because it is kind of unique. But this uniqueness also left me in a state of anticipation that was a little odd. I felt like Clavell had written 700 or so pages of precursor and that the interesting part was about to happen after the last page.This is a pretty long and involved book, Clavell goes into great detail, but on reflection it would have been even more satisfying if as an author he had been able to add just an extra layer of nuance or sense of place. You might wonder what I am trying to say here... the book is lavish in detail, but still contains not enough. By this I mean that only in select spots does Clavell stop and build a sense of place that will really put you in the world he is writing. Perhaps it is enough in that every forty or so pages he really slows down and offers this glimpse. But I would have enjoyed it even more if he had gone into side stories that might not have enhanced the linear plot but had instead grabbed the reader and given some insight into the characters of this world outside of the protagonists eyes.Tai Pan was a pretty decent read. I found that it did not compare with Shogun in it's over all historical sweep. The only other Clavell work that I have read is King Rat, a WWII prison camp story that almost worked like \`Stalag 17'. All in all, it seems to me, as an impartial observer, that Clavell's work lacks an over all punch that does not manage to blow the reader away. If you were a fan of Shogun's like myself, Tai Pan might be a little bit of a let down because it is lacking in the manipulative intrigue department. The story just plods along, unfolding without the finesse or character development shown so adeptly in Shogun.Wilbur Smith is a contemporary writer who has only just recently after a long career managed to piece together a trilogy that feeds upon Clavell's legacy with his Courtney Family books \`Blue Horizon' and the such. I would recommend these books \\\\by Smith over Clavell. If you have not read either of these authors and are looking for a comparison, I would say that Raphael Sabatini and \`Gone With the Wind' are precursors to the mindset that can be found here in Tai Pan. There are many better books out there that fall into this genre. In Tai Pan every thing is there for a rousing adventure, but it is left under developed and in many ways is stiff and un-pliable."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Ok, you take this book for what it is....a soap opera in 1841 Hong Kong. As such it is interesting with period details especially about sailing ships.Am always interested in picking up a little historical or technical information. My problem is the book goes on too long and I began to get real tired of the stereotyped cutesy Chinese characters and of course the swashbuckling Scotsmen too. Towards page 600 I began to hope some of the heroes would die and the evil ones prevail. Not good!If you are stranded in a blizzard in North Dakota it is passable. I give it a 4.5 on a 1 to 10 scale. Danielle Steele would rate a 3 on such a scale and Graham Greene a 7... Most boiler plate novels are a 4.That is what this is essentially a boiler plate novel. It gets an additional half point (4.5) for all the sailing ship and period Chinese information.Again it is simply too long don't start it if you are compulsive book finishers."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"James Clavell was second to none in decribing the charcters' reasining process. The reader can think he actually knows the characters. However, it seems to me like the author wanted to end the story and did it so abruptly. Unlike Shogun, many stories were left incomplete. This is why I didn't give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I found this novel a faily difficult read. As mentioned in another review, the broken English was cumbersome. It slows down a reader, who is interested in the plot.I did like the plot, which includes piracy, smuggling, deceit, and pride.I read this novel, so that I could read Noble House with ease by understanding the characters, etc. I'm only 100 pages into Noble House and can already tell that it is a better novel than Tai-Pan.I suggest to read this novel only if you plan to read the Clavell's series."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"One of the best books I have read. Best of all James Clavell's novels. The book is filled with adventure,mystery and continual intrigue. The characters are inter-woven to keep you interested in all their activities."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Set in the early 19th century, TAIPAN is the story of the self-proclaimed \\"China traders\\" - western opium and goods dealers to China. Of these, Dirk Struan controls the most profitable trading company; The Noble House. Struan is known as the Taipan, which is the title given by the Chinese to the most powerful of the \\"barbarian\\" traders. In order to keep his title and his company on top, he must keep the rest of the traders on his tail. As the book opens,the traders have settled on Hong Kong and are determined to make it the cornerstone of China trade. But while the rest of the dealers are hellbent on chasing the Taipan and the Noble House, Struan has another motive: To open China to western influence and to open Britain to China's influence. He must topple the obstacles in his path, which include handing over the title of Taipan and the Noble House to his brother Rob and son Culum, and defeating the most cunning of his opponents.Dirk Struan is a character who is revered by numerous characters as a God, and yet, is presented to us as a clever man with a remarkable amount of power. One element of Struan's character that he is able to use to his advantage countless times during the book is his ability to foretell peoples' responses to his actions. For example, Struan and his arch nemesis Tyler Brock are bidding on a piece of land on the island of Hong Kong. Struan knows that Brock will bid as high as he can and leave him with an enormous debt. So instead of backing down from the auction, he counts on his son Culum to donate the land to the church, though he doesn't ask him to do so. However, knowing his son, Struan predicts his son's actions correctly, and avoids losing a great deal of money.TAIPAN does a stellar job of combining an edge-of-your-seat plot, fantastic character development, and great description of Chinese life in the early 1800s. Perhaps even more interesting, though, is the insight author James Clavell gives into the minds of the Chinese. While this novel isn't classic literature in the sense that it can be analyzed thematically, I guarantee that the China traders and their enterprise will not only entertain you immensely, but will also educate you about life in China. This is truly a remarkable book, and I urge everyone to take the journey and follow its adventure."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Clavell's Asia Saga is a masterpiece of historical fiction. In this edition, Clavell captures the creation of a great trading house amidst several themes common to the series:- Characters with histories spanning multiple books- Western pioneers meet Eastern tradition- Intrigue at every turn- History and cultural lessons when you least expect them.Standalone, the book is fantastic. As part of the series, it is a treasure. Deep. Longlasting. For those impatient with the heft of the book (It carried me through several coast to coast flights), there is the video, but you'll lose quite a bit in the translation to film."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Tai-Pan is another beautifully written novel by James Clavell. His characters come alive in this intricate novel. The reader follows the witnesses of the beginning of Hong Kong. His accuracy in Chinese culture is amazing and makes the book an even better read. The characters are beautifully conjured and moving. The plot is suspenseful and breathtaking. The storyline takes us through the beginning of Hong Kong and deep into the heartaches and troubles of life in a developing colony. Tai-Pan is a gripping novel and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This book is a very worthwhile read especially if you can imagine a world filled with adventure and intrigue in an era when time was judged by the calendar not nanosecond. The characters are well written and very appealing whether they be villian or hero. The plot line is rich in historical content and dramatic embellishment. I would highly recommend this book and encourage the reader to plow through the sagging pace in the middle of the story to reach the climatic conlcusion."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"In the year 1841, in the wake of the Opium War, Britain has taken control of Hong Kong. Most deem it a worthless rock that serves as a poor spoil of war. But one man, Dirk Struan, Tai-Pan of the Noble House, the preeminent trading house in Asia, sees Hong Kong as his greatest achievement, for he believes it is the doorway to China, and British global supremacy. But Struan cannot simply rest on his laurels, as the goal of holding onto Hong Kong will intertwine with holding onto the Noble House, his remaining family, and the Chinese mistress whom he loves.After reading \\"Shogun\\", I wasn't in a hurry to read any of the other books in James Clavell's \\"Asian Saga\\". I enjoyed \\"Shogun\\" immensely, but Clavell wrote tomes, and I don't always have the time. But then I got to thinking about how much I really did love \\"Shogun\\", and figured what the heck, as \\"Tai-Pan\\" isn't that long. I'm glad I didn't wait, as \\"Tai-Pan\\" is an engaging and entertaining novel.Clavell writes strong characters, both male and female, and wonderful descriptions of people and setting. Clavell also has a strong talent for action and drama. Events that sound generally mundane, like the indebtedness of the Noble House, the politics of Hong Kong, and the various romances and love affairs are actually quite gripping events.Two key relationships set the course of this novel. The first is Struan's bitter rivalry with Tyler Brock, the head of the Brock and Sons trading house. Initially, Clavell starts this relationship in terms of \\"good and evil\\", as Struan is constantly portrayed in sympathetic and heroic terms. Although Struan frequently acts the devious manipulator, the reader usually sees his noble intentions. Brock on the other hand is a belligerent ruffian, missing one of his eyes, who delights in the brutality he can inflict. While this rivalry never loses its edge, Clavell wisely allows ambiguity to creep in, as Brock seems less an absolute monster at the end. Nearly every obstacle Struan must overcome stems from the mutual hatred he shares with Brock.The other key relationship is Struan's relationship with his Chinese mistress, May-may. As with the character Mariko in \\"Shogun\\", Clavell uses May-may as the reader's insight into Chinese culture, as May-may has taken it upon herself to \\"civilize\\" her \\"barbarian\\" man. None of the women in Clavell's books are ever weak or completely content to play the submissive role that society has placed them in (creative license on Clavell's part), and May-may is a perfect example of this. She's willful and shrewd, holding to her place, but using it to her and Struan's advantage. It's deeply written and honestly felt.Still, Clavell sets certain traps for himself. A great deal of the length of the book is made-up of minutiae that don't seem relevant. The first chapters of the book, roughly 50 pages, are dedicated to Britain officially taking control of Hong Kong. Clavell fills these pages with introductions to characters who wind up being plot-devices throughout the novel. Clavell tends to treat certain of the events are far more important than they need to be, and frequently beats us on the head with how \\"unjust\\" and scientifically ignorant the world was in 1841 (suggesting Clavell is aspiring to great literary significance). There are also a couple of plot-lines that don't immediately bear fruit, which I presume are dealt within one of the other books of the series. Finally, I was disappointed at the lack of important Chinese characters. While I realize that this novel is really about Hong Kong and not China, some insight into the leaders of China as they smash up against Britain would have been useful.It's probably true that Clavell was aspiring to something great, but missed the mark. While imperfect, \\"Tai-pan\\" is a very satisfying and entertaining book that engages the reader emotionally. Clavell was not Dickens or Tolstoy, but his works should be appreciated on their numerous merits."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I have to give this amazing book 5 stars for its grand and deep story and compelling characters. I've read it many times and it always satisfies. And it's true to the spirit of Hong Kong, which I've visited many times.I'm grateful to have Tai Pan available on the Kindle. But it appears to have been a hasty transcription -- perhaps an optical scan with little follow-up editing. I'm about 2/3 of the way through, and I've spotted what must be at least 100 errors, very obvious ones that a cursory pass through should have picked up. Practically any apostrophe is fair game for being combined with the character it adjoins to form a different letter not intended by the author. That's why I suspect an optical scan. I wonder if the Kindle distribution mechanism would permit an updated text of improved quality. That would certainly be welcome."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"...there are many similarities between \\"Shogun\\" and \\"Tai-pan\\", only the first is about Japan in 17th century, and the second is about China/Hong Kong in 19th century. However, both books have european (british) characters in the main role, and both books are based on the differences and struggling of these characters in a different environement.Dirk Struan is the Tai-pan (supreme ruler) of the Noble House Trading Company, one of the Hong Kong-based companies that provide England and Europe with the middle-1800s wonder: tea. Along the book, Struan has to overcome rival companies, murder threats, malaria, love interests and the supposedly dettachment of Britain towards having an Asian base on Hong Kong.Like \\"Shogun\\", \\"Tai-pan\\" has dozens of plot twists, many characters all involved with each other in one level or another, forces of nature, etc. Unlike \\"Shogun\\", \\"Tai-pan\\" has a very fast pace and the chapters follow one another with the speed of a Typhoon. In the beggining, the reader will struggle with the speed Clavell introduces his characters, and there will be at least 100 pages until you know who is who, but past that phase, \\"Tai-pan\\" is very enjoyable.Dirk Struan, the main character, sure seems a little super-human sometimes, but that's not something that will spoil the reading. In fact, Struan is the kind of central character that the reader will always relate to. ...P>Now I'm surely moving on to \\"Gai-jin\\" and \\"Noble house\\"."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"James Clavell's Tai-Pan once again throws you headlong into the East. His detail and insight into asian culture, be it fictional or not, is amazing. The story grips you immediately and has you on the edge of your seat (or dais) consistently throughtout the novel. It tracks the story of Dirk Struan, the most powerful of the China traders at the birth of Hong Kong. You despise his enemies, love his lovers, and have a sense of longing to be or at least know someone like him.This is the best ending of any novel I've read. What a triumph!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"James Clavell is a literary genius. Tai-Pan is a swashbuckling tail of a pirate-merchant named Dirk Struan, in the 1800's. He hails from Scotland, and deals in opium, fighting to keep his position as the \\"Tai-Pan\\", and secure his company as t he Noble House. He must fend off pirates, bandits, and ruthlessly competitive foes, such as Tyler Brock. I suggest this book to anyone with a love for adventure, romance, suspense, and betrayal. The book can appeal to anyone."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Clavell pens a masterful, character-driven historical drama. The only blemish that mars this book is the first chapter, which sports a surprisingly clumsy laundry list of characters. But if you can read past Chapter One, you'll never put the book down until you're done. Beautiful."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This is just a wonderful novel, Clavell at the heightof his powers, and an object lesson to anyone who, 40 years later, wants to write a big, sprawling, historical novel. One of the things that sets Tai-Pan apart from so many books in this genre is that the story is entirely character-driven, and the characters who drive it are wonderful: larger than life without being overblown, consistent throughout, and always engaging. I somehow missed Clavell when he was writing, but a few months back I decided to give him a try, and I have to say that when he's good, as he is here, he's at the top of the class. This is an especially tremendous read for anyone who's lived in, or is interested in, Asia, but it's hard to imagine anyone failing to enjoy it."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"After reading Shogun,I though there would be no way it could compare. I was wrong. Tai-Pan is a wonderful book, and I'm continuously amazed at how deep the charecters go, and how clever the Tai-Pan continues to be. It differs from Shogun in a couple of ways: There is more focus on the charecter than on the plot of the story, which tends to become almost predictable after a while. In Shogun you are reading about a man who has to do everything possible just to survive, but in Tai-Pan you are reading about a man who is already very rich and powerful, and he just wants to stay that way."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Just doesn't get better than this. I'd say it ranks right up with Shogun. The entire book is filled with everything you could ask for in a book (intrigue, suspense, action, intellect, love) and the ending is priceless. On reading the last paragraph, I threw my head back, laughed, then cried. Absolutely amazing work."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Tai-Pan is a wonderful epic novel. The story is fascinating on many levels. First, since it takes place in Hong Kong, there is a spectacular cultural and historical backdrop for the entire book. On top of that, the plot that Clavell developed is quite intriguing, and the characters are interesting as well. Finally, there are lessons on leadership and morality as well, for those who would like something more than an extremely enjoyable novel!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Tai-pan is a truly memorable novel and had me immersed from page one. Set in nineteenth century Hong-Kong, Tai-Pan captures the atmosphere as if you are there yourself, enveloped in a hierarchical world of conspiracy, mistrust, antagonism and insubordination. Featured around the very amiable Tai-Pan himself, Dirk Struan, is an epic storyline of 'The Noble House', the largest and most powerful China Trading company in Asia, and the problems that come with such supreme power.Tai-Pan not only offers a thrilling, fast moving storyline with profound and bold characters, but an interesting look into the historical context of Asia, ranging from culture and religion to the way Asians interpret Europeans. The novel is full of historical references and is a must for anyone interested in historical fiction. However it has to be said, I think this novel would be appealing to anyone who enjoys reading. An admirable edition to the Asian saga."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Tai-Pan was one of the most amazing and exciting books I have ever read. Starting out at the ceremony commemorating Britain taking over Hong Kong it moves over the period of colonization with the land sale and the movement because of malaria epidemic. Filled with action and interesting talkie style description it is a hard book to put down. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Tom Clancy or Clive Cussler as an imaginative historical epic of the best kind."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"James Clavell continues in the tradition of Shogun to deliver a wide ranging epic set in 19th century China. Set in exotic, imperial China, this book is full of action, intrigue and adventure as we follow the exciting quest of Dirk Struan, a larger life English trader, as he drives forward to establish the British in Hong Kong and himself as the chief ruler - Tai pan.A tale of intrigue, conspiracy and murder, with a touch of sex thrown in - the plot is fast paced and engaging. The characters are bold and colorful and, most importantly, have considerable time to develop and flesh out during course of this lengthy tale.I am not an expert in Chinese or English history so I can not vouch for the authenticity of Clavell's details but the book is full of historical tidbits about customs and attitudes of both the colonial English and the Imperial Chinese. The rich and detailed narrative really helps the book &quot;come alive&quot; and further involve the reader.Overall, this book is an engrossing read."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"What a great story this is as are all of the Clavell books. The detailed plots that are intertwined make for story telling mastery that will totally captivate the reader. Watch out if you start this book on a week night because as it was with Shogun, you might just miss work tomorrow so you can finish this engrossing tale."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I have read Shogun, Tai-Pan, Gai-Jin, and soon I'll read more. James Clavell rocks, and I love Tai-Pan. Dirk Struan is the greatest character ever."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This was my second novel I read over 400 pages, and I have read 20 or so since. Every easter I get this feeling that I need to read about greed, and absolute power, and every year but one, I have read Tai Pan. The odd year out, I read the sequel Noble House, which was above average, but Tai Pan just kicks butt!!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. It is a wonderful story with multiple plot lines, characters that have real depth, and well constructed themes. I have read this book again every several years, and each time I read it, I notice something more. I think this book is great literature. To me, the story by itself is definitely a 5-star.Having said all of this though, the translation to Kindle is rather poor. It appears that it was perhaps scanned in, and the some kind of optical character recognition was used to get the text into a digital form for Kindle. Unfortunately, something did not work well, because almost every page has misspelled words, typos, incorrect words, and similar errors. I would not mind a little bit of this, but it is to the point where it detracts from the reading experience. I hope that the publisher does better when they do \\"Noble House\\", \\"Whirlwind\\", \\"Gai Jin\\", and \\"Shogun\\". I have not checked out \\"King Rat\\" yet, and hopefully that does not have the same problems as \\"Taipan\\" does."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Tai-Pan is simply brilliant. It has everything, and James Clavell presents the story in a fascinating, well-written manner. The gritty history of the Victorian era is incredibly accurate and artfully portrayed. Clavell takes us masterfully in to the world of 1840s Asia, and we lose ourselves in the bustling streets, the shouts of merchants, the roar of ships' cannon, and the bittersweet romance of the age.The story itself, and the characters, are wonderful. The reader instantly falls in love with the magnanimous, charismatic Dirk Struan. We are taken along on his incredible, tragic life story, experiencing every one of his triumphs and failures in a grand journey of discovery and wonder. His friends, his enemies, and his lovers populate the already colorful world with a seemingly infinite cast of vibrant, lively characters, each of who we cherish and care for deeply.Struan's story, although it may sound trite, will keep you on the edge of your seat and riddle you with a whirlwind of emotions. This is a story about humanity, pure and simple, and the things that we hold dear, even when we are lost in a strange, foreign land."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I enjoyed this tale of the beginnings of the British occupation of Hong Kong. A good mix of action, Chinese culture, historical detail and geography!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Having read the excellent Shogun, I was afraid of being letdown with Tai-Pan. I wasn't. The plot was interesting, the pidgin dialogue amusing, and the history fascinating. Looking forward to Gai-Jin."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I'm an avid reader. This book remains as one of the top ten on my reading list! It's the formation of Hong Kong and its 99 year lease (that expired in 1997). Everything a reader could want: intrigue, glimpses into ancient culture and customs, pirates and torture, history, romance, and the connection between gold, opium, and tea. Fantastic and the first in a series of three.

Don't do the same, ready Tai-Pan, then Gai-Jin and King Rat (probably Clavel's best.) You should have already read Shogun but if not please do so.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I purchased this book, Tai-Pan, by James Clavell as a replacement for the 'worn out' copy that I had re-readtoo many times. All of Clavell's books are classics and are among my favorites. I am very happy with thequality and condition (new) of the Amazon edition of Tai-Pan. It also cost me only about a third of what theprice would have been had I ordered this edition from a national book store chain."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Start with Shogun by Clavell and work up to Gai-Jin, Noble House, King Rat and the rest of the Asian saga. They are tremendous and educational"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I've never read one of Clavell's stories before this. But I'm sure glad I read this one.From the first couple pages I was compelled to complete this lengthy novel. JC does a superb job of layering in his characters all of which are interesting and flawed. From the half-breed son, to the women, to the merchant culteure to the lead role of Dirk Struan, a corrupt and powerful man who is the Tai-Pan of Asia, meaning he is the supreme leader of his field of merchants.I particularly liked how JC used Struan's quasi-moral/religious beliefs in the word JOSS, which fluctuated its meaning from that of swearing at God to Karma. He was constantly trying to beat out his fellow men, mother nature, the Chinese Empire and even his own lovers and children in his pursuit of excellence.The rise and fall of ewmpires is the background of this great read and it was excellently apportioned and written by a man who I can now understrand the scope of his capabilites as a writer.this may have been the first of my adventures with james Clavell but it definitely won't be my last."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This is one of those books you don't want to put down. Great story that spans the life of its hero Dirk Struan. I can picture Sean Connrey playing Struans role in a movie. He would be the perfect Scottish ships captain. If there could be any criticism of this book, it would be that Struan is too strong of a character. He always out fights, out smarts, and has all the women attracted to him. The author introduces some unique pigeon allowing the characters of different cultures to communicate. It was also worth noting at while the British (and other Europeans) look down on the Chinese for their lack of sophistication and strange cultural practices, the Chinese saw them as barbarians. Of course our hero Struan was wise enough to listen, test, then adopt some of the Chinese practices. This was a great story and setting, I'm anxious to read some of the Clavell's other books."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I give this book and 8. The reason it isn't higher is because I felt that there was too much racyness for my taste. The story line and plot were intreaguing, and i was compelled my his historical rendation of the eventing surrounding Englands aquisition of Hong Kong. I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I was very disappointed with the upload. There are way to many typos and symbols that has been transported over, so you are left figuring out what the word really is."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I'll admit, throughout _Tai-Pan_, I couldn't resist comparing it to Clavell's shining star, _Sho-Gun_. Although Clavell's appreciation for the vast cultural differences between the Chinese in _Tai-Pan_ and the Japanese in _Sho-Gun_ is admirable, the similarities between the two books are just too obvious. In both, a Western hero struggles for power in the mysterious and often treacherous East, gaining more and more respect for the complex Asian world. Unfortunately, _Tai-Pan_ loses on all fronts to _Sho-Gun_. Where Clavell's protagonist in _Sho-Gun_ is subtle and complex, Dirk Straun, Tai-Pan (&quot;Supreme Leader&quot;) of the British Noble House Trading Company, has all the subtely of a comic book superhero. I literally cannot remember any point in the book when Straun was ever wrong, mistaken, fearful, rash, hesitant, or anything less than absolutely perfect. As the story progressed, I began to chuckle and then laugh out loud at every new escape or amazing feat performed by Straun. His superhuman infallibility became ridiculous to the severe detriment of any story Clavell was developing. A few of the other characters are passably well-developed, such as Straun's rival, Brock, who illicits both the reader's sympathy and ire. Overall, however, Straun's perfection kept me from ever doubting the eventual success of any undertaking he was involved in. This made for a less than thrilling read. Additionally, Clavell's observations about the stubborn, dirty, hypocritical, and brutish nature of European civilization was well-taken in _Sho-Gun_ and became tedious in _Tai-Pan_. Towards the end, I was reading for completion and not for pleasure. END"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Like many on this board, I picked up Tai Pan after reading Shogun. In my opinion Shogun is one of the top 5 novels written in the English language. Perhaps because of the expectation set by Shogun, I found Tai Pan to be a huge disappointment. Shogun was a story of empire-building and forbidden romance. Half way through Tai Pan, the \\"drama\\" centers around a pending beauty pageant and which two tea-carrying ships will dock first on a different continent six months in the future. I started, but was unable to finish, both Tai Pan and Noble House. For me at least, being a fan of Clavell turned out to be really just a fan of Shogun."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Not as good as Clavell's Shogun, and not nearly as good as many other great historical fiction novels. The first 30-50 pages were so slow, so boring that I stopped reading it multiple times. But impelled by the overwhelmingly positive Amazon reviews, I tried and tried again. I finally finished, and I believe the most valuable less I learned is to not trust Amazon ratings so much. (After all, they are mostly left by those who actually finished the book, meaning the thoughts of those too frustrated by a book to finish are not counted.) The story finally picked up, but remained a bit slow at times, and a bit too fantastical to believe. That said, it was quite interesting to consider the early history of Hong Kong and some of the political issues of the time and area.If you are looking for historical fiction specifically about the beginnings of Hong Kong, this is a good selection. But if you are looking for good historical fiction or a just a great book, there are many far better options."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Had I not paid for this book I never would have finished the first chapter. The entire first section of the book spans a period of about an hour, and yet for some inexplicable reason about ten characters silently recount their life stories to themselves while standing around waiting for a ceremony.This unnatural inward dialogue continues throughout the book, and to me it was an entirely ineffective mechanism for telling a story.There's not much of a satisfying story in these 700 pages either. Another reviewer was not exaggerating when they mentioned that the suspense half way through the book was who would win best dressed at a ball. From the book's size I was expecting a self-contained epic; in the end I got some resolutions to some lightly interesting plot lines with a fair amount of items left unresolved.I fail to see what the time and effort were worth."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This book is highly over-rated and very hard to get through. The author over-loads us with trivial details of complicated espionage. There is not much &quot;historical&quot; detail as I would have liked, as in the Michener books. Also, Dirk Struan is such an unlikeable character I couldn't wait for the book to be over so I wouldn't have to read about him anymore"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"this is a grear book a must readyes i must agree with you but that endung dirk strune getting killed thet was uncalled for but the wan culum handeled it was great i donot beleave thet may-may dies it was her servent AH-somthing that dirk hele in hus armes may-mat his tai-tai survived and left to go back to jin-qui where she lived out the restofher days"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"2.5 stars.I'll be honest: this book may have a good portrayel of English and Chinese customs and good historical accuracy (I'm guessing), but that's not what I was really looking for, not in a fiction book, anyway. What I look for in fiction, any fiction, is a book that's gripping and entertaining from start to finish. For that to happen the first thing you need is good characterization, which I think Clavell does reasonably well in this book, and secondly, ACTION. I found this book lacking in the latter. For an interesting book you need some type of coflict, tension, and this book really didn't have that much. Shogun(which is a 5 star book) had plenty to keep you interested, and I was hooked, and the only times that I got bored were a few sporadic instances scattered throughout the book that didn't last more than three pages. There was a lot of action, lots of conflict, characters' fates were uncertain, war was looming in the distance... There's a war in this book but it's only in the background, and there's no doubt that the British will easily defeat the Chinese, so there's no conflict there. Basically the only real conflict in this book is the enmity between Struan and his rival, Brock. Might have been a good sub-conflict, but as the forefront of a 700 page book makes the book lacking in terms of enjoyment. This book is divided into six parts. There's really only two sections of the book where there was enough action and conflict to get me really interested. The first was the ending of book one, and the second was of course the climax. The rest of the book, books two, three, four, and most of five, is mainly talking, planning, fretting, Struan arguing with his mistress, and more talking. It gets boring real fast, and then it gets REALLY boring. There were a few instances in which something would happen that would peak my interest, but it wouldn't be long before it faded into the boring monotomy that was so prevalent during the middle portion of this book. Honestly, there were many times where I nearly gave up, and the only thing that kept me going was my desire to read the other books and not miss out on anything. I got interested again when I got to the climax, and the good ending gave this book some redemption. But, compared to the ninja-attack climax of Shogun, the climax in this book is still a pale shadow. Shogun was the first book I read and this is my second, I'm reading them in order. I know that Shogun was his best, maybe it spoiled me for his other works. I know many people rank this as his second best. I hope that isn't true. But then again, I don't think I'm evaluating using the same criteria that the rest of you are using. The next book is Gai-jin, and just by reading the reviews it seems that it has more action and more conflict, more on the lines of Shogun, so I'm still game. And if you're asking me, &quot;You mean you'd really pick lots of action and conflict over intricate plots, good evalution of different cultures and social systems, and historical accuracy?&quot;, my answer is, &quot;Absolutely.&quot; All that other stuff is good but it comes second."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Tai-Pan is a very good book and definitely worth reading especially if you are interested in China and Hong Kong. It is the story about the development of Hong Kong by the British and the three rival trading companies that compete against each other. It also has a lot of historical facts throughout which I felt enhanced the story tremendously. This is definitely a great and unique story and very well researched by the author. I thought the characters in this book were believable and very strong.This book is not one that I would describe as an easy read. Like Shogun, it requires your full attention or else you will be lost. It is somewhat of a committment to read not only because of its length but also because of the dialogue. It's kind of slow reading. I do not think everyone will enjoy this book. I think men will definitely like it more than women. There are quite a few characters and it is important to remember who is who.The ending of this book was definitely a surprise to me. I was certainly not expecting it to end like it did.I will admit that this book was not nearly as good as Shogun. I loved Shogun, for it is one of my favorite books of all time. So if you are expecting that kind novel out of Tai-Pan I think you might be disappointed. However, this book was really entertaining and I am glad that I read it!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"First, many years ago, as each book was released, I'd read all of the Asian Saga, and loved each and every one of them. It takes a lot for a book series to stand out in your mind when you think back the first was released in 1975.While Shogun was my favorite, Tai-pan, Noble House, and Whirlwind, always stood out in my mind as I learned more and more about the global economy, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, etc. . . and America's love and focus of quarterly profits over long term strategy.As we watched China grow into an industrialized and economic powerhouse, my memory returned to the Clavell series, and how long term the Chinese strategy was compared to ours.Now, even though we have the most well trained and technologically advanced military in the world, we now find ourselves indebted to both Japan and China. Our country's deficit, and thus our future and standing within the international community, is held by these two Asian countries who are defeating us, not by military force (though the Japanese did try that in WWII unsuccessfully) but by outsmarting us with long term economic strategy.If ever a fiction series was prescient as to how our greed and arrogance would be used against us over generation to generation, Clavell's tightly woven and interesting books certainly have.For this reason alone, the Asian Saga including Whirlwind, should be a compulsory read in high school and by budding politicians.While our focus on the Muslim extremists is necessary, we cannot turn our backs on the threat China poses to our long term economic strength and sovereignty. The next President needs of have a firm understanding of how the Asian philosophy can and will continue to affect our lives.On a more book review basis, Clavell's writings are page turners, and create a story as tightly written and as all encompassing and engaging as the Lord of the rings series, or Dune, and Harry Potter, to name but a few.With the summer upon us, now is a great time to immerse yourself in a brilliant series which you don't need to wait years for the next book to be written. For sadly, Clavell passed away long before we were ready to lose him. It would have been interesting to see how he would have written about the current state of Asian affairs and those of the middle east, where the saga last brought us."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"The second (at least chronologically) in Clavell's Asian saga, where the focus is not on Japan and the Toranaga shogunate, but the birth of Hong Kong and the battle of two rival trading companies. Here again, Clavell's character development and forays into plots and subplots plays out masterfully and again I found myself bound to this book. While in theory, Shogun was the beginning of the saga, Tai Pan pretty much sets the stage for the bulk of the later books and, in my opinion, is required reading before setting off the explore Gai Jin and Noble House."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Smaller compared to his other works, the book is about HONGKONG and its TAI-PAN (supreme leader). Time is around 1840, British have just got the island from China. Now they want to make it a trading hub with China and external world. Chineeses want opium from the non-china traders inreturn for tea and silver.The story is about the initial settlers on the island, their struggle to make it civilized, competition within the traders and the Chinese who are difficult trade/ communicate with 5000 years old of civilization.This one is similar in most ways to SHOGUN. Former has background in Japan and TAI-PAN is in HONG-KONG/CHINA. Toranaga of SHOGUN is Dirk Struan of TAI-PAN with a similar plot. There is a chance that you may like TAI-PAN if you have read SHOGUN. My suggestion is to read these books with a time gap just to avoid thedeja vu feeling.What I liked about Clavell is his sincerity to the people of China, unlike some of the western JAMES-BOND kind of protagonists who go to the orients and people start bowing them.Also the ending is better than that of SHOGUN. Last few chapters are very fast moving. I liked the GOD-FATHER kind of ending.Clavell is best at non black and white characters. And he is loyal to his characters (Unlike Michener whose characters last single chapters and vanish to oblivion with out much significance). The book is character driven and you will love the characters long after the book is finished. I read the last few chapters at great length just because I knew that I am going to miss them once I finish the book.There are some loose ends I think Mr. Clavell will address them in NOBLE HOUSE, sequel of TAI-PAN.I also recommend SHOGUN by the same author and books by JAMES MICHENER and EDWARD RUTHERFORD for any one who liked TAI-PAN. Even though other 2 authors write semi-historic novels than character driven plots as by Mr. Clavell."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I dreaded the end of this book coming. I just wanted to keep on reading it indefinitely. It is set in a fascinating time and place, with rich characters who we definitely come to care about. It has humour, drama, and history. You'll learn a lot reading it."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"When I visited Hong Kong I was so impressed by the fountain of wealth that the city represents and having seen the film of this book made in 1986 - I wanted to read the book. I've not finished, but, as someone looking into Hong Kong and Chinese culture, I find the book absorbing, gripping and can related to its hero, Struan. I don't think there are many real Struans out there and in this sense this book is hyperbolic fiction.Having said this it is fiction based on fact and represents a fairy story of the birth of Hong Kong including its place names and heritage.I find remarks on Chinese culture especially useful and topical even in a modern context though Chinese readers will probably find the book patronising and one sided (having said this the book take pains to be fair, both sides view the other as barbarians a great deal). This is a sort of British version of events.Much of the book seems true, based on factual material on Chinese culture in relation to Hong Kong coming from Chris Patten in \\"East and West\\". Indeed the author has a good grounding in Chinese culture so I think his ideas are accurate enough.This book tackles mixed relationships, business negotiations, the Chinese and their ways, their systems of marriage ... and is a really good source of the elements that make Chinese culture so attractive, colourful and rich.As for the story. Well, it is gripping enough and I can't get enough of Hong Kong so I'm taking in every word. Pity that Hong Kong has reverted to China I say but hopefully China will become like Hong Kong in time rather than the other way around."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Unlike many of the previous reviewers, I have no particular connection to Asia or an extensive knowledge of Chinese history, rather I am merely a fan of exciting stories and great writing and if the novel is full of interesting facts, then all the better. Tai-Pan fits the bill.It is an engaging story about the European community in China just after the British have taken control of Hong Kong. It centers on Dirk Struan, a manipulative, shrewd, and charismatic man who happens to be the most powerful trader in Asia. There is intrigue, violence, romance and tragedy, but this all adds flavor to the epic story of how the British controlled their first stronghold in Asia. Clavell does an amazing job of creating realistic characters and incorporaring facts about the time period and his knowledege of the culture. Despite being a fictional account of this era, I learned a great deal about China, British trade and sailing in the 1800's.I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys historical fiction or just great writing and good stories. Further, this book is at least as good as Shogun and is a critical component of the Asia Saga, so it is a must read for people who enjoy Clavell's other books."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I can not begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this book. There is so much to this book. A great story, great characters, great dialogue, history, culture I could go on for ages.Basically, if you are interested in a historical novel, Asia, China, Hong Kong, the Sea, action, romance, this book has it all.Shogun and Tai Pan are two of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Tai-Pan is engrossing. James Clavell has a marvellous Asian touch that is very realistic. The whole story is so beautifully crafted that you think Clavell witnessed all the events himself. The flow and the scale of the story are top-class. You also learn that the Europeans were horribly filthy those days, both cultures (Chinese and European) thought the other to be barbaric and many more little things. The ending is totally unexpected, really disastrous and hair-raising.A real jewel of fiction!!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Reading is by far my favorite pastime. Quite simply, this is the best novel I have ever read...and it's been over 10 years since I read it. Clavell's grasp of history and his insight into the clash of cultures between east and west still, in my opiniion, is unmatched. A true classic."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"After reading Shogun I had to read the next book in the Asian saga. When I began reading I didnt expect it to be as good as Shogun, but this book is just as good. The first chapter is a little slow but after that I was completely drawn into the story. Tai-Pan, along with Shogun, is one of the best books I have ever read. If you decide to read this book, you will not be waisting your time."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This book is the second in James Clavell's \\"Asian Saga\\". This is the introduction of Struan's Noble House and, while all of Clavell's books can be read independently of one another, you will appreciate Gai-Jin and Noble House much more if you read Tai-Pan first.Tai-Pan takes place in China and revolves around the founding of Hong Kong. There are viewpoints of many characters, just like with Clavells other books but, in this book, the main viewpoint is clearly that of Dirk Struan. Dirk is the founder of the Noble House (which is the richest trading company in China). He has to keep his company afloat and ahead of all his competitors, the toughest of which is Brock and Sons. Dirk is a great character. Whenever you think he is stuck and that Tyler Brock might be able to come out ahead, Dirk manipulates his way out of trouble again. Out of all the characters in James Clavell's novels, Dirk Struan is probably my favorite.Tai-Pan doesn't develop China as well as Shogun develops Japan, largely because European traders weren't allowed into China. That is why Hong Kong became so important, because it was a European entry point into China. The details of the trade circle between China and Europe are interesting but most of what makes this books great is the way Dirk manipulates people to his way of thinking, while all the time being slightly manipulated himself by the other forces in his life. All the characters in this book are well-developed and all have good and bad moments so they are more realistic than caricature.Tai-Pan is one the strongest entries in the Asian Saga and one of the most fun to read. It is also the most important if you intend to read the whole series because it provides almost all of the relevant history for the other books."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"The time period of James Clavell's fascinating \`Tai-Pan' is the middle of the nineteenth century, during Britain's glory days when her champions swaggered across the globe extending the reach of the British Empire by brain and by brawn. Part edge-of-your seat action adventure, the book is also a delight to those who are still interested in the history of colonialism. China's belligerent foreign policy today can be traced back to the spanking humiliation that this ancient culture endured at the hands of the West for close to a century.Ah, Britain and China - one arrogantly flaunting it's military might while flexing its economic muscle at the same time, the other fiercely insular and undaunted in its sense of superiority. One challenged in matters of hygiene, the other in matters of human rights. How will these two great nations ever see eye-to-eye, with each looking down its nose at the other?While the book more than adequately lays the historical groundwork for the plot with its detailing of the acquisition of Hong Kong, the story in general is about the British China Traders, the ruthless merchant-pirates who ply the oceans monopolizing the exchange of opium, tea, silk and bullion between East and West. Using Bengal-grown opium as leverage against China, the traders build their empires while corrupting the soul of a nation. In an environment where foreknowledge equals money, staying ahead of the game means staying three steps ahead of everyone else. That would be Dirk Struan.Struan is the larger than life force behind Hong Kong, the proprietor of The Noble House, and the most powerful of the China Traders. He is a man who can be defined only in contradictions, a British Imperialist and a global visionary, one who would exalt China even as he ravages her for monetary gain. He is a devious manipulator who bends friend and foe alike to his Machiavellian will. He's not a nice man, but one who lives by his own inscrutable code of honor, harsh yet humane at the same time.Struan's implacable enemy is Tyler Brock, his business rival with whom he is on first name terms. Even as each seeks to annihilate the other, they will nevertheless stand shoulder to shoulder defending their mutual interests, and fighting off their common threats. This is a man's milieu, each one jostling to be the alpha male - the Tai-Pan. But never fear, there are also some wily yet vulnerable women in this book. Chief among them is May May, Dirk Struan's devious yet endearingly childlike mistress of indomitable spirit.\`Tai-Pan' is an adrenaline-laced thrill ride. Its odd blend of Scottish brogue and Pidgin English may be a little distracting, but its triumphs more than make up for its minor shortcomings. It's an entertainer fueled by intelligence. That is a potent and irresistible combination."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"First, this is my favorite book of all time (averaging over 75 books a year, that is saying a lot). The blend of intrigue, action and fascinating characters is unsurpassed. It's totally absorbing from page one to last.As for the Kindle edition, I was a little disappointed in the amount of typographical errors in the conversion. I'd say there was an average of about 1 every 6 pages or so. That is not terrible, and it wasn't too disruptive, but I had hoped for better. I'm sure this was a conversion using OCR, and, under those circumstances, and with the Chinese names, it could have been much worse. AND, proof-reading a 700 page book is tough (can't you use spell check?). Still, I was a little disappointed in this aspect."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Several years back, I picked up \\"Shogun\\" and immediately fell in love with the Orient. That single book led to a fascination I continue to have with Japan, and led me to re-read the book several times, as well as purchase the DVD of the TV Mini-series.I finally made the time to start Tai-Pan, and quite simply, it didn't \\"grab\\" me. The first 25% of the book is dry. New characters are thrown at you like machine-gun fire and you reach a point where you're flipping through the book looking for a list of characters just to try to keep them straight (there is no such list, BTW).However, if you force yourself through that initial deluge, you'll find yourself drawn into an engaging, exciting book with terrific character development.This can be considered \\"Historical Fiction\\", and it's a genre that this book and it's sister \\"Shogun\\" have got me looking much deeper into. Each item of interest in the book I've wiki-checked has been correct, if the author has perhaps taken some literary liscense with dates!I highly recommend this book, but if you haven't read \\"Shogun\\", you should first. This is 2nd in a series that traces the \\"Noble House\\" through the Centuries.Most interesting of all - it's loosely based on a real-life person, who's company continues to be one of the largest companies in Hong Kong to this day!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This is on my Top 5 Book list.Dirk Struan is a remarkable character, I believe the stongest male character to become part of a book. If you like stories blended with history, culture and a strong protagonist, you'll ove it. James Clavell alongside Frederick Forsyth and Noah Gordon are the top writers for this type of reading."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Tai-pan is possibly the best book in Clavells series and that says allot since Shogun is one of the better books of all time. Run don't walk, get this book. The characters are top line, the story is stunning and the details are pronominal"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Tai-Pan made me feel I was really in the time period because the research was impeccable and the author leaves nothing out. Even the topic of 19th century hygiene is brought up. At the same time, it is a thrilling story with many things all going on at once. Two families are competing to be the predominant traders, but there are also the larger politics taking place between China and England, and the personal lives of all the characters. Clavell's characters correspond closely with real people although their names are changed and the same is true with the some of the events that take place. The author has an amazing grasp of social and political workings. Some other historical fiction writers with this skill are dry at times, but not Clavell who focuses just as much on his story as he does on living in the past. This book has it all! What more could one ask from an author?"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I just finished reading Tai-Pan, and although it did not top Shogun, in my opinion it came pretty damn close. The strongest aspect about the book was the clever way in which Clavell weaved all the history, politics and character development together into a fascinating story.Tai-Pan was well researched, well written, and extremely well thought out. Clavell really seemed to grasp the essence of the Chinese and their mentality and juxtaposed it against that of the English.Hands down the best book I've read this year."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Wow. As soon as you have finished reading this book you will want to begin reading it again... it's that good. It is a wonderful tale of British settlement in Hong Kong and how they interacted with the Chinese. The character development in this book is exceptional. You begin to feel as if you know everything about them. I can not recommend this book highly enough. It's a definate classic."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Next to Shogun, the best book I've ever read. The research done by Clavell is incredible and he includes all the facts. You may think it boring, almost a history lesson, however, the way that Clavell develops his characters and the plot are impeccable. This is the second time that Clavell has stunned me with his writing and again, I find myself reading this novel over and over. One of the best."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"I read Tai-Pan after Shogun and I have to say Shogun is much better.Tai-Pan is successful in recreating the atmosphere, language and historical background of Hong-Kong, but it fails in crafting a great storyline. The plot seems to be moving in an unclear direction and many plot turns are random and co-incidental. The ending is also a disappointment as it fails to neatly end all the plot lines and many things are left open. For such a long book it is a great flaw. There are however some moments of brilliance and some great characters. All in all, it seemed to me like I was reading a first draft of a novel that needed much editing."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"After reading Shogun I immediately bought this book expecting a rich literary view of Hong Kong and China. I was slightly disappointed. The books starts out with an introduction of various characters who mostly play minor parts. I kept waiting for a climatic ending, that never seemed to happen. The ending seems rushed and left me wanting for more. Reading Shogun first set my expectations rather high for this book. They were not met, but I still could not put the book down."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"This is a novel that plays in China at the time Hong Kong was established. The book is pretty similar to &quot;Shogun&quot; by the same author. In fact, if you want to know about the mood and philosophy in &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; and my opinion about it, you can as well read my review for &quot;Shogun&quot; and substitute the word &quot;Chinese&quot; for &quot;Japanese&quot;. Even the reason why I didn't give the book the full five stars is the same.Mr. Clavell's expertise and accuracy for details is astonishing. He really has very deep knowledge of 19th century China, the way the Chinese people behaved and thought. Exactly as deep is, unfortunately, his ignorance of foreign names. Imagine a Russian called Zergejev or a Norwegian called Orlov! I'm really stunned by this incredible sloppiness.In despite of this flaw, I consider Mr. Clavell one of the best skilled writers ever. His detailed description of different cultures' interaction is extemely educational. Especially enjoyable in this book was the realistic presentation of different English dialects. &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; is a book that can't be translated without losing most of its expression.If you have any interest in historic fiction, make sure you read this book. If you want to know whether you should start with Taipan or Shogun, I really can't tell. If I had to pick one, I'd rather advice Shogun for the first lecture. If you're reading a translation, your only reasonable choice is Shogun."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"The series starts with Shogun, which was wonderful. But the best of the series is Tai-Pan!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"As the title of my review states, IMO, this is one of the greatest novels ever written. Clavell's writing is stellar from cover to cover. Everything one could want in a story is found within it's pages. The whole series is worth multiple reads, but TAI-PAN lives up to it's name!"},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Shogun was kind of an odd book for me because even though I loved it, really loved, I didn't really enjoy reading it. The same thing happened with \\"Tai-Pan.\\"This is a highly political and informative novel about the opium-tea-silver trade and the beginnings of British Hong Kong but it's more tedious somehow because there is so much conversation compared to the action parts of the book and the bitter rivalries between the traders can be hard to understand.In spite of all this something about this book left me a little awed. Most likely it was May-may, the Tai-Pan's (a kind of king/leader/president of company) Chinese mistress who with her exuberant spirit and hilarious English made parts of this book a joy. Maybe it was the education I got on how hard a group of drug smugglers really fought to hold on to a worthless piece of rock which would one day be one of the world's greatest harbors. Maybe it was the completeness of the ending. Maybe it's magic. Who knows. But this is a great book even if I didn't really like it.Anyway you put it this book is \\"fantastical good\\" (as May-may) would say but it lacks the emotion of \\"Shogun\\" and was at times a bit like wading through sand. In spite of all this I feel compelled to give it a five star rating. Read it and you'll find out why."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Second in a series, this book isn't nearly as good as the first (Shogun). The subject matter (the British occupation of Hong Kong in the early 1800's) is certainly juicy enough, so I'm not sure exactly what went wrong in this book. I had difficulty adjusting to the way in which the book portrayed the spoken words of each of the characters. For instance, if the character couldn't speak English very well, then Clavell attempted to faithfully reproduce phonetically what you would have heard in real life. While good in theory, this method wreaked havoc with the readability of the story. I still found the story engaging, although not quite to the extent of Shogun where I would race home from work and immediately start reading. Clavell's magical ability to encapsulate history in a sugar coating of fiction and slide it down your throat is amazing. The story's climax occurs only a few pages from the end, and the resulting two page denouement is a little unsatisfactory, although I suppose this is to be expected in a series with four more titles... worth the read if you are doing the whole series, otherwise read Shogun instead."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Wow. I didn't know what to expect of this book after first reading Shogun, but after the first few pages I was hooked. This story is equally as captivating as Shogun. Disregard what Mr. Gigounas said about this book in the review below. It is enthralling from start to finish. I do suggest reading &quot;Shogun&quot; first."},{"Title":"TAI-PAN","review":"Right behind Shogun as the best James Clavell book. Total excitement and adventure. A must-read"},{"Title":"Before They Play a Grand Slam: Parenting the Junior Tennis Player","review":"Yes, this is a great book for parents. It is also a great book for young tennis players. I highly recommend it to tennis families like mine.It is written in an entertaining and direct style. The chapters are short; each addresses a particular aspect of playing junior tennis (and parenting the tennis player). The advantage of this is that once you've read the book, it is easy to return to a particular chapter to re-visit a specific issue. Moreover, the chapters can be read in just about any order you wish -- each is a bit like a self-contained essay on a particular subject.Our entire family has read the book (we have two tennis-playing sons). Because we've all read the book, we have a shared starting point for some of our discussions.The chapters cover topics ranging from equipment to nutrition to training to pressure, sportsmanship, traveling to tournaments, choosing and interacting with a coach, and parent-child relationships and how they are affected by competitive play.We have taken the book to tournaments with us, and turned to a particular chapter after returning to the hotel. It's kind of like taking the coach along. You can draw on that little nugget of wisdom at just the right time!I highly recommend this book to families raising junior tennis players."},{"Title":"Before They Play a Grand Slam: Parenting the Junior Tennis Player","review":"Growing up with David Britt, it was an honor to purchase his book sharing his thoughts, experiences and advise to parents and coaches. I think so much of this book that I have implemented it as purchase for parents of young people in my own Junior ACADEMY. Doing this has saved alot of time and similar repeated conversations about the development of each child in the program."},{"Title":"Before They Play a Grand Slam: Parenting the Junior Tennis Player","review":"This book was by far the best book I have read and the only book I have found on this topic. The thoroughness and the personal touch that the Author gives is second to none. It was a fun read and one that I can easily remember and relay onto my children. I have two children that play tennis. One that has been at it for a number of years and the other that is just starting. I am thankful to have found this book now, but really wish that I had it when my first child started playing tennis. This book is helpful for parents who already have experienced junior tennis players and for ones that have kids who are just getting started."},{"Title":"Before They Play a Grand Slam: Parenting the Junior Tennis Player","review":"If you are looking for a very basic book that offers some insight to parents who have children just getting started in tennis and what to expect, then this is for you. There is not much detail and chapters are very short. It's blunt and to the point about how difficult, if not impossible it is for kids to achieve success in the pro circuit. I would never let my 8 year old son read this book because it may dash his hopes and dreams. However, I do believe the information in the book is fairly accurate from what I'm learning from my son's tennis coach. The author primarily played college tennis and never really made it in professional tennis. I would have rather known this before purchasing the book. He played a few professional matches and met a lot of the famous tennis players, but never did much in the professional circuit. So, he stresses in the book for parents to focus on collegiate tennis. There were also numerous grammatical errors and typos throughout the book which tells me the author probably doesn't write many books either. Overall, It's worth reading, but continue to get other people's opinions."},{"Title":"Before They Play a Grand Slam: Parenting the Junior Tennis Player","review":"As a former competitive junior now raising another generation of tennis enthusiasts I had expected more from this book. Although author Britt hit the nail on the head on several issues, I was disappointed at his superficial treatment and lack of incisive insight on important topics. The text reads like Britt's personal blog i.e. full of typos and obvious omission of negations such as \\"don't\\" or \\"no\\" which change the meaning of entire paragraphs.The book is too long, half of the text can be omitted as they don't bring much value, while Britt's \\"funny anecdotes\\" often don't relate to the subject matter. Again, think personal blog.To starry-eyed tennis parents however, Britt's book is an excellent wake-up call to the grim realities of being a \\"tennis pro\\". The road to stardom is filled with potholes and the odds of \\"making it\\", i.e. earning enough to pay your own way, are extremely slim. Staying on the tour costs upwards of $70,000 per year which includes travel expenses, hotel bills, restaurant meals, coaching fees, medical insurance, rackets, strings, incidentals. A pro has to earn at least that much to stay on the tour.I agree with Britt's take on the pro tour as I have seen first-hand NCAA Div.-I college friends struggle on the tour. They were top juniors and #1 and 2 players on Div.I teams, but consider this: I was often asked to open up my then-modest apartment to accommodate them and their doubles partners (they could not afford hotels), and they would ask for rides to tournaments, gladly coming along even though I had to leave for work hours before tournaments began. They could not afford cabs, not even shared among 4. Britt talks about pros sleeping 4-to-a-room and the most popular evening activity is scouting for dinner deals. It IS TRUE.In my opinion Britt was not clear on a few important points:1. the difference between a \\"pro\\" and an \\"amateur\\" is what you check off in your tournament entry form. Hence your local butcher can sign up for a tournament, check the box for \\"pro\\" and viola, he's a tennis pro (i.e. being tennis pro is no guarantee of success),2. while Britt exhorts juniors/parents to look to the college route, he does not mention that the odds of \\"making it\\" (full or partial scholarship) are also very slim,3. for every Roger Federer or Venus Williams, tens if not hundreds of thousands fall by the wayside due to injuries, burnouts or what-have-yous. Britt should provide numerical statistics on the odds of success.If you must buy this book do so with lowered expectations but if you're looking for tennis \\"stardom\\" I highly recommend reading this."},{"Title":"The Little Digital Camera Book","review":"If you are a newcomer to digital photography, this inexpensive book is for you. The Little Digital Camera book covers the gamut of your needs: How to use your camera; share pictures with friends and family; organize and protect your digital files; find a photo editor that suits your skill level and needs; along with digital photo creative projects. The writing is thorough, clear and informative, without being overwhelming. Thankfully, the content is truly cross-platform, viable for both Mac and PC owners. Overall, excellent value for your money."},{"Title":"The Little Digital Camera Book","review":"If you were lucky enough to receive a digital camera for Christmas you may be wondering just how to use said new gizmo. Perhaps your questions are even more fundamental: Is this the camera for me? If it's not can I exchange this camera for a cheaper one and keep the difference? Just where does the film go anyway? Cynthia Baron wants to answer your questions and she wants to make a little dough in the process. To achieve this laudable goal she and Daniel Beck have written The Little Digital Camera Book. The Little Digital Camera Book is a good read for anyone who just bought a digital camera and a great book for anyone who is getting ready to buy a digital camera. The Little Digital Camera Book is not as well suited for the intermediate user or for the budding Ansel Adams who understands the technical aspects and aspires to take better pictures.The Little Digital Camera Book opens with a very brief history of photography followed by a few steps to prepare your computer for the imminent image exchanges. If you have more than a passing familiarity with RAM and why you need it skip to Chapter 2 that's when the book first becomes useful. Chapter 2 of The Little Digital Camera Book is a potentially big money saver if you're one of those bigger numbers must be better type of person. If you read carefully you'll realize you don't need that 5-megapixel-money pit, a 2 megapixel will likely suit your needs. The rest of the chapter is fairly useful as well, though you are not going to end up saving a couple of hundred bucks by continuing to follow Cynthia L. Baron's advice. If you just can't bring yourself to part with the ... cover price of The Little Digital Camera Book at least stand and read chapter 2 in your local bookstore; the advice therein is well worth following.The rest of the book is not as immediately useful to the novice user but the majority of The Little Digital Camera Book will be useful to the average digital camera owner at some point. You get your basic photo composition tips (rule of thirds et al), your basic image editing tips (though these a bit too general to truly be useful), some info on storage options and just enough info on online versus local printing options. All of the information is pertinent and all of it is well presented. The information you find most useful will undoubtedly not be the info I find most germane but there's something in The Little Digital Camera Book for everyone.I do have a few gripes about The Little Digital Camera Book. The same camera is used as the model throughout the book. This is fine if you own an Olympus but if you use any other brand of camera you might feel a bit cold-shouldered. Since The Little Digital Camera Book is (presumably) a book aimed at just about any novice user it might have been more interesting if a variety of cameras were used for demonstration purposes. My last gripe regards color photographs. Photography books have to address color and color correction owing to the nature of the subject but a precious few actually go to the extra expense of providing color plates to illustrate the point being made. I regard this exclusion as a necessary omission but a few color plates could have put The Little Digital Camera Book at the top of my must have list.Bottom Line: The Little Digital Camera Book manages to cut a wide swath without being over simplistic or overly detailed. The Little Digital Camera is a nice book for beginners, pros should look elsewhere.MacMice Rating: 3.5 out of 5------------------------------------------------------------------------Chris Seibold"},{"Title":"The Little Digital Camera Book","review":"This is a great book for people who, like me, only have rudimentary knowledge of digital cameras.

Of course, many of these stories do have the twist that Hitchcock loved so well, they just seem less strong than many in his other collections. This one is still very worth reading.The opening story in this collection is a slow chiller. Rick gets involved with the wrong people in \\"South of Market,\\" by Joe Gores.

Great subject, should be brought to the attention of everyone even vaguely interested in the forces that shape our landscapes, and a fascinating account of the Bretz \\"saga\\". Like Wegener, Bretz was ridiculed in his time for his outlandish theories; unlike Wegener, he lived long enough to see his theories dramatically confirmed. On a recent trip to the US I had the opportunity to drive across WA, ID, and MT, and was entranced by the coulees, Dry Falls, the scablands, and the stranded lake shores above Missoula.So what's my gripe? Simply that, while the authors have done a commendable job of making the whole story accessible to lay readers, they haven't really done their subject the treatment it so richly deserves. The writing (shared by three authors) is uneven, tends to be repetitious, and would have benefited from tighter editing. The chapters describing Bretz and his battles with the geological establishment are the best and most readable; those describing the details of the post-flood geomorphology (sensibly ordered from Lake Missoula to the sea) are more ponderous. The photos are also a big disappointment - I would happily have paid extra for a book with up to date and well-produced colour photos, rather than the grainy monochromes which have been used throughout. Buy the book, marvel at the story, and imagine what it would have been like to watch the floods from a secure piece of high ground, but keep your eyes open for the day when the authors (or someone else) produce a livelier and more readable update."},{"Title":"Cataclysms on the Columbia","review":"This fascinating book, written in language easily understood by non-geologist, yet full of scientific facts that a geologist can appreciate reads like a detective story; describing in detail how the geologic history and formation of the Columbia River was finally understood.

The lake covered thousands of square miles and impounded about 500 cubic miles of water. As the water in the lake rose, it eventually got high enough to float the ice dam, breaking it and unleashing hundreds of cubic miles of water that rushed out through eastern Washington creating what we call the channeled scablands.The flow was enormous. It left giant ripple marks that are clearly visible from the air, but hard to discern from the ground. It left gravel beds sloping upstream in tributary rivers on the Columbia. It tore out chucks of rock and stripped away loess. It carved interlinking channels, waterfalls, and deep canyons - all of which can be seen today, and which are particularly striking when viewed from the air, or space.The book is filled with photographs and maps showing the evidence for the flood, but older folk (like me) may need a magnifying glass to make them out.The book's written in several parts. Parts 1 and II, written by Marjorie Burns, consist of introductory material with historical background about Bretz, his early field work, and his effort to construct a complete and coherent theory of the Ice Age floods. Part III was written mostly by John Allen, who presents some of the scientific detail that describes and supports the Bretz Flood theory. Part IV, also by Allen, follows a typical flood from the point of failure in the ice dam until it emptied into the Pacific Ocean.Allen's sections are my favorites. I also enjoyed much of what Burns wrote, except for her frequent personal attacks against early skeptics who rejected Bretz's initial hypothesis. Burns leaves the reader with the impression that skepticism is bad, and that early scientists should have rushed to embrace Bretz's hypothesis before all the evidence, especially the source of the flood, had been discoveredFor example, on page 52 Burns quotes Meinzer, who said (in 1927)\\"Before a theory that requires a seemingly impossible quantity of water is fully accepted, every effort should be made to account for the existing features without employing so violent an assumption.\\"This seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to say, particularly since Bretz, in spite of the evidence for a massive flood, had been unable to identify the source of the water. Burns, though, calls Meinzer's comment a \\"splendidly revealing passage,\\" and \\"remarkably close to overt hostility.\\"When Bretz presented his hypothesis in 1927 he didn't know the source of the flood, and without being able to point to a clear source, he knew his hypothesis was lacking. W.C. Alden responded to Bretz' hypothesis by suggesting the need for more research; again, this seems like a perfectly reasonable response. But Burns taunts Alden's position by mentioning other geologists who said \\"Cautious\\" was Alden's middle name. And, with dripping sarcasm, she quotes Alden as having used phrases like \\"it would seem,\\" \\"perhaps,\\" and \\"not yet well enough understood.\\"Burns lambastes skeptical and/or cautious scientists who disagreed with Bretz. She describes them as closed minded, unwilling to accept new ideas, and stuck in their ways. She describes Bretz's hypothesis as an \\"unthinkable heresy,\\" while twisting legitimate scientific caution into claims of \\"overt hostility.\\" Yet, when Bretz exhibited similar caution she lauds it as a high \\"standard.\\" Consider this quote from page 58:\\"By 1932 Bretz was again saying \`the cause of the flood is not yet known.' He had, at this point, virtually finished his field research on the Channeled Scablands, and in his final studies he mostly ignored the Lake Missoula possibility. It was an intriguing hypothesis but too questionable to meet Bretz's standards.\\"Burns seems to have a genuine grudge against skeptics in the scientific community. For example, on page 72 she complains that Wegener's \\"theory\\" leading to \\"plate tectonics\\" was \\"maligned.\\" The problem is that Wegner didn't have a theory; he had a hypothesis based on incomplete data, with an incorrectly proposed mechanism for how the continents moved. In retrospect, his larger hypothesis (like Bretz's) proved correct, but it wasn't a scientific theory until it was completed with a verifiable mechanism for continental drift - something that's part of the theory of plate tectonics. The fact that hypotheses such as Wegner's are/were debated is a necessary and healthy part of the way science works, and yet Burns castigates those critics who later turned out to be wrong - as if they should have been \\"believers' without all the evidence.Bretz should be highly regarded for correctly hypothesizing (on the basis of a huge amount of original field work, I might add) that the scablands were created by a great flood. But in spite of the many evidences he presented, he couldn't explain where the water came from, and how it was unleashed. Without that key bit of evidence he didn't have a scientific theory; he had a scientific hypothesis that was still under intense investigation. The scientific community did pretty much what it should have done; they went out and found the source of the flood.It was Pardee, who did it with his description of humungous ripple marks in Lake Missoula in 1942. With the source of the flood identified, Bretz's hypothesis was quickly accepted. While Burns sees the episode as a sham, I see it as one of the best examples of why and how science works so well.Once you get through Burns' personal attacks on Bretz's critics, the book becomes a pleasure to read. It is one of the best scientific descriptions of the Bretz floods and has some very helpful references. In spite of Parts 1 and II, the rest of the book makes it definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Cataclysms on the Columbia","review":"In the early twentieth century, J. Harlen Bretz was a geologist who walked around what were believed to be glacial formations carved through mountains and valleys in the states of Oregon and Washington. He took detailed notes and observed rock patterns from Spokane to Portland, Oregon...and came to the conclusion that a huge prehistoric flood created the canyon called the Scablands. This was completely at odds with the beliefs of established geologists of the time, and he knew this, but he stood up for truth anyway. This book proves to be not only a scientific study but also a riveting drama."},{"Title":"Cataclysms on the Columbia","review":"As a geologist who recently visited northern Oregon, I was eager to learn more of the Missoula Floods. After reading this book, I concluded that if there isn't a better written account, there certainly should be. The portion of the book on the geologists who worked on solving this puzzle was fine, but the account of the floods and the geologic evidence they left behind was less than adequate. The text was repetitive in some places and in others didn't provide enough context to be clear. There was a disconnect between the figures and maps and the text. Frequently the text referenced features and locations that were hard to locate on the maps or were missing entirely. Some of the references to figures appeared to be wrong and in at least one case the text referenced a figure number that did not exist in the book. It is difficult to understand how a \\"revised second edition\\" of a book can be in such dire need of majoring editing. Overall, the discussion of the sequence of events and their locations was hard to follow. It seems the authors were trying to provide enough of the supporting information for a geologist and make it accessible to the layman. I think this falls on both counts."},{"Title":"Cataclysms on the Columbia","review":"This book was a pleasure to read. I'm currently doing research and frankly used to drab and technical writing. This book was neither. It is well written, allows for the person completely new to geology and geography to understand easily, without missing the facts. The book explains how the Missoula Floods' geographic remnants were discovered and then explains the discoveries, as others have noted here, in a format that allows the reader to use the book as a travel guide (if one wishes). He includes excellent images that explain the floods' movements and also show actual evidence in roadside sites right off of the highways one would travel to see the route of the great floods.

I'm very glad I did, however. I noticed that a previous reviewer (or two) became very defensive in their explanation of what a wonderful situation it is to belong to a corporate cult. Like the frog, enjoying the warm water, but slowly boiled after gradual temperature increase, you poor people never even saw it coming. Of course the company provides everything you could possibly need. Of course they reward you for five, ten and fifteen years perfect attendance. Why ever leave the property, when you have a place to eat, take your children, exercise (and yes, even sleep). The joke on the &quot;team&quot; I worked was that we only went home to change clothes. That could be addressed as well, with lockers in the fitness center. Eventually, your entire life is with the company, and this is the danger. Work needs to stay at work, and home at home. When the lines are blurred, I guarantee your life will fall apart. Depend upon it. You may have met your spouse there, take your kids to daycare there, have breakfast and lunch with all your friends there, but at some point, you will realize the high price you've paid. They are taking care of business, not you. They really do not care about you at all. When you retire after 40 years of service while holding your pencil set engraved with the corporate emblem, the question I want you to ask yourself is this: Were the trinkets and certificates worth it? Are you a better person for sacrificing your whole life to show your loyalty and thankfulness? Did all your bowing and scraping pay off? Have you realized your full potential at the expense of your marriage, your children and your sanity (...Although they did come through on hospitalization costs after your nervous breakdown.)? Did you make the right decision?"},{"Title":"Corporate Cults: The Insidious Lure of the All-Consuming Organization","review":"While many organizations wrestle with the challenge of retention and loyalty, some organizations, according to Arnott, achieve a dysfunctional degree of control over employees. The author finds parallels between the traits that define a cult-devotion, charismatic leadership, and separation from community-and the characteristics of 'best places to work' namely, sense of purpose, inspiring leadership, and knockout facilities. Arnott finds an unhealthy, insidious physical, emotional and psychological relationship between individual and organization involving the use of manipulative and controlling tactics. The organization displays something like the gravitational power of a 'black hole' into which the light of individualism is drawn.Conversely, some people have a dysfunctional dependency upon their work and corporate community for their identity and psychological needs; they are willingly absorbed into the closed organizational 'black hole.' The author thoughtfully explores the dynamics of the &quot;when work becomes life&quot; cult phenomenon, its effects on family and community, and advice on how to avoid the cult trap.All organizations have some cultedness; using Arnott's cult test, people can find least cult-like places to work. This book is a timely, and extremely absorbing and provocative work. Highly recommended.

Before you sign up, you might want to heed Dave Arnott's warning that you could be walking into a cult.I found Arnott's treatment of corporate life to be somewhat biased by his thesis that organizations, particularly those labeled as \\"great places to work,\\" operate like intentionally manipulative cults. The book takes a number of organizational innovations, such as wellness centers and other on-site conveniences designed to make life easier for employees, and spins them into an evil spider's web designed to trap employees into the organizational version of a cult.While the book provides a very thorough description of the major elements of a cult and how these elements exist to some degree in a number of organizations, it downplays the need for organizations to offer incentives, such as providing on-site day care, wellness centers and dining facilities, in order to attract and retain highly talented employees.In the end, however, the book does challenge the reader to question the potential downside of organizations who provide such lavish incentives to keep people on their payrolls.

There is a certain defensive tone to his writing that I find oddly childish, given his credentials.I discovered several factual errors in the book, and I think his visits to the companies he mentions and the employee interviews he conducted were more &quot;whistle-stops&quot; than fact-finding missions. (I feel sorry for the Southwest Airlines employee he dismissed after using the word &quot;we&quot; -- isn't it possible she was talking about her family and not her workplace?)

The author obviously wants to worry people, to make them aware that Western culture's idea of you=your job is a bad thing. And I agree. This isn't a fault that corporate America has imposed on the world; this is the market adapting to existing societal conditions. People don't live in the same house or same neighborhood all their lives, so they don't develop relationships with their neighbors. Churches are having trouble finding and keeping members. Society values work over these things, so it isn't too surprising when employers begin to fill the needs that are not being met in the workers' personal lives. I, personally, would love to work for an employer who actually cared about my well-being and valued my hard work enough to supply a gym, child care, visiting massage therapists, etc. The author's cause-and-effect theory on this phenomena seems backwards from the reality of life."},{"Title":"Schaum's Easy Outline of Business Statistics","review":"If you must buy a stats book then I guess this would be as good as any other pocket reference guide.

He was possessed of a rich, raw eloquence and the ability to manipulate profanity as a form of punctuation. Cleaver epitomized a form of thought leadership manifesting itself in this whirlwind period of Black radicalism which had wrestled ideological dominance back from the sanitized presentation of the centrist Black clergy and political class. Its orientation was towards a grassroots fusion of street knowledge with a rediscovered deep leftist political ideology. An ideology which had flourished in the Black community throughout the Harlem Renaissance only to be subverted by the Great Depression, Red Scare nativism and individual economic gain. This fusion, while possessed of the noble aim to draw urban youth in from exile to be politically engaged, was also lacking the long view which renews political ties with a progressive past in order to build upon prior knowledge instead of duplicating present effort.This latest reading finds my views matured in their acknowledgement of the profound sociopathy inherent in Cleaver's description of exploring rape as an insurrectionist act (\\"On Becoming\\"). Where once existed an intellectual curiosity to understand the psychology, I can now experience only the utmost antipathy as he outlines refining his technique by practicing on Black girls before crossing over to white. The brisk logic of his confession no longer strikes the necessary emotional tone which would convince me of his empathy for the victims. He seems certain of his rationale, but unable to discern any true fault in his decision which factors into the literary construct he builds throughout the text. In prison studies, he was able to master a militant discourse made routine by the cultural fluctuations of the time. This proficiency was juxtaposed against a narcissistic indulgence in his own opinion which was nearer to didacticism than dialogue often leading to conflict between his rhetoric and action. As one of the beneficiaries of a cult of personality in which the white counterculture emphasized a revolutionary narrative above the continuous resistance required to overturn an oppressive system, his writings would be widely circulated in the political magazine Ramparts garnering support for his release. This support was forthcoming even as his sole contribution to social transformation consisted of a series of strident political dispatches and dexterity in prison debate.In further inspecting his trajectory from fiery American iconoclast to conservative ideologue, his longstanding admiration of Malcolm throughout the text peaking in the essay \\"Initial Reactions on the Assassination of Malcolm X\\" returns to haunt him. Malcolm had rooted himself in the organizational hierarchy of the Nation of Islam only to be rebuked for expressing an opinion not conforming with the established guideline. His analysis that the program espoused by Elijah Muhammad was ineffective did not lead him to conclude that the American experience held any greater virtue by contrast. Cleaver adopted precisely the opposite position upon his return from exile surmising that because communism as it was practiced in Cuba, Algeria and North Vietnam was injurious to members of its population, capitalism must be the only socioeconomic construct capable of producing a just and democratic society. In a telling line from the text about coming to atheism in his early years in prison, Cleaver writes \\"Unsophisticated and not based on any philosophical rationale, our atheism was pragmatic.\\" The conclusions drawn by Cleaver from his expatriation fostered an inability to launch any deeper inquiry into the nature of American society beyond the dichotomy of America and its antithesis hindering any evolution from his nascent pragmatism. His later life reflected an unprincipled commitment to a multitude of complementary and contradictory causes. Thus he returns once to the arms of the Republican party, another time to evangelical Christianity, again to the Unification Church and later to his own personal synthesis philosophy, Chrislam, searching for a place to belong, but never elucidating a single point of focus as succinctly as Malcolm.Cleaver's most egregious criticism in \\"Soul On Ice\\" is reserved for James Baldwin (\\"Notes on a Native Son\\") whose work he alleges exhibits \\"...the most grueling, agonizing, total hatred of the blacks, particularly of himself, and the most shameful, fanatical, fawning, sycophantic love of the whites that one can find in the writings of any black American writer of note in our time.\\" Cleaver goes far beyond mere literary critique in order to advance a vicious personal vendetta founded not on any principled disagreement with those critical insights raised in the writings of Baldwin, but on his distaste for the homosexual lifestyle. Cleaver presents the following three points as evidence of Baldwin's racial disdain: the dismissal of Norman Mailer's premise in \\"The White Negro\\", an alleged snub of Aime Cesaire in the report from the Conference of Black Writers and Artists in Paris of 1956 and the censure of Baldwin's mentor Richard Wright in the opening essay of \\"Notes of a Native Son\\" which disassembled Bigger Thomas as a Negro stereotype. Cleaver fails to build his case against Baldwin on any intellectual basis using those three points and peppers the remainder of the essay with a variety of ad hominem attacks against Baldwin's Blackness, sexuality, masculinity and sincerity. Here we discover the young Cleaver in critical collapse for his arguments become incoherent. As with his sexual victimization of women, he seems unable to confront his deep seated issues of misogyny and masculinity choosing instead to assert his literary domination over the political direction of the Black community while framing the world to conform with his vacillating conviction.At the outset of this review, I had every intent eviscerate of any further need to study this text in earnest. When I first entered organizational activism, my admiration of Cleaver was once so great that I took his title of Minister of Information as my own and sought to exhibit as firm a grasp as Cleaver of the political micro and macrocosm occurring about me. My initial desire was to exorcise the part of me that once accepted the gorgeous rhetoric displayed here so uncritically. Upon further contemplation, I have come to understand that it is necessary to retain Cleaver as a picture of fanatical naivete which encircles both his participation and our own. The fluctuations which he exhibits should remind us to never locate the success of our radical endeavors so far outside of ourselves. Cleaver's vision of a successful socialist revolution was located in Algeria, Cuba, Korea and each of the other places he was able to experience in exile. When combined with a mostly self absorbed radicalization and the crushing defeat suffered by the Panthers at home, his appetite for resistance was left fatally injured upon his return. He now resembled a character from Soul On Ice described as an \\"Old Lazarus\\" (\\"The Allegory Of The Black Eunuchs\\") whom Cleaver and some fellow inmates confronted for not being dead and accused of lacking the dedication to offer his life to the struggle for Black liberation. Cleaver exhibits here another momentary lapse in the certainty of his masculinity as he reaches down to examine himself \\"afraid that my rod would be missing\\". The pseudo-mythology from the conversation with the \\"Old Lazarus\\" is then used to formulate the bizarre thesis of \\"The Primeval Mitosis\\". This essay is presented in so a compelling fashion that such terms as \\"omnipotent administrator\\" would work their way into a broad array of Black Panther literature including the writings of Huey P. Newton. One of Cleaver's own narratives again returns to haunt him as a new generation found itself prepared to pummel him with the same question \\"Old Lazarus, why come you're not dead?\\" His answer appeared as a jumble of changes and permutations with no discernible objective to be found even in his writings and speeches taken together.After a fresh reading of \\"Soul On Ice\\", I am cautious to consider if I have judged Cleaver too harshly solely on the basis of this extreme transformation following exile. If the author of memoir and essay is to be judged by the philosophy he espouses in textual form, he must be bound for worse or better effect that those words form ideas remaining attached to his personal actions and are affected by each new transition. While Malcolm's activism gave him a wider lens through which to dissect and offer criticism to the internal socio-poltical mechanisms of America, Cleaver opened his eyes and seemed content to return to squinting through the eyelids once more. \\"Soul On Ice\\" appears now as a series of malformed ideas and incomplete analyses of a proto-revolutionary which is sufficient to get the wheels stirring in the minds of those who would study history to extract the lessons left behind, but not fruitful enough to sustain a growing consciousness or fortify one's personal philosophy. There are thinkers with a wider and more consistent body of work who can occupy that role with greater adequacy whose attractive language is not merely a vehicle for speculating upon perverse ideas."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Eldridge Cleaver wrote this book with an incredible sense of description of what being African,African-American is and means.

Soul on Ice is a collection of outdated essays, along with a few love letters to his attorney written while Cleaver was serving time for being a serial rapist. Cleaver shows a poor understanding of the political workings of the elites, the reasons why many middle and working class whites are \\"racists\\", and virtually every other thing he opens his mouth on with one major exception. His observations about the disturbing mental and sexual pathologies that exist in the American black males mind towards white females are very insightful and realistic. At one point Cleaver actually says that his whole motivation for raping white women was that he considered it a \\"revolutionary act\\", it was his way of striking back at \\"white\\" society. He also goes into blacks pursuance of white females having more to do with black self hatred more than anything else. Although I think the general pathology black males have towards white females has evolved into something slightly different now, given the system now approves of and out and out promotes relationships between black males and white females, this book is still brilliant as far as delving into the psychological illness that exists within that dynamic. Other than that most of Soul on Ice is a complete lump of garbage. I can't fathom why this book is used in many University literature and sociology classes in America except to brainwash and indoctrinate white students with white guilt. I bet those classroom discussions are a real hoot!Cleaver was certainly the weak link in the Black Panther leadership, ultimately contributing more towards its destruction than helping it. He wasn't really a hardcore black nationalist or racial seperatist when you get down to it, he wasn't, which was common for that time, an overblown hardcore Marxist or leftist. What Cleaver was really all about was expanding his overblown ego more than anything else. He also later proved himself to be a complete flake going through stages as a black right wing conservative, a born again Christian, and I think he even got involved in some sort of bizarre eastern religion for a while. There are lots of reasons to admire the Black Panther Party, Cleaver is not one of them."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"If there is another book out there that more effectively excavates the subterranean foundation of American race relations in a mere 200 pages, I'm not aware of it. Barack Obama's presidency has demonstrated both how far we've come as a nation and how far we have yet to go. While it could be argued that visible, public evidence of racism seemed to steadily decrease prior to his nomination, we have now seen the miscreants smoked from their dens and they're running around, coughing and organizing, wiping the tears from their eyes and wondering what the heck happened. Read \\"Soul on Ice\\" and you'll understand much of what we see in the news today. While some of Cleaver's views are nave, outdated or just plain wrong; his sexism, idolization of Mao, demonization of homosexuality, and blanket condemnation of law enforcement and the military, for example; most of this book is as applicable to 2010 as it was to 1968. The book is not without troubling contradictions. Cleaver's letters to Beverly Axelrod capture the essence of new love's manic infatuation but the absence of any kind of empathy for the women he raped leaves us wondering. His enlightened embrace of Malcom X's acceptance of all races clashes with his surprisingly hateful attacks on gay people. The truth he utters, however, far outweighs the lies; and the light he sheds on the taboo dynamics of race in America is still needed today. The breadth of his knowledge and his masterful illumination of the interplay between historical, social, psychological and physical forces responsible for our daily on-the-ground realities makes \\"Soul on Ice\\" compelling. The fact that most of his assertions make sense but are rarely discussed makes it required reading.Only Shot At A Good Tombstone"},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"One must remember, this man is a convict, sent to prison for attempted murder.

Or does it sound like the a street thug. The fact that he became a crack addicted whore towards the end of his life renouncing the Black Panther attest to the fact that Eldridge Cleaver was a phoney only hustling the system to get out of jail.I read his book and essentially was bored. I had no desire to experience life behind bars as white critics and so-call academics do."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"This book was the best inside look at the black male experience since Ellison's &quot;Invisible Man&quot; Cleaver cuts no corners, spares not feelings, and takes no prisoners. The book should be required reading for every African-Americans studies program in America, and every African-American Literature course in America. Cleaver is an excellent writer that proves that you don't have a PhD. to be an intelligent, articulate, person. Cleaver has knowledge he gained from school of hard knocks and the school of life. Like Malcolm X, Cleaver had to fall in order to get up and become a man!!!!!"},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"This is an amazing book, and a must read. What is also amazing is how people focus on the fact that it was written by a professed rapist and chauvinist. These very same individuals who would dismiss this book on the basis of the author's shortcomings would have no problem reading about George Washington, Samuel Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, King David of the Bible, Henry the VIII, and many more that were known rapist, bigots, chauvinist, slavers, kidnappers, and serial murders without batting an eye. They celebrate these criminals and their crimes without shame. This book gives the reader a glimpse into the mind of someone who has gone through his own hell and gained some enlightenment and insight that a wise reader can glean. No one is calling Eldridge Cleaver a saint unlike the people mentioned above that some fools adore without question. Mr. Cleaver is wreckage, but among that wreckage there are gems of hope. He is not promoting rape or chauvinism, but is being more honest and open about how misguided he was in his life. It today's society a pathological liar who refuses to admit guilt is forgiven before a person who acknowledges his crimes. With shallowness being the new deep it is a wonder that people understand the difference between a Dictionary and an Encyclopedia. There are many people who are not mature enough to read this book or maybe damage themselves and cannot see beyond their own hypocrisy."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Some people just can't accept the truth.

Here are three of the strongest:1) In 1992, when Malcolm X was being transformed into a fashion accessory/popular culture icon and the black influence on the cultural politics of the 1960s whitewashed, the reissue of Cleaver's book reminded us that \\"what was great was not Malcolm X but the truth he uttered\\" and that the survival of black genius is crucial to the good mental health of white America.2) Inasmuch as the 1960s of the Civil Rights-Black Power Movement was about closing ranks -among other things- \\"Soul on Ice\\" did not support any dysfunctional black unity, which explains its challenge of author James Baldwin's unconstructive and unfair criticisms of writer Richard Wright and Negritude advocate Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire.3) Useful condemnations of slavery's racist (re) presentation of black/American sexual politics (subtle or blatant) can be found in the pages of Cleaver's book; it anticipated much of the contemporary scholarship intervening in part or wholly in this domain: Ed Guerrero's \\"Framing Blackness\\", Mike Marqusee's \\"Redemption Song\\", and Spike Lee's cultural politics and cinema.Cleaver had his soul on ice but managed to produce this brilliant collection of essays. As readers we must, in turn, freeze \\"Soul on Ice\\" in the 1960s fridge; let us consume it 1960s-frozen for therein lies its Twist(ed)-Hula-Hoop(ed) richness. The author of \\"Soul on Ice\\" was no prophet, just an intelligent angry young black man who wrote under duress during an era when it was very difficult for his people to free their psyches from subjugation to the point where they could \\"say it loud: I am black and I am proud!\\"."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"The overall effect of the book was one of an eye opening experience where I was able to crawl inside the mind of a Black revoltuionary. The fact that this man was an American and not a part of a revolutionary force somewhere in the Uganda showd me that the crystal clean superficial of what we call America does not always have the same tint when we strip it down to its roots, with the oppressed. I wanted to read more about the author himself rather than read his highlt intelletual essays and for that reason, it took a great deal out of me to pick up the book after bringing myself to conclude one previous chapter. Not completely agreeable were some of the essays but at least they provided me with a new and often militant outlook on the situation that encased America for years. Cleaver opened my eyes and ears to an experience that will often be attempted to be left behind, but as long as the word is out, it will never die. &quot;Stay Strong!&quot;"},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"This is a lively, entertaining work. Cleaver never seems to lose sight of the fact he needs to entertain his audience, or sell books (or his ideas). Near the end Cleaver develops his own sexual philosophy of sorts and fleshes it out with a bit of detail.In the 1992 preface Ishmael Reed writes, \\"(although Cleaver criticized writer James Baldwin) it is obvious that Soul on Ice is influenced by Baldwin's flamboyantly eloquent taxidermist's style\\". It's said Soul on Ice is a classic and influential work. . . When I read this I wondered if what I write has been influenced by Cleaver. That is, I wonder if I've been influenced by those who've read and imitated Cleaver. I've come back to this review and given it 4 stars instead of 3. It's worthy of the 4 stars I just can't myself agree with the message. At times Cleaver makes a profound statement hidden simply inside half a sentence and then moves on to something else in the wink of an eye without following up or expounding upon the apparent revelation.In the middle of the book he writes, a bit facetiously, \\"all red-blooded Americans who love TV and gentle toilet tisue know that the negro revolution was conceived in Moscow (scratch Moscow, insert Peking) and launched by left-wing fanatics, and that the growing mass movement in opposition to Americans war in Vietnam is \\"communist inspired, manipulated and controlled\\"'.When I read that I thought it was one of the best things I've ever read. Looking back over it, I noticed 'toilet tisue' is misspelled. For a moment I thought I discovered a typo but most likely Cleaver misspells the word on purpose for effect.Overall there's a conciliatory or hopeful tone to the work. He seemed to see the white youth of America as ready and willing to change. Elvis and the Beatles were not going to corrupt white youth but liberate them. On the inside Jacket Cover, Media and Methods, writes, \\"this book is a black man's spiritual odyssey away from hate and crime towards understanding and 'convalescence'. Best Sellers writes \\"Cleaver is not simply a zealot or reactionary. . . He moves through Soul on Ice with a hunger to reaffirm his existence, sometimes in anger, sometimes with abundant pride, but the need is there to speak out, to comment, to seek truth\\". I have to disagree with that very last idea.Soul on Ice is divided into four parts. In part one, Letters from Prison, Cleaver talks a little bit about prison life and his previous experiences being a member of the Nation of Islam. At the end of part one there's a subchapter titled \\"initial reactions on the assassination of Malcolm X (Cleaver was ex-nation of islam but not yet a Panther when he wrote this book, I believe)\\". Of his pre-prison life, He writes, \\"I became a rapist. . . rape was an insurrectionary act (against white male domination or whatever)\\". Summing up his fall from grace, he writes, \\"After I returned to prison, I took a long look at myself and, for the first time in my life, admitted that I was wrong, that I had gone astray -- not so much from the white man's law as from being human, civilized\\". For the most part, though, he doesn't talk about his past \\"crimes\\".Part two, Blood of the Beast, is about the white race and it's heroes, and the heroes of the black race, Muhammad Ali for one. Cleaver suggests that a previous champ, the black Floyd Patterson, was the white man's hero, \\"There is no doubt that white America will accept a black champion, applaud and reward him, as long as there is no \\"white hope\\" in sight. But what white America demands in her black champions is a brilliant, powerful body and a dull, bestial mind--a tiger in the ring and a pussycat outside the ring\\".Part three, the aptly titled? 'Prelude to Love', is simply a short love letter to his Lawyer, and her reply. The love letter was so mushy and flowery even I had to pull back from the passage, thinking, 'come-on now'. Then Cleaver writes, \\"NOW TURN THE RECORD OVER AND PLAY THE OTHER SIDE\\" and proceeds to contradict every thing he's just written - a warning perhaps or a reality check? We love it when you keep it real. \\"I have tried to mislead you. I am not humble at all. I have no humility and I do not fear you in the least. If I pretend to be shy, if I appear to hesitate, it is only a sham to deceive. . . I had planned to run for President of the United States. My slogan? PUT A BLACK FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR TRIGGER. 400 years of docility, of being calm, cool and collected under stress would prove I was the man for the job. . . then came Watts!. . . Most Emphatically Yours, Eldridge Cleaver\\".The beginning of part four (titled White Woman, Black Man) is the best part of the book. It's basically a recounting of a speech given by an elderly black prisoner in the mess hall who sits down to eat with him and two brothers from the Nation. They refer to the old man as 'Lazarus' and 'the infidel' and 'the interloper' and 'the accused', as he tells his story, \\"we had him written down as an Uncle Tom - not that we had ever seen him buck dancing or licking the white man's boots, but we knew that black rebels his age do not walk the streets in America: they were either dead, in prison, or in exile in another country (I should note that the black man they are allegedly talking to is in prison with them)\\". The old man explains why he thinks black men want white woman. It sounds a bit like the story told in the movie \\"Jungle Fever\\". Cleaver expands upon this in the next sub-chapter of White Woman, Black Man, called 'the primeval Mitosis'. He calls black men 'Supermasculine menials' and white men, 'Omnipotent administrators'. Black women, 'self-reliant Amazons' and white women, 'Ultra Feminines' He says we're each striving to achieve a 'unitary sexual image' we're drawn towards each other, basically. It's quite interesting, but I don't think I believe all of it.The final subchapter of White Woman, Black Man, the very end, he dedicates, \\"to all black women, from all black men\\".The blueprint is laid out here in Soul on Ice. . . He calls on black women to remain faithful to black men while black men are being 'oppressed' by their need to sleep with white women. Soul on Ice is not so out of date. . . at Duke University recently the campuses was up in arms (about the patterns of abuse evident in the lacrosse player scandal) reiterating these very issues of oppression."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"I read this in the fall of 1969 and was struck then by the essay dedicated to James Baldwin and sexual orientation, particularly by the term \\"ghost\\" in reference to male homosexuals. Cleaver's comments are acute and, in a certain sense, prescient and prophetic. This work is about much more than black frustration and rage (remember the violent riots of the 60's) and for Americans who are interested in the past, in order to comprehend better the present and anticipate the future, this is good reading, much better than the bestseller pulp out there."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Mr. Cleaver seems to have been a very conflicted man. In this book he discusses his predicaments in his life and how he feels he came about them. He discusses his imprisonment, his life thereof and how he ended up there. He also shares his ideas on everything from corrupt government to his feelings about his convicted rapings of white women. I don't always agree with some of his views but they are very powerful nonetheless. If you are at all interested in the writings of Mr. Cleaver and have not read this book, I highly suggest that you do. To better understand his mindset. A very interesting book."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"racism is still alive and well in the USA, despite surface gains by some people of color. this book goes into a theory for black/white tensions: the primeval mitosis, when humanity split into male/female, black/white, etc. and our dichotimies became external rather than held within each human. eldridge has some very serious ideas about why our gender roles are lined up with &quot;race,&quot; and how the Body and Mind have become province to certain ethnicities. to heal our world, all humans must become whole: Mind, Body merging instead of blacks being all Body &quot;supermasculine menials&quot; and whites being &quot;omnipotentent administrators.&quot; eldridge's glance into inter-racial love are interesting, if not at times confusing since he fell in love with his own (white) lawyer. eldridge's writing is strong and his prose is evocative. i think the best essay in this book is the one on primeval motosis, where he lays out his theory on tensions between the races. but all of them are excellent, especially when cleaver examines the vietnam war and wars against colonionalism the world over and links colonial/liberation struggles to the struggle for equality in the US! deep stuff, seeing as how &quot;liberation&quot; has been &quot;won&quot; because all nations, no matter how squalid and repressed, have the honor of participating in capitalism (aka globalism). blacks and other oppressed people in the USA have also bought into the switcheroo. read cleaver and see that many of the issues happening in the late 60s have not been resolved.another thing i often found myself thinking: for a man who was incarcerated, and before the advent of the internet, cleaver must have put in so much effort to get the political/social information he did. even prison can not hold the mind/thoughts of someone who will reach out despite constraints."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Was a very good \\"read\\" , until the last 2 chapters..........I can't put into words why I write this , but the rest of the book was excellent , showing a very complex man , troubled while he wrote , in love , in hate , in patriotic tones , in slander , in lust , in life.........in fact I have to look up the rest of Mr. Cleavers life , I HAVE to know how it \\"ends\\".........Don \\"G\\""},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"As a college student, I chose this book due to my interest in history. It relates to that and much more. The black man's struggle with trying to find an identity in a white society which continues to ignore it. How the prison system oppresses rather than empowers. This book paved the way for the Black Panthers and a better understanding of the civil rights movement. Even though Cleaver is angry and hateful, he is an intelligent and observant writer. He educates himself through reading and writing, even while in the depressing circumstances of prison. His experiences in prison have been captured beautifully. Anyone who wants to understand race relations, incarceration, religion,and literature should read this book!"},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"This book, which is pure genius, is an insight to what it meant to be a black man in turbulent times.

THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR A NOVEL READER, BE WARNED."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Even though this was one of the most important and popular books of the 1960s, it is not discussed that much now, some thirty-five years after its initial publication. \\"Soul on Ice\\" is as much an allegorical masterpiece as it is a real description of black male (whom he refers to as Supermasculine Menials) attitudes towards prison-life, white racism (and white women in particular, who are here referred to as Ogres and the Ultrafeminines) and the Nation of Islam (Cleaver writes compellingly about his disassociation with the Nation, citing their racism--\\"The onus of teaching racial supremacy and hate, which is the white man's burden, is pretty hard to bear\\"). Cleaver's at-times amazing writing gives this book a peculiar power, and given this, it is easy to understand why the book was so popular in the late 1960s. For several reasons, though, it is easy to see why this book doesn't get as much attention as, say, James Baldwin's \\"The Fire Next Time\\" [1963]. The chapter on Baldwin in \\"Soul on Ice,\\" entitled \\"Notes on a Native Son\\" (a reference to one of Baldwin's early essays) is exceedingly homophobic, and other sections fairly hateful towards women (even though, in this regard, Cleaver is at times aware of his own misogyny--especially in his blushingly honest letters to one-time attorney Beverly Axelrod) and exceedingly macho. Many contemporary readers might not have the patience for this (especially given Baldwin's elevated status in the world of literature). Also, this book has lost some of its bite over the years because of excellent books written by participants in the Black Power Movement and the Black Panther Party. \\"Soul on Ice\\"--especially when compared with George Jackson's \\"Soledad Brother\\" (1971), Huey P. Newton's \\"Revolutionary Suicide\\" (1973), Amiri Baraka (1984) and Angela Y. Davis' (1974) autobiographies, and Elaine Brown's \\"A Taste of Power\\" (1992)--lacks the political vision, accuracy and believability of these other books, but it should also be credited for setting some of the standards by which these books would later have to judge themselves against, especially in regard to prison life (though Jackson's \\"Soledad Brother\\" is much more powerful in this regard). Nevertheless, \\"Soul on Ice\\" is a compelling read, and I agree with a statement that Ishmael Reed makes in the introduction that this book IS the 60s. If this memoir were a western, we could smell the sawdust on the floor."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Eldridge Cleaver writes his memoirs here, and much of the book seeks to justify his actions and sentiments. It is as if he knows that his actions have been looked down upon by America and he needs to tell us where he is coming from. I found it shocking, not only that he should admit to raping women, both white and black, but more so that he makes excuses for why he HAD to rape them. He also explains his veiws on the inferiority complex that has plagued the African American since slavery, and his motivation for violent response. These views, though, are exceedingly hard to sift out of the pontificatory run-on sentance that permeates this book. He will launch into the feelings of a black woman in this society, and while his point may be valid, his statement consists of two pages of metaphorical secondary clauses. But, for all of his circumlocution, Cleaver's points provide great insight not only into a black revolutionary, but a convict, a Muslim after the style of Malcom X, and the african american experience in general. In all, his thoughts are hauntingly true."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Soul on Ice, written by Eldrige Cleaver is a collection of essays (written during his 9 years in Folsom State Prison during the 1960's) in which Cleaver discovers his racial identity. \\"I knew I was black, but never really stopped to take stock of what i was involved in. I met life as an individual and took my chances.\\" Cleaver was sentenced 9 years for raping a white woman. Cleaver felt his crime was a way to \\"spit\\" on the white man's values and women. He lived his life only to benefit himself. After meeting with his attorney, he realizes the value of listening and absorbing what another human being has to say. \\"The price of hating other human beings is loving one's self less.\\" Cleaver, educating himself in prison, also writes \\"In prison those things held and denied from the prisoner become precisely what he wants most of all.\\"Cleaver becomes especially interested in the writings of Thomas Merton, particularly his excerpt on the \\"New York Black Ghetto: Harlem.\\" After many religious endeavors, Cleaver found himself most intrigued by the teachings of Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X. Malcolm X appealed to the black convicts caught in the vicious prison paroll cycle, like himself. One aspect in which Cleaver felt most attracted to in Malcolm was that the society owed a debt to prisoners and not vice versa. Malcolm X did not \\"compromise truth to have favor with the white power structure.\\" The American tactic was to emmasculate the black leadership and to manipulate them. The unique black leader who would defy white power would ultimately end up dead, in prison, or forced out of the country. Classic illustrations of this policy are the careers of Marcus Garvey, W. E. B. Dubois, and Paul Robeson. White America crushes the black leaders while inflating the images of Uncle Tom's (black on the surface, white on the inside)and celebrities. Power is taken out of political and economic context and plainly debased to the level of good sportsmanship. James Baldwin was an author who wrote \\"Native Son\\" and \\"White Negro.\\" Cleaver, inspired by Baldwin, felt that police brutatily was not caused by the hatred for the black man, but for social, economical, and political reasons. Blacks, having their freedom for approximately 100 years as a result of the Emancipation Proclamation, were still treated as \\"part of someone's invetory of assests.\\"After the most violent negro uprisings, the Burning of Watts, the white power structure pacifies the black community by appointing John Roseboro, an African American baseball player for the dodgers, to consultant for community relations. Cleaver also writes about the Vietnam War. Black soldiers are called upon to sacrafice their lives for freedom in Vietnam. In Watts they are killed because of their desire for freedom. Cleaver felt the black man should stay and die here for a better life.Cleaver's first imprisonment in 1954, for a drug charge, set the tone for his next 9 year term. Cleaver hung a poster of a white woman in his cell like the other prisoners. One of the guards came by and tore the poster down. The guard would only allow Cleaver to hang a picture of a black woman. Cleaver realizes that his attraction to the white women is not because of beauty or sexual appeal but because of their status and symbol. The white woman displays a symbol of freedom while the black woman is a symbol of slavery. \\"I will not be free until the day i can have a white woman in my bed and a white man minds his own business.\\"Although Cleaver's actions were not always moral nor did he go about things in a peaceful way, his fight was to allow the black race to revive their eradicated identity. From the moment the blacks were brought to this country from Africa, the white man imposed their culture and heritage upon them. Cleaver's quote, dealing with the white woman in bed, hits the nail on the head. He does not care for trivial freedoms and rights such as drinking from the same water fountain or riding at the front of the bus, he cares for the freedom where he can do what he wants, when he wants, without the white man looking over his shoulder. \\"One task that we have in the black community is a coupe de'etat against our present leadership, to strip them from that machinery that controls the community. So that new ideas and new people can percualate up, then we can have a new agenda.\\"I thorougly enjoyed this book because Cleaver moves from hate and violence towards an understanding of himself and humanity. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to gain a better understanding of the black struggle in the 1960's."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"I've spent the last thirty-two years being reminded of the brutal honesty and truth of much of this classical work on race, sex, and poverty by Eldridge Cleaver. I was honestly shocked by some of the sexual/racial ideas it contains the first time I read it in 1968, and decided to try it again to see if my present understanding of and assumptions about America now render this work moot- or affirm it.Not surprisingly, as much as I'd like to confirm or refute this work, the jury still won't come in and remains out. You should read this book if you've thought deeply about the &quot;why&quot; of our race problem in America, our prison problem in America, or the psychology of gender. You really owe this one to your real-world educational and intellectual development, whether you agree with it, or like it, or not. It will challenge, frustrate, and in the end, inspire you to look deeper. Great achievement; makes you wonder what extraordinary things never surfaced from inside this man's mind.A must-read from the 20th century."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"This book is actually somewhere closer to three and a half stars. It may even move up to four upon a second reading. It is a harsh book that is difficult to accept at times. The homophobia and sexism can be usettling. Of course, one must understand where Cleaver was coming from. The rascism is easier to understand in that light. And it should be noted that a lot of the anger and bitterness began to wane in later years. Cleaver seems to have undergone a spirtual transformation similar to that of Malcom X. This remains an important book from the 60s. It is critical for Americans both black and white (and yellow, brown and red as well) to read books like this to try to understand the horrors that have underscored this nations evolution. Cleaver, overcame tremendous obstacles to achieve this degree of success."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"The FBI could not have created a better person to sow the seeds of destruction for the Black Panther Party than Eldridge Cleaver.The treatise from jail - before Cleaver became a BPP member - catapulted him into the 1960s revolutionary/black power movements. But his so-called consciousness was never for the greater good of the whole.Cleaver failed to gain control of the BPP during his time in exile - and when he was essentially booted out of Cuba - by making what he felt was a left-turn by placing the organization into solidarity with nation's \\"at war\\" with U.S. imperialism. The attempted coup was foiled when Huey Newton kicked Cleaver and his followers out of the party. But Cleaver sounded so good when barking out orders thousands of miles away!The split began the fragmentation of the party. I contend it was the cornerstone development for the U.S. government to manipulate as a means to destroy the party from within. And I still have questions concerning the police shoot-out where Cleaver emerged basically unscathed, but his comrade in arms was shot dead.Cleaver - a convicted rapist - was legendary for his physical/verbal abuse of women. Again, the sickening spector of control through intimidation.It should have come as no surprise to anyone that years later Cleaver made an abrupt political turn into a right-extremist camp. He feared not being the head of the game, and with no place to turn on the left, Cleaver scampered to the right in hopes his new friends would pick him as captain of the team.As a slice of American History, Soul On Ice remains an essential read. But Cleaver's ideology cut severe wounds in the BPP, caused death and dissension, while arguably driving Newton into consolidating a national party into one Oakland chapter.Cleaver a revolutionary? Hardly. An egotistical coward? Yes."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"I have seldom read anything as offensive as Cleaver's attempt to pass off rape as a &quot;revolutionary&quot; act. By his own admission he is a serial rapist,and if he'd served time for all of them would never even have been out of jail in the sixties in the first place! While the other content of this book isn't totally worthless, I found that Cleaver came off as a typical criminal, filled with reasons why SOMEBODY ELSE was responsible for everything he did wrong. The first step to self respect is to accept responsibility for one's actions, Cleaver has not done that, nor does he give the slightest indication that he ever will. If you want to read an autobiography of a panther read Huey Newton's, because with Newton, instead of self pity, there was substance and intelligence behind the anger."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Mr. Cleaver wrote a semiautobiography about how society sets itself up along racial and gender lines. Raping women is reprehensible and evil and it doesn't help solve the racial/gender problem. It excabates it. Challenging the racist/sexist society by making alliances with people whom he considered to be his enemies will solve most of the problem. He should have shown love for his fellow man/woman. Didn't Jesus tell people to love your enemies, not hating and violating them? Later on in life, his views have changed for the better."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Outside the generally detached and often cynical reviews that are so typical of those who have little to no understanding of the inordinate complexities commonly born by blacks of the period, do I humbly submit this evaluation. I believe that if one is open enough to the notion of understanding life from an entirely foreign perspective, then one might also be able to appreciate the indefatigable efforts on an impossible journey to sainthood by this book's author. In my mind, Eldridge Cleaver most adequately personified the rebirth of the black conscious alpha male. His writing in this book was the perfect blend of a sort of primal rage coupled with the suave literary sophistication of the most accomplished poet. Soul on Ice is essentially an allegorical retelling of some of the most profound experiences in the life of a man who's awakening in a world drenched in terrorism (of the European variety) was anything but kind.As a black man in his thirties, I am always impressed and then ultimately relieved to see how men of my own ethnicity have torn through the societal constraints (real or imagined) seeking to right the wrongs of their lives that the whole of the community can begin to heal, thus being at peace with itself. Many can learn from this book -including whites- but only if the goal is not to seek justification for condemning the overall purpose of the black panthers harping on the imperfections and past sins of many of it's heralds. Believe me, there are quite a few reviews written about this book that give precisely that impression, only to concede begrudgingly of course, that these black men & women were indeed human after all.For Eldridge Cleaver, the book was a catharsis, in which he admits to the unsavory truth of his involvement in rape - a nearly unforgivable crime in my opinion. Nevertheless, one soon discovers that the author is not beyond the reach of redemption thankfully. His prose and allegory give strong testament to his skill with a pen. The back-n-forth love letters with his one-time lawyer Beverly Axlerod, are endearing and is sure to make every women blush. His unflinching analysis on the social politics of the day is defiant but also lucid; to suggest that the U.S. government (p. 153, paragraph 2), was sending 16% of blacks to Vietnam in order to butcher peasants who like themselves, were fighting for the right to self-determination - not so much to die - but that hate for blacks would metastasize across the rice fields of Asia like a cancer is jarring, but not entirely without merit. Lastly his appeal to black women was a call for reconciliation with the brothas, a call that has mostly gone unanswered even today sadly. Cleaver was no angel, nor should he have been as the world in which he lived, was no place for the faint of heart. And he was not trying to explain away, much less mitigate the severity of his crimes which quite frankly, pale in comparison to the force of the upswing in his life. I don't think his goal was to assuage white people or anyone else for that matter. Instead, he set out to discover himself and the world around him. In Ismael Reed's preface in this extraordinary book, is a most fitting description of Cleaver, given first by Amiri Baraka: Bohemian Anarchist!(Page 34, Paragraph 3)That is why I started to write. To save myself. I realized that no one could save me but myself. The prison authorities were both uninterested and unable to help me. I had to seek out the truth and unravel the snarled web of my motivations...It may be that I can harm myself by speaking frankly and directly, but I do not care about that at all. Of course I want to get out of prison, badly, but I shall get out some day. I am more concerned with what I am going to be after I get out. I know that by following the course which I have charted I will find my salvation. If I had followed the path laid down for me by the officials, I'd undoubtedly have long since been out of prison - but I'd be less of a man. I'd be weaker and less certain of where I want to go, what I want to do, and how to go about it."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Whew! The how-to shows the success of a writer who bootstrapped his way to the top a best-sellers list, deftly using his experiences and the several mentors who recognized his brainpower. The life path Eldridge Cleaver spent in getting to this writing peak is the not-to part. Much of the book is the kind of rant one might hear on Sunday morning TV, often with a socialist twist. But the ranting is quite clearly written, and sometimes just when the reader is about to say, \\"Oh, for pete's sake,\\" the author nails a concluding sentence right on the mark, and not necessarily where the reader thought the thread was heading. Such an unexpected thought hits in the middle of \\"The Primeval Mitosis\\" chapter: Cleaver concludes that, \\"liberality is, in fact, charity.\\" How true. To do the thought fairly, one has to read the chapter up to that point, of course.Then comes the chapter, \\"The Allegory of the Black Eunuchs.\\" If Cleaver could write like this for a whole book in a row, he would be a best-seller without resorting to polemics. Polemics, unfortunately, was the whole point. The disjointedness and flights of fury and semi-sense that showed up sporadically in the first part of the book suddenly funnel into a well-told story, almost in the style of the biblical tale of Job. Job's \\"friends\\" were more interesting (and speak better) than Cleaver's wooden pen pals, but \\"Lazarus,\\" or \\"Infidel\\" is arguably a much more complex person than old Job. He thus makes several key points using a character who changes page by page, chameleon-like. Here is a master story teller.Whatever the \\"yeas\\" and \\"boos\\" for most of the earlier book, the last chapter stands out as a worthy piece of writing. The reader realizes at this late point that the whole book was leading up to this ending, an apology and a love letter from all black men to all black women, from souls on centuries of ice. This was wonderfully done, and all the earlier diatribes and nonsense look like mere practice writing for the finale. That chapter is worth re-reading, as well as \\"Eunuchs.\\"."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"CLEAVER CLEARLY STATES HE PRACTICE RAPING LIGHT SKINNED BLACK WOMEN (BECAUSE HE THOUGHT DARK SKIN WOMEN WERE INFERIOR) UNTIL HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON WHITE WOMEN.

Cleaver spends a great deal of time writing on the injustices Black people face in America, and how even though he is what society wants him to be, it is his fault that he allow society to be right. He pledges to take steps towards change and to become a benefit to society.I know that a lot of people think that they know about the civil rights movement and the effects it had on the Black race, but they don't. This story of a man who, at the time, had been locked up for more than half of his life, is the story of all real Black people. I think that sometimes Black people do things and think that it is their nature, which is how stereotypes brew. Cleaver shows us that it is history and hatred that have made us a collective in an usual individual world. We do think for ourselves, yet a racist society continues to force us to travel down a road that we have not set for ourselves, and that he has fell into racist America's trap. He has become the stereotype: (supposedly) uneducated, a prisoner, and a victim of \\"The Ogre\\" (the white woman)."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"I enjoyed the book, but I'm on the hedge with my opinion of him as a person.

While reading this memoir, I was engaged, repulsed, seeking further understanding, and more. So many emotions were brought forth. Eldridge Cleaver provided us with insight to the soul of a complex man during a time of turmoil. While I may not have agreed with some of the things he had to share, I appreciated being able to look at social issues during that time period from his perspective. It's harsh, it's gripping, and it was his reality. Cleaver conveyed his feelings and views of society with such clarity and emotion that it certainly allows you to step inside of his mind and see from his perspective how it was to be black at that time...whether you agree or not, it certainly provokes reflection."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"I AM A YOUNG MEXICAN, AND I AM AMAZED THAT AFTER 30+ YEARS THIS BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE!

So if you are in for hearing how the Man has repressed his human brother for 400 years with a liberal sprinkling of .50 cent words then this book is for you.

Cleaver reveals this to us, exposing even his own faults, the psychological enslavement of African America, and the reality of how it plays out in society. Despite those that believe that this book pertains only to this era are obviously blind to the fact that many of the same issues then exist today. What makes it worse is that many people are unaware of it now, the gimmicks of media and political correctness have only mastered camouflaging it.

This book reveals the white power struggle to control the mind, body, and spirit of the black man - a relevant and true account even as we enter into the 21st century. Judging from the present injustices and the apathy of the black masses, as well as the disproportionate black prison population, it is certainly true that the white man has ruled the back man's mind and body; however, Cleaver's testimony is proof that their spirit is unconquerable."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Written from Folsom Prison in 1968. Some people have referred to this as an autobiography, though I don't remember the author calling it that. It is more a series of essays. It is pretty deep. To understand it at all you have to constantly remind yourself who is writing it, from where, and when.Cleaver has a lot of insight on several levels. He offers his thoughts on the society as a whole during his day and particularly on the origins and effects of classism and racism. He talks about forces at work and the effects of such diverse phenomena as hula hoops, Elvis Presley, and the Beatles. Reading it as Barack Obama was being elected President was particularly informative, because we could see the longer range effects of some of the directions Cleaver saw the country moving forty years ago. I wish he could have seen it happen. The author goes deep into his analysis of the role of sex in society and especially in racism and he uses some graphic, colloquial terms.Cleaver was the Minister of Information for the Black Panthers, and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.A Call to Arms!

The uncomfort it produces explains much of the reason why it will endure as a classic"},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"I first encountered this tall white haired man standing curbside along 5th street in San Bernardino awaiting the west bound city bus. His complexion was a grayed out brown and his skin looked warn yet he stood tall and erect and desplaying an air of confidence. I passed him day after day and had no ideal that the man awaiting the morning bus was Leroy Eldridge Cleaver. At some point it was pointed out to me that \\"he'd once been somebody important,\\" but that was obviously along time ago. I pondered stopping for quite sometime but decided against it. At this stage in my life, Cleaver was a relic from the distant past. A man whose importance I was faintly aware of yet had no ideal of how I should feel about him and his contribution to black history. Once I'd learned of his activities first as a writer and activist, my impression of him changed. I found him not only shameful but contemptible as well. I continued to pass him by casting clear and purposeful glances tinged with emotion. I wanted my contempt to be obvious. Day after day this continued and I began to wonder if he was ashamed of what he'd allowed himself to become. For the manner in which he'd allowed himself to be used in the war against his own people. I was equally angered by his duplicitous dealings with prison authorities, the FBI, CIA and ultimately right-wing Evangelical Christian zealots and the GOP.F--- that fool I thought, look at him now. All that scheming and scamming and he's catching the city bus? He'd once been a celebrated author, respected community activist and Presidential candidate. He was beloved and respected but he'd traded it all away and for what? As I glanced upon this broken down shell of a revolutionary I couldn't imagine the depth of his fall. He now occupied a place in society that was no better than my own. I made absolutely no since and so I picked up for the first time \\"Soul on Ice\\" and then I began to understand. The faults and frailties were always there plain as the snow white goatee on his aged face. I read line after line and kept running into ideals that seemed completely disingenuous for someone in his position. We are often damned by our own words and deep within the pages of Soul on Ice, the author opens up in a confessional manner that should have served as a warning for all those who allowed him into their inner-circle and placed trust in him.\\"I mislead...I pretend...I...sham to deceive...I sucker my fellow men in and seduce them of their trust. And...if it suits my advantage, I lower the boom-mercilously...\\" In this letter to attorney Beverley Axelrod, the man formerly known as Leroy E. Cleaver Jr., Eldridge X., and ultimately Eldrige Cleaver went on to say \\"my vanity is vast...my heart is that of a tyrant, my arm is the arm of the Executioner. It is only the failure of my plots that I fear...\\" I often wonder at what point did that decrepit old man feel the fear rise from his failures? I wonder what role did the arm of the Executioner play in the death of little Bobby Hutton? There were so many things to regreat in the life of Eldridge Cleaver none more so than the granting of his wish to be the \\"voice of doom,\\" for the black panther party. I suppose it fitting that the quisling should end his life disdained and forgotten. However there is something sad and disappointing with the story of Eldridge Cleaver and the disingenuous penning of Soul on Ice."},{"Title":"Soul On Ice","review":"Controversial book written from prison.

It could easily be used by anyone who knows basic Algebra and has no knowledge of Statistics before starting the course (such as myself!)The author relies heavily on the example problems to illustrate each concept clearly. The example problems are easy to follow, and anything that is potentially confusing is usually foot-noted. It is a very incremental approach. You'll spend most of your time working problems and doing calculations, and very little doing just straight reading. The area where the book really shines is in its large assortment of practice problems, plus the extra review section at the end of each chapter. There is lots of opportunity to practice the techniques.I had hoped to get a better grounding in Theoretical Statistics and Probability Theory so I often found myself on the internet looking for the original works by Pearson, Gosset, LaPlace, and anything I could find for more advanced knowledge. This is not necessary to use the text book, I just want to point out that I was not able to satisfy my intellectual curiosity about the subject matter from the textbook alone. The title Introductory means just that.One point of note is I purchased the associated Solutions Manual, which was completely unnecessary since the same answers are in the back of the book, and it is error-ridden!

This is critical in a subject this complex even at the introductory level.

This textbook is great for students."},{"Title":"Business operations in the Republic of China (Taiwan) (Tax management portfolios)","review":"Three sociologists studied the same male-female interactions and got different fuel for blaming men. One studying Native american tribes said that the men protecting the women was how they maintained a \\"protection racket\\", the second said that they were as usual leaving all the work to women, and the last said that it was a patriarchal system where men had all the power. That above quote is from a book by Jack Kammer where he discusses sociology breifly as being an arm of feminism that being said in this book they do everything to blame whatever they can on men like me. Me and my white male privelege of working 40hrs a week and going to school. I understand in Chapter 9 Inequalities of gender it would mostly be written with feminist asides but if sociology is a science as our teacher insisted they could at least be objective or at the very least check their facts. For example in discussing the wage gap they never once mention that women tend to take majors in careers that pay less and stay away from most hard science classes like engineering ie the careers that pay well, of course, they dont mention having kids will interrupr your career either, which is something that many women do. The usual culprits reads like its out of a Faludi book: Sexism, exclusion from the old boys network, glass cieling. They even attempt to use the idea of a glass cliff when discussing two women who lost their ceo positions, Fuller was fired when Mirant went bankrupt something that happens to male ceos as well, but the second example they cited was just too ludicrious. Carly Fiorina of HP who dumped a profitable printing section and the company was bleeding money left and right until finally she was fired due to her lack of any business sense. Of course they do not mention that they just say it happened to her after she attempted to merge with Compaq thereby subtly blaming the invisible hand of patriarchy. Then they talk about gender equality and the law, all that I can say to that is women have more than equality under the law they have free liscense to murder their husbands and get away with it rather easily. Under inclusive feminism they attempt to say that men are threatened by feminism and dont want to lost their priveleged position, again aside from the top ten percent of men who are filthy rich......I dont feel that priveleged.At least at the end of the chapter on gender inequality they make mention of the fact that men are more likely to kill themselves at least society isnt exactly friendly to men either, so at least there was some hope of a balanced chapter at the end.But it doesnt end there in Chapter 12 RIGHT before they discuss Domestic Violence, They say, \\"The loosening of economic dependency has had consequences for men as well,\\" you would think that maybe its going to swing a bit to the fair side but your disappointed, \\"a divorced man whose former wife has a job can more easily escape the need to make custody payments...the gender gap in pay means that women suffer more than men.\\" Of course they dont mention the stat that says women dont make payments more often, when compared to men. Also I would like to mention they also have the feminist stat that a man standard of living goes up 10% after a divorce.....tell me what kind of financial planner would tell you to get married and divorced so your standard of living would go up? The only thing I am going to mention about the Domestic violence section is that they dont mention that studies have found that women and men are equally likey to use violence in a relationship, which again means if you werent well versed on the issue before you would assume a man is guilty of domestic violence in all cases when the cops are called. The reality is a lot different do a search for Erin Pizzey.In closing I would like to say that I hated Intro To Sociology, not only due to the horrible research that was done on the issues contained therein, because I was forced to take it as part of my psychology degree path I didnt have a choice. Many people failed or got Ds in the class because they couldnt read the book itself, not much of an edorsement there. Please if you are a professor reading this use a better book.I myself have changed my major to Biology since this class essentailly soured me on social sciences as a whole (I still cant figure out how sociology is a science aside from the fact that they do historical studies but the interpretation is up to the researcher and his/her biases) and secondly because they dont earn much with a four year degree *hint* *hint*."},{"Title":"Hickory Dickory Death","review":"I absolutely loved this book!

This, in my opinion, is one of those books. Despite an intriguing premise, the story (which concerns a fairly uninteresting group of young college students) deteriorates somewhere in the middle and the reason for the random thefts takes an unusual and boring direction. The solution, which is arrived at with little of the skillful detection that Poirot is known for, is one of those types that you forget almost immediately after finishing. For first readers of Christie, please don't let this book influence your opinion of her quality. I STRONGLY recommend AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, DEATH ON THE NILE, THE ABC MURDERS, and FIVE LITTLE PIGS, which rank among her very best."},{"Title":"Hickory Dickory Death","review":"I'm only 19 years old, but yet a veteran at reading A.C novells. I have read about 30-32, of all the 55-full lenght novells,. I have to admit the I prefer Hercule Poirot, over Mrs Marple. Still this book features Poirot, and it is still one of the weakest of A.C:s books. I can only think of one that disliked moore, and that's &quot;at bertrams hotell&quot; (Mrs Marple).

But remember that this is only my humble opinion...read it and judge for yourself!"},{"Title":"Hickory Dickory Death","review":"HICKORY DICKORY DOCK is unique in that it involves Hercule Poirot's confidential secretary Miss Lemon. Christie is ruthless in her general description of Miss Lemon, often referring to her has being little more than a highly intelligent, unemotional calculating machine. In addition to effciently running Poirot's front office, Miss Lemon is concerned primarily with inventing her own filing system. The poor thing is also described as \\"hideous\\" in appearance.I found it very interesting how BBC's Mystery! altered the character of Miss Lemon for TV. There's nothing at all \\"hideous\\" in actress Pauline Moran's characterization. She is much more outgoing & has a strictly platonic--but hurmorous--relationship with Poirot's sidekick, Captain Hastings. Many times they exasperate the fastidous Belgian detective. This makes for a good script. Pauline Moran is perfect in this role. The one thing that keeps Miss Lemon at least a little aligned with Christie's original character is a very tight roll of large curls crossing her forehead as a fringe--this hairdo is, indeed, deliberately hideous.I like both Christie's Miss Lemon & BBC's version.Well, back to HICKORY DICKORY DOCK.In this story Miss Lemon's sister is introduced (for the first & only time.) Poirot is bowled over by the fact that Miss Lemon even HAS a sister--or any family at all. He seems to think that she was created by a purely technological union of two typewriters. As it turns out, the sister manages a youth hostel of full-time students. Thefts begin occuring & other strange incidents. Miss Lemon & her sister ask Poirot to look into things.The resulting story has more than a few highly implausible sub-plots, including the existence of a drug smuggling ring. This raises the question, is Christie's mystery world meant to be realistic or fanciful? I don't think it was necessarily meant to be realistic, but even at that Christie often goes wide of the mark. For example, in HICKORY DICKORY DOCK the drug smuggling motif goes like this: The drug cartel has come up with the perfect plan to get drugs into Englad--they hide them in a secret compartment in--get this--STUDENT BACKPACKS! After all, no one would suspect (albeit unwitting) foreign students going throughg British customs with their backpacks...oh, Agatha, Agatha.On the plus side, there's plenty of humor in HICKORY DICKORY DOCK that makes it worthwhile reading. I also think that Christie demonstrates a certain degree of tolerance for racial & political differences. One of the few students who ISN'T hiding something is a female MD student from Africa named Elizabeth. Not only is she above suspicion, but she is studying primarily in order to eventually improve things back home.

Then, he calls up everyone, tries to put the blame on each person (and make the innocents squirm...), and finally revealing the case against the criminal. This book lacked this pattern: Poirot was assisting the police (a very rare occurance in more modern mysteries, where the \\"good\\" detective has to work against them) to solve a crime, and the blame was put on a certain character after being framed by another one.Even though this was an original book in that respect, I found the story as a whole very predictable, old fashioned (which is to be expected since it was written quite a while ago) and full of places where I figured out how useless the police or Poirot were acting, and came up with a better way of doing things myself... Also, the description of the foreign students seemed a little prejusticed to me, even though the different era could account for that, too."},{"Title":"Hickory Dickory Death","review":"I think that this book was very good!

The majority of Thompson's contribution is information about various contractors, the variations in these models, timelines, and common pitfalls of M1 ownership.

The descriptions of various types of guns and their proper care and preservation, is explained in finite detail. Mr. Thompson leaves no stone unturned covering the past 60or so years in the life of this beautiful treasure. The accompanying photographs of the author field testing his rifles, and photos of various guns and accessories are well described and captioned.War (and Peace) stories are spun through tbe context of the book.I love Jim Thompson's personalized style of writing, I seemed to flow with him from one chapter to the next eager to learn more.

His insightful handling of issues and clever debunking of a lot of widely-held bogus conspiracy theories is as sharp as his examination of the anti-gun lobby, and his new tome gives some insight into what the man is about. He also sheds some light on peripheral but all-important American issues, which seem to totally elude most firearms writers. The first three chapters are particularly enlightening... His new &quot;Great Guns&quot; books, out about 2002-2003, promise to be entertaining and enlightening, just like these two missives.

The consequences are terrible: drained financial resources, incessant internet searches for M1s, parts, and attendant paraphernalia. You find yourself attending meetings, standing, and reciting the familiar phrase, \\"Hello, my name is B--- and I am a Garandoholic.\\"Along the way, to really appreciate this hobby (whether shooting or collecting), it is required that you build up a library and along side of Duff, Canfield, and the others are the books by Jim Thompson. None of the books written by *any* authors, by themselves, will provide a complete and total compendium of knowledge about Mr. J. C. Garand's wonderful rifle. All of them do provide essential information, making the practitioner more appreciative of the M1.Some of the other reviewers have objected to Mr. Thompson's rants about gang bangers, the criminal element, gun confiscation, Arizona local government, etc. are a bit tiresome. I do not share that view. On the contrary, I found Mr. Duff's books to be chocked full of facts and history, but a bit dry and too much a relation of the history of the Springfield armory. Consequently, Mr. Thompson's opinions provided interesting counterpoint. I value *both* the books that I have by Duff and Thompson as valuable components in a necessary reference library.To be sure, Mr. Thompson does provide a great deal of his personal knowledge to his works and does so in a very literate manner. I mean, a gun book whose author uses the words \\"calumny\\" and \\"denouement\\"?The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I wish it were longer."},{"Title":"Complete M1 Garand","review":"After reading the reviews of this book, I was looking forward to a practical, yet interesting read to help me understand the M1 Garand better. I was disappointed on several levels. Here are a few of the reasons I didnt care for this book, and below this list you will find why I recommend Scott Duffs \\"The M1 Garand: OWNER'S GUIDE\\"1. The format in which the book present information is relatively random, with no coherent logic apparent. Instead it seemed like random thoughts and examples of various M1's. His dialogue throughout the book is perhaps geared toward someone already familiar with the ins and outs of the M1, and he is providing some random information that perhaps is helpful to them (but not to the new collector).2. The photographs are atrocious. Several of the photographs were bleached out, double imaged, fuzzy, or too dark. Normally I wouldn't care, but in a book which you specifically purchase so that you can learn to examine small parts of a rifle and related maintenance tasks, it was totally unacceptable. I showed it to my wife and she immediately was surprised at how poor the images were.3. Was hoping to get a clear idea of maintenance protocol. Book was a complete let down in this arena. Rather than clearly demonstrate proper maintenance procedures, author places a photocopied manual from Beretta discussing care and maintenance of the rifle. It wasnt horrible, but near as detailed as it could have been. For example, there was little to no discussion of grease points. He did talk about grease vs. oil, types of grease, but if he got specific about grease points I missed it. No index of course to easily find such a thing.4. Irritated me that author swears up and down that using an uncut op-rod is dangerous, and says to \\"study unit histories\\" to find examples. If its that dangerous to do so, couldn't he have cited at least one example? I tend to think he is a victim of oft repeated statements and is passing it on as fact. Now, has ANYONE ever been hurt by one failing? I HAVE NO IDEA, and would never offer advice to anyone on the topic. However I'm not the purported expert writing a book with nothing to back up my statement.5. While I thought I would appreciate the \\"down home\\" dialogue that other reviewers seemed to like, I found his informality distracting and annoying. For example, he comes off condescending when he talks about the incorrect recollections of an M1 by \\"some old antique\\" (referring to an old person). Well personally I had a vet tell me about the M1 he carried in Korea, and while the vets memory may be clouded, I still respect him and would never snub his \\"M1 knowledge\\". At one point, in reference to some viewpoint that some people have about the M1 (sorry cant remember the exact example) he says something about it being pure ignorance, and a few other derogatory adjectives I cant recall right now. Bottom line, I thought he came off condescending (despite the fact that he voices his distaste for those who snub the milsurp collectors). In my opinion, it would have been better if he had just stuck to the facts, and cut out the editorializing.After deciding I was going to return this product (yes I admit I did not read every word, I could tell from a serious look-through that it was not going to work) I ordered Scott Duffs book that I mentioned above. (new copies selling cheaper on Ebay than Amazon). Within 10 minutes of browsing through this book, I knew I had found what I was looking for. The book was laid out in a LOGICAL manner, well designed for a new garand owner. He discusses the history. Enough to give the reader a good background, not so much to bore them to tears. He then discusses maintenance. While he draws from other sources, the line drawings are EXCELLENT, and much better move than blurry black and white photographs! He provides a list that says exactly what materials you need to own to properly clean and maintain M1. He goes into detail about the process. I wish he would have had a picture showing grease points, but he does give you a clear list telling you exactly what needs to be greased. He has complete dis-assembly and assembly directions. He has information for sighting in the rifle, info about this sights and various other parts (including some distinctions between early and late war models, and Winchester vs. SA differences. This book was perfect for what I was looking for. It does not give the reader a detailed guide to determining origin of minor parts but as I recall, he acknowledges that and refers the reader to a different text. This book is not for the person wishing to explore the originality of their rifle and the intricacies of the parts. It is exactly what it says, \\"an OWNERS GUIDE\\" but it goes way beyond your typical owners guide, including production dates numbers, etc. An appendix in the back provides helpful resources also.Do yourself a favor and order Duffs book. Avoid the \\"Complete M1 Garand.\\" It is not complete, rather it is a compiled collection of other sources mixed with the authors personal observations of the M1 and the world around him."},{"Title":"Complete M1 Garand","review":"This book is almost useless.

But I found it a worthy adjunct to other books on the Garand and I have no regrets over my purchase. There is some very good information for the Garand owner.In summation, I would suggest people think about the paper version, even if I have not seen it.

Moving eastward, high mountains restrict access to the Alto Plano and the Amazon jungles beyond accentuate climate variations. Large indigenous populations share a common Inca heritage and historically Ecuador was a Spanish colony. As Ecuador was transformed and modernized in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, elites envisioned national reform. The discourse was about how a railroad could tie the country together. Historically, it should be noted, railroads are marked as the quintessential icon of modernity in Latin America.A. Kim Clark traces the development and construction of the rail link between Guayaquil, a port city on the coast and Quito, the capital in the interior. The railroad was seen as redeeming because it represented \\"for Ecuador, her moral resurrection and emancipation as a people.\\"(43) Differences between the \\"principal dominant groups in Ecuador - the landowning elite of the highlands and the agro-export elite of the coast\\" (2) were overcome as each group perceived an advantage from the railroad. The insular land holding elite in the interior were tempted by expanding markets for their crops and livestock. Coastal elites, on the other hand, badly need labor to produce cocoa for export. The railroad alone was a technological achievement, but more significantly it served as a unifying link for nation building.Clark notes three important aspects of the railroad in Ecuador: \\"First, the construction of the railway was associated with important political-economic transformations in Ecuador.... Second, the railway, and the broader discourse of movement and connection that surrounded it, allowed for consensus about the nature of national development....Third, the processes of national economic, political, and social integration through the railway had contradictory and uneven effects on different social groups and regions.\\"(1-2)If constructing the railroad was fraught with difficulty, the discourse necessary to achieve a consensus to even build it, likewise was not easy. It was the conservative leader, Gabriel Moreno, who came up with the very liberal idea to develop road and rail transportation as a means of uniting the country. Unlike most other Latin American countries, he did this by bringing the church and state closer together, rather than using the military to pressure the country toward modernization. (24)Not until 1895 when General Eloy Alfaro and other coastal liberals wrested power from the dominant conservatives in Quito did Ecuador finish the task when they contracted with North American entrepreneur Archer Harmon. \\"The major difficulty was...due to the climatic conditions and the nature of the rocks.\\" (36) When the Guayaquil-Quito link was inauguration in 1908, Ecuadorian liberals preened triumphantly. Hope for the nation sprang from optimism for national unity when the railroad opened up the interior to bring people together.Clearly the building of the railroad was redeeming in that Ecuador was for all practical purposes disunited by geographic and ideological barriers. High mountains had separated the costal lowlands from the plateau and the more insular interior elites differed in outlook from the progressive export oriented coastal elites. As such the railroad was an \\"arena\\" of discourse between a geographical and ideological divide. The quickening of movement and communication would help promote the idea of an Ecuadorian national identity.In reading The Redemptive Work, there is very little discussion directly about consumption as a mechanism of modernization, but in talking about the effect of the railroad on labor, agriculture, urbanization, movement, and connection, it is possible to extract some clues from the text.Cocoa production for export did little to stimulate Ecuador's domestic economy. There was little foreign investment and the capital generated went overseas or went to support a luxurious life style for a few local elites. Cocoa production did stimulate growth in the population of Guayaquil where labor was in short supply due to the climate and illness associated with coastal living. Relatively high wages were offered to laborers there, compared to agricultural workers in the interior. Similarly higher wages for rail workers did not translate into more consumption. Intermediaries took a cut and left the workers with about half of their pay.Other factors did not help build an internal economy. \\"As cocoa production expanded on the coast, it did not mean that highland food production was developed through transfer of earnings from the export sector to the non-export economy.\\" (27) Despite the fact that Ecuador was an agricultural country, it was cheaper to import foreign food staples than to acquire them from the interior. What little industry developed had an agricultural basis and this was not significant.The railroad did create a labor market for people from the interior to seek work on the coast and, by means of the railroad, interior elites were able to expand internal agricultural and livestock markets while easing access to imported goods, which presumably benefiting themselves more than others. Exactly how these factors effected the consumption patterns of peasants and indigenous people is unclear, but most likely it was minimal.Nevertheless Clark concludes, \\"The railway stimulated the internal market by improving transportation in three ways. First, it allowed rapid transportation, which facilitated the commercialization of fresh vegetables and dairy products in coastal cities and towns. Second, the railway made it possible to transport heavy or bulky products such as onions, potatoes, grains, and corn. Third, the reduced cost of transportation permitted an increase in the profit margins for certain products destined for the internal market: livestock, dairy products, and some legumes (especially lentils and peas).\\" (110)Clark makes one explicit reference to expanding the internal market in a program of the Sociedad Nacional de Agricultura to create additional consumers along with the elimination of debt peonage. Underscoring its proposals was a concern that \\"indigenous peasants frittered away their earnings in unproductive ways.\\" (128) This move to expand consumerism also served as a racist argument against Chinese merchants moving to Quito, accusing them of being \\"'meager consumers'\\" and \\"restricting costs to such extremes that they prevent legitimate competition'\\" (168-69) In this instance it does not seem the railroad was redemptive."},{"Title":"Sight Unseen and Other Plays","review":"Donald Margulies is one of the best playwrights currently at work in the American theater. His view of, particularly, middle class family life is elevated above the ordinary by Margulies' ability to observe his characters' struggles with the sharpest of eyes, while making his audience see and sympathize with the different points of view. His plays exploring the life of the artist also resonate. Margulies' earlier plays play with surrealism and comedy, while in the more recent plays he has used his knack for shuffling time and place to illuminate what appear to be ordinary lives. The Model Apartment is a remarkable play that dares to explore the fallout of the Holocaust through a lens of comedy, with powerful results. I look forward to a next volume of collected works of this extraordinary playwright."},{"Title":"Sight Unseen and Other Plays","review":"The collection was in good shape and arrived within the expected shipping time.

Mr. Page is thoughtful, balanced and even-handed throughout. Though the book is long, it is a tense and exciting read. He knows how to tell a story, and there is none more compelling than the story of our nation in its peril. This series is so well-respected that it is surprising to see negative reviews on this site. Read this book for yourself, and you'll feel its excellence on every page."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire: A People's History of the Civil War and Reconstruction","review":"Page Simith's history is unparalleled anywhere. This history should be required reading in schools everywhere, in place of the boring, lifeless textbooks we were forced to read as children. If minor and pointless minutiae can be refuted, the big picture cannot. This is not \\"revisionist\\" history, it is told primarily through contemporary diaries and newspaper accounts, and assembled into a riveting narrative by a master historian. The heroes and villains of this frenzied, uncompromising, brutal and ultimately disastrous period are allowed to emerge on their own, not as fantasies of a partisan agenda. This great country can learn much from the retelling of this painful episode in our history, on our collective journey to become the great people we think we are."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire: A People's History of the Civil War and Reconstruction","review":"Page Smith's &#34;Trial By Fire: A People's History of the Civil War & Reconstruction&#34; is the 5th volume in an 8 volume history of the United States from its inception to the New Deal. In other words, you have 1/8th of an 8000 page history in your hands. This book's focus is not so much on the war itself, nor all the various battles, but rather the historical context of that time and place. Smith states: &#34;I feel obliged to make clear to the reader that this is not primarily a military history.&#34; If one wants to cover the military aspects, you cannot do better than peruse Shelby Foote's multivolume tome.Virtually every history book that covers 1860 to 1876 glosses over Reconstruction. Admittedly, it is not a fun subject. But this is where this book really shines. Smith takes 1st person sources and brings them to life. I would do a disservice trying to summarize that subject, but other topics are equally well done. For example, in Chapter 24 'Hospitals & Prisons'... &#34;Whitman wrote, 'the wounded lying on the ground, lucky if their blankets are spread on layers of pine or hemlock twigs, or small leaves. No cots; seldom even a mattress...The ground is frozen hard, and there is occasional snow.'&#34; There are gems like that everywhere. Smith has culled information from some of the best writers of the time.But he is at his best when he is adding his own summaries to all the background. Here he is near the end in a chapter entitled &#34;Reconstruction Reconsidered&#34;: &#34;It took the convergence of half a dozen elements - the desire of the Republicans to hold onto power; the fanatical and immovable determination of the South to reduce the freedmen to a condition of slavery in all but name; the intractable and finally infuriating policies of President Johnson; a widespread desire to punish the South in the face of Southern intractability; the political pressures created by the vast network of freedmen's associations; and, perhaps above all, the skill and tenaciousness of the leaders of the Radical Republicans in Congress - it literally took all these unpredictable elements to effect those modest improvements in the condition of the freed slaves that could be counted by the 'end' of Reconstruction.&#34; This is powerful stuff. I defy anyone to find a pithier statement on Reconstruction anywhere.I'm looking forward to starting Volume 6: The Rise of Industrial America."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire: A People's History of the Civil War and Reconstruction","review":"I second Mr. Sanchez, although with somewhat less disgust. I am astounded by Mr. Smith's lack of understanding of the military aspects of his subject. For example, he continuously refers to the senior Federal general as the &quot;Chief of Staff&quot;, a position not introduced into the US Army until the 20th Century. Indeed, one of the great shortcomings of the Union military establishment was the lack of a Chief of Staff with the unifying powers of that position over the quasi-independent Departments and their feudal baron-like Chiefs.Mr. Sanchez has noted the absence of references, which I can only ascribe to Mr. Smith's lack of serious scholarly intent. He clearly takes the view that this work is, and ought to be, a vehicle for his own revisionist political agenda. That agenda is made abundently clear by his heavy handed approach in describing the decadent &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; Southern life-style which, although few enjoyed, all were culpable.&quot;Lincoln&quot;, by Gore Vidal is better history as a work of fiction than &quot;Trail by Fire&quot;."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire: A People's History of the Civil War and Reconstruction","review":"Simply put, this book is not worth reading. The author writes in EXTREMELY vague generalizations, thereby jumping to many untrue conclusions about numerous things. And, when he is done writing about his view of &quot;Southern Culture&quot;, he goes on to show a very poor understanding of the actual war. His commentaries on the generals alone was enough to make me stick out my tongue and put the book down in disgust. Furthermore, he cites ABSOLUTELY NO sources, so we, the readers have no way of knowing if he made everything up!

Usually these books are not up to snuff, the author having grown as a writer in the intervening years. A WOMAN BETRAYED is an exception to this. Written in 1991, it is a bit dated as it mentions nothing of the technological gains of the following ten years we have come to take for granted such as the internet, caller ID, and cell phones. But the story itself is compelling and just as good as anything Delinsky has written in recent years.As a wife, mother of two, and business owner, Laura Frye seems to have it all but finds her life crumbling down around her when her CPA husband of 20 years fails to come home from work one evening. At first Laura believes it has to be either foul play or that Jeffrey has had an accident of some sort, but when she discovers the IRS has been investigating Jeff for tax fraud, it becomes all to clear that he left on his own accord. As a part of the investigation, Laura's assets are frozen. How is she going to make mortgage payments or college tuition payments for her son let alone pay her employees at the restaurant she owns?Things get worse before they get better with a new revelation that Jeff was having an affair, her son being arrested, and Jeff's brother Christian, Laura's early love, returning. There's also Laura's interfering mother who doesn't think Laura can do anything right, and the local newspaper who continues to try Jeff's case via editorials and front page headlines.If you have enjoyed Barbara Delinsky's later novels such as A WOMAN'S PLACE, COAST ROAD, LAKE NEWS, and THE VINEYARD, you are sure to also enjoy A WOMAN BETRAYED. This is highly recommended as a book difficult to put down once started. The devastating effects Jeff's actions have on his wife, children, mother, brother, business partner, and friend are well-documented. Surprises revealing motivation for not only Jeff but other minor characters keep the reader turning pages. In addition, the reader is treated to the budding romance between Tack Jones, the IRS agent investigating the case and Laura's best friend and attorney, Daphne. Delinsky has done a wonderful job of bringing this vast array of characters to life via the pages of this book.

This is a must-read for fans of Barbara Delinsky."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"After reading &quot;Lake News,&quot; I scanned the reviews of other books by Barbara Delinsky and picked this book from the list.

When Laura's husband disappears without a trace (even the IRS and FBI can't find him), her life starts to unravel as she adds up the bills, encounters tax problems and frozen assets, and discovers that she has no personal credit rating. After 20 years of marriage, she finds she never really knew her husband, and was unaware of the real source of some of his income. Various things are dredged up from the past including the emotional abuse that some people endured as children. As Laura struggles to maintain her own career and business while dealing with her family, an old friendship is lost but an old love is rekindled.

Sure, eventually the love of her life comes back to her rescue, but this book carefully analyzes the relationship between lovers, friends, parents and children.

However, one day Jeff fails to return home. Laura's first inclination is that her husband is hurt from an accident. Starting to worry, she wonders if Jeff is dead. When she hears nothing further either from him or authorities, she concludes he purposely vanished to evade the IRS who wanted him arrested for years of scamming money.Laura's perfect life quickly collapses as the IRS freezes the Frye assets. Laura's first love and Jeff's brother Christian returns to provide her with the emotional support she desperately needs during this crisis. Soon, this couple decides that they remain in love and want to start a life together, but both needs to see Jeff one last time before moving onto something new and hopefully better.Barbara Delinsky wrote this appealing novel over ten years ago, but the plot remains as fresh and fascinating as when it was first released. The protagonists touch the hearts and souls of the audience as Ms. Delinsky shows why she always lands on the New York Times bestseller list.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"Laura Frye thought she had the perfect life. Until one night her husband Jeff didn't come home. Laura is sure there has been some terrible accident that has prevented Jeff's homecoming. He would never disappear on purpose. As if the disappearance isn't enough, six days later the IRS is knocking on her door to inform her Jeff is being investigated for tax fraud. The man she thought she knew isn't the man she knew at all. And the bad news doesn't end there...but you'll have to read the book to find out what happens next!A Woman Betrayed was an absolute fabulous book. The book gets going on the first page and doesn't stop until the end. The reader begins to wonder just how much this one woman can take and how much she'll have to endure. The book is written in such a way that everything that happens to Laura and her family is believeable. Ms. Delinsky did her homework well before writing this book. Every event falls into place in a long (and I do mean long) line of betrayal. The storyline of Daphne, Laura's lawyer friend, and Tack, the IRS agent, added to the story too. Their storyline ties in with the rest of the story effortlessly.I can't say enough about this book. I just couldn't read it fast enough. I had to know what happened. This book will bring out all the emotions--sadness, anger, hurt, and maybe a little happiness at the end. This is a book to keep and read again!"},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"I really enjoy the writing style of Barbara Delinsky. Barbara combines a twist of romance with suspense. She keeps the pages turning. This was the first book I read of her work and I continued to buy other books and read them. Good book - you can't go wrong reading anything of Barabara's work. Start with this one though...you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"This is the first novel by Barbara Delinsky that I have read and I must say that I am impressed!This tale of suspense centers around Laura as she finds her perfect world shattered when her husband disappears. After many years of a marriage that she thought was blissful, she begins to question her life and those around her. For instance, did her husband, Jeff, meet with foul play or could he possibly have orchestrated his own disappearance? Are her friends really loyal? Is Laura, herself, as capable as she once thought?As the story progresses, the web of intrigue begins to unravel, starting with the whereabouts of her husband, what he has been up to (I will leave that a secret for you to find out) and what role his brother, Christian, plays in Laura's life.The story is about illusions and that they are just that-illusions."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"I have been a Barbara Delinsky fan for years but this one held me like no other one has before. The combination of characters and story theme, I think, is fantastic. I definitely hope she writes more that can be this realistic and entertaining. Try it, you'll like it!"},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"This was my first Barbara Delinsky novel and it was pure chance that I came accross it at a libary sale of older books. At the cost of ten cents, I couldn't pass it up. I had also picked up some Ludlum, Grisham, Clancy and Koontz for the same ten cents each. I had expected Delinsky's novel to be fairly light reading.In some ways it was but the subject matter was more realistic than most of my normal reading choices.Laura \\"has it all\\". Good marriage, nice home, great kids (even if one is a 16 year old daughter...if you've had a teenage daughter, you'll appreciate the struggle Laura has with Debra.) She even has a successful business that stems from her love of cooking. So her mother is a real piece of work that drives Laura up a wall most of the time, but all in all...life is good. Until her husband Jeff does not come home after work one evening...What drew me into the book was the \\"it could happen to anyone\\" storyline. Even though it was published in 1991, it is still relevent today. Hard working woman making a good home for the hubby and kids while finding professional success in a bussiness that stems from a natural talent...only to learn that she may not have been the most observant of those around her.Delinsky's description of the emotional and physical effects of Jeff's disaperence are on point. Anyone who has ever experienced the stress of \\"not knowing\\" can truly relate. How Laura manages the crisis as the \\"hits keep on coming\\", is worth the read.As for Jeff...I just feel sorry for him. Yes there is a bit of an open ended finnish to the book but given that it was written early in Delinsky's career, she may have been thinking of a sequel. While we, as the readers, may want to have everything tied up in a neat little bow at the end of a novel, we have to remember that life is not always so neat and tidy.I'm looking forward to reading some of her other works and hope that she hasn't become a \\"formula writer\\" as so many have done. You know the type...really interesting first few books and storylines that lead to contracts and eventually the books become the same...just the names and places change."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"As far as Delinsky's work is concerned, this was spot on! The characters are incredibly complex, likeable, but with human flaws. I'm kind of disappointed that the scumbag didn't get his own in the end, but I suppose he wasn't *really* evil.... I guess. Still disappointing. Not a fairytale ending, but then, Barbara Delinsky rarely writes them that way. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense with a bit of romance thrown in. I know Delinsky is generally pegged as a romance writer, but this is not a \\"romance novel\\" per se. Too much plot and other stuff getting in the way ;) This is a very sad, very nostalgic, and very touching story."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"When black becomes white and up becomes down. Laura's husband Jeff has come up missing and she fears an act of foul play but there just might be more to this. As the story slowly takes flight unraveling at every turn of her life Laura finds herself not knowing who to trust and how to go on.Delinsky gives us a good story with likable characters that find themselves in a difficult situation. Will Laura be able to pull this together, and is there love in her future? Only time will tell. I would give this one 3.5 stars.

The characters were developed so completely that I felt as though each one of them was someone I knew personally. The different turn of evens was exciting and kept me reading. But, I became very tired of the issues and facts of the story being repeated over and over. This great story could have been told in 2/3rd the time that Delinsky took to complete the book. It really did seem to drag on and on. I skimmed much of the book because I knew what was going to be said or done."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"Story line was interesting from start to finish.

Delinski is quickly becoming my favorite author as her books seem as though they could be happening to me. I can hardly put one of her books down once started and will probably ruin my eyesight but can't think of a better way to do it. Her stories could happen to any of us and I am never disappointed with the endings altho some can be terribly sad.....but also true to life. We all need to look for the good things in our own life and those around us, family and friends alike, and this would be a much better world in which to live."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"The whole premise of this Barbara Delinsky novel, is that the reader wants to find out what happens to Laura Frye's husband. The book opens with central character Laura Frye's husband abandoning her, and as the book closes, Laura's husband is still on the run, (he's running from the Authorities on a Tax Fraud charge, but also wanted out of the marriage) but has simply changed his name.I'm not saying this woudn't be a worthwhile read for hardcore Delinsky fans. But it seemed like nothing was tied up at the end. There is no real payoff for making it through this rather longer Delinsky novel. I just don't know how wise it is to construct a long novel around a single problem, drag your readers endlessly and repetitively through that problem, right up till the end, and then not even satisfactorily tie things up in a definite manner. I like a definite and absolute happy ending, like in Barbara Delinsky's 1998 novel \\"Coast Road\\".In all fairness, this was an earlier effort of Delinsky's written in 1991, and it was one of those straight-to-paperback novels written before Delinsky was even writing hardbacks.There are some situations that are hard to believe here, also. For instance, central character, Laura, is not only betrayed by her missing husband, but also by her best friend, Daphne. Delinsky didn't provide enough back-story on, what seemed to me, to be a very together lady-lawyer (Daphne) and how it was that she (Daphne) a smart and educated lawyer, could come to seem so flaky by the end of the novel via her \\"betrayal\\" of central character, Laura.Even Laura's Mother comes across as cold and unfeeling towards her daughter during this tragic time. Does everyone and anyone simply have it in for poor Laura? Well, not everyone. Certainly not Laura's lusty brother-in-law, for whom Laura engages in a steamy affair with. This is a Barbara Delinsky novel, and an early one at that, so you know there are going to be racy sex scenes. Couldn't do without those.Again, I would say this is not one of the better Delinsky novels, those being: \\"Three Wishes\\" \\"Coast Road\\" and \\"Shades of Grace\\"---all which are much better reads than \\"A Woman Betrayed\\"."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"I have read several Barabara Delinsky books that were good--this one was very disappointing. I found the characters to be very annoying. Laura was pathetic and her children were very annoying. When her son is accused of rape he openly admits to sleeping around and no one bats an eye. Then she goes off for 5 days and leaves her daughter with the grandmother (who we all know will be too busy to pay attention to the girl) and comes back to find that her daughter has lost her virginity!!!!I couldn't like or relate to any of these characters--Lake News and An Accidental Woman are much better books."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"Fast pace, good character development.. you will miss the people when the book is over. Just as good as &quot;The Woman Next Door&quot;"},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"So, is Laura Frye a smart woman or a gullible woman? Is she a weak woman or a strong woman? I got so tired of trying to keep up with these questions during this book I almost quit reading. But, I perservered because I had heard this one was &quot;great.&quot; Great it wasn't. Mediocre, with the ends tied up in a neat bow is the most I can say for this story of a woman who can't decide who she wants, what she wants and how much she's going to &quot;take&quot; from the people around her. I was disappointed with Delinsky's story here...find her most recent romantic/suspense novels to be much more satisfying-both with characters and storyline."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"We received the book A Woman Betrayed by Barbara Delinsky on time in great condition.

This story is mainly about three adults Jeff,Laura and Jeff's brother Christian. The adults take no responsibility for their actions as they are self-centered. They are this way because of their parents. We get to meet them too. Especially Laura's mother who is so self centered she cannot love. Laura is just like her mother self centered and married to a passive man. Laura at least has some compassion. As the bible says \\"The sins of the parents will be passed down to the Children\\". Really meaning your behavior will effect your children. If I had read this book back in 1991 I would have been steemed at Jeff and my sympathy would be with Laura. I am twenty years older and wiser. My sympathies are with Jeff and Laura's children. The story comes down to this. Laura married Jeff for the wrong reasons and vs versa. She convinced herself she loved him. But she didn't. As her children keep correcting her about what their father Jeff liked or disliked. Laura was blind. After 20 years of a living without real love Jeff has a breakdown and ruins his children's lives. Laura wants us to feel sorry for her because Jeff betrays her but I can't. Jeff got tired of trying to please Laura. He knew she really did not love him not the way she should. Jeff gives up and screws Laura good. At the same time he forgets about two people who love him unconditional his flesh and blood. You want to reach out and shake this man. His brother Christian of course gets the prize. Jeff hands him his most prize gift his children. What a dope. He hands Laura to him as well. You might like this book due to all the media blitz lately about stupid men like John Edwards and his political cronies that don't think their self-centered behavior will affect their children. The Woman betrayed is Jeff's daughter who loved him. Really loved him. She was worth fighting for. Laura is not betrayed. Elizabeth Edwards is a betrayed women. She loved her husband."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"Delinsky's trademark has always been smart and sensitive handling of family dynamics and she doesn't disappoint here.The Daphne character is endearing."},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"I couldn't find anything good about this book. The plot (such as it was) didn't make sense. What was going to happen was apparent 10 chapters before it actually did. The dialog was stilted and unbelievable. The characters were two-dimensional and predictable.It's just too bad that Laura couldn't have been revealed to be the sneaky tax cheat on the last page!!!"},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author and was not very impressed. I am sure her others are better or maybe I missed something here, whatever the happenings, it lacked sizzle and suspense. Being a suspense/romance it made for a somewhat dull read. The female lead of Laura Frye was a little too whiny and I felt as though she thought people 'owed' her. The missing husband Jeff was weak and we never got to know him very well. I thought she brought in the long lost 'wild' brother Christian a little too late to be interesting.~A seemingly perfect 20 year marriage falls apart when Laura's devoted husband Jeff mysteriously disapears without a trace. He has left behind two kids and alot of questions. As the days go by Laura finds her 'perfect' life was not perfect by any means. What had Jeff been doing all those years behind her back? Was he really missing? Or did he take off? The pieces begin to come together as information arises from his dirty dealings and Laura's life slowly erodes. She is left with a shocking image of her 'true' husband's persona.Looking for a way to cope and get her life back, she turns to Jeff's elusive brother Christian Frye. A wild and free spirit. He shows her love and life again. What she thought she had lost so many years ago, she finds once again, but will the past secrets come to tear them apart? Are her friends, truly her friends? Should she be looking more closely?What started out as a promising mystery, turned out to be a dull look into a jilted woman's life falling apart and her immediate yearning for her husband's brother. It would've been much better had Jeff been in the story longer and there was less of Laura's whining and self-pity. In short, I expected more. It started out great and sort of fizzled as it went on. In my opinion, the side romance between her best friend and the cop was much more interesting.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"A Woman Betrayed","review":"The story line was very good except the book was very repeative and draged on and on telling the same thing over and over. I liked the characters and the plot but not reading the same thing over and over."},{"Title":"History of Indian music","review":"This book contains a collection of widely diverse articles having to do with various aspects of the history of South Indian music. It does not provide a coherent story of Indian music- -for that, you will need to look elsewhere. Instead, the author takes up numerous topics related to South Indian music history in turn, and relates a few facts, observations, or anecdotes about each one. Highlights include an enumeration of uses of types of South Indian classical music, anecdotes about famous musical contests and famous musicians, and a history of the various instruments termed vinas.The writing style is extremely Indian in nature, with an enormous emphasis on classification and enumeration. The author uses Indian musical terminology extensively without much explication. While most of the terminology and names are written in Latin script (with occasional spelling variations), the book also contains a light sprinkling of words and phrases in Sanskrit and Tamil scripts. I believe this book may be used as a textbook in music colleges in South India, where students may be required to memorize its main points and details, hence the extensive enumeration as a memorization aid. For Western readers, the book would be quite difficult to understand without the aid of an Indian teacher who can explain the terminology. Nevertheless, a determined outsider may be able to glean some useful information from it."},{"Title":"God @ Work: Developing Ministers in the Marketplace, Vol. 2","review":"God@Work is helpful in debunking the view that the only ones \\"chosen\\" for God's word are preachers in a church setting. Marshall shares how our work (and how we carry it out) can be a source of blessing/ministry to people, can touch and help hurt people, can help finance the advance of the Kingdom, how the Holy Spirit can release us for ministry right where we are, and even experience the miraculous everyday. Vol.1,God@Work, focused on the validity of ministry outside the church, proposing that both \\"priestly\\" and \\"kingly\\" ministers were needed. Vol.2 here looks a little more towards application, helping those working in the marketplace to become effective in ministry there.There are a number of excellent points made and his overall premise is strong, but overall I ended up more uncomfortable rather than encouraged or enlightened by the book. There seems to be too strong an emphasis on spiritual gifts of signs and wonders, words of knowledge, and an expectation that God's blessing in ministry is necessarily related to the success of the business. For example, Chapter One starts out with a story of Rich praying away a hurricane during one his seminars in Barbados, and in Chapter Two (pg 28) he describes God's promise to bless our business (as he \\"wants you to succeed\\") if we follow three steps: act in faith and give generously, pray, and \\"tap into God's wealth producing system\\" and ask for His blessing on your job. Other chapters include \\"Signs and Wonders\\", \\"Authority\\", \\"Wealth Transfer\\", \\"Hearing the Voice of God\\", \\"Reaching Nations\\", and \\"Developing Marketplace Ministers.\\"I believe Rich is passionately committed to marketplace ministry and seeing the Kingdom of God flourish through his followers living out their faith in the workplace, and there are many solid insights in the book. I'm also thrilled that this book has been transformational for many readers, but if you're considering this book be aware of the stress here on dominion and wealth, and consider other books for a more balanced treatment of marketplace ministry."},{"Title":"God @ Work: Developing Ministers in the Marketplace, Vol. 2","review":"This book is life changing!

Daniell has a journalistic and non-fiction background and it shows. You can write literature that way--look at Hemingway--but the style simply does not do well with fantasy novels.Daniell shows some familiarity with the world of Krynn in the book but there are holes in the continuity--which Weis cleared up in \\"The Soulforge\\" by basically ignoring the entire Meetings Sextet out of existence. There are some charming moments here but Kitiara is not the most solid of leads (even Weis and Hickman struggled with her in the spotlight in \\"Dragons of Highlord Skies\\"). It may tell you something that Raistlin--even as a 4 year old--steals the spotlight from Kitiara. She simply is not a compelling lead.If there was a solid plot, it would make up for the lack of a compelling lead. But the story is weak and the book rambles on with little direction. Daniell takes us way too much in the head of Kitiara and lets her thoughts dictate the story. It's annoying.While not the total failure that some of the other Dragonlance books are, \\"Dark Heart\\" does nothing to add to the saga. While a weak book, it is not offensively bad and there are much worse books in the series. Be warned.

As she grows up she wanders around after the ghost of her father, a Solamnic Knight, and ends up joining a band of thieves.

Also, her travels are very interesting and she meets some unique characters. It's so hard to believe that this is Tina Daniell's first book! Wow! A must read! Now! This book will fill you with anticipation with what will happen next. I wish all Dragonlance books could be this great! I had to finish it in one day! Fantistic character development and you see Kit develop over the years into a warrior, along with her brothers in their own right. I don't think I can find anything wrong with this book except that it ended.

I have never really been a Kitiara fan from the start. When I read the chronicles I never really liked reading about here, but I am on a mission to read all of the dragonlance books. I have to say that every book I read about Kitiara, whether it is \\"steel and stone\\", or this book...my opinion of Kitiara drops very low. I know she is an \\"evil\\" person, but her character is a disgrace to all women, and she makes me sick when I read about her. Don't get me wrong, the book is written well, and does have its points, but Kitiara is a sickening character, and whenever I read about her I want to close the book."},{"Title":"Dark Heart (Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet, Vol. 3)","review":"Dark Heart was a excellent written book. Though for me i started reading the Chronicals and Soulforge before i read this. Tina I believe did a good job at showing how Kit became ruthless and bold but did not get her brothers right at all. Raistlin was too exceptionally smart and Caramon seemed a little out of place. Between Soulforge snd Dark Heart the contradictions were very high and noticable such as how Raistlin got into mage school and Gilion's and Roseamum's death. Over all the contradictions Dark Heart was a very good book. Sometimes a little boring but when the excitment started it got real good. It was definetly 100% better then Kindred Spirits. Out of that its a real good book and not a waste of money!"},{"Title":"The Ingoldsby Legends or Mirth and Marvels.","review":"If I were exiled to the moon and could only take one book, (no compendiums allowed) that would be The Ingoldsby Legends, Myths and Marvels, by Richard Harris Barham. I cannot praise this book enough. It is mainly poetry, with a few prose stories. I could spend many hours praising this book, and although I realize it would not suit many tastes it fits mine to a \\"T\\". Let me only say I have spent more hours reading and rereading this book than I can count. I never tire of it. This is the only book I have ever encountered that I could never reread enough. Every time I find some hidden jem it it I missed before. I have memorized huge passages of it for the times I can't actually have it at hand.

In one of the chapters I believe it's chapter # 8 Mr. Dombroski talks about the conscious &amp; subconscious mind. We as Americans are so worried about proper adequate that we fail to be creative. We are subconsciously so worried about how are opinions look that we fail to be creative. Thomas W. Drombroski has written a book that literally everybody should read. This book shows the reader that they're really is no boundaries as far as being creative. Who says you can't color outside the lines? I have every intention of going back to what I've should have been doing and being creative and not worrying about how my ideas look to other people. The book is set up like a college text with excercises and examples. The book is worth the little price Amazon wants for it. The Author Mr. Thomas W.

The topic strikes a cultural chord, appealing to our myth of rugged individualism. We are all resilient - up to a point. For every child that develops severe problems due to a traumatic experience, many more do not.But there is an illusory quality to the seeming variations among individuals in their capacity to conquer adversity. If we look deeply enough, we find that certain types of chronic adversity in early childhood are virtually insurmountable. No one overcomes them.Luthar's edited volume goes a long way toward explaining what types of adversities predict this catastrophic failure, and why. With chapters from leading scholars, it explores factors that predict good or bad outcomes among children exposed to child abuse, divorce, poverty, parental mental illness, community violence, discrimination, parental alcoholism and drug abuse, and an accumulation of multiple risks. The book also explains biological and genetic influences on childhood outcome, and provides suggestions for how we can promote resilience through early childhood interventions.This is an excellent overview of a complex topic. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"DragonMech Shardsfall Quest (Sword & Sorcery)","review":"I recently bought The Shardsfall Quest, and immediately sat down to read it. I had already had a good experience from the DragonMech book, and I expected great things from this author. I was not disappointed.I found the adventure to be interesting, if sometimes somewhat too simple or too complex. Sometimes, I could see player characters spending hours and hours solving a puzzle (simple if you know the answer), or circumventing a complex series of discoveries by simply casting one or two spells. But for the most part, it seemed like a very smooth-running adventure. My assumptions were confirmed when I ran it with a group of PCs.The New Rules section was well-written and well-organized. One thing I approve of about these books is that they do not glut the game with huge numbers of new feats. This book was no exception, having very few feats, but each one quite innovative. The new magic item was very interesting, if a bit slanted towards helping spellcasters. Two new mechs, three new monsters, and one new template round it out nicely.Coming back to the adventure itself, I found the path was not quite as set as some other published adventures. It had multiple ways to solve each situation, including alternate plans for if the PCs did something not immediately obvious. There are four episodes, each building off the last. The last episode ends with a bang, inviting the campaign to continue beyond what's written on the page. The individual pieces inside each episode really do set up plots for further exploration, both in roleplaying opportunities and in combat situations.All in all, money very well spent. I would recommend both this book and the original DragonMech book to anyone interested in a more mechanized Dungeons & Dragons setting."},{"Title":"Guerrilla Metaphysics: Phenomenology and the Carpentry of Things","review":"It is easy to mistake Graham Harman with an unorthodox Heideggerian, but in this work he develops a philosophy which is, at its core, genuinely independent of Heidegger. Guerilla Metaphysics begins with the objection that both analytical and continental traditions are not interested in objects, but in human access to them. Harman proposes a philosophy which does not aim to reconcile the analytical with the continental, but instead is determined to free metaphysics from its anthropocentric residues and reclaim it on behalf of a direct contact with all nonhuman entities. This is the main objective of Harman's object-oriented philosophy which is comprehensively laid out and pursued step by step. As a \\"carnal phenomenologist\\" and a \\"guerilla carpenter\\" Harman writes a book that resembles a novel imagined by Alain Robbe-Grillet, but written by William James. Following his renowned teacher Alphonso Lingis, Harman develops a cheerful style which is preoccupied with all sorts of earthly objects such as pollens, bicycles, chess boards, pebbles, puppies, and beads in the most alluring way. For people who imagine that fresh thoughts in philosophy are not possible any more, Guerilla Metaphysics is a lively refutation."},{"Title":"Guerrilla Metaphysics: Phenomenology and the Carpentry of Things","review":"I've read this book twice. At first I was quite excited by the ideas and the approach Harman was taking. Now I'm less so. Anyone who is really excited about metaphysics and speculative philosophy should read this. Harman is WILDLY speculative, however.What I do not like:Ultimately, one gets the feeling that this book is a bit worthless and something akin to fiction rather than genuinely \\"philosophical\\" material. Harman combines Bergson, Whitehead, Heidegger, Aristotle, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Ortega y Gasset, Levinas, Lingis, Latour, and others without *really* taking advantage of what these authors exploited in order to make their philosophies great, such as: concrete phenomenology, cosmology, psychology, or natural science.The whole thing is a bit....contrived. Harman often makes these grand claims about beginning a new wave of ultra-spectulative ultra-realist metaphysics (semi-reminiscent of a more entertianing and more easily readible version of Husserl's repetitive proclaiming: \\"back to the things themselves!\\" in his middle-period when writing IDEAS, always returning to beginnings and the working out of methods) without ever *really* beginning. That is, without ever *really* engaging objects, Harman constantly discusses how one *might* engage them in the future via his metaphysical notions (i.e., vicarious causation, fission/fusion, etc.). Perhaps this work should be viewed as preliminary. Still, if you don't mind this caveat, his work is rewarding.What still makes Harman's work worthwhile:-Has a kind of rigorous logic to it, similar to the style of Plotinus. You're 'lured' in by seemingly commonsensicle propositions which lead one to wild conclusions. This leaves you scratching your chin a bit, wondering how you were lead down such a path, and where the imperceptible twist occured where things went from everyday to strange so quickly.-Wonderful writing style, excellent descriptions. Its like \\"eye candy\\" for the reader's imagination at times.-It is an interesting synthesis of different ideas.-Harman is clear because he reviews and repeats his ideas over and over again. This makes it impossible for the reader to be unsure about what has been said thus far at any stage in the development of his argument. But, simultanously, this can make the book a bit monotonous at times.-A kind of originality. While it seems to me that Harman's principles for how objects act upon other objects are largely based upon linguistic devices (i.e., metaphor, metonymy, etc.) and his iffy interpretation of Heidegger's fourfold, the way Harman presents these ideas has an originality, which, if it proves useful for ACTUAL metaphysical explanations of the universe of objects, would be, at a minimum, highly original and thought provoking.Well, thats about all I can think of for now."},{"Title":"Guerrilla Metaphysics: Phenomenology and the Carpentry of Things","review":"Since most philosophical writing of high caliber usually comes in the obtuse-to-American-ears stylings of continental French and German academia, Graham Harman's book makes for a brilliant gem of thought to American readers interested in high caliber philosophy. Along the lines of Alphonso Lingis, this book flies the flag of a refreshing and inventive turn away from the long obsession with liguistic subjectivity in philosophy departments, demonstrating a movement toward phenomenological reacquaintence with things themselves. This is exciting, intense, relevant philosophy."},{"Title":"The Chase Is On (Desire)","review":"Book was a wonderful read. I read this book in two days because I had to go to work.

But on dark and stormy afternoon Frank and Joe Hardy were caught outside Barmet Bay when the engine of the Sleuth died. The violence of the ocean prevented making any attempt at repairs. The boys spot a yacht, but are unable to make contact with it. Soon the boys hear a helicopter, and then a siren. The boys are able to glimpse the yacht and the helicopter for brief moments, but are unable to gain the attention of either. As the helicopter passes overhead a wallet full of money drops into the water next to the Sleuth, and the boys are plunged into another mystery.Soon thereafter the Hardy boys' best friend Chet Morton has a truck with a shipment of high power rifles and camping equipment stolen while he is eating at a roadside restaurant; leaving the keys in the truck may have had something to do with the theft. The trail leads to the North Woods, where wild dogs have been reported to roam.The mystery grows when Frank Hardy is kidnapped. Frank and Joe have stumbled into some kind of mystery, but they are unable to understand the nature of the mystery. Frank escapes by himself and halts payment of ransom just in time.Soon, Fenton Hardy reveals that he is involved in investigating the theft of United States currency in Central and South America. Later, we learn that the money is being used to fund terrorists and to purchase arms for them.All trails seem to lead to the North Woods, where Frank and Joe Hardy and their friends encounter a man raising wolves, including Saber, a killer wolf. The stakes are high as the brothers and their friends face death numerous times.There are a couple of problems with this story that I found distracting. First, healthy wolves do not attack and kill people. In spite of numerous studies that confirm this observation, people persist in portraying wolves as people killers. Second, the criminals' preoccupation with $2,000 seems bizarre. The criminals have a yacht, a helicopter, and numerous henchmen. It seems strange that any criminal organization would be overly concerned with a mere $2,000.Other than these two annoyances, this adventure is exciting and interesting. The teaser promised that this book would be one of the Hardy boys' most exciting adventures, and it appears that the book has fulfilled that promise.The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14. However, this book in the series contains many interesting moments and will keep most readers guessing the answers to the mysteries until the author reveals the final solution."},{"Title":"The Wailing Siren Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 30)","review":"Originally published in 1951, the biggest flaw with this volume was the absolutely horrible cover art drawn by Bill Gillies in 1951. Nappi's 1968 revision was a vast improvement on the original cover and fishing trawler of a Sleuth portrayed on the front cover. The book itself opens with a bang as the Hardys find a wallet full of money while out in Barmet Bay during a storm. Personally I now think the Sleuth has a voodoo doll that has been hanging beneath somebody's shower head as everytime it seems they take out that boat it rains!! This is a well written suspenseful adventure that takes place for the most part in the \\"North Woods\\" near Bayport. Very delightful reading throughout the entire book until perhaps the final chapter which tended to lack creativity. I was somewhat let down with Chapter 25. But the first 24 were excellent.

This book has one of the best opening chapters of any in the series and it gets you into the mystery very quickly. The pages from about 60-130 when the Hardys and their friends go camping in the North Woods are the best, but the whole book is really good.

Valmouth is his finest work.Firbank blazed the path away from Naturalism. He did with prose what contemporary artists were doing with paint: fixing an impression of life rather than making a copy of it. He knows his work is fantasy so he can write beautiful and witty prose about subjects polite people pretend don't exist such as religious mania, bigotry and sex in all its flavors. Although the overall impression of his style is baroque, flowery and often oblique, the writing is really swift and tight. Like Hemingway or Truman Capote, there's not one word, one syllable more than absolutely necessary.He writes marvelous dialogue. His innovation, I think, is how he captures the silences. A lot of what we understand from conversation comes from what remains unspoken--the pauses, the deflections, the silences. Firbank does the silences. The little sighs, the defensive change of subject, the little joke that hides a deep wound.All his strengths are presented in abundance in Valmouth. Valmouth is an English seaside resort where the salubrious air promotes extraordinary longevity. Its most industrious citizen is Madame Yaj&ntilde;avalkya, (whom we would identify as South Asian, but everyone calls nig--r) a chiropodist, masseuse, beautician, quack and perhaps procuress. She serves a delightful assortment of fussy dowagers from all levels of the social strata who are obsessed with death, romance, marriage and a particularly exquisite brand of Catholicism.Valmouth is a short read although not always an easy one. But becoming acquainted with this place where a footman may offer you \\"an ingenuity of tartlettes\\" is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Derivatives : The Theory and Practice of Financial Engineering (Wiley Frontiers in Finance Series)","review":"Paul Wilmott's book has an impressive but lopsided coverage. Paul is clearly an expert in numerical solutions of Partial Differential Equations (with a leaning towards non-linear ones, I would guess) and this topic does find useful applications in derivatives valuation. His expositions of techniques and concepts in this area is lucid and helpful. Unfortunately the 'martingale revolution' seems to have by-passed him altogher. Not only he avoids probabilistic techniques and jargon in his treatment (this could be an intelligent choice), but he gives far too scant treatment to very important related concepts - such as the change of numeraire - which have very powerful practical applications and are coneptually very far reaching. Similalry, the treatment of interest rate models is far too centered on the 'traditional' approaches, to the detriment of a serious analysis of such approaches as the BGM (in this context, I found his dismissive commnents about his colleagues in poor taste). The book would have been very good in the early 90s. Finance has moved on too much, though, for such as weeping title as 'Derivatives' to be warranted today."},{"Title":"Derivatives : The Theory and Practice of Financial Engineering (Wiley Frontiers in Finance Series)","review":"Wilmott's Derivatives is an accessible introduction to the partial differential equation (PDE) approach to mathematical finance.The basis of mathematical finance is the observation by Black and Scholes that when pricing a derivative contract, for example a stock option, the randomness of the value of the underlying stock can be used to balance the randomness in value of the option in such a manner as to eliminate all randomness. A trader can thus by continually rebalancing his positions guarantee the price of an option. This price is the solution to the famous Black-Scholes equation. Thus the pricing of derivatives becomes a suprisingly rigourous branch of mathematics.The Black-Scholes equation itself is not a particularly difficult equation -- indeed a few simple changes of variables transform it into the one-dimensional heat equation and a closed-form solution for the price of an option can be written down. The proof that it holds and the implications of the proof are however not so trivial and the book does well at explaining these.Mathematical finance does not end with the Black-Scholes equation for two reasons. The first is that more and more complicated derivatives products are continually being innovated which require new mathematics to be invented. The second is that the equation is based on certain assumptions which while providing a reasonable first approximation are not perfect; the research of new more accurate models is therefore active and ongoing.The author starts with the definitions of the basic financial instruments and gradually builds up to the Black-Scholes equation. He does so in a clear and detailed manner. He then goes on to discuss various generalizations to exotic options and more complicated models of stock price movements.The principal defect of the book is that mathematical finance is not a branch of PDE theory or applied mathematics but rather a branch of probability theory. The probabilistic aspects of the subject are skimped on with only a brief coverage of binomial trees, and the concept of an equivalent martingale measure which is the fundamental concept of mathematical finance not discussed. Interest-rate options and many exotic stock options are more easily priced both practically and conceptually from a probabilitistic point of view and the PDE approach to them can become contrived.To summarize, this book is worth buying but the reader should treat its contents with a pinch of salt and concentrate on the first two hundred pages. It should be read in parallel with another book, such as Baxter and Rennie, which concentrates on the probabilistic approach to the subject."},{"Title":"Derivatives : The Theory and Practice of Financial Engineering (Wiley Frontiers in Finance Series)","review":"I spent a fortune out of my meager salaries, buying derivatives and financial engineering books for the past 5 years.

In terms of usefulness, I would compare it to Tuckman's Fixed Income Securities."},{"Title":"Derivatives : The Theory and Practice of Financial Engineering (Wiley Frontiers in Finance Series)","review":"Financial engineering as a profession has exploded in the last 15 years, and has enlisted the minds of mathematicians, physicists, economists, engineers, as well as course everyday brokers and traders. This book is geared towards a mathematical audience, as one will need a background in the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations and an understanding of stochastic processes (at the level of the Ito calculus). The author does devote a chapter to partial differential equations for readers who need it. Those readers with such a background will find the book very straightforward to read, especially those readers who are mathematicians or physicists, and are desiring to enter into the exciting field of financial engineering. The book is out of print, and an updated collection of books has been written by the author, but this one could still serve as an excellent introduction to the subject. In addition, this book has exercises, while the updated ones do not. Most of the results in the book can be used to develop practical trading strategies, and so the book qualifies more than being a mere academic exercise.The author's approach is not always rigorous from a mathematical standpoint, but this is fine since the emphasis is on developing insight into the principles behind the subject, such as the principle of arbitrage, the idea of hedging, etc. Early on, the author shows what is involved in removing oneself from the Black-Scholes world, with clear explanations of jump conditions, time-dependent volatility, and path dependency. The discussion on the valuation of American style options using partial is illuminating considering this is typically done with Monte Carlo simulations. Another interesting part of the book is the derivation of the partial differential equation for the market price of volatility risk. In addition, the author gives an overview of how to speculate with options, a topic that is truly removed from the Black-Scholes world, but of course is taken up with enthusiasm by many traders the world over. This discussion is very interesting, in that it sheds light on just how subjective preferences enter into options trading; but it also shows that such preferences can be treated quantitatively. Assuming the asset price follows a random walk, the author derives an equation for the present value of the expected payoff, an equation that differs from the Black-Scholes equation in having the drift rate rather than the interest rate in the delta term. This risk-neutral valuation is dealt with in more detail in the author's discussion on portfolio management.The author uses spreadsheets and Visual Basic to perform some of the numerical calculations, with many included on the accompanying CD. This is done no doubt to maintain the connection with practical trading. All of the mathematics and numerical studies could be done more efficiently though with a high-level programming language, such as Mathematica or Maple. The graphical capabilities of these languages will allow the reader to view the results of the calculations on-the-fly.Some omissions in the book include discussions on energy and weather derivatives, but these are covered, although in not too much detail, in the author's more recent books. Also omitted is any discussion on bandwidth markets or derivatives trading in network capacity. This is also a new area, but one that is growing rapidly. Discussion of it will no doubt be included in future books on derivatives."},{"Title":"Derivatives : The Theory and Practice of Financial Engineering (Wiley Frontiers in Finance Series)","review":"Everything is good in this book.

There is definitely some ego here but it does not interfere with the author's sincere attempt to present the material in such a way that it can be understood easily by anyone with the required math background. That of course is the problem for some: this book requires a fairly extensive math background to be really understood. Fakers may try, but the successful will have a pretty good background in mathematics. That said, the discussion of stochastic calculus is better than many have led the casual onlooker to believe. It is not rigorous but is perfectly sufficient for the subject matter at hand. A good understanding of the material in this book will make the reader truly dangerous in the realms of the PDE theory of derivatives."},{"Title":"Derivatives : The Theory and Practice of Financial Engineering (Wiley Frontiers in Finance Series)","review":"Everything is good in this book.

Perhaps what's preventing it from 5 stars is the nature of the task rather than the author's capability.The book is so comprehensive such that it's going to be very difficult if not impossible to find the book with greater coverage on the subject. The level of discussion should be on the intermediate level or first-year graduate students. A good background on basic derivatives or mathematics ( algebra, differential calculus, and statistics) will proof sufficient in most of the cases to follow the mathematical detivations in the book. Working out the exercises at the end of each section will be a great pleasure to all the derivative students. Unlike many other text books which provided many difficult but interesting exercises but never the solutions elsewhere as if it's the author's intention to keep the secret with themselves forever, the Book's Instructor Manual with the solutions to all the exercises is separately available through the Publisher. However, I feel that the unexperienced readers should spend some time with a more directly accessible derivatives book such as Hull's classic ( Options, Futures, and Derivatives Securities ) before approaching this book. Once this is done, you'll realize that the Author knows the subjects very well and has his interesting ways to take you to a very heart of the concepts.I think there are 2 limitations of this book that should be put forward. Some mathemetical concept on modern derivative pricing theory such as martingale or measure theory are only scantly touched throughout the book. Yet I have a good perception that it;s the Author's intention to follow his preferred PDE approach on derivatives pricing and to make a book more directly accessible to a practitioners i.e., derivative traders or researchers, rather than the full academic researchers. Also the treatments on interest rate through sufficiently comprehensive, is far from completion. However, the literature on interest rate derivatives is very farflung such that it should be treated in a place of it's own. I myself don't really look at this as a handicap on this book.All in all, I can't find any good reason why this book shouldn't be on derivatives section shelf."},{"Title":"Derivatives : The Theory and Practice of Financial Engineering (Wiley Frontiers in Finance Series)","review":"Paul Wilmott's passion for derivatives / quantitative finance is fantastic. It's a great pleasure to read his book. Not only does he cover a vast range of topics (50 chapters), but he also presents it with loads of examples. Paul's addition of Excel Visual Basic formulas plus the wide range of references make it the book on financial engineering. It's very rare to find people who can explain such a technical topic in such a individualistic style (reminds me of Richard Feynmann who explained quantum theory without maths).It's still very technical though, be reminded that Paul is a mathematician, so readers who are looking for a non math book on derivatives are well advised to look for another book (e.g. Kolb)."},{"Title":"Derivatives : The Theory and Practice of Financial Engineering (Wiley Frontiers in Finance Series)","review":"Clear and with humor.

Is it a BDSM-manual? Is it some kind of feminist manifesto about women's right to live out their sexual fantasies? Is it a diary, combined with relationship-stories, written by the two authors strictly for their own personal satisfaction? Or is it simply a combination of all of the above?Well, probably the last alternative. Probably. Because I'm not that sure, despite the fact that it's only been five minutes since I (finally) finished the piece. I add \\"finally\\", because it wasn't the greatest book I've ever read. Especially since it felt like such a lengthy book; page after page was turned without anything really happening, but no. The only thing one can do is keeping one's fingers crossed that the authors will get to their point, whatever that is, but the wait is long and extremely frustrating. And frustration is never a good thing.Many different parts of the BDSM-scene are investigated, for instance various bondage-scenarios and various domination/submission sessions, many of which Easton and Hardy themselves have experienced together with their numerous male and female lovers. Time and again they emphasize the phenomenon, or state of mind, known as ecstasy (not the drug), and try their very best to explain to the reader how to experience it. But the question remains: what's the difference between ecstasy and an orgasm? Well, you tell me. The book sure doesn't do it, and whenever it's mentioned it's mostly written for a female audience. This doesn't mean that the role of the men is trivialized or overlooked. However, though, it's definitely a book written by women and mostly aimed towards other women.Still, the book has its good sections, too. Especially the part where they discuss how a ritualistic setting can enable people to act out and deal with their inner pain. But overall, Radical Ecstasy comes out as yet another mediocre New Age book found in the self-help section of your local bookstore. With the exception that this one contains detailed sexual scenarios. (Not extremely detailed, though. It's not an XXX-rated book).Finishing the book I couldn't help but feeling that perhaps the authors wrote it due to their exhibitionistic natures, and not because they wanted to help people. I'm probably wrong, but that was nonetheless the feeling I got."},{"Title":"Radical Ecstasy","review":"I love Dossie and Janet! Radical Ecstasy is a great intro for building a spiritual side to your sexual practices. To be honest, it bothers me how there's so much out there in society about basic lust and pleasure without the added component of seeing it all as a way to transcend the physical and turn it into something far greater than the sum of its parts by adding the spiritual aspect to it. This is a great description of doing just that and I'm happy more people are putting books out there, especially in the kink community."},{"Title":"Radical Ecstasy","review":"This book is a brilliant book for the leather loving enthusiast.

If, on the other hand, you want to know why on Earth would anybody want to do this in the first place, you've hit the jackpot in \\"Radical Ecstasy.\\"If you think BDSM is all about cruelty, Dossie and Janet will convince you otherwise. They are incredibly articulate about psychological processes that are nearly impossible to describe. Come along with players on their journeys to the darkest, scariest parts of their minds and watch them emerge cleansed, whole, free, and (most importantly of all) LOVED by their play partners. Their role-plays may well be more effective than hypnosis or years of therapy on a shrink's couch. The authors feel their words do not do the experiences justice, but truly they are too modest.I had the good fortune to meet Dossie and Janet at a Polyamory convention, having already read their classic \\"The Ethical Slut\\" which is far-and-away the best and most practical book about the dynamics of Polyamory. They are cool ladies who would be mistaken for ordinary vanilla if you didn't know otherwise. \\"Radical Ecstasy\\" is every bit as revelatory as \\"The Ethical Slut,\\" opening up a whole new world for me.At one point in reading it, I collapsed in cathartic laughter that made tears stream down my face, when I suddenly realized that I had always been fascinated with bondage games, even as early as age 8. My obsession with \\"Perils of Pauline\\" scenes became a source of enormous ridicule from my schoolmates, so embarrasing I never dared breathe a word of it to anyone for more than 30 years. At long last, Dossie and Janet proved that there was nothing wrong with me after all! I was merely trying to act out a logical resolution to the school-bully problem. My first-ever night at a BDSM club saw me tied to a St. Andrew's Cross while wearing the most demure, innocent, Victorian-vintage lace dress imaginable. Eventually, I might finally get to act out a resistance/takedown/rescue scene where I get chased all over the dungeon . . .THANK YOU, Dossie and Janet, for sharing your amazing love with the world."},{"Title":"Radical Ecstasy","review":"This book takes a look at \\"altered states,\\" BDSM and sacred sex practices and the route that the authors take to get to these \\"altered states.\\" It is in some ways a journey the two authors made while writing this book to get to the core answer of \\"what truly is radical ecstasy.\\" And yet the impression I get from reading this book is that what it truly is differs for everyone. Having been exploring alternate forms of spirituality over the past two or three years, quite a bit of what the authors speak of hit home for me. The book also has a number of vignettes of scenes the authors did with one another, their reactions and feelings during and after the scenes, as well as their use of breathing and visualization to reach \\"spiritual highs.\\"At times you may find the authors delving into areas that seem a bit hard to follow, but there will also be times reading about areas where you nod your head in acknowledgment.

I am particularly delighted when a book initially shocks me, provokes me, frightens me, or turns me on.I experienced all these reactions when I first read one of my all-time favorite books, Radical Ecstasy. Radical Ecstasy is a sexual/spiritual memoir by Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy. Dossie and Janet have been friends, play partners, collaborators, lovers and confidantes for nearly 20 years. To write this book, Dossie and Janet sought out ecstatic experiences--together and individually--for two years. Along the way, they wrote about what they felt and discovered on each of their journeys. Here's the twist: the ecstatic experiences Dossie and Janet wrote about are the transcendent states they reached through the practice of conscious--I would call it Tantric--sadomasochsim.In Radical Ecstasy Dossie and Janet write about all manner and sorts of S/M play, from dark psychological role-play to intense and prolonged ecstatic physical pain, all with an eye to the divine moments when all the shadows and sensations dissolve into blissful, love-filled unions with their inner selves, each other and the universe at large.There are countless ancient and modern accounts of extreme physical and emotional embodied spiritual practices intended to produce transcendent states and spiritual awakenings. What makes Radical Ecstasy so compelling is that it is a story--not a history, a how-to book, or a study--of two contemporary, brave women who wrote down their agonies and their ecstasies as they lived them.Stories of extraordinary experiences such as those Dossie and Janet describe, invite us to challenge our limitations and our judgments about sex and spirituality. They stretch our boundaries and encourage us to make new connections between peoples, practices and ideas. They entice us to believe in something that exists outside our present understanding. Radical Ecstasy shows us how conscious S/M can be as effective a path to love, connection and awakening as any more traditional spiritual practice.In the Tantra I practice, all experiences on the physical plane are potential avenues for spiritual awakening, for transformation, and for connection to All That Is. The key to transforming any ordinary aspect of life into an extraordinary experience is mindfulness. How conscious are we able to be in each and every present moment? Dossie and Janet not only show us example after example of mindfulness, they also explain how they achieve it so that we can practice it, too.The pursuit of transformational, ecstatic experiences has been my lifelong pursuit. As a writer, I can only only attempt to describe my intimate, individual pursuit of ecstasy. Language is woefully inadequate to describe blissful states and no single book can capture the entirety of ecstatic experience. That being said, Radical Ecstasy--with a writing style that more closely resembles art porn than spiritual philosophy--comes oh so deliciously close."},{"Title":"Radical Ecstasy","review":"These two ladies are for me the Lewis and Clark of the naked soul. In biker leathers flogger in hand they seem to go after that spiritual world that shows up sometimes when hot sex meets hot love. As a reader, this is quite a confession for me, a pretty much vanilla non-practicing BDSMer with a seminary studies background in mystical theology. I'm still somewhat surprised that this theme keeps showing up in what I read of late; this Divine Eros, even the Eros Maniakos spoken of by holy men of the monastic desert in the Christian East, men and women going all out for God. I see the same thread in Easton and Hardy except they are not afraid to have some naughty fun along the way. My spiritual side keeps coming back to their head scratching edgy sex, feeling strongly that there's a connection there that is almost religious and most certainly in touch with the Divine.Such is the power of orgasmic bliss these two women explore in Radical Ecstasy. Theirs is a serious and athletic climb mixed in with heart-felt compassion and friendship and an intense desire for more that goes for both pleasure and healing at the same time. If you're like me, knowing for certain somebody dropped you off at this party broken and you'd like to leave whole, maybe this book is for you.Both words in the title hooked me. Ecstasy? Radical? Give me both. And what of that Kundalini snake running up and down the spine of that naked lady on the cover? What's not to like here for the spiritual traveler? For the many neophyte kinkster voyeurs just tuning in around us, those who have ventured as far perhaps as having spanked a lover but once or twice as an experiment, this book will shock and awe perhaps. Yet so many are exploring now various doors into the realm dark eros, braving entrance into the leather world. Maybe this spiritual book is for those with a churchy past? And why not? Like many of us, my experience with dark side sex and kink has been the last ten awful years of a formerly good marriage. And many do come to the party as watchers rather than doers, the intrigue for many may well be the spiritual part as much as the edgy sex. And what could be more fun than coming to the game looking for steamy sex and finding God, too?I've long identifying as a sensual person seeking a soul connection. Shadow work has kept my interest through the years as a bookophile starting back when I encountered Plato in his Republic in college. Indeed, shadow, shadow on the wall, which is the real and which is the illusion? Hardy and Easton explore this question cover to cover.If you liked the extreme honesty and passion of Ethical Slut, you'll see Radical Ecstasy is equally honest. Both of them reference an erotic pursuit that is almost monastic in its severity. I've toured and retreated at many a monastery from California to the Middle East and find it not all that much of a stretch to see an Easton/Hardy connection with the intensity of fasting and asceticism found there. And also, oddly, in BDSM in general, not unlike for me are the severe activities of say, kneeling on a rock for a thousand days as saints have done. And why do spiritual folk do such severe things with their bodies, be they these authors or saints? Because they want at any price to be close, near to their Beloved, be he or she as lover human or Divine. Powerful for me was the devotion, friendship and spiritual pursuit found here in the deep relationship between these two women: it's the main pith of their tale.If tears and sweat and howls and pain and naked skin mixed in with scare-the-crap-out-of-you fear of embracing the Divine makes you queasy, stay far from this book. These are two dangerous ladies. But let's say you've a wound or two that is painful and runs soul deep and you want real bad to reach that wound and find healing. And let's say you've got an open mind to what tools are permissible to add to your toolbox. Then read this book. But you've got to want to go deep. And you've got to be willing to not even care if you look good going there. Risk this book. It will give you some new religion to mix in with your old perhaps. I'd also read their excellent When Somebody You Love Is Kinky. If you've a serious spiritual side, you might just find that the particular someone in your quest is yourself."},{"Title":"Radical Ecstasy","review":"There are other books out there that combine kink and spirituality. All of the ones I have read are graphic and gratuitous. The spiritual aspects seem like just a footnote to the rest of it. It feels like the authors wanted to write porn, then slapped some spirituality on top so they could justify it.This book is different.In this, the authors are exploring the state of mind called \\"ecstasy.\\" They look into the Whats and the Hows and the Whys. The methods they use to achieve it are often kinky, but they make that seem inconsequential. The erotic parts in this book are just that--erotica, not porn. They're tasteful, not tacky. This book is the opposite of the others I've read on the topic. In this, the adult bits are more of a footnote to the rest of the book. The book is solemn and dignified, but also joyful.I would highly recommend this book to people who are seeking ecstatic spiritual experiences, and are open-minded as to how they might achieve them. I would also recommend this book to people who have experienced something spiritual while doing something kinky, and want to find out more about what it was they felt. That's how I stumbled onto it, myself.I would NOT recommend this book to people who are looking for an excuse to work kink into their religion or religion into their kink."},{"Title":"Radical Ecstasy","review":"While our paths haven't crossed for many years I was fortunate to have met Dossie back when I was just beginning my BDSM exploration.

SM is for me a source of laughter, strength, growth and spirituality and I see my role as a sadist to be that of a healer more than anything else.

This book is also a very good text for teaching Radiology Residents. Radiology Residents currently (4/12/03), do not use calculators for their ABR exam therefore they do not need to know most of the calculations that are presented in this text. The chapter on Radiation Detectors is an excellent primer for medical physicists, health physicists and Biomedical engineers. My only criticism of the text is that the QA recommendations are not current and the MRI section does not address image quality enough detail."},{"Title":"Medical Imaging Physics","review":"I had to buy this book for a class. I was very disappointed.This edition has several typos and mistakes on the tables. The examples and problems sections are really irritating, sometimes they show a couple of equations and write 5 problems over the same equation over and over again, and I have found instances where the \\"answers to selected problems\\" section show incorrect information. There is very little physics that you can learn from those problems.It seems that it is hard to find good books on Medical Imaging, but I highly recommend \\"The essential physics of medical imaging\\" (Bushberg. et al.) This is a very good review of the imaging techniques but it is not very quantitative. A more quantitative book I would recommend is \\"Medical Imaging: signals and systems\\" by Jerry L. Price.If you have an option, don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"Medical Imaging Physics","review":"Big changes!!I have a previous edition of this book butThis new edition is really big different from prev. edition.This book is a bible of Radiation community...I love Dr.Hendee's products.."},{"Title":"Medical Imaging Physics","review":"\\"...an excellent introduction to the physics of medical imaging...Medical Imaging Physics is sure to be a favorite of residents, perhaps supplanting Christensen's Introduction to the Physics of Diagnostic Radiology as the classic radiology residency physics text.\\" (American Journal of Roentgenology, Vol. 180, No. 4, April 2003)"},{"Title":"Medical Imaging Physics","review":"\\"...fulfills the authors goal of providing an up-to-date survey of the physics of medical imaging in a format that will appeal to students and educators alike.

When you think of Shakespeare, you automatically think of plays -- \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" etc.But he was also a poet of considerable skill. And while he sprinkled his various plays with poetry and songs, his poems are best appreciated when they're read all by themselves -- particularly the cluster of brilliant \\"Sonnets\\" that he penned. These works just have a unique, hauntingly vivid flavour of their own.Each sonnet has no title, and is simply identified by numbers. And while Shakespeare's love poems are the best known of these works, he addresses different themes in theme -- old age, writer's block loneliness, the cruelty of the world, sex, beauty, a mysterious rival poet, and Shakespeare's own complicated romantic feelings (love that \\"looks upon tempests and is not shaken\\").And these poems are absolutely lovely. Some of these sonnets are pretty well-known (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate\\") but most of them are a little more obscure. They have vivid metaphors and imagery (\\"let not winter's ragged hand deface,\\" \\"gold candles fix'd in heaven's air\\") and hauntingly lovely passages (\\"What is your substance, whereof are you made,/That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\\").And these sonnets really give you new insights into Shakespeare as a person -- he feels uncertainty, passionate love, unhappiness, lust and quirky humor. But while it's obvious these sonnets were deeply personal, they can still be appreciated on their own, particularly as love poetry.William Shakespeare's \\"Sonnets\\" are rich with meaning, language and atmosphere -- the Elizabethan English takes a little deciphering, but it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Sonnets (The Shakespeare collection)","review":"Just received it today (7-12-2010). Sweet little book, would tell others about it, the nice little size allows me to carry it in my purse. This is my first book of Shakespeare, I'm more mature now, and can appreciate these types of fine literature."},{"Title":"Applied Photographic Optics, Third Edition","review":"I have an older (second) edition of this book, and I use it regularily for reference. It is comprehensive and covers everything imaginable about photographic optics. It does skip basics and a reader without deeper prior knowlegde would do good, to read a solid optics book beforehand (the old books by Conrady are to be recommended). Mathematics is not overly complicated, highschool knowledge should be sufficient - but one can learn a lot from this book, even without going into the details of the formulae presented. Sidney Ray is a great teacher with a precise and clear language.If I miss something, it is mainly all the specifics about digital imaging. At least the second edition is very thin on this... But it lays very solid foundations and serves as a venerable reference even in our digital imaging age. Applied Photographic Optics does not cover things like colour and the scope is very focused. So it is really not a substitute for a general optics or colour book (like Hunt's \\"The Reproduction of Colour\\").For many readers the much shorter \\"The Photographic lens\\" by the same author might be a good and much cheaper alternative. But it won't go into detail as much and might leave the reader with the wish to learn more - then Applied Photographic Optics is the logical next step.To my (limited) knowledge, there is no other current book, that could be a sensible alternative to this classic."},{"Title":"Applied Photographic Optics, Third Edition","review":"If you have an amateur interest in photographic optics, there are excellent books for a lot less money. But if you really need the most in-depth information in a wide range of detailed topics and applications, this one is well worth the price. Though for $150 you'd think they'd throw in a hard cover, wouldn't you?"},{"Title":"Office 2000: The Complete Reference","review":"This book does a good job of explaining how to use the most common features of Office-2000.

When Holt writes a gothic romance, she is a master! &quot;The Secret Woman&quot; is among my favorites. It seems heroine Anna Brett is doomed to be a governess for a rich family in England, but she later is led through circumstances to the captain of a ship named &quot;The Secret Woman&quot; and its secrets, many of which are diamond in nature. She also learns about the secret woman within herself while trusting the wrong people and learning the hard way about evil in a friend."},{"Title":"The Secret Woman","review":"I read The Secret Woman my junior year in HS, and would get in trouble in class, becase I couldn't put the book down.

I'm reading it again."},{"Title":"The Secret Woman","review":"I read this when I was about 12 and have never forgotten it. It is my favorite 'historical romance' novel ever. Full of intrigue and myseteries and secrets. The narrator is someone I could relate to and the main male character, Redvers, so charming and warm and yet with a past ... of course. Lots of society both high and humble, exotic locales combined with homely England. So romantic. Great read!"},{"Title":"The Secret Woman","review":"I have just ordered this book -- and may revise my review accordingly, later. The reaosn I have bought this book is that I remember, when it was first published, that the book-critic world did a double-take on it, and gave it a GREAT compliment.\\"Regular\\" book reviewers, you see, (especially then), looked down their noses at such \\"non-serious\\" books, as gothic romances. However, many of them said that THIS book -- \\"The Secret Woman\\", by Victoria Holt -- was far more than \\"just another\\" gothic romance -- that it was REAL LITERATURE. Hmmm.... any REAL gothic romance with THAT type of critical acclaim, seems to be the type of gothic romance for ME!

First of all, it is definitely a book... not a \\"purse\\" with things a child can take in and out. All the items in this book are attached or are illustrations on the pages... with the exception of a few items. There are some cool cardboard \\"sunglasses\\" that can be tried on. Then there are a few items that are packed away in an \\"envelope\\", such as a tea bag, half of a postcard with illegible handwriting on it, and some other small items I wasn't able to figure out. None of the other items can be taken out and played with. For instance, the box the book comes in (a throw away box, more of packaging & not really a part of the book) advertises to \\"put on Granny's rings--- all six of them\\". Well, you can't actually try on the rings b/c they are really just holes in the book... and I wouldn't really say there's six of them; there are 3 on one page, and 3 on the other. The pages are back to back, so they really appear to be the same rings! I really don't think a kid can put their fingers in the holes... I know I certainly couldn't. There's not much to actually do with the book. The items that are there to play with (not many) are flip-out items that are attached to the book except for the little things I mentioned. It would have been nice to actually have the \\"things\\" in the purse Velcro in and out, instead of just flap open. And there's not really many of those anyway. The postcard I mentioned would have been nicer if it wasn't ripped in half and if it actually had a message to read, complete with a legible address and a \\"stamp\\". The handkerchief would have been nice if it came in and out by Velcro. The advertisement on the box also says \\"Why does Granny carry a wrench?\\" Well, it would be nice to actually find that out, but the text doesn't even go there. There is not much to the text at all, and what it does have is very derogatory towards mom. I do not like the way the text degrades Mom and puts Granny up on a pedestal because of her spoiling. It could have said the same things about Granny without the derogatory comments about mom.Finally, I do not think this book is geared towards the correct age group. My daughters received this as a gift (from Grandma) at ages 4.5 and 7 yrs. The seven year old was interested in it at first, but once she looked at it, she was done and will never open it again. My four year old was somewhat interested in it and may go back to it, but I think she'd be more into it if there were more things to pull out and play with. Also, at 4.5 she is either looking for more of a story, or a book she can actually read herself. The text in this book is neither of that. There's absolutely no storyline, yet the words are not words that a 4 or 5 year old can read. I think this book is more suited to the 2 to young 4 year old range. However, the book is all made of cardboard... so I have no idea how long this book would last with any child. If it weren't for the cardboard flimsiness of it, I would even say it would be geared for a younger toddler... but I would hesitate due to the lack of sturdiness."},{"Title":"My Granny's Purse","review":"I'm writing this because I'm surprised that anyone would write a negative review for \\"My Granny's Purse,\\" a clever, charming piece of readable sculpture that still intrigues my precocious 5 year-old daughter after a year and a half.Despite lots of other available literary treasures, My Granny's Purse has been her consistent favorite, winning the nighttime sweepstakes as my daughter's most-requested reading item. That makes it a winner for dad too - a kid's book that engages and fascinates for repeat visits. But there's something a little mysterious in My Granny's Purse that defies explanation, though I think it's the peek into an adult world that is part real and partly untold that fascinates my daughter.The ongoing appeal of My Granny's Purse is also mildly surprising given its rather minimal, aphoristic text - a text intended to be humorous in contrasting mom and granda's admonitions (\\"Throw that junk away\\" vs. \\"Save it for a rainy day\\" e.g.), with no danger that it might stir up any family conflicts (whew, please spare kids the blandness of political correctness!)Whatever the allure of this piece - part pop-up, part toy sculpture, part reading book, part found object collection - My Granny's Purse has kept its appeal longer than anything else on our bookshelf, so now I'm getting copies for kids of friends as well. Fragile? Not really, but handle with care and apply tape where needed (only the joints are fragile, the cardboard is tough). In any case don't deny your kid a trip into the random snapshots and souvenirs of an entire adult lifetime, glimpsed in the found objects that populate the witty and intelligent \\"My Granny's Purse.\\" Bottom line: my daughter loves it - she's the one giving it five stars."},{"Title":"My Granny's Purse","review":"Grandmothers who buy this book for their own children's children are simply demonstrating their own lack of parenting ability.I think this book body-slams Mom every chance it gets! It also encourages children in the formative years to just ignore Mom and go with that fun-loving granny, no matter how important Mom's advice is to her growing daughter. Any good granny should know, (except for the narcissistic ones who will purchase this book) that supporting Mom and backing her up is more important than being hip and wild. All grannies who think about purchasing this book should step back about forty years and put themselves in the place of Mom, and then place the book in the hands of her own mother-in-law giving it to her daughter!Mother-in-laws beware...if you don't want to enrage your daughter-in-law, choose another book!

I am going to have to put it up for a couple of years, then look at it with her. It's not a board book for little kids. Some of the pieces are very flimsy and small.Its a very cool book and I'm excited for her to be able to use it, but will definately have to wait a while. I can imagine that it would last only a few minutes with what I think of as the traditional age (2-4) for a board book.A really great concept and I can see it being used with a 3-4 year old under very close supervision. A great \\"read on your lap\\" book.The book is in a sturdy clear plastic box, each page has removable parts or flaps to open or an activity to do. I would recommend keeping the book in the box on a high shelf when not in use, if your child is small.I bought all three in the series: My mommy's tote, My grannies purse, and My grandpa's briefcase.

I could tell right away that it wasn't a book that I wanted to just hand over to my exploratory 18 month old. Although she is very gentle, this book is designed for exploration and curiosity, and I could just see it having some pieces ripped away just out of a toddler's normal zest and enthusiasm.That being said, we have already enjoyed several hours playing with the book together. She loves to sit on my lap and \\"explore\\" the book with me. There are so many things to look at, and open and feel. She loves to \\"put on the rings\\" and open the passport. I'm enjoying many more times like this, and then when she is old enough to look at the book by herself it will be in good condition, and she will have learned that books are meant to be read and enjoyed and not ripped up.

It would have been something I would of adored as a little girl, with it's pockets of treasures and flaps to pull out with brightly colored pictures of granny and baby. The only problem is that it is NOT DURABLE enough for a toddler. I don't reccomend it for children under 3 yrs old or if your child is a little rough with things. This will not last. It is made out of cardboard and alot of the little flaps are folded so that they can EASILY tear. You'll spend more time gluing the flaps back together than enjoying this great little book.

My mommy always says 'Sit still Please!'\\"--\\"'Stop worrying' says You know who. 'Be happy' says Granny.This book not only is derogetorry toward moms but it plots mom against grandma... which is not the image I want my daughter to have. I want her to have strong female influences in her life that compliment each other not oppose one another... I am not unaware of the stereotypical spoiling that goes on with grandchildren and Grandparents.. I just think it could have been done in a more playful manner... the dialogue sounds almost angry at \\"you know who\\". As a mother who is very close to my daughter's \\"Nana\\" and who enjoys a 3 generation girls day out a few times a months i like to think that we can all get along and work together toward my little girl's growth and self worth...

It would be comparable to \\"The Jolly Postman\\" because of the items that are included in the \\"purse\\", and this makes the book.

It's pretty flimsy considering it's suppose to stand up to the attention of a toddler- it's only made out of cardboard. There are so many little pieces that are easily lost. Like I said- wonderful idea but you would be better off just taking an old purse and filling it up with real items- old keys, old plastic sunglasses, etc."},{"Title":"My Granny's Purse","review":"My Granny's Purse was a big disapointment for me. I wish I had read the reviews of others before buying. THey are right.. it's not for a small child. I bought it for my 18mth old daughter. She didn't like it at all. The sunglasses are the only thing she played with and they broke almost instantly. It's all cardboard.. and so it's not durable. For a older child, this might work. But it doesn't have much to do really and its text doesn't have much of a point. I don't know whether this is a book or a toy but it falls short in both categories. thanks!"},{"Title":"My Granny's Purse","review":"Although this is a cute idea, I would not recommend this for small children (which doesn't make sense because that is who it is for, right?).

There are 24 lessons, each about 7 minutes long. The lessons are divided into scenes on three audio tapes. The lessons are taught entirely in Spanish. It is amazing how well this works by putting the conversation in context and by using a guidebook. By going through each lesson several times and doing the exercises in the book, you learn Spanish in an easy and enjoyable manner, Having used Pimsleur, I believe that dollar for dollar, the Berlitz method compares well. You can't go wrong with either {Pimsleur or Berlitz) but, for less than 30 bucks, your money is very well spent with the Berlitz basic Spanish. The big difference between these two fine methods (Berlitz &amp; Pimsleur) is the following: (1) Pimsleur has a series of 32 longer lessons in which the language is taught using both English and the language you are learning on the tape. The Pimsleur lessons are about a half hour long. (2) The series of Berlitz lessons are about 7 or so minutes long and no English is spoken. The accompanying book provides English translation in marginal notes for new words that are introduced into the vocabulary. Both programs are effective but Berlitz is a great bargain."},{"Title":"Love at All Ages: A Novel (Angela Thirkell Barsetshire Series)","review":"Judging an author's body of work by only reading one novel, and her last novel written at the very end of her long life, is infantile, the equivalent of watching Steven Spielberg's \\"1941\\" and judging him to be a mediocre talent and not worthy of further viewing.This is Mrs Thirkell's final completed novel and like the majority of her later works, not up to the standards of her finest work of the Thirties and Forties, but it's a must read for fans of the Barsetshire series. For newcomers to her books, I would recommend any of the Barsetshire novels of the Thirties, but particularly \\"Summer Half\\", \\"Wild Strawberries\\", \\"Pomfret Towers\\", \\"The Brandons\\" or \\"High Rising\\".

Kennedy came in and thought that Ike had approved it.It was a fiasco from the start, with Kennedy demanding that he might pull the plug on the last day before the invasion, if he did not like it. The CIA and the military could not conceive that once things started that air support would be refused.I knew from years ago that Kennedy had denied air support from our own Navy for the invasion.What I did not know until reading this book was that Kennedy also reduced the size of the liberation forces B26 strikes, and eliminated 2 of them, thus allowing Fidel's air force to survive and slaughter the freedom fighters on the beach and their supplies coming in from the sea.Also, the Alabama National guard had and pilots who trained the Cubans in flying the B26 and 2 of them were killed when they flew strikes in for ground support of the invasion.Moving the target landing zone from Trinidad to the Bay of Pigs at the last minute eliminated any chance of survivors escaping into the mountains to fight as guerillas if anything went wrong, and everything went wrong.The CIA flaws are numerous. They did not know about a reef that everybody in the area knew about, and sunk the supply ships.They refused to place guns on the supply ships as unneeded, as there would be air cover, and were forced to because the owner of the ships would not let them use the ships unless they were armed. The guns were used a lot. All the communications equipment was in one crate and went to the bottom, making it impossible to communicate with the beach. CIA officials were not on the supply ships.The air strike plan was not made clear to the Pres in advance.The plan assumed an uprising that never took place. It was only in the minds of the invaders.After the air strikes were cancelled, the CIA went ahead with the plan as there was no place to take a bunch of armed, pissed of Cuban freedom fighters, other than to Cuba.It is a frustrating book to read."},{"Title":"Bay of Pigs","review":"A detailed account of the Bay of Pigs landing derived from the author's interview with Fidel Castro and various U.S. government officials.

The objective of the plan was to free Cuba from communism. The initial military plan was sound, but then the politicians changed the location of the invasion from Trinidad (very close to the mountains to establish a guerrilla stronghold in case the invasion was not succesful) to the Bay of Pigs, a peninsula surrounded by swamps, far from the mountains. Then politicians (mainly President Kennedy) cancelled crucial air strikes two days prior to D Day, and on the morning of D Day. The result being that Castro's air force was not eliminated. Then on D Day, President Kennedy refused to provide air support, allowing Castro's air fighters to sink anything approaching the beaches. Bottom Line: The US Government allowed 1,500 men to invade Cuba, then left them to be killed or captured, refusing to help with air cover.

Many, too many, believed that the U. S. would intervene before seeing the attempt squashed.

The shame and grief of those who were compelled to stand by and do nothing is heart wrenching. If you want to know more about why and how President John F. Kennedy was convinced to allow the invasion and about the men who participated in it, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Bay of Pigs","review":"In \\"Bay of Pigs\\", Peter Wyden pulls out all the stops- and asks the many questions that remained unasked for nearly two decades after the infamous episode in America's foreign relations. The Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 had originally been planned by Eisenhower before he left office in January 1961- and he handed over the plan of action to Kennedy- who was trying to paint himself as a tough anti-Communist at a time when the Cold War was raging. It's well known that the U.S. backed the unpopular dictator Fulgencia batista in Cuba and millions of Cuban citizens were not happy with the status quo. Fidel Castro saw an opening and fought a guerilla war against the government, taking power in January 1959 and quickly seizing control of major industries, the press and many other operations, including the lucrative casinos and illicit operations run largely by the America Mafia. Mafia leaders were outraged and wanted retribution and their property back. It has been speculated for almost four decades exactly what Kennedy discussed with his advisors in the CIA and other intelligance agencies- and how he came to the fateful decision to invade Cuba (it had only been in the planning stages until then). Yet- he made the final decision- somewhat half-heartedly- and it turned out to be a public relations disaster, leading Kennedy to go before reporters and utter his famous quote \\"It's been said that success has a thousand fathers, yet failure is an orphan\\".The meetings leading up the the Bay of Pigs invasion- one meant to overthrow the Castro government and return Cuba to democracy- are said to have involved \\"groupthink\\"- the reluctance of individuals to disagree with a train of thought which appeared popular to the group overall. Indeed, Bobby Kennedy- JFK's Attorney General- tried unsuccessfully to argue against this invasion and thought it unwise and reckless. Yet, JFK gave in- but only halfway. He actually allowed the ground troops to land via several ships hitting the Cuban coast- but called off the air support at the last minute- stranding the infantry and dooming them to failure. As a result, the Bay of Pigs invasion is routinely quoted as one of the worst planned, illogically conceived and poorly enacted foreign relations activities in American history.Peter Wyden interviewed dozens of critical observers and participants- including Fidel Castro- in writing this important book. Fans of American history- and those who follow government policy- will enjoy his detailed analyses and hard-hitting commentaries.

Hmmm I know what I would do...And Robert is amazing but a little over the top, he needed to just let her go to see if she followed."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I love the Bridgerton and Whistledown books but this novel about lovers torn apart by misunderstanding didn't work for me. I thought that the things that drove them apart when they meet again 7 years later were not realistic and the hero didn't seem very understanding about the heroine's objections, basically just wearing her down instead of getting her point the first time she tried to explain it. His actions didn't seem so much like a lover as like a stalker."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I love Julia Quinn's writing style and humor, so I always enjoy her books. Other people have problems with the fighting between Robert and Victoria, but that is when the story really picked up for me. I found the love at first sight beginning to be very unrealistic. But I think the humor in this book redeems the first 50 pages. Yes, there is a big misunderstanding, and yes, all this could be solved if the hero and heroine would actually talk instead of fighting, BUT the fighting brings us many funny moments. This is definitely a good escape from reality."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I enjoyed this tale of star-crossed lovers, but I thought it dragged on too long and there was too much fighting between the hero and his lady. Victoria Lyndon and Robert Kemble, earl of Macclesfield, fall in love but are kept from eloping by their small-minded fathers. Seven years pass, and Victoria has become a governess who encounters a much-changed Robert at a party. It becomes a bit of a complicated tale of love and revenge from then on, and would have benefited from being 50 pages shorter."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"With \\"Everything and the Moon\\" Julia Quinn has created another distinctive blend of imaginative narrative and expressive characters. Her specialty has always been dialogue- and this tale of star-crossed lovers does not disappoint- her characters spar wittily and often made me laugh out loud. Victoria Lydon is a likable heroine, who, disappointed after a youthful but passionate love affair, grows to be a strong and independent woman. When after seven years, her path again crosses that of her childhood love, Robert, Earl of Macclesfield, she resolves not to fall under his spell again. But love will not be denied- and no matter how much Robert and Victoria try to suppress it, they are drawn together. Theirs is a dance of heartbreak and deception, romance and seduction- you will laugh, you will sniffle, and you will thoroughly enjoy \\"Everything and the Moon."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"With this work, Julia Quinn has tumbled into the writers' pond of thinking -- that the swells of conflict are the keys to remarkable reading. Ah yes, every romance reader's dream is to drag through three hundred pages filled with down and dirty quarreling all in the name of love.Even with dry wit sprinkled throughout, the author's words are long and drawn. In this Quinn book, we find two people, who are the ages of 31 and 24, and they go at each other to the extreme.Victoria is the nastiest. This little shrew is supposed to be a vicar's daughter. I guess she missed the lesson on forgiveness. On the other hand, Robert was absent the day his governess taught Life's Lesson 101-- &quot;Believe none of what you hear, and half of what you see&quot;.For more delightful reading check out Quinn's &quot;The Duke and I&quot; and/or &quot;An Offer from a Gentleman&quot; both are fun.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"The first half was really great. I loved the chemistry of the characters. But once the misunderstandings are uncovered by the main characters, the book goes down the drain. Mainly because of Victoria's reaction and stubborn rejection of Robert. The whole misunderstanding was actually wrong on both sides. Robert misunderstood Victoria and Victoria misunderstood Robert. But I didnt know why Robert had to pay for it over and over again in the second half of the book. He was near groveling to win back her love while she was pretty cold and adamant about refusing him.Julia Quinn is an excellent author but this book was just \\"eh\\".She has some awesome books though like \\"How to marry a Marquis\\" and \\"The Viscount who loved me.\\""},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I'm not as down on this book as a lot of others seem to be. I don't think it was Quinn's best, but I quite enjoyed it. If you're on the bubble about purchasing it, it's worth it - go ahead. Julia Quinn's books are just entertaining reads. I got a little exasperated with the characters in the middle but I always liked them and found many parts of their story quite touching. I could feel their pain during their conflicts and separation, and when an author can do that, it's worth a read.Yes, I found myself questioning the fast declarations of love. And then even the immediate love itself, but I started thinking back when I was a teenager and how quickly it can happen. Yes at first sight the feeling can be there and they are loves one always remembers."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Do you believe in love at first sight? Julia Quinn states in her introduction that she doesn't think that she does but she decided to write a book about it. Obviously this would be a very short book if hero and heroine fell in love at first sight and then lived happily ever after so in order to produce some more pages it couldn't go that smoothly; thus the \\"Big Misunderstanding\\".Regency novels these days seem to fall into two groups - the \\"Big Misunderstanding\\" group or the \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" group (where the hero and heroine dislike each other at the start and have to slowly change their opinions). Generally I prefer the latter sort of book as there tends to be more character growth and variety whereas the former type can often get annoying in the lengths the author has to go to in order to keep the protagonists apart with the misunderstanding when one quick clear conversation would sort it out.And that's my problem with \\"Brighter than the moon\\". Hero and heroine were about to elope but it was prevented and both then went through the next seven years assuming the other had been at fault and didn't really care about them. When they meet again, with Victoria working as a governess and Robert, the Earl of Macclesfield, living the life of a rake, they talk (or argue) at length about what separated them but neither explains their side of what happened. If they had done then the Big Misunderstanding would be over, as would the story. Eventually Robert finds out some of it from Victoria's sister but even when that is sorted he has rubbed her up the wrong way enough for her not to fall into his arms. Most of this book they spend bickering - Victoria in a decidedly unladylike way - and Robert also seems to spend a lot of his time stalking her and generally hassling her.For me this book didn't really work. Aside from the historicity (Regency English people speaking modern-day American, Victoria's behaviour being completely inappropriate for her station, role, era, you name it) I found that I couldn't get into the story enough to really like the characters. By the end I was a bit bored with them both and it got monstrously soppy by the end - too cheesy for this English reader. There's a token baddie in the story who features in about four pages, various other minor characters who come and go, but most of it is about Victoria and Robert and for me there wasn't enough to their story."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"A very enjoyable read that brings a smile to your face but nothing that gets your heart pounding in excitement. There are no side plots (e.g mysteries), the story focuses entirely on Robert Macclesfield's pursuit of his lost love, Victoria Lyndon. Julia Quinn romantically positions this novel with Robert's attempts to win over Victoria's heart after a cruel misunderstanding separated them for 7 years. Older in the ways of the world now, having lived independently as a governess Victoria is reluctant to trust Robert again and lose her independence. Quinn creates a sweet heroine but somewhat overdoes it with Victoria's overprotestations - \\"the lady doth protesteth too much!\\". The storyline may be too simple for some to enjoy as there is no real obstacles to Robert winning Victoria, just her objections over his courtship. Readers may just fall in love with Robert - he is a charming, intelligent and understanding gentleman and arduous in his courtship. However, if you enjoy tender romances this is one novel you should read. It cannot fail to touch your heart with its sweetness and true-love. While not her best novel, a very quiet and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"This is my favorite Julia Quinn novel so far (and I've read all the ones since Splendid, thanks to the reprint.)

So I was very disappointed when I was only to the end of the first chapter and the two main characters had already fallen in love (a really unbelievable love-at-first-sight situation). Of course, the rest of the book takes place seven years later, but the beginning of the story, the background, was so rushed that you really don't even get to know the characters. I really didn't like either of them.Really, this book reads like something a high school student put together. I can hardly believe that Julia Quinn, who exhibits (in my humble opinion) near genius in most of her writing, wrote this!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Robert is next in line for the earldom.

The characters were bland, and the love at first sight plot between these two wasn't believable in the least bit; that's were I think Quinn dropped the ball on this one. As a loyal fan that's read almost every book she's written I know she had the talent to pull this one off, but obviously she didn't use it."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Don't start this book unless you have a lot of time to spare because once you start, you won't be able to put it down.

Victoria did play a little too hard to get, but it was a great read anyway. I just ordered Brighter Than the Sun from Amazon and can't wait to get my hands on that one either. And her new book will be out in October. I'm sure it will be just as enjoyable as the rest!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I finished reading this book in one sitting. I loved this book so much I wanted to read it again straight away!! I wanted to give this 100 stars!This is a story that was light (but not shallow) in plot but heavy in love, which is wonderfully refreshing since most of the other romances I have read have many deep plots and misunderstandings that can sometimes be a little too much for us \\"gentle readers\\". I will not summarize this story since it has been done by other reviewers.Robert Kemble's character (who has become one of my all-time favorite heroes) shone so brightly you could not help but fall smack bang in love with him. He is an original Hero, a man who was not so egoistic that he could not accept his mistakes. Instead, he put his whole life into making amends and never EVER hesitated in declaring his love for our Heroine, Victoria Lyndon, in both action and words. Over and over again in the story his love, adoration and loyalty was displayed. Just to melt the reader more, Robert has to rescue Victoria many many times in this novel and even when his own life was at risk, is only concerned for Victoria. His love/knowledge of science is not only endearing but caused me so much laughter, and who could resist a hero who is capable of being teary eyed? ~sigh~Victoria Lyndon is a woman who brought the excitement, dispair/tears and frustration to the story. Her antics as she attempted to run away from the man she loved made me feel slightly annoyed (in an interested way) yet laugh at the same time, hold my breath from a kind of nervousness and anticipation, then read as fast as I could to find out what would happen to her. The traumas, trials and confusion she endured made me cry. The strength in her character both satisfied and frustrated me.To achieve these emotions in a reader only proves that Quinn is indeed one of the top writers. Everything is described and rendered in such a way that you felt you were standing in the same room as the characters or sitting in ther mind, listening to their thoughts.The side characters were beautifully placed and written about enough for the reader to feel that they knew these characters and were used to not just fill out the storyline, but to lift and support the hero and heroine along to the end.For those of you who loves a romance that is dripping with love from front cover to backpage (unlike most novels that uses more ditches than rises to capture the reader) and a story that makes you go \\"awwwww\\" every other minute, \\"Everything and the Moon\\" is a must-read!!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I love JQ's books, but this one isn't up to par. The characters just didn't ring true, and worse there was NO tension in the book. If they called each other darling or sweetheart one more time..... And it didn't help that the whole plot was a big cliche and shouldn't have taken 300+ pages to solve.Over all, it's not the worst thing I've ever read, but it's not a good example of Quinn's abilities. If you've never read her before, read one of her later books first."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Okay so this is the story of love at first sight, two people who want to elope and are mislead by both their fathers so that they think they are being deceived by one another.Seven years later they meet again, they still love each other and all dishonesty is brought to the fore front, everything straightened out and all should be well......Well this is where the book took a nose dive for me, since I was thoroughly engrossed in the first half of the book.So after they meet again seven years later and find out that they both deceived by their fathers, why didn't they just get back together like normal people, instead Miss Quinn decided to let them bicker with each other page after page after page.The Heroine now decides (after she was almost raped twice, has no money, living in the slumps where a man got stabbed) that she wants her independence, mind you this is after seven years of being independent.She also now realizes that although she still fiercely loves our Hero, she would be better off being by herself.....okay can I stop here and say give me a break....I know this is fiction but c'mon, even with writing fiction sure Julia must have a little bit of knowledge about adding a bit of reality to the book.What woman (a vicar's daughter at that time) would turn down marriage to an earl (Who she loves and he loves just has passionately) to be poor and live the life she is so dissatisfied with after living it for seven years.....Not only did I want to burn this book, the sudden appearance of characters, oh the hero just happened to be part of a house party with people he didn't like to begin with, the Governess being very rude to an earl in front of the ton, he just happened to stop by a dress makers store.....I could go on and on.I know most people would say this is Julia Quinn's earlier work and does not compare to her work now, but I disagree, I have read the last two of the Bridgerton series, (The first four were great! The duke and I, The Viscount who loved me, An offer from a Gentleman, Romancing Mr Bridgerton. I will give credit were credit is due) and this formula she has adopted of letting the Hero and Heroine go on and on for pages at a time bickering is evident in the last two Bridgerton series (When he was Wicked and It's in his Kiss) My head reels from reading it, seems like two 7 year olds going at it.One word Immature!So if this review is not helpful, (I always say this) please don't be discouraged, just don't spend more than a penny on a used copy."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I love Julia Quinn's books, but this is my favorite of all of them. Victoria and Robert, separated seven years ago by treachery and misunderstanding, meet again in much altered circumstances. Robert, the guiltier of the two in their past, suffers enough after he realizes his mistakes to satsify any reader. These are two very loveable characters, and watching them regain their love over the course of the book is simply magic. My only wish is that the sensuality would be have been a little hotter, but the lack doesn't detract from this funny and moving love story about two people destined for each other. Definitely a comfort read."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"This is my favourite Julia Quinn novel, because it just has so much heart. It's a tale of star-cross'd lovers, to be sure, but what makes it intriguing is the number they do on themselves and on each other, even once the obstacles are out of the way. Robert and Victoria are both psychologically believeable, and the reader will want to sympathise with each of them. Aside from that, it's charmingly romantic and delightfully witty, as all of Quinn's works are."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Circumstance, misunderstanding and outside deceit keep Victoria and Robert apart but neither can deny the need they share for one another when fate brings them together again seven years later.A great angsty read! Well-written with incredible dialogue; a Julia Quinn staple.I have read this book many times and plan to read it many more!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Once in awhile you come across a book that makes wading through all the others worth it. Everthing and the Moon is it. I loved the joyful innocence, the heartbreak, and later the pursuit. I want to read stories where the romance is the center of the story. It is my all time favorite of the many romances I have read. Please write more like Everything and the Moon, Julia."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"What a wonderful book! Here is another novel that will be staying on my shelf just because I loved it so much! This was my first Julia Quinn story and I picked it in a rush rather randomly at the book store, and I was NOT disapointed!Julia Quinn has an amazing talent, her characters were so real, as were their andventures and their love for one another. Not to mention that the story was full of humor. Laughter and tears were inevitable.This book almost entirely revolved around their love and heartache. If you're looking for a romance novel that is heavily into the romance (some seem to have all plot and little to no romance) this is a must read! I do agree with another reviewer that Victoria did perhaps play hard to get too hard, but her heart had been broken for 7 long years, and, frankly, it makes things more interesting when the characters don't behave as we would like them to!! That's what makes the words on the pages become more than just &quot;words&quot; and somehow weaves itself into a wonderful adventure that keeps you turning the pages to find out what the characters will do next.And awesome book!! I'm certain I will be rushing to the book store with an aim this time!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I love the sequel to this book, but this book I found slightly insulting. Don't get me wrong, Julia Quinn is definitely the author I look for in romance novels, but this book didn't have enough plot. I am insulted by Robert's distrust of Victoria in the beginning, not even asking why she was in bed that fateful night 7 years ago, but lays it down on her being an evil, mean, fortune hunter. It takes Ellie (one of my favorite characters along with Elizabeth in How to Marry a Marquis) to pop his view of Victoria and tell him what really happened. And then he acts all surprised as if, &quot;Gee, I guess I was wrong all of this time and made my life and her life miserable for the past seven years, oops!&quot; I am glad I read Brighter Than the Sun first or I would have lost interest in Ms. Quinn."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Although I got kind of annoyed with how Victoria kept on refusing Robert (even though she found out he was innocent of just trying to get into her pants and then abandoning her) all in all &quot;Everything and the Moon&quot; was a good book. I liked Victoria, except for her stubbornness, however Robert was the book's saving grace. He was sweet, intelligent, and most of all kind. He is a nice change from some of the cruel heroes that are so prevalent in books today. The plot was was well done and generally fast moving. &quot;Everything and the Moon&quot; was a good book that I would recomend to anybody as a plesant (if a tiny bit dull) read."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Other Julie Quinn books are entertaining, but Everything and the Moon was boring, redundant, and full of cliches. Usually she comes up with a somewhat original story line, but this one has been written over and over again. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"This book, while lovely, is not very mind compelling. It is one of those book that you read swiftly without much thought process. Robert, the hero, seems perfect without a fault, while Sara, though lovely and amusing, is not very intelligent. The story in itself does not have much of a plot and seems to be going around in circles. For those who want a romance that will keep you on your toes, unfortunely this is not the book for you. For those, however, who want a romance to relax and read, this is quite good."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"This is the best romance novel i have read since I read Romeo and Juliet. Victoria and Robert are the ideal couple. If I could have any romance I would want it to be like theirs. It was so romantic how they first got together and how he showed up at her window at night and they took a walk around. I have never been in to romance novels but after reading this one I cant put tem down. Expecially not the books by Julia Quinn. She is a wonderful author, and she has a wonderful talent.thank you Julia for sharing your talent with the world of romance novels."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I started w/ Quinn's newest book (an offer from a gentleman) and am working backwards through all her books. The newer books are definitely better written. Everything and the moon does have the witty dialogues but it tries too hard.Some parts were too sappy and the characters weren't too developed. Probably cuz they had already found love in the beginning, and therefore are nice loving people, unlike the cynical rakes and supposedly un-interesting ladies one usually has. The plot moved along too quickly and it was hard to believe the lovers had become cynical of love."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I absolutely loved this book;I couldn't put it down! The characters, Robert and Victoria were so charming, and the dialogue was beyond compare. This was the first Julia Quinn I've ever read, and I loved it!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I love Ms. Quinn's books, but this one didn't hold my interest. Like the other review stated, it started out good, but fell flat about a third of the way in. The heroin sounded like a harpy, screechy witch. There really was no plot. I'm sorry I paid for this one."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I absolutely love love love this book! I recently lost my copy that I have read more than 100 times in a move and had to go buy another one because I miss reading it so much. I love Julia Quinn. A lot of people say this isn't her best work and maybe that is true in comparison to all the others in her collection but I still truly love this book!!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I don't think I've ever cried more, or laughed more. I may be a stickler for romances, but this book is by far Julia Quinn's best book, and I've read almost her entire bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone! There are some of Julia Quinn's books that are wonderful, but this one is not one of them. The writing, the dialogue and the storyline is pathetic. She has so many excellent books it is hard to believe she wrote this one!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"It's love at first sight for Victoria and Robert. Fine, you say, then where is the fun? Add in a pair of interfering fathers and a night of crossed signals and you have two lovers hopelessly ticked off at eachother for seven years. Can true love see through all the pain and distrust? Well, that's why you have to read it!Lose yourself in this wonderful Regency romance that has all the fun you expect from Julia Quinn, but without an annoying murder subplot that is so typical of the genre. This story is simply about when it's meant to be. Read it!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Victoria Lyndon, the seventeen-year-old daughter of the local vicar, is stunned to meet Robert Kemble, the young Earl of Macclesfield, and is even more stunned when he starts courting her. But when their fathers prevent them from eloping-and each thinks the other has betrayed him/her, they are both plunged into seven years of a bitter broken heart.Victoria runs away from home and goes to work for the amazingly cruel and insulting Lady Hollingwood, as a governess to her impossibly bratty son Neville. It's been seven years since she's seen Robert, but she's been unable to forget him. When he shows up at a weekend house part Lady Hollingwood throws, Victoria is speechless.Robert is furious: here she is in front of him-the woman who wanted him only for his money and title and whom he still burns for. He's spent seven years in other women's arms trying unsuccessfully to extricate Victoria from his heart. Now he vows to seduce and abandon her to get his revenge.But as Robert forces his attentions onto a hesitant yet attracted Victoria, he soon realizes that he can never let her go. He won't marry her but he'll bind her to him forever. When he asks her to be his mistress instead of his wife, Victoria's heart is broken a second time, and all she can think of is escaping from the man she will never be able to banish from her heart.This novel has a touching beginning-the courtship between Victoria and Robert is beautiful and refreshing. However, the subsequent rift between them is frankly implausible: there is no way the reader can believe that Robert would assume the worst when Victoria fails to show up for their elopement, even after he spies her asleep in her bed. He has no way to know her reasons, and to abandon her without finding them out reflects very badly on him. Even when the reader gets over this, Victoria then seems incredible when she is for awhile irritatingly prudish and churlish.Yet despite this and despite the failure to fully develop Victoria and Robert's characters, Everything and the Moon is often fun and touching. It is especially delightful when Robert kidnaps Victoria and takes her to a deserted cottage on the coast where they must somehow work out their differences. The dialogue and overall sensibility is not as humorous as Quinn's earlier trilogy, but this is still overall an entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"One of my favorite books by Julia Quinn and I have them all! I wanted to give it 10 stars."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I thought maybe since it started off so fast it really had nowhere to go. The plot moved along just fine and the heroine seems to be a courageous young woman but Robert was sometimes downright sappy he said I Love You so many times it was anticlimatic. I do enjoy Julia Quinn's novels and found this to be amusing but not the can't but down variety. If it's a sappy regency you're looking for this would be it hot passionate lovers who are torn apart.. nah well I guess I'll give little sister Eleanor a shot in Brighter Than the Sun wish me luck :)"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"You could tell immediately that this was an early effort of Quinn's and frankly, I am surprised it was published. It was that bad. The plot was too simple and she did not have the experience required to extend it into a full length novel. Boring, boring, boring. I never imagined I would tire of hearing a hero say \\"I Love You\\", but I definitely did as the over-worked phrase was repeated way too many times for it to carry the importance you associate with the words. None of the spirited, funny trademark dialog that we have come to expect from Quinn. Stay away from this one unless you just have nothing else to do."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I thought this was a pointless book. I couldn't empathize with the heroine, even though I understood intellectually what her issue was. There was no real emotional development; instead the book was filled up with repetitious, empty, fairly whiney dialog. I LOVED the last J Quinn book I read - this was a great disappointment. Skip it and try another one of her novels..."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Seven years ago Victoria Lyndon, daughter of a vicar, and Robert Kemble, future Earl of Macclesfield, fell madly and deeply in love. To the point that they planned to run away and elope, no matter what their fathers say or think! However when Victoria's father catches her sneeking out of the house, he makes sure she isn't going anywhere; and Robert assumes that Victoria was nothing but a fortune hunter who just wanted his title and money! Whereas Victoria is positive that Robert was just using her as a summer fling to keep himself from getting bored.Seven years later, Robert is the hansome, extremly wealthy , and powerful nobleman; and Victoria is now a governess to a spoiled rotten 5 year old. Both Robert and Victoria are furious with the other because they are still under the impression that one was using the other and never even loved them. What either of them can't figure out is why they just can't seem to NOT want to be with the other, and why their hearts always start to pound when the other comes into sight, after they meet again after 7 years!!Julia Quinn is by far one of my favorite authors now. In every book that I've read of her's, she has done a perfect job with everything that makes a book great! Just after the first chapter I felt all giddy inside just like the characters! The characters were completely thought out and you could see how each of them were changing and growing as a person, and you could see the love grow again in each of them. I loved this book. I found myself actually laughing out loud throughout most of the book. The only thing it didn't make me do wascry. I've noticed in some of her other books, Mrs. Quinn has the most amazing ability to make he laugh and then 5 chapters later cry. I'm not saying that because I didn't cry it only deserves 4 stars, but it was just a suprise. I give this book 5 stars because it earned every single one of them and more!!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I've been reading romances for years, and I think this is one of he best"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I have read all of Julia Quinn's books. This book is my all time favorite. I have read it a couple of times in the last couple of years. The characters are very lovable, the dialogue is witty, and the plot is quite funny. The book serves as a reminder that first love is always something to treasure and remember. In this case, the scenario is first love for both characters then an elopement goes awry and a big misunderstanding ensues. Seven years later, the two meet again, and love rekindles. The hero tries to make apologies for the misunderstanding via a courtship with sweets and pastries. The characters are both vulnerable to each other during the courtship. He is afraid she will never forgive him and she is afraid he will hurt her again. I have enjoyed all of Quinn's works with the exception of &quot;To Marry An Heiress.&quot; If you enjoyed &quot;Dancing At Midnight&quot; and &quot;Splendid&quot; then you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I enjoyed the plot, but from the middle of the book to the end, I was actualy anxious to end the story once and for all. Though the characters are witty, too much of their talking, no real action, dragging from page to page will leave you exhausted. The hero said something, the heroin talks back, she doesn't dispense kisses until talking a mileage first, really the hero is just so patient to listen to her antics and no kisses before that, but I got so tired of her fears that I wished that the guy will just tell her to shut up or go find another more ardorous and quiet woman. At the end I didn't know if she being beautiful will make up for her being so shrew. The woman didn't ring as one sexy heroin. She is more the convent girl."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I love Julia Quinn's work. She's a fantastic writer, and most of her books are wonderfully funny and fun to read. &quot;Everything and the Moon&quot; was an undeniably sweet book -- in the beginning. It's absolutely perfect, with the love at the first sight and the romance and then... kapow, throw in a completely misunderstood situation and the madly in love characters suddenly become overly suspicious aliens.When Robert realizes the misunderstanding, that's when you get the non-alien Robert back. But unfortunately, Victoria insists on being completely stubborn and clich&eacute; up till the end of the book. It's a lovely story, but completely frustrating. You want to knock some sense into these characters that've NO idea what they're doing.Beautifully written, though, and a very touching story. You can't possibly not enjoy Ms. Quinn's books. I definitely suggest reading this one."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I hate to be the fly in the ointment but I cannot agree with the 5 star ratings the previous reviewers gave Everything and the Moon. I recently read Quinn's How to Marry a Marquis and I was enchanted! The book was light but very very very funny with cute believable characters. This one however, started out very well but became a strain about midway. I didn't care for the new independent, unmovable Victoria. Even though Robert had the patience of a saint, near the end I thought he should have just dumped her. She was too much work. I mean- there's angry and defiant and then there's obtuse! Anyway, I'll still try more Julia Quinn because I liked the Marquis one so much. If you like humorous regency novels, try Merely Married by Patricia Coughlin and Escapade by Kasey Michaels."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Julia Quinn is incomparable when it comes to dialogue. Her characters come across as real people saying and thinking things that real people say and think. They're funny, sad, gentle, sensual, loving, lovable and unforgettable!This is the story of the star-crossed lovers who fall in love, get separated and then meet again.. he wants revenge, she wants to erase him from her history. They both fail.You might find yourself feeling a little sorry for Robert by the second half of the book because Victoria does not give up.. she drives him to the edge, several times, but he never gives up on her. There a part when he is faced with 'eight hens' and his groom advices him that 'now might not be the best of time to be a rooster..&quot; where I laughed so hard, people thought I was going crazy..Lovely book, lovely read.. don't miss it and if this is your first Julia Quinn, don't hesitate, she'll get you hooked."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I started reading this book this morning on my way to work (I am a LIRR commuter) and I could not put the book down. Thankfully since I was able to finish my work in record time I was able to finish Everything and the Moon before lunch! I couldn't stop, I tried to slow down my reading (I tend to read really fast, only leaving myself to re-read the book after I've finished to learn of the things I might of missed) I even tried closing the book and waiting until my trip home, but I just couldn't. I loved Robert and I loved Torie (not to mention that I happen to love that nickname for a woman) and I especially loved the mention of the Duke of Ashbourne, which only served to remind me of Splendid (another one of Ms. Quinn's treasures)! This book, along with all of her other books, are delightful! Filled with love and laughter, wit and charm. If you do not read anything for the rest of this century, read her books. SPLENDID, DANCING AT MIDNIGHT and MINX, then EVERYTHING AND THE MOON and BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN, and finally TO CATCH AN HEIRESS and HOW TO MARRY A MARQUIS! You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"&quot;Everything and the Moon&quot; is the first book written by Julia Quinn I've read. It will definitely NOT be the last. I absolutely adored this book. The main characters, Victoria &amp; Robert, are intelligent and lively. Their conversations are sure to make you smile if not laugh out loud! Robert is one of the most likable &quot;heroes&quot; that I've come across in historical &amp; romance. I found Victoria's concerns very easy to identify with and liked her immensely. This is one of the best I've read in a long long time."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I have loved so many of Julia Quinn's novels (the Bridgerton series is fantastic!) that it hurt my heart to dislike this book. But I really did. Any other author would have gotten 1 star for this boring, anger-filled book, but Quinn has given me so much reading pleasure in the past that I had to show some mercy here. What bothered me the most is that while Quinn has proven herself more than capable of fleshing out characters and creating complex and compelling dialogue, she does neither her. The hero and heroine are both shown at only a shallow depth, and what is revealed makes them both seem childish and mean beyond what their past would call for. Their conversations could have been written by any decent student in a high school English class, with little of Quinn's typically clever turn of phrase. If Quinn's name had not been on the cover, I never would have believed she was the author. I will continue to read her work as often as I can, because I have adored so much of her writing, but I will try to forget that she penned this one."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I just finshed reading all of Julia Quinn's novels, this one being the last one I read. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either. Don't get me wrong, I think there's no bad Julia Quinn book, it's just that some are so great that others pale by comparison. This is one of them.All the character's were likable and it was endearing to see characters from other novels mentioned (like the Duke of Ashbourne and Emma from \\"Splendid\\"). There were also a few moments that had me cracking up, like the dress shop incident. Still, I found Victoria to be irritating at times and I thought that the love-hate banter between Victoria and Robert was dragged out.I'm giving this novel 3 stars because there are other Julia Quinn books that are so much better. However, if you're a Julia Quinn addict you should read it, just so you can appreciate her recent work even more."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Although the misunderstanding was serious, the book did not warp itself into a tedious melodramatic tale! The characters were absolutely fantastic and the interaction between them just made you melt. I disagree with one the reviewers about Victoria \\"Torrie\\" being stubborn and cliche! I was glad that she did not give in right away! Even if they are both somewhat to blame for the misunderstanding, I think more of it should be heaped upon the hero! This was why I found it amusing that Victoria made him work for it a bit! It's great to see an arrogant man on his knees!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful. I started reading it at work during my luch hour and after four chapters I knew that I was in trouble. It was so good and so gripping that I knew I was going to have trouble putting it down. And you know what, I did. I came right home from work and sat down and finished the book. This book just captivitated me from beginning to end. In our own way, each of us is like Victoria. We all are a little scared after a bad experience at love. Especially if the person who hurt you is the same person who you love. But it is nice to believe that people can work things out and grow to love each other once again. You have just got to read this book. I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I really like Julia Quinn. She is, in fact, one of my favorite romance authors ever. I discovered her with \\"The Duke and I,\\" I devour each of the Bridgerton books as they come out, and now I've gone looking for her earlier books to tide me over until the next installment.Unfortunately, \\"Everything and the Moon\\" is not one of her best works. It's not *bad*, by any means, but there's nothing particualarly memorable about it either. The plot doesn't flow very well -- each segment seems a little disjointed from the one that came before -- and it could have borrowed from any of a thousand other romance novels. The characters don't really stand out either; they're fairly generic, as if they were sent from Central Casting and not fleshed out at all. I've just finished the book, and I have a feeling that in a few days, I won't remember much about it at all.Despite this middle-of-the-road quality, it does have its good points; I occasionally saw flashes of Ms. Quinn's trademark wit and style. Robert's reaction when he almost walked in on Victoria in the bath amused me to no end, and the way Victoria trounces the villain at the end of the book made me both laugh and cheer. But, on the whole, this book was rather flat.This is one of Ms. Quinn's earlier efforts, and it shows -- she has greatly improved as writer since then, in my opinion. If you're just looking for a regency romance to read, there's nothing actually *wrong* with this book; there's just nothing really exciting about it. If you're looking for early Julia Quinn, I recommend reading \\"To Catch an Heiress\\" instead; it's much more lively and charming. If you've never read anything by Julia Quinn before, I recommend picking up a copy of \\"The Duke and I,\\" the first volume of the Bridgerton series -- you'll be letting yourself in for a real treat!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I love it! Out of Julia Quinn's non-Bridgerton books, this is my favorite. Is so sweet, so bitter sweet throughout the story. And even though its a romance novel and I know they'll end up together at the end, it stays suspenseful. I think Julia Quinn is able to develop the emotions and the characters in this novel as compared to the younger Lyndon sister's story. Its just so nice that there wasn't a villian in the story but rather random people who played a role in both lives that either took them apart or made them even bond faster together."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Another great read by Julia Quinn. I love how the male characters are not afraid to show how much they love the woman in her books. Just wish real life was the same. I get taken back so much that I think I should have been born 200 years earlier."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"The minute Robert Kemble, Earl of Macclesfield, set eyes on the raven-haired beaty that was Victoria Lyndon, it was love at first sight.She was everything he never knew he had always wanted. And she would be his.As soon as he let her know, that is.Victoria couldn't be more suprised when the owner of the lands and the pond she was swimming in suddenly accosted her. That is, until he started to shamelessly flirt and kiss her. And promise her everything she could ever want. AND the moon.Robert proposed and Victoria wants nothing more than to marry this wonderful, charming man she is rapidly falling for... but their fathers think differently on the matter. And thanks to them, a most horrid misunderstanding takes place, pushing the loving couple apart.Seven years later, they meet again. Now they need to learn to forgive each other, and start accepting the old feelings that are now resurfacing. If only Robert can convince Victoria that this time he will, indeed, give her everything and the moon.I just love Julia Quinn. It's very rare for me not to like the things she write... but when I read her introductory letter for this book, I somehow knew this would be one of those rare occasions.How can an author expect us to believe in something she doesn't believe herself?I've never been one for love-at-first-sight stories, but thinking this one would be like the others Quinn had so perfectly penned, I gave it a try. I don't know. Maybe if I hadn't read her letter saying she was writing about something she didn't believe, I would have enjoyed the story more. Maybe I still wouldn't have enjoyed it. My point is: I couldn't finish it.Yup, that's right. I abandoned this book. The beginning was super cute, I'll admit it. And there were some great (and awfully characteristic of Quinn's works) amusing moments... but I just stopped caring for the characters around the middle of the book. I didn't even care enough to jump to the ending. I simply gave it up. They were juvenile. Plain silly. And not believable.However, I am enjoying the second book in the series immensely. But Brighter Than The Sun is very much in line with my other Quinn's favorites. :P I still love Quinn, we just had a bad moment.If you do like love-at-first-sight stories in a historical setting, then this will most likely be a hit for you. I hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I recommended to anyone who hasn't read julia quinn work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Everything and the Moon by Julia QuinnThis was a wonderful historical romance book. I rated it as 5 stars. The following is my review but please beware that it might contain spoilers.This book is the story of Robert and Victoria. This is the first of The Lyndon Sisters series.The story starts out with Robert and Torie as young adults (according to Victorian times).

Neither one realize that there father is going to make sure that they do not see each other nor allow them to marry.They decide to run away to get married but Torie's father decided to make sure that does not happen. To me Torie's father is an overbearing, arrogant, idiot. Robert's father is one of the aristocrats that does not believe love will ever prevail when money is involved. According to The Marquess money marries money it does not marry a vicar's daughter.Torie misses the appointed time that she was suppose to meet Robert. Robert starts to believe everything he father was spouting off about Torie. The next day Robert leaves for London. Hours later Torie goes to see Robert. She learns that he has left for London.

After 7 years Robert and Torie meet by chance where she is the governess to a monster of a little boy where Robert is attending a house party.Okay that is all the spoilers I will give about this book. It is a great read with a developed plot and interesting characters. If you have never read anything by Julia Quinn then this is a good first read for anyone to try."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Oh, the power of words! Their fathers vehemently disapproved of Robert Kemble's plan to marry Victoria Lyndon. They were too young, and the difference in their birth and wealth too vast. So what was this lovelorn couple to do but elope? Right before the elopement hard words were exchanged by each father to his child, and the truth in those words took root in Robert's and Victoria's mind. When Victoria did not appear at the meeting place, and when Robert fled immediately afterwards each felt heartbroken but convinced the words spoken by their father was true. Seven years passed...Victoria and Robert are brought together in a most unexpected way, and feel guarded, and mistrustful of one another...and yet the spark is still there. Will they be able to overcome not only the differences in their birth and wealth, but also the deep sense of betrayal each has carried around for all those years?This novel was well done, no loose ends were left hanging, but somehow it was just too much. Robert's behavior toward Victoria was over-the-top, and Victoria's behavior was inconsistent. She was generally a compliant person, but when she was in a desperate situation this rather passive woman (who was deeply in love with Robert) refused to fall in with Robert's honorable plans for her. I think if the novel had been about 100 pages shorter, or if Robert's courtship had been both less aggressive and taken place over a longer period of time it might have been just right."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Robert Kemble & Victoria Lyndon met, fell in love and decided to elope.On the night of the elopement Victoria failed to appear and Robert assumed she'd changed her mind, while Victoria believed Robert did not show up at the elopement either. Seven years later they meet again and although each thought the other had shunned the elopement, they were still attracted to each other. In the rest of the story, they fall in love all over again."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I have always loved Julia Quinn's books but this is one of my favorites.

This book is not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"Every once in awhile one needs to read a lighter more loving less dramatic kind of book. At least I do. That is the type of book this is. Robert and Victoria fall in love instantly at 17 and 24 - planning to marry their fathers keep them apart. Both think the other is at fault. When they accidently meet 7 years later Robert is still bitter and wants revenge and Victoria has decided to safe guard her heart forever. Robert soon realizes that it was not Torrie but his father and hers that kept them from eloping 7 years ago and he wants to win her back. Torrie who has decided to never allow herself to feel love again resists. And this is the only part I had difficutly with - she just seemed to resist too much. Robert was a very good and decent man - not like so many of the rouges we read about. He was kind, sweet, honorable and truly LOVED his Victoria. Finally she sees the light. This is not heavy reading but a love story about believing that you can fall in love at first sight and make it last forever."},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","review":"I liked the plot and found the characters endearing, if a bit two dimensional. However, there was no sizzle! The characters are intimate twice in the book and both times are DULL. They have pined for each other for 7 years, have 7 years of passion-filled longing for one another, and yet the first time they make love it's over so fast and is so boring that you're not even sure anything happened.The descriptions of the amorous scenes leave alot to be desired. The characters are so full of passion for one another that you just want them to go nuts for each other. Unfortunately, J.Q. fell terribly short on that aspect.It was entertaining and fluffy. If you like the romance novels with little to no sex, this is your book.

I picked up this book for a report at school. I thought that it would be just another boring book that we are often forced to read in school. Wrong-O! I loved it! From the team that had lost every single one of its games to the train depot that served soldiers during WWII, I found myself emersed in each of the stories. Each of these average Americans had a not so average story to tell..."},{"Title":"On the Road with Charles Kuralt","review":"Charles Kuralt had the gift of seeing a story in the littlest thing. He took the thread of everyman's life and wove a tapestry of America and then gave it as a gift to us."},{"Title":"On the Road with Charles Kuralt","review":"Charles Kuralt's On the Road segments always provided a nice break from the serious stories that dominate the evening news. Also, his segments revealed the positive side of \\"every day\\" America. So when I saw Kuralt's book based on those segments, I was excited to read it.While traveling America, Kuralt uncovered some amazing stories. One of my favorites concerns a dirt farmer from rural Arkansas who had little formal education, but who spent twelve hours a day reading the classics and educating himself. Another is about a small-town Missouri doctor who charged whatever his patients could afford to pay him. These great short stories (most are 3-4 pages long) make On the Road easy and fun to read.Though I liked the book, there are a few problems. One is that many of the stories are very slight; Kuralt goes on about hamburgers, misspellings on signs, and other trivia. In another chapter, he discusses a woman - Pat Baker - who built a public park in Reno, Nevada. What Kuralt doesn't mention is more interesting. After Kuralt's death it emerged that - unknown to Kuralt's wife and kids - he kept a second, \\"secret family\\" with the Baker for 29 years. It is difficult for me to like Kuralt after learning about his decades-long deceptions.On the Road contains verbatim transcriptions from Kuralt's CBS reports. I remember some of the dialogue. Though there are many black-and-white pictures, at times, the book suffers without the visuals in the original reports because the dialogue alone was not intended to tell the entire story.In short, On the Road contains some good vignettes about obscure Americans that Charles Kuralt gathered during his many years at CBS News."},{"Title":"On the Road with Charles Kuralt","review":"Excellent read on the United States of the 1970s and 80s.

Will possibly purchase DVDs by the author too. CBS would be wise to publicize and reissue the books & stories. They could replay specials and add them to other news programs. They could sell them to PBS or other stations to air too."},{"Title":"On the Road with Charles Kuralt","review":"I've never seen Charles Kuralt on television. This book is my only experience with him, and that may explain the review that is to follow.This is the most insipid, cheese-ridden pile of bushwah I've even had the displeasure of picking up. Perhaps Kuralt has an indefinable quality that somehow brings some authenticity to the words that are printed on these pages, but the material itself is just terrible.I was reminded of a Simpson's episode in which Bart Simpson wins admiration from everyone by peddling schmaltzy \\"human interest\\" stories on a children's news program they've started. Now, the fact that I watch Simpson's and am criticizing Kuralt may be indicative of a generation gap that is the root of the problem, but I don't see how anyone of any age could give credence to the heavy-handed moralism that Kuralt trots out, not just occasionally, but in virtually every single segment.A truly do appreciate the value of nuanced, small town life and the individuals who dare to go against the grain in some way. But is it necessary to spotlight someone who has given their nine children rhyming names (Terry, Sherry, Jerry, etc.)?There's something about Kuralt's line that seems insincere. Clearly, at times, he's stretching to find greater meaning in something that is maybe a little interesting, but ultimately meaningless. This leads me to think that all of it is insincere, that Kuralt is going to find the cuteness and greater meaning in everything, truth be damned. Even aside from the heavy-handed schmaltziness, it seems like a lot of the people portrayed in this feature are being capitalized on. Some of the people will certainly be ridiculed by most of the viewers; at any rate, they have had their quirky individuality processed and used for the very corporate interests that they flout.If you are a fan of Charles Kuralt, I think that the tv segments that you fell in love with should probably be where your love affair ends. Kuralt may be a winning personality and a good salesman; if that's true, I recommend that you stick with the news broadcasts, where you can enjoy him as he grew famous: a little bit at a time."},{"Title":"Reader's Digest Condensed Books Volume 5","review":"Since you give no details about this book, let me help.

I am not a scientist, and I was able to follow how he came to his conclusions. If you are as mystified by the crop cricles as I was, I think you will also be delighted with the discoveries in this book, and as astounded and fascinated as I was. I can't believe that I'm the first person to review this book. This is information that people really need to have! Aren't others reading this?? You should be! The implications are staggering.I personally talked with his publisher about a year ago, when I ordered the book, and was informed that Doug Ruby was working on an accompanying video. I want to encourage more people to read this book to encourage the author to release this video. Once you read this book, you will want to see that video!"},{"Title":"The Gift : The Crop Circles Deciphered","review":"The Gift is a thought-provoking examination of the phenomenon of &quot;crop circles&quot; (glyphs or pictograms). By employing a novel and creative approach to understanding these images (derived from &quot;common sense and intuition&quot;), Ruby extrapolates from the two-dimensional glyphs three-dimensional models, with eye-popping results. Ruby concludes from his research that the pictograms originate from extraterrestrial entities. He believes the sequence of the appearance of these images are building blocks to man's understanding of messages. These messages have begun with a description of UFO's physical structure and propulsion systems. These glyphs provide ever-more information as they progress in complexity.Whether Ruby's &quot;decoding&quot; is correct or not, it is facile to dismiss the reality of a true mystery. It is certainly correct that many of these &quot;circles&quot; are hoaxes. There was even a &quot;crop circle making&quot; competition in England. However, research by scientists like Charles Levengood and Nancy Talbott have shown empirically that &quot;real&quot; crop circles show changes at the cellular level (which can be replicated by short, intense bursts of microwave energy). There is also no breakage of the stalks of the plants, only bending. This cannot be done by hoaxers. Aside from that, the notion that two English geezers and copycats are creating thousands of such glyphs worldwide, showing complex fractal geometry patterns, and leaving no trace of their presence, is ridiculous. The recent (Aug.01) Chilbolton, England glyphs will sorely test the hoax hypothesis. Carl Sagan offered his biased, mechanistic view, conveniently ignoring that which did not fit; Jim Schnabel ('Dark White')seems to be more of a debunker than an open-minded skeptic. Both provide a convenient out for those who prefer their ordered and safe world view. If you aren't afraid to consider other possibilities, however, this work will deliver."},{"Title":"The Gift : The Crop Circles Deciphered","review":"I heartily recommend this interesting book, which presents a refreshingly different perspective. As for the reviewer promoting Jim Schnabel's 'Round in Circles' as a solution to the mystery, it would be foolish indeed to jump to the conclusion that a known CIA agent is going to present the public with unadorned facts, given that government disinformation on this subject, media manipulation, and the 'Firm's role in it, is already well documented."},{"Title":"The Gift : The Crop Circles Deciphered","review":"Boy, did I love this book! This was the first crop circle book that I've read (among many) that skipped past the pedestrian \\"are they real?\\" and \\"how are they made?\\" questions and delved directly into the MESSAGE that the glyphs are attempting to convey. Ruby stumbled upon a new truth, in that many of the circles are actually diagrams and sets of instructions to explain certain scientific truths of the Circlemakers, including the shape of their ships, their power source, and the reasons why their ships are able to move in such amazing ways. I was completely intrigued, and I recommend this book to ANY person interested in Crop Circle phenomena. The crop circles are meant to be SPUN and analyzed at a much deeper level.That said, I must say that I did disagree slightly with some of Ruby's analysis of certain formations, and I felt that a couple of the models that he created were only partially complete. However, this guy is REALLY on to something, and I devoured this book and enjoyed every moment of it. If only he had continued his work, we might be much farther along in our global understanding of the messages.If you want to know what the circle makers are trying to convey to us, instead of wondering whether a couple of drunken Irishmen with no understanding of geometry could have created such astonishing formations, then this book is for YOU. I wish it had been 500 pages! Regardless of the brevity of the book, I suspect that a new generation of circle researchers will stumble upon this groundbreaking tome and become inspired with a bevy of new possibilities, new insights, and new understandings into the greatest mystery of the 21st century. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Gift : The Crop Circles Deciphered","review":"Even if you dont believe in aliens or crop circles it is hard to ignore the math behind what he is saying. whether its true or not doesnt matter cause the math and science of the blueprints are based on basic principals.the craft in the book would work if we had the technology to build one.I think people start this book with a bias against it and that prevents them from seeing that this is real.scientist and scholars should read this book.I only hope Doug can create a follow up book of any new things he has found. Looking forward to the video.2 guys creating a 750 long and very intricate crop circle is totally absurd.

There are interesting facts scattered throughout and clearly the authors have a love of Vermont and the places therein. But there are a few buts, and with regards to the maps is a deal breaker for me.The maps are frankly abysmal. They are the worst city and town maps anywhere without helpful things like restaurants, museums etc marked! It is annoying to have to use a second guide or additional maps because the large Vermont guide is not up to the job.I did not like the lack of a clear section on the history of Vermont, its geography, politics etc. When history is mentioned it is in a very edited format with large jumps in the timeline. I like to know the history of something when I visit it to put all into context.There is a slightly odd, slightly arbitary division of restaurants/cafes into 'dining out' and 'eating out'. It would have been more helpful to just divide places by cost of meal like every other guide in the known universe.Ultimately I cannot say that there is a better Vermont guide out there as I did not use any other. However I would be amazed if there is not a guide with better maps. Suffice to say I will be wary before using an Explorer guide again."},{"Title":"Vermont: An Explorer's Guide","review":"We used this book this summer to travel throughout Vermont.

It's a good \\"where to sleep, where to eat, where to shop\\" book, but the historic and cultural contexts that make the Maine guide so good are largely lacking here. You'll need a companion volume of Vermont history to get the most out of your trip. This book won't be enough.The maps are totally inadequate.

That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love this story. It is full of meaning and lessons. I recenly re-read it for about the tenth time and enjoyed it as much now as when I was a youngster - decades ago. I highly recommend this classic book.Check out my newest thriller - Bound by Birth - by Randall R WheelerBound By Birth"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What a delightful book! Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age. One cannot help but see one's own portrait in the depiction of young Dorian Gray.I found the writing of the book to be fantastic. Great dialogue and monologues with the British witticisms that you would expect."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"So you want to remain eternally young? This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"a classic literary staple of the modern world! a must read for any intellectual. every sentence is brimming with stimulating ideas and paradoxes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde seems to have written a somewhat scathing critique of late nineteenth century English life, or at least that of the upper class. The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story in itself was great, I loved it! However, Wilde's use of excess pronouns could tend to confuse a reader.

Oscar Wilde incorporates conventional defeating human dispositions such as superficiality, idolatry, and obsession into an astonishing tale of the life of a young man conflicted between morality and a hedonistic culture. The storyline is dynamic and captivating while the words play smooth and melodious. &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is thought-provoking and certain to interest a variety of readers. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book on a whim at a local bookstore knowing little to nothing about Oscar Wilde. This story kept me entranced the entire time. I, like Basil, was completely infautated with Dorian Gray from the moment his name was annouced. A beautiful boy completely unspoiled by the darkness in the world. A boy immeressed in the decendance of his times. When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face. A Picture of Dorian Gray is now one of my most favorite books of all time. If only Wilde had written more than one novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was shunned by the public after publishing The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a beautifully written book and is as much a work of art as an elegantly painted portrait.Centered around the vain and young Dorian Gray, it tells the price one pays for eternal youth and gives a new dimension to the human soul. As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought. Then a shadow from his young past creeps back into his life and makes Dorian's life even more frighteningOscar Wilde's novel is a magnificent read and explores the issue and thoughts surrounding man's soul. How tarnished it becomes if we live a bad life, etcetera.I recommended anyone to read this Wilde masterpiece. You do not have to like horror to enjoy it. Any lover of a well written book would also fall for this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart? This story gets to the bottom of that question and takes you on a journey ending with a surprise. Dorian Gray is the perfect main character. You will love him, dislike him, loathe him and then pity him. Just as relevant 100 years after it was penned."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though this book was well written, Oscar Wilde fails in his attempt to glorify aestheticism, and in fact condemns it, and thus condemns himself. It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it hadescaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to dowith their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.Dorian is very pretty..Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and prettyand men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.What happened in that time span is not told.Dorian is pretty.There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.Even Dorian, who is very pretty. We do not not know him, or the painter and have only a glimpse of the life of thethird main character in the book. He thinks Dorian is pretty too.*****************Spoiler Alert*****************I guessed the end about 1/3rd of the way through, I only missed that I figured Dorian (he, who is pretty) would torch the painting insteadof stabbing it.*****************End Spoiler Alert*****************I'm sure all the world is aflutter because of the daring topics discussed, or not discussed as it wasn't in this book. For its time period, I guessit would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could savethis travesty of words. I wasted enough time with these pathetic characters (and author) although I think Dorian is still very pretty according to everyone.I'm only glad I read it on my Kindle so a tree didn't die in printing this boring book.

While full of wonderful quotes that sound great over a dinner discussion, a noteworthy tale this is not. Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares?? Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"sdfj dsljf asdfjksl sadf lsdjf al asdl sjdsl flasdf fl. fsdjls,..f lf fdjfdsl. dsdfjs.. eoweoiwiew wwed vfrd vmri riejkfn fkjei fjf"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Okay when I bought this book I was leery because I thought it would be too scary.

I found myself constantly amazed that someone from Wilde's time could have had such clarity of thought on certain topics. I've never seen the movie made from this but I saw some movie posters. So it was hard taking the horror look and putting that in this book. It is more of a twisted coming of age story and not even one that gets too deep. Lord Henry has deeper moments of speech then Dorian. And as shocking as they said this book would be...I read nothing shocking. I thought maybe the unedited version would actually have a sex scene in it lol but they don't even mention a naughty body part lol. Nothing ever gets remotely sexual. I mean several characters are definitely gay but not in a shocking way. More like Jack McFarlan on Will and Grace.

When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle. I would love your suggestions and comments.

I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.)

Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now.

Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. It is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French Decadents--a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction...\\" (How I'd LOVE to get such a review for one of my wee books!)

It is now a classic of supernatural fiction, and I think it has been in-print ever since its first book appearance, or shortly afterward when Robert Ross worked so diligently to bring Wilde's works back into print. This is a beautiful and definitive edition."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" provides a cautionary tale about the dogmatic pursuit of youth and beauty at the cost of one's own soul. Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good classic read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Gray is a beautiful young man who after seeing his portrait wishes that the painting ages rather than his own face. Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had heard speak of The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I must admit I did not expect the depth and clarity of thought, the utter honesty to be found in this short novel.

Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you didn't read this book, do it. Even if you watched the movies and didn't like them, or particularly if you didn't like the movies. As always Oscar Wilde shows here a great talent to analyze human society and behavior, creating an extremely interesting book in the process."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Everyone should read this book. What interesting ideas and philosophy are presented! It is not your average battle between good and evil - this is a pained battle. The protagonist does not behave like any usual protagonist - good, pure, lovely. You're not quite sure who you're rooting for throughout the book an the ending seems both just, unjust, mercuful, and harsh. What a book. Really makes you think."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In the mid 70s I watched a two part mini series based on this book. The book is far better because Mr. Wilde is able to whisk you away to Victorian England and give you a sense what that time and place was like."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I chose this rating because I was fully absorbed in this book. The words were beautifully written and it reminded me of how society hasn't really changed. K"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Excellent book! A classic.

Still in the process of reading it, I want to enjoy every page so I am taking my time with this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. The depth and level of realism that Wilde is able to infuse into the characters is almost unbelievable. Addtionally, I am so enamored by this book because of the timelessness of the theme of societal pretense. This is a classic that one should truly make time to read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important. The Picture of Dorian Grey deserves its classic status, and Oscar Wilde actually was a bit of a genius."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'd heard a lot about Wilde when I started this book, but this was the first of his works that I'd ever read. I was half-way expecting long, incomprehensible philosophical discussions, impossible to decipher passages...my stereotype of 19th century literature. But when I was through the first chapter, I had a wake-up call. &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, &quot;this is really GOOD!&quot; I became addicted, and sped through the rest of the book. It is engrossing, absorbing, entertaining, and not the least bit boring. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel provides a fascinating story on a young man's desire to keep his appearance while having his age expressed and progressed in a portrait of himself. The story not only has a good plot, it has a strong philosophical foundation which is characterized through numerous epigrams. Among the characters, Dorian Gray and Lord Henry present various explanations throughout life. I have read this book as an assignment for preparation toward the AP [Advance Placement] test in English Literature and enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who, not only would like to prepare for an AP test in English, but to those who appreciate philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As Wilde's only novel, it does have it's slow spots. However, the genius of the writing is in the dialogue (as is generally true of Wilde). The depth of the ideas discussed is often overlooked by the simple way in which they are presented.Dorian's example forces us to examine our own lives and face the unmistakable truth: the choices we make everyday determine the state of our souls."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's novel takes us through the dangers and temptations of hedonism. It is a fantastic psychological adventure."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Besides the clever fiction and vivid details that draws you in deep, this book brings out the shame of humanity and puts it on display so elegantly.

It was actually why I decided to read it.If you expect exploits as in the movies, where he uses his ability and all that, then you'll regret it.It's a good story about a man who realises what morality is and how to live with it, or not live with it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I heard of the movie first because I'm a Fan of Ben Barnes before I found the book. I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting. Colin forth and Ben Barnes were fabulous! The movie is lush, exhilarating and extremely sexy!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A fascinating look into the human ego and basic selfishness,this story could as easily have been written regarding our society as that of 1890s England.

Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey. Even as an adult, I'm grateful to have experienced a healthy dose of Shakespeare, prior to microscopically examining the minutia of a deeply troubled mind preoccupied with male beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I started out disliking this book: too much silliness, not enough serious message. However, as time progressed, it turned out that the silliness (often shown in people's favorite quotes) is froth, and the body underneath is substantial: good, evil, innocence, and corruption. Wilde is a sublime genius at meshing the two levels in one work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this was a well written book but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who wants a relaxing read. If you like well written novels that have an almost disturbing sense to it then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Art for art's sake? Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics. Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget. The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation. Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\". To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life. Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world. Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions. Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\" This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul.

One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde. This particular book is the Bible of the Infinitely Quotable Strokes of Verbal Genius. My personal fave: &quot;Cigarettes are the perfect form of the perfect pleasure. They are exquisite and they leave one unsatisfied. What more could one want?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me. The writing style took more than just a little getting used to, but overall it is a classic tale that was a lot of fun to read. Not sure I'll do much more Oscar Wilde, but I'm glad to have read this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The main thing I have to say about Dorian Gray is--if you haven't read it, do so. Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie based on the other reviews, and found it to be a good read. Although the ending was a little predictable, I enjoyed the book overall and have recommended it to several friends. I received my Kindle as a Christmas gift and didn't even realize there were freebie books to be downloaded. I'm even more pleased with the quality of the freebies available."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Perhaps I'm jaded by modern science fiction conventions (ala The Twilight Zone), but I felt Dorian Gray ended predictably. Given a magical portrait that protects the subject from the consequences of immorality, Rod Sterling would have ended it the same way.Still reading through a contemporary lens, Dorian Gray provides rich imagery of life in the 19th century. Wilde disadvantages this strength of the novel by exhaustively listing image after image while Dorian immerses himself in sensory experience. These passages read like mildly interesting dictionary entries.Overall, the pithy dialogue, imagery and wonderfully gothic story wins out and Grey entertains."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Initially heavy on witty dialogue and light on plot, but it gets there in the second half and is a clever story. You can't flick between chapters as you can with other Kindle publications."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it. This is nineteenth century literature at its finest."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving.

It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \\"off the rails\\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First published in 1890, Oscar Wilde's now classic novel is a meditation on decadence, art and morality. At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century. However, for those who want to fully understand the commonly referenced trope of \\"Dorian Gray's portrait,\\" nothing serves bettern than the source."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book because it was a bookclub read. I aways wanted to read this book, and glad that I did, but it was a little bit of struggle at times not to set it down and forget about it. I don't know why but it never seemed to catch my full attention like it did with other people, and I found the story to be slow in spots. I am happy that I read the book and I did find it to be a good story and plot overall. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read the classics."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I really have no idea why \\"Illustrated\\" is included in the title of this work. The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \\"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \\"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \\"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \\"the end of the century\\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO-"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a English summer project for my daughter in school. She really enjoyed it.

The book was overly descriptive in some instances that lead to me envisioning the story exactly as the author had seen it instead of leaving a lot of it up to my imagination. This is not a problem when reading a non-fiction book but when it comes to fiction, I feel it is a hindrance to my ability to enjoy the book.

I've contented myself with providing you a list of epigrams contained in the book I found especially wisdom-filled or humorous:\\"The moments were lost in vulgar details. It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away.\\"\\"...to be highly organised is, I should fancy, the object of man's existence.\\"\\"'To be good is to be in harmony with one's self. Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.'\\"\\"'There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating -- people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.'\\"\\"There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love.\\"\\"'...there is a fatality about good resolutions -- that they are always made too late.'\\"\\"Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives.\\"\\"But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail.\\"\\"When a woman marries again it is because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.\\"\\"I like men who have a future and women who have a past.\\"\\"She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness.\\"\\"It is said passion makes one think in a circle.\\"\\"'All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.' 'What is that?' 'Disillusion.'\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a very interesting story by the immensely quotable Wilde. It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake. One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When asked to pick a favorite passage from a book, a lot of people will choose a vivid description. These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you have never read an Oscar Wilde book, read this one. It is easy to read, entertaining and throughly enjoyable. The language doesn't trip you up. I have enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love.

Sadly, perhaps it will be even more so in 100 more years hense.These are powerful reasons to read and enjoy Wilds only full length novel. Besides the wit and satire that can be enjoyed for the sake of humor, the book screams out to each of us, to live for pleasure or wisdom.This is one of the choices Wilde plays with in many of his works, and this is one of the best to understand and think about.I can't imagine someone who has not read this book, but if you have not, and you are hear today, then its time to do so.

When reading about such characters such as Lord Henry for instance, you can only admit that you are being worked by the words and charms of a great novelist. It is sad that this is the only full novel Oscar Wilde ever did.(he did do a fair amount of plays, short stories, and essays however). After reading it, you will find yourself quoting it for a good while. And the plot device used is one of the better one's in all of fiction. I must say I plan on re-reading this one, the language, the wit, and the overall story that Wilde creates is very alluring and worthy of all the praise you might hear about it.Pick it up, read it, love it, and then recommend it to all of your friends."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After a few months of cajoling, my parents finally convinced me to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde. Actually, part of what motivated me was not my parents' persistant pestering (and occasionally threatening), but the fact that Oscar Wilde is the favorite author of the lead singer from my favorite out-of-date band, The Smiths (Morrissey, yes).But anyway, to the book. When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have seen the old movie several times, and it tempted me to order the book. Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront.

It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through. Lots of old English and lots of footnotes describing what the words or phrases meant. I struggled through about 3/4 of the book, but then it picked up and I managed to get it read. In the end, it was worth the time and effort but does take some patience to get through. Not for everyone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It makes one think what would happen if one were to remain young/immortal. Part of our lives revolve around aging, preparing for that, and what have you, while Dorian doesn't have to. It's really interesting to see how his inside goes on decline while his outer self remains young. It's overall a good read, and I'd recommend this to anyone who is in need of a good, classic read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was difficult to read at first. I accept that the great ones always take a while to hook you as they build the characters. It has been a while since I read this book and yet much of it is fresh in my mind. Not a beach read. It's too deep. A story like no other I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While this is Oscar Wilde's only foray into novel-writing, I must say it is justifiably called a classic. The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots. Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, \`this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'\`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, \`but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?' Lord Henry responded. He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. \`I was referring to my Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a true classic that should be read by everyone. It may be fiction, but truth lies within the pages of this book. Oscar Wilde has painted a truly perfect representation of the human species with his character Dorian Gray. A character so full of life that you can't help but be drawn into the book. I was unable to put it down after reading the first page!When you open this book, you are not just reading a story, you are looking into a mirror. You see yourself in Dorian Gray's position as he goes through his trials and tribulations. Regardless of who you are, everyone feels and, at some point, thinks along the line's of Dorian Gray. For some, they may have even traveled down a similar path. It is for this reason that Oscar Wilde was able to create such a realistic character. He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius. I believe that this book should be part of the required reading material in some age appropriate schools. I doubt that it will, but I feel the character of Dorian Gray and his 'life' would be an eye opener for many.I highly recommend this book to anyone even vaguely curious about it. I honestly cannot understand why this has a single bad rating! If your still not sure after reading the reviews, check with your local library about borrowing it. If you like it, then buy it and save it to read for later. I've re-read mine several times now and have yet to grow bored or tired of it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is absurdly good-looking. Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read quite a lot and I have not been so entranced by a book in a very long time.

If you're a connoisseur of literature it's mandatory, and if you're not, it's highly recommendable.It tells of the life of Dorian Gray, who, upon meeting Basil Hallward (his painter's) friend Sir Henry Wotton, begins to fret over the ephemerality of his youth, and makes an involuntary wish for...Well I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll leave that out.

For one it is an easy read, it can be enjoyed whether you are sitting at home or travelling. In another it is thought provoking, you could pull about two hundred quotes out of it and apply them to your daily life (and I'm not exaggerating). And lastly, the story line is gripping.If you're approaching this after experiencing Wilde's plays then I should warn you, there is no comedy here, in fact there is barely even a resemblance to the tone of his plays (although some of the dialogue is fairly similar).Either way, this is a damn good read and I certainly recommend it.If you're interested in gothic literature, this is highly, highly recommended, as are the above titles."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story is pretty standard.

Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is one of the most elegant novels in the Gothic canon; that it is also one of the most sinister is hardly surprising given Oscar Wilde's curious aptitude for tempering the macabre with the sensuous and the frivolous with the fatalistic.A considerable scandal upon its publication in the early 1890s, the novel still reads as slightly homoerotic, even if only in the most clandestine and aphotic of ways. Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice. I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism. He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow.

I'm a fan of Oscar Wilde, and I could'ntmiss this great classical novel. The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book.

You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This free classic version for my Kindle was very good!

A good friend of his paints his portrait. Dorian Gray sees it and makes a wish not possible - to stay youthful forever. He doesn't grow old but the picture of him does, in the most awful and frightening ways.Dorian shows his friend who painted the picture how it has changed - his friend reaches for a knife and charges at the picture. Dorian restrains his companion and kills him with the knife. Dorian grows more and more evil as the picture grows from awful to hideous.

Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale.

Dorian Grey is one of the most bizarre charecters in literature. I guess we all have a little bit of Dorian Grey in us at times, hopefully in small doses.

The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

Certainly, it is dated insofar as many other Edwardian novels out of Nineteenth Century England seem trite and shallow (faring badly with what was coming out of Russia at the time: Gripping, universal, human stories from titanic authors like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy). But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years. That is to say, when one thinks of &quot;Twilight Zone-esque&quot; writing one is put in mind of Kafka, Borges or Grabriel Garcia-Marquez. The best in World Literature.

The book builds up beautifully towards the climax. Wilde's generates idle irreverent amoral and bitingly sarcastic dialogue as if out of thin air."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a masterpiece of English literature from the 1800's. It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual.

After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"&quot;Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist...&quot; says Oscar Wilde's Basil Hallward - and every book is the author's autobiography. Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THis book is not only about \\"The Picture Of Dorian Gray\\" but it is a few short stories by Oscar Wilde. His intellectual prowess not only perceives him as a mystical thriller but between the lines you can see the seductive yet fanatical characters he enlists. Before Stephen King his writing is considered fascinating and is still to this day one of the premier writers of history. Though his stories are not too long they embark on psychological journeys you won't want to miss.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray.

He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time. I find the book to be well writen, a great add (or like me a great beginning) to your classic collection."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oh what sinister fun! A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is the question I kept asking myself as I read through Oscar Wilde's book. The narrative is characteristic of the author's flamboyant nature and readers will find certain descriptions a little uncanny. Overall, this is an interesting story, written with purpose and to me this was the most important thing. Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty? The best answer to this question is a quote from Thomas Wolfe: \\"The surest cure for vanity is loneliness.\\"- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A book for all time.

I'll simply ask that you please give this book a read. It's quick, it's short, it's exciting, it's thrilling, it's very well written and it's a good summer read - I promise."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture Of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is set in London, England. This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters.

He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it. However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"which is a waste of paper. What makes me say that? Could it be that the sins are too vague or too outdated? No, I judged this book based on my enjoyment or lack of enjoyment in reading it. Wit without substance, characters without passion, dialogue without reason. I found myself reading other books just so I had an excuse not to continue reading this one. In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me. 177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'. The only reason I finished was because I hate to start a book then walk away and also I wanted to do review (and to do a review without finishing the book is unfair)."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book some time ago for a book club, and we all thought it was a total snooze.

I feel that Oscar Wilde used this as a semi-autobiographical vehicle to transport his radical, eccentric ideas and ideals. He speaks through his characters of Lord Henry and Dorian Gray. They seek to justify debauchery and murder and they kill off anyone who is good, kind, moral or differs in opinion with them. A good read, perhaps, for the likes of the 42nd president of the USA.

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Who knows? But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent. The lukewarm will simply be confused."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions. The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times. Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me. I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery. Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, a story of morals, psychology and poetic justice, has furnished Oscar Wilde with the status of a classical writer. It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life. Despite this, the book is laced with the right amounts of the author's perpetual jaunty wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books of all time. This is breath-takingly honest look at life when the physical is all we look at...and many of us do.From the brilliant quotes to the numerous times when Dorian Gray proves what a scoundrel he is, this book makes any reader think and enjoy their own lives much more to see what that type of thinking causes. Here is a man who looks lke a Greek God and he takes everything for granted because he knows his powers will never allow his looks to be tarnished. Then he loses his sanity and actually commits murder on his artis who painted him and then does himself in!Not only brilliant, but pretty funny, too!Check out this book! It's a once in a lifetime experience!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Appropriately, I read this book while travelling the dark, sombre tube system in London.

Wilde uses such beautiful, concise and clear language to convey his own version of the Faustian legend.The subject matter is troubling to some but one cannot deny the quality of the art."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book at times appears to be a sequence of Wilde's best one-liners, intersperced with narrative. Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function E(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",C,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",M,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const P=d(x,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-80197e3f"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/52.md","filePath":"quotesmag/52.md"}'),B={name:"quotesmag/52.md"},O=Object.assign(B,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{G as __pageData,O as default};
