Situating her work around the intersecting publications of Daniel Bell's The End of Ideology (1960) and J.D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey (1961), Laurie Rodrigues argues that American novels express this paradox through nuanced applications of non-realist strategies, distorting realism in manners similar to ideology's distortions of reality, history, and belief. Reflecting the astonishing cultural variety of this period, The American Novel After Ideology, 1961 - 2000 examines Franny and Zooey, Carlene Hatcher Polite's The Flagellants (1967), Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead (1991), and Philip Roth's The Human Stain (2001) alongside the various discussions around ideology with which they intersect. Each novel's plotless narratives, dissolving subjectivities, and cultural codes organize the texts' peculiar relations to the post-ideological age, suggesting an aesthetic return of the repressed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SswAEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Successful Problem Solving","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yBhnDQAAQBAJ&dq=Successful+Problem+Solving&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Paintings of Paul Cezanne: A Catalogue Raisonne (2 Volumes)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zWwzXwAACAAJ&dq=The+Paintings+of+Paul+Cezanne:+A+Catalogue+Raisonne+(2+Volumes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Santa's Crash-Bang Christmas","description":"A succession of annoyances causes Santa to wish he were at home rather than on his Christmas Eve journey.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YObNAAAACAAJ&dq=Santa%27s+Crash-Bang+Christmas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Le Secret De LA Salamandre (French Edition)","description":"The increasing popularity of bande dessinee, or French-language comic strip, means that it is being established on university syllabuses worldwide. Reading Bande Dessinee provides a thorough introduction to the medium and in-depth critical analysis with focus on contemporary examples of the art form, historical context, key artists, and themes such as gender, autobiography and postcolonial culture. Miller's groundbreaking book demonstrates exactly why bande dessinee is considered to be a visual narrative art form and encourages the reader to appreciate and understand it to the best of their abilities. Miller also provides the terminology, framework and tools necessary for study, highly relevant to current curriculum and she creates a multi-disciplinary, comprehensive approach to the subject matter. Reading Bande Dessinee draws from analytical viewpoints such as narratology, cultural studies and gender studies to illuminate the form fully, examining how it can be seen to undermine mythologies of national and cultural identity, investigating the satirical possibilities and looking at how the comic strip may contest normative representations of the body according to gender theories. This volume explores the controversy surrounding the comic strips in contemporary French society and traces the historical and cultural implications surrounding the legitimization of bande dessinee. With the growing academic readership of bande dessinee this book proves to be an invaluable analysis for scholars of the postmodern narrative art. Reading Bande Dessinee is also an essential resource for anyone interested in the cultural context, visual and narrative meaning and intricacies of the art form.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=V7urDwAAQBAJ&dq=Le+Secret+De+LA+Salamandre+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside Western Union,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DqODMwAACAAJ&dq=Inside+Western+Union,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Picture for Harold's Room","description":"From the treasured author of Harold and the Purple Crayon, Crockett Johnson, comes an I Can Read adventure for Harold and his magical purple crayon.

For several decades after the Civil War, they were hunted by hundreds who supposed them to be involved in every bank and train robbery in the Midwest. Trained as guerrilla fighters in the border conflict between Kansas and Missouri, they joined with the Younger brothers in February 1866 to rob a bank in Liberty, Missouri. That was the beginning of a criminal confederation that seemed beyond the reach of the law until the Northfield, Minnesota, raid killed three of them and sent the James brothers into hiding. But they were the objects of posted rewards that proved too tempting in Jesse's case: in 1882 he was shot in the back by Robert Ford of his own gang. The Rise and Fall of Jesse James, by Robertus Love, a newspaperman who knew Frank James, is a pioneering work that plumbs the personalities of the outlaws, looks at their domestic lives, cites many stories about them, and attempts to separate fact from legend in tracking their violent operations. Michael Fellman assesses Love's 1926 book in his introduction to this Bison Books edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vXBZyr3tg94C&dq=The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Jesse+James&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"365 Ways To Checkmate","description":"Tactics based on checkmate ideas against the enemy king decide a large proportion of chess games, so it is vital to be alert to these possibilities when they occur.

The market system has, since the eighteenth century, brought enormous gains in living standards, in contradiction to the Marxist theories that predicted capitalism's collapse. The institution of property rights has facilitated trade and investment, whilst the price mechanism has enabled people to benefit from dispersed knowledge about individual preferences. Yet politicians, needing to win votes in the short-term, have largely failed to recognise the benefits of a market system with the minimum of government intervention. The development of the welfare state has been disastrous, almost destroying the voluntary provision of health and education, whilst creating institutions that serve producer interests at the expense of consumers. Seldon's message is clear; if capitalism is to yield its best results the political process must be confined to the minimal duties of the state. This condensed version of Capitalism includes a foreword by the late Milton Friedman, an introduction by John Blundell and Philip Booth, and commentaries by James Bartholomew and D.R. Myddelton.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yrgJd9gAiZMC&dq=Virtues+of+Capitalism,+The+(Collected+Works+of+Arthur+Seldon,+The)+(v.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edgar Huntly: Or, Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker","description":"One of the first American Gothic novels, Edgar Huntly (1787) mirrors the social and political temperaments of the postrevolutionary United States.

Michael Lee Lanning, board a Greyhound bus that would take him to a military flight scheduled to deposit him in Vietnam. As he boarded the bus, Lee told her, \\"It s only for a year.\\" Moore-Lanning struggled to believe her husband s words. Waiting: One Wife s Year of the Vietnam War is the deeply personal account of Moore-Lanning s year as a waiting wife. The first-ever book from the perspective of a wife on the home front during the Vietnam War, Moore-Lanning s telling is both unflinching in its honesty and universal in its evocation of the price exacted from those who were left behind. During her \\"waiting year,\\" Moore-Lanning traveled far, in both distance and perspective, from the small West Texas town of Roby where she had grown up and met her husband. Through her eyes, we experience the agony of waiting for the next letter from Lee; the exhilaration of learning of her pregnancy; the frustration of dealing with friends and family members who didn t understand her struggles; and the solace of companionship with Susan Hargrove, another waiting wife. Because of her insistence that Lee give her an honest account of his experiences, Moore-Lanning also affords readers a gut-wrenching view of Vietnam as narrated by an infantry commander in the field. Unfolding with the gripping narrative of a novel, Waiting will captivate general readers, while those interested in military history and home front perspectives especially from the Vietnam War will deeply appreciate this impressive addition to the literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6TiCHhLZufsC&dq=A+Personal+War+in+Vietnam+(Williams-Ford+Texas+A&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Poison Tree A True Story of Family Violence and Revenge","description":"This account of the events that led teenager Richard Jahnke and his sister Deborah to murder their father is also an in-depth investigation of the problems of child abuse","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yLNIAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Poison+Tree+A+True+Story+of+Family+Violence+and+Revenge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simon Pure","description":"The Broadview Anthology of Drama: Plays from the Western Theatre is a chronological presentation of 43 plays in two volumes, ranging from the ancient theatre world to the present day.

First published in 1986 by Airlife, its publishing history has seen a great number of glowing reviews generated, coming from both historians and participants in the proceedings that the author so eloquently relays.??The book charts Crosley's service career in the Fleet Air Arm during the entire period of the Second World War. Part of his service saw him in action aboard HMS Eagle, flying Sea Hurricanes on the Harpoon and Pedestal Malta convoys of June and August 1942. It was during this time that he shot down his first enemy aircraft and survived the dramatic sinking of HMS Eagle. From there he graduated on to Seafires, (the Naval equivalent of the Spitfire), and flew this type in Combat Air Patrols over Norway and ramrod strikes from Operation Torch (the invasion of French North Africa in November 1942), through to D-Day in June 1944 in the European Theatre of Operations, and then in the Pacific abroad HMS Implacable as part of the British Pacific Fleet in 1945 until the end of the Pacific War, by which time he had command of his own combined squadron, 801 and 880.??The narrative is well written in a frank and often scathingly critical way of Fleet Air Arm operations during the Second World War and beyond. The book looks set to bring the endeavours of Crosley to a whole new generation of enthusiasts, and it should appeal across the board to fans of aviation, naval history and families and friends of Armed Forces, past and present.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SGBtBQAAQBAJ&dq=Sea+Fire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations (Star Trek: S.C.E.)","description":"The first full-length novel starring the Starfleet Corps of Engineers!

The tales tell of toil, tragedy and triumph; their message is of hope, faith and service to America. For older readers, it is a nostalgic look back to the early twentieth century as perceived by an immigrant boy growing up in New York City. For younger readers, it should prove an inspiring and educational experience. The author says, \\"to those who know what gonnif means, I know you'll enjoy this book. To those who don't know what it means, it is partly for you that I wrote it -- and you'll probably enjoy it all the more. It amazes me that so little is known of the times and events I write about and, especially, how little is known of the Jewish people outside of New York or Hollywood. I hope this book will help.\\" This history of sort is not intended as a doctoral or academic literary treatise, but told in easy to read, everyday language (with a Bronx accent) as the lives of the characters are woven into the history of the times: It portrays members of a certain family, caught up in the maelstrom of the great depression, and how they fought and survived. Its recipe is a mix of \\"Ragtime\\", \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" and perhaps \\"Angela's Ashes\\" -- spiced with a tender love story . . . and though it has a Jewish flavor, its appeal is universal. An early reviewer has critiqued it as \\". . . charming and touching -- romantic and flowery . . . shows a good deal of warmth, understanding and the human touch . . . there is strong character development and quirky charm shown here.\\" In addition to the excerpts that appear here, the first 7 pages or 1 1/2 chapters appears on the author s web page at emnolbay (and contains photographs from the book). . . .

Must a Bible writer be original, and must his writings agree in every detail with every other Bible writer in order to be inspired? These and other questions are dealt with in this book. The author does an in-depth analysis of the way Luke wrote his Gospel, and from it draws certain logical conclusions with respect to the way God inspired the Bible writers.

Managing Volunteers in Tourism reviews the latest research to highlight the key management issues and relate them to the tourism volunteering context. It includes previously under-researched forms of tourism volunteering such as meet-and-greeters, surf life-savers, conservation, festival, and information centre volunteers and volunTourists. The book develops through three distinct sections, the first of which begins by introducing the concept of volunteering and considering the variety of volunteer forms and settings within tourism. The next part picks up the organisational approach and examines volunteer program design and planning, volunteer motivation, recruitment and selection, training and development, reward and retention, and diversity management. The final part consists of ten case studies from leading international researchers and practitioners identifying best practice and key management challenges. Real-life examples and case studies throughout this book provide an in-depth examination of the challenges facing those managing tourism volunteers, making this book indispensible for current and future managers in the tourism industry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=R7YESV7GrZoC&dq=The+Volunteers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extraordinary Short Story Writing (F.W.

Rebel Barons writes the history of this ambivalence, which was especially acute in England, France, and Italy in the twelfth to fifteenth centuries, when the modern ideology of sovereignty, arguing for monopolies on justice and the legitimate use of violence, was developed. Sovereign powers asserted themselves militarily and economically provoking complex phenomena of resistance by aristocrats. This volume argues that the chansons de geste, the key genre for disseminating models of violent noble opposition to sovereigns, offer a powerful way of understanding acts of resistance. Traditionally seen as France's epic literary monuments - the Chanson de Roland is often presented as foundational of French literature - chansons de geste in fact come from areas antagonistic to France, such as Burgundy, England, Flanders, Occitania, and Italy, where they were reworked repeatedly from the twelfth century to the fifteenth and recast into prose and chronicle forms. Rebel baron narratives were the principal vehicle for aristocratic concerns about tyranny, for models of violent opposition to sovereigns and for fantasies of escape from the Carolingian world via crusade and Oriental adventures. Rebel Barons reads this corpus across its full range of historical and geographical relevance, and through changes in form, as well as placing it in dialogue with medieval political theory, to bring out the contributions of literary texts to political debates. Revealing the widespread and long-lived importance of these anti-royalist works supporting regional aristocratic rights to feud and revolt, Rebel Barons reshapes our knowledge of reactions to changing political realities at a crux period in European history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QF4vDwAAQBAJ&dq=Rebel+Baron&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doors of the Kingdom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VxESAQAAIAAJ&dq=Doors+of+the+Kingdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apple Pro Training Series: Shake 4 Quick-Reference Guide","description":"Shake 4 is a world-class compositing package, but it's also complicated.

The supply chains of supermarkets and consumer goods industries have spread ever more widely and deeply into Asia, Africa and South America, while oil, mining and financial companies, among many others, have invested heavily in countries that were previously denied to them by political or ideological barriers. While companies have seized the opportunities presented by globalisation, they have in many cases been completely unprepared for the risks presented by their headlong rush into these new markets. Companies have found themselves and their business partners operating in countries where corruption, injustice, internal conflict and human rights violations are rife. An increasingly alert and critical world has acted as watchdog, highlighting corporate malpractice and the links between corporations and repressive regimes. It has increasingly been argued that companies have responsibilities for the protection and promotion of human rights. These arguments are, at least to some extent, accepted by companies. Yet, despite the increasing use of human rights language in public policy discourses, the expectations of companies remain unclear. That is, what are the ethical imperatives? What are the legal expectations? How far does responsibility extend? What can companies actually do in practice? The debate is further complicated by the range of actors (companies, governments, international institutions, local communities, non-governmental organisations [NGOs], trade unions, consumers) involved; by debates around free trade versus and fair trade; by the discussion of the specific role of governments; and by questions about the relative merits of regulation and self-regulation. Business and Human Rights provides an analysis of the relationship between companies and human rights in the context of globalisation. The analysis is in two parts. The first maps the reasons (financial, ethical, regulatory) why human rights have become a business issue. However, simply because there are reasons why companies should be concerned about human rights, this does not say what companies should or could do. Therefore, the second part of the book looks at the practical experiences of companies in responding to specific human rights issues in the context of their own operations, in their supply chains and in specific countries. These case studies, many of which have not been previously published or analysed from the perspective of human rights, provide important insights into questions such as: How do companies organise themselves to respond to human rights challenges? What have the experiences been-positive and negative? How have companies responded to specific situations? What are the roles and responsibilities of other actors: government, trade unions, NGOs? What are the limits to responsibility? In this outstanding collection, Rory Sullivan has drawn together leading thinkers and actors from the debate on business and human rights, to establish how far the business and human rights debate has evolved, and explore the many complex questions around roles, responsibilities and solutions that remain to be answered.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FKo0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Embracing the Storm: Jewels for Victims of Domestic Violence","description":"Domestic violence knows no boundaries. It affects all ages, races, religions, genders and income levels. There are many women we encounter on a daily basis who are in the midst of domestic abuse. Sadly, too many of us are unaware of their plight. Coming forward is truly a brave and courageous step on behalf of the victim. The woman who has made the decision to share her terrifying secrets has already been through a wide range of emotions and thought processes before deciding to talk. Many people see one side of the abuser in public while his victim sees the other. It is the difference between knowing a person who is calm, humorous, social and pleasant, to one who the victim identifies with: a person who is mean, dangerous, and calculating. If everyone, as individuals, were to lock arms and unite hearts, we could stamp out domestic violence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3ZEHPQAACAAJ&dq=Embracing+the+Storm:+Jewels+for+Victims+of+Domestic+Violence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With Grant and Meade from the Wilderness to Appomattox","description":"The letters of Theodore Lyman, an aide-de-camp to General George Meade, offer a witty and penetrating inside view of the Civil War.

INTRODUCTION: THERE are few experiences more important in the education of a newcomer to motion pic tures than the discovery of V. I. Pudovkins Film Technique and Film Acting. No more valuable manuals of the practice and theory of film making have been written than these two handbooks by the notable Soviet director. So sound are their points of view, so valid their tenets, so revelatory their analyses, that they remain today, twenty years after their initial appear ance, the foremost books of their kind. First published abroad in 1929 and 1933 respectively, Film Technique and Film Acting brought to the art of film making a code of principles and a rationale that marked the mediums analytic coming of age. Until their publication, the motion picture maker had to eke out on his own any intellectual or artistic considera tions of film craft. No explicit body of principles existed upon which the film maker could draw with confidence. Film technique was a more or less hit or miss affair that existed in a kind of fragmentary state which, in the main, leaned heavily upon theatrical methods. These pioneering books made clear at once that movie making need no longer flounder for a methodology or for its own standards. ...","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IKbBbMxeJDEC&dq=%22+Film+technique,+%22+and,+%22+Film+acting+%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fortuens of Richard Mahony: Australia Felix / The Way Home / Ultima Thule","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BN7xzAEACAAJ&dq=The+Fortuens+of+Richard+Mahony:+Australia+Felix+/+The+Way+Home+/+Ultima+Thule&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oregon's Salty Coast","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bGTmAQAACAAJ&dq=Oregon%27s+Salty+Coast&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ABC Murders","description":"Hercule Poirot's mastery of detective skills is tested by a mysterious correspondent who predicts and then executes alphabetical murders","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9EA0VsgGP84C&dq=ABC+Murders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mer-Lion","description":"Psst!

While the world sees your good works on the first mile, they see Christ s power working through you on the second. He carries the burden and takes you beyond yourself. First mile living is cramped and unsatisfying. When you stride beyond it, chains fall off and freedom ensues. True rest, fulfillment, joy, and other surprising treasures become yours when you dare to embark upon the second mile. Story Behind the Book  As a pastor in North America , I am amazed by how many Christians struggle with depression, anxiety, and stress. The burdens of life overwhelm them, and they pull back from serving the Lord, thinking they can t take any more pressure. While visiting Mozambique , I went to the home of a native pastor who also works a secular job to support his life, his church, and another mission church. I was shocked at how little he had. He was giving his all to the Lord and existing on the bare minimum. As I consider his challenges, I am struck by his contagious smile. He has taken the yoke of Jesus and learned from Him; he has found rest for his soul and lives abundantly; he is walking in the second mile. I want God s children everywhere to know the same joy and privilege that comes from serving God.

After some publishing successes himself in the 1890s, he developed the Stratemeyer Syndicate - a type of production factory for series books. Stratemeyer would conceive ideas for series, draft an outline for each book, and hire writers to turn the outlines into full-length manuscripts, all published under pennames. The syndicate kept between 19 and 31 series in progress until Stratemeyer's death in 1930, when his daughters assumed control, publishing over 480 books. Not all the books were popular, but by experimenting with different types of series, using timely material, and reflecting prevailing social values, Edward Stratemeyer and the Syndicate offered readers vicarious wish fulfillment.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jFBbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Edward+Stratemeyer+and+the+Stratemeyer+Syndicate+(Twayne%27s+United+States+Authors)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miasma","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=n1IHSQAACAAJ&dq=Miasma&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keepin' It Real: School Success Beyond Black and White (Transgressing Boundaries)","description":"Looks at the academic achievements of low-income African American and Hispanic students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=p5k6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Keepin%27+It+Real:+School+Success+Beyond+Black+and+White+(Transgressing+Boundaries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Homeschooling Moments and Child-Friendly Recipes: A Collection of the Unique Adventures of a Mennonite Family","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bVFkAAAACAAJ&dq=Homeschooling+Moments+and+Child-Friendly+Recipes:+A+Collection+of+the+Unique+Adventures+of+a+Mennonite+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Melissa Hayden, ballerina","description":"The complete and dramatic story of Melissa Hayden, known throughout the world as one of the great prima ballerinas.

But when we speak of culture, what, precisely, do we mean? Adam Kuper pursues the concept of culture from the early twentieth century debates to its adoption by American social science under the tutelage of Talcott Parsons. What follows is the story of how the idea fared within American anthropology, the discipline that took on culture as its special subject. Here we see the influence of such prominent thinkers as Clifford Geertz, David Schneider, Marshall Sahlins, and their successors, who represent the mainstream of American cultural anthropology in the second half of the twentieth century--the leading tradition in world anthropology in our day. These anthropologists put the idea of culture to the ultimate test--in detailed, empirical ethnographic studies--and Kuper's account shows how the results raise more questions than they answer about the possibilities and validity of cultural analysis. Written with passion and wit, Culture clarifies a crucial chapter in recent intellectual history. Adam Kuper makes the case against cultural determinism and argues that political and economic forces, social institutions, and biological processes must take their place in any complete explanation of why people think and behave as they do.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lls139Ru0lkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Door","description":"When Ed and Ann s turkey dinner burns, they think their Thanksgiving is ruined.

Why have human beings, in many different cultures and epochs, looked to nature as a source of norms for human behavior? From ancient India and ancient Greece, medieval France and Enlightenment America, up to the latest controversies over gay marriage and cloning, natural orders have been enlisted to illustrate and buttress moral orders. Revolutionaries and reactionaries alike have appealed to nature to shore up their causes. No amount of philosophical argument or political critique deters the persistent and pervasive temptation to conflate the  is  of natural orders with the  ought  of moral orders. In this short, pithy work of philosophical anthropology, Lorraine Daston asks why we continually seek moral orders in natural orders, despite so much good counsel to the contrary. She outlines three specific forms of natural order in the Western philosophical tradition specific natures, local natures, and universal natural laws and describes how each of these three natural orders has been used to define and oppose a distinctive form of the unnatural. She argues that each of these forms of the unnatural triggers equally distinctive emotions: horror, terror, and wonder. Daston proposes that human reason practiced in human bodies should command the attention of philosophers, who have traditionally yearned for a transcendent reason, valid for all species, all epochs, even all planets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=U5eWDwAAQBAJ&dq=Against+nature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Distinctive House Design and Decor of the Twenties: With Over 500 Floor Plans and Illustrations","description":"Hundreds of excellent photographs, drawings and floor plans depict landscaping, interior and exterior decor.

A fascinating meditation on what it is that makes a writer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lCIcAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Last+Leopard:+Life+of+Giuseppe+Di+Lampedusa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Programmable Logic Controllers, Sensors, and Communications: 3rd (Third) edition","description":"The third edition of Fundamentals of Programmable Logic Controllers, Sensors, and Communications retains the previous edition?s practical approach, easy-to-read writing style, and coverage of various types of industrial controllers while reflecting leading-edge technology.

Natty and trim as straight as a sapling, with few words and no gestures quite unlike those of two days, or rather nights, ago, when the cold froze them out of their blankets, and they sat around the camp-fires pounding tin cans and singing the Indian medicine song with a good Irish accent. Very funny that affair the mixture of Cheyenne and Donnybrook is a strange noise. The last stage from Custer to the railroad is thirty-five miles and a half, which we did with two relays, the latter half of it in the night. There was no escort only two orderlies and the general and I pattered along through the gloom. The clouds hung over the earth in a dense blanket, and the road was as dim as a Florentine fresco; but night nor cold nor heat can bring General Miles to a walk, and the wild charge in the dark was, as an experience, a complete thing. You cannot see; you whirl through a ca?on cut in the mud; you plough through the sage-brush and over the rocks clatter and bang. The general is certainly a grim old fellow one of the kind that make sparks fly when he strikes an obstacle. I could well believe the old Fifth Infantryman who said \\"he's put many a corn on a dough-boy's foot,\\" and it's a red-letter day for anyone else that keeps at his horse's heels. You may ride into a hole, over a precipice, to perdition, if it's your luck on this night, but is not the general in front? You follow the general that's the grand idea that is the military idea. If the United States army was strung out in line with its general ahead, and if he should ride out into the broad Atlantic and swim to sea, the whole United States army would follow along, for that's the idea, you know.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0nd9EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Enchantress: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3gtBAAAACAAJ&dq=Wild+Enchantress:+Complete&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John L.

Over 1,000 works on paper are documented, all created between 1956 and 1976, and they encompass a wide range of formats, materials, themes, and styles. Included are collages, ephemeral sketches, preparatory studies for paintings, oil on paper works, and drawings executed in a variety of inventive materials, including gunpowder and organic substances. Ruscha came to prominence in the early 1960s as part of the Pop art movement, although his work equally engages the legacies of Dada, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism as well as the Conceptual art that emerged later in the decade. He has long enjoyed international standing and admiration, and his work is widely known. Despite this recognition, this volume contains hundreds of works that have infrequently, or never, been exhibited or published. Each work is catalogued with a color reproduction, collection details, full chronological provenance, exhibition history, and bibliographic references. Essays by Lisa Turvey and Harry Cooper complete this extraordinary survey, which expands and enriches our understanding of Ruscha s pioneering exploration of the written word as a subject for visual art and his witty assessment of the iconography of Los Angeles, both real and imagined.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IkTYBAAAQBAJ&dq=WET:+THE+MAGAZINE+OF+GOURMET+BATHING+AND+BEYOND+-+ISSUE+20+(VOL.+4,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creating a Thinking Organization: Groundrules for Success","description":"Entrepreneur Rikki Hunt joins forces with Mind expert Tony Buzan to provide a blueprint for individual and corporate transformation.

One would think that by now all controversies have been exhausted, but an issue of this magnitude can never finally be laid to rest. Because disagreements persist, there is room for yet another attempt to study the covenant and improve our understanding of it. This book proposes that the path toward an evangelical consensus is not to be found in building another modified systematic theology, but in a biblical theology approach. Grounded in this approach, John Walton's perspective is that while the covenant is characteristically redemptive, formulated along the lines of ancient treaties, and ultimately soteric, it is essentially revelatory. This view in turn has implications regarding the continuity or discontinuity of the covenant phases, the conditionality of the covenant, and our understanding of the people of God. And this ultimately affects the way the Old Testament is preached and taught. Walton's thesis is an important contribution to the discussion of the covenant and the attempts to find common ground among evangelicals of diverse theological traditions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3gg0szYUL0IC&dq=Covenant&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HOW COME IT'S TAKING ME SO LONG TO GET BETTER?","description":"Now that Connor Cohen is dead, Silas Cohen is free to live the life he wants.

In part I, the main themes of the Odyssey such as  guest-friendship  and  testing  are investigated. The incorporation of these and other themes, such as  omens  and the  homecomings of the Achaeans , into the dramatic construction of the whole epic is also examined. In Part II, the main characters of the Odyssey are described: the Suitors, Telemachus, Odysseus and Penelope. So too are Theoclymenus and Laertes, whom traditional criticism has maligned or disregarded. The analysis of the characters tries to illumine features which are challenging for the contemporary reader. In the conclusion, the  plan  of the Odyssey is reconstructed. The author argues that it would probably have been performed over the course of three days: two sessions each day, with each recitation maintaining its own artistic unity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IHhsBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Writing Road to Reading : The Spalding Method of Phonics for Teaching Speech, Writing and Reading","description":"A dynamic introduction to reading which teaches students to hear, say, and write almost simultaneously.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ardOAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Writing+Road+to+Reading+:+The+Spalding+Method+of+Phonics+for+Teaching+Speech,+Writing+and+Reading&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A father's legacy to his daughters","description":"Reproduction of the original: A Father s Legacy to His Daughters by Dr. Gregory","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0fP0DwAAQBAJ&dq=A+father%27s+legacy+to+his+daughters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choices in Relationships","description":"This activity manual, prepared by the authors, is an excellent resource for students.

It does this by describing the interpersonal and group dynamics of decision-making at key stages in the processing of accused persons from the time an alleged offence is committed to the moment sentence is passed. The book bears directly on many current debates concerning the ability of the criminal justice system to deliver reliable verdicts. It recognizes the interdependence of decision makers in the system and addresses questions at an appropriately social-psychological level. The book examines systematically and critically the dynamics of criminal decision-making, the response of victims, the assumptions, attitudes and behavior of police officers, the conduct of court proceedings, the performance of witnesses, the strengths and weaknesses of juries, and the sentencing of magistrates and judges. Discussions of law and morality, the attribution of blame in court and in everyday life, and the achievement of justice in interpersonal and organizational contexts, provide a definitive account of the social psychology of law in the context of criminal justice. Problems with our adversarial system of justice have led to the establishment of a Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. It is commonplace to seek a scapegoat in the behavior of one or other protagonist in the system - especially the police. It will become clear to readers of this book that breakdowns of the system are a product of persuasive interpersonal and intergroup processes of organization, reaching well beyond the behavior of any one agent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RngSqCJUK50C&dq=The+Psychology+of+Criminal+Justice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nursing Assistants: A Basic Study Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=F-ZtPAAACAAJ&dq=Nursing+Assistants:+A+Basic+Study+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Officer and a Hero: In Uniform (Harlequin Superromance No. 828)","description":"The Maine Man by Ellen James released on Dec 25, 1998 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=E2_EPNzh3loC&dq=An+Officer+and+a+Hero:+In+Uniform+(Harlequin+Superromance+No.+828)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Case Against Israel (Counterpunch)","description":"A measured but relentless assessment of the long struggle between Zionists and Palestinians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PeyXxACwjYwC&dq=The+Case+Against+Israel+(Counterpunch)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient CLeansing Formulas That Work After Vitamins and Medicines Have Failed","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=w3n_tgAACAAJ&dq=Ancient+CLeansing+Formulas+That+Work+After+Vitamins+and+Medicines+Have+Failed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Perfect Fit Diet: Combine What Science Knows About Weight Loss with What You Know About Yourself","description":"A physician specializing in the treatment of obesity explains how to create a customized weight-loss program that is tailored to each individual's lifestyle, medical profile, food preferences, satiety signals, and other personal factors that contribute to one's weight gain, along with sensible advice on how to control negative behavior patterns and keep weight off forever. 150,000 first printing.

Life has returned to normal and once again, technology's focus can move from war and bullets to peace?and pleasure. Sexuality has changed, disease and unwanted pregnancies now controlled. Riding close on the heels of this new sexuality are the B.O.B.s-Battery Operated Boyfriends-a cybernetic invention created to please and pleasure. Life-size, life-like, the most sensual, most creatively arousing sex toys ever to be created were programmed for sex and were the answer to every woman's-or man's-dreams.Into this new world of heightened sexuality, erotic romance has re-emerged. Written and led by free-spirited sensualist Elyiana Richards, it has taken the world by storm. But Elyiana, living a contented existence far from the perks of conventional society, never dreamed she would experience a B.O.B., never thought that her greatest fantasy-to be touched, to be held by one certain man-would ever come true, especially in the way it did. Neither did her nemesis, The MacDougal, leader of Cyber-Tronics, creator of the B.O.B.Full of repressed sexuality and smoldering sensuality, The MacDougal, a man who has closed off his emotions and his needs, now leads the most advanced sexual design ever envisioned by man.

Today he endures as the archetypal Romantic genius who explored the limits of the imagination and celebrated the pleasures of the senses but suffered a tragic early death. Edmund Wilson counted him as 'one of the half dozen greatest English writers,' and T. S. Eliot has paid tribute to the Shakespearean quality of Keats's greatness. Indeed, his work has survived better than that of any of his contemporaries the devaluation of Romantic poetry that began early in this century. This Modern Library edition contains all of Keats's magnificent verse: 'Lamia,' 'Isabella,' and 'The Eve of St. Agnes'; his sonnets and odes; the allegorical romance Endymion; and the five-act poetic tragedy Otho the Great. Presented as well are the famous posthumous and fugitive poems, including the fragmentary 'The Eve of Saint Mark' and the great 'La Belle Dame sans Merci,' perhaps the most distinguished literary ballad in the language. 'No one else in English poetry, save Shakespeare, has in expression quite the fascinating felicity of Keats, his perception of loveliness,' said Matthew Arnold. 'In the faculty of naturalistic interpretation, in what we call natural magic, he ranks with Shakespeare.'","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=90U2amLa318C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Beka Book Home School: Phonics, Reading, & Spelling 2 Curriculum/Lesson Plans","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IgbxtgAACAAJ&dq=A+Beka+Book+Home+School:+Phonics,+Reading,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freeway Legal Studies","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C-5EKgAACAAJ&dq=Freeway+Legal+Studies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asuntos de un hidalgo disoluto (Narrativa contemporanea) (Spanish Edition)","description":"Contains scholarly evaluations of books and book chapters as well as conference papers and articles published worldwide in the field of Latin American studies.

In the immediate aftermath of the Gulf War, the embargo was accompanied by an effort to provide aid to the Iraqi people and to protect them against human rights abuses: an initiative that seemed to break new ground in providing protection for civilians in a situation of conflict. Yet the outcome of the international community's efforts has fallen short of the promise. Why has there been such a large gap between the rhetoric and reality? How exactly have the combinatin of economic sanctions, international humanitarian aid and limited protection of civilians affected Iraq? What lessons can be drawn from the experience? This is the most carefully documented, comprehensive account of the consequences of intervention in Iraq during the 1990s. It examines not only the record of intervention but also the complicated political context which has shaped international policy and the Iraqi response to it, and which has made events seem so unpredictable.\\"--Bloomsbury Publishing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bQRpzQEACAAJ&dq=Sanctioning+Saddam:+The+Politics+of+Intervention+in+Iraq&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English Grammar to Ace New Testament Greek","description":"If you think that . . . ?

The selections of Handel?s music included here are those best understood and most apt to be mastered by young musicians. One evening, back in 1691, conservative Doctor Handel was shocked and dismayed to find his small son carrying the torch at the head of a band of singers wandering through the little town of Halle. The good doctor never quite understood the all-consuming love of music which drove his son from childhood on and on to the great heights he eventually attained as the beloved Father of the Oratorio, the composer of the magnificent MESSIAH. Opal Wheeler has given us here the most finished, most completely satisfying book on her list of fine music biographies. Handel at the Court of Kings should be a favorite of all children who love music, whether they are young musicians themselves or not.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pN47AQAACAAJ&dq=HANDEL+AT+THE+COURT+OF+KINGS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IMMUNOLOGY GUIDEBOOK","description":"The Immunology Guidebook provides an easily accessible text-reference to the more up-to-date and difficult concepts in the complex science of immunology.

This treatise on military ethics goes a long way in bridging the gap between the military and society's understanding of the military's ethical dilemma. It is a must for the student of military affairs. International Social Science Review To Serve With Honor is the first book by an American to focus on the validity of current standards of military ethics in more than a century.

Discussed formerly in terms of friendship and sisterhood, these relationships came to be associated with feminism, on the one hand, and psychobiological perversion, on the other a radical shift whose origins have long been unclear. In this first ever book-length study of Chinese lesbians, Tze-lan D. Sang convincingly ties the debate over female same-sex love in China to the emergence of Chinese modernity. As women's participation in social, economic, and political affairs grew, Sang argues, so too did the societal significance of their romantic and sexual relations. Focusing especially on literature by or about women-preferring women, Sang traces the history of female same-sex relations in China from the late imperial period (1600-1911) through the Republican era (1912-1949). She ends by examining the reemergence of public debate on lesbians in China after Mao and in Taiwan after martial law, including the important roles played by globalization and identity politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UU9DZWoxzQkC&dq=The+Emerging+Lesbian:+Female+Same-Sex+Desire+in+Modern+China+(Worlds+of+Desire:+The+Chicago+Series+on+Sexuality,+Gender,+and+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How We Read: Passion for Knowledge Disciplined by Subtle Turns of Strategies And Tactics","description":"A practical guide for high-end reading skills, this text addresses the critical components of reading skills such as highlighting, notes, reviews, vocabulary study, book choices, speed-reading, and more.

His richly illustrated account of life in the Burmese jungle creates an evocative portrait of a people fighting to preserve their way of life. The Karen, one of Burma's many minority peoples, have been waging an increasingly desperate war for autonomy against the Burmese government since 1949. Burma's 'closed door' policies have prevented any close study of Karen society since the 1920s and more recent writers have been forced to concentrate on Karen refugee communities in Thailand. Discussing all aspects of Karen life, this is no ordinary anthropological study but a highly personalized account. Based on the lives of individual Karen there are chapters on music, food, love, the patterns of forest and river life, on women, language, weaponry and mercenaries, and on the symbols of rebel nationalism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=a8L3bn34fX4C&dq=True+Love+and+Bartholomew:+Rebels+on+the+Burmese+Border&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handfasting","description":"This information-packed book takes readers on a historical journey, describing customs and traditions associated with betrothal from times and places when our forebears were in tune with the changing seasons and natural rhythms of their world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VUk87CGtL78C&dq=Handfasting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Retrieve Your Destiny: Living the Soul's Path","description":"Do you have an inner knowing that there is more to life?

The Hurricanes went into action over Singapore on 20 January 1942 and the last two aircraft made the final flight at Java on 8 March that year. During the intervening time the Hurricane pilots and ground crew - British, New Zealanders, Australians, Canadians, Dutch and Americans - gave their all, with many making the supreme sacrifice. The majority of survivors would spend the next 3 1?2 years as prisoners of the Japanese - and some of their heart-rending stories are detailed here. This expertly researched account, the most comprehensive to date, and accompanied by rare photographs, is told wherever possible by the pilots themselves, the majority of whom were young and inexperienced. Their efforts should not be forgotten and this book is a dispassionate tribute to those who fell in battle, those who died as prisoners and those who survived the trials and tribulations of imprisonment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Cd3kAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hurricanes+Over+Singapore:+RAF,+RNZAF+and+NEI+Fighters+in+Action+Against+the+Japanese+Over+the+Island+and+the+Netherlands+East+Indies,+1942&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extreme Bachelor","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ziZm8scL9xMC&dq=Extreme+Bachelor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Engineering Electromagnetism: Physical Processes and Computation (Textbooks in Electrical and Electronic Engineering)","description":"The aim of the book and its associated computer disk is to explain the physical nature of electric and magnetic fields encountered in electrical engineering. Field problems are inherently difficult because fields are distributed in space and can exist in what is usually regarded as empty space devoid of matter. The customary approach to fields problems is through algebraic methods and the solution of equations. The book emphasizes instead a method based on geometry which enables the student to visualize the fields. Backed by a computer program (available to download at the bottom of this page) giving visual displays, the method enables the student to attempt real problems and to use design methods. A comprehensive survey of numerical and analytical methods is provided and examples of engineering applications are discussed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UIJ9QgAACAAJ&dq=Engineering+Electromagnetism:+Physical+Processes+and+Computation+(Textbooks+in+Electrical+and+Electronic+Engineering)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Fury","description":"In this sexy paranormal romance novel set in the world of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, #1 New York Times bestselling author J. R. Ward tells the story of two couples - both fighting to find love in the midst of the war with the Lessening Society. A vampire aristocrat, Peyton is well aware of his duty to his bloodline: mate with an appropriate female of his class and carry on his family's traditions. And he thought he'd found his perfect match - until she fell in love with someone else. Yet when his split-second decision in a battle with the enemy endangers the life of another trainee, Peyton has to face the idea that his future, and his heart, actually lie with another. Novo, as a female in the Black Dagger Brotherhood's training program, feels like she has to prove herself to everybody - and she has no interest in being distracted by falling in love. But when Peyton proves to be so much more than a rich playboy, she is forced to confront the tragedy that has broken her soul and closed her off from love. As the two grapple with Novo's past and Peyton's present, another couple must contend with an erotic connection that is unparalleled - and potentially scandalous. Saxton, who has had his heart broken, discovers in himself a deep-seated attraction to Ruhn, a new member of the household. But will the other male explore the connection? Or will he close his mind and his heart to what could be true love . . . and cost Saxton everything?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AtekDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tao of Physics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-1E9PgAACAAJ&dq=Tao+of+Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Culture Shock!

The following two chapters examine the references to Pilate in Philo and Josephus, looking at each author's biases before going on to assess the historicity of their accounts. The next four chapters look at the portrayal of Pilate in each gospel, asking how a first century reader would have interpreted his actions. Each chapter asks what this portrayal shows about the author's attitude towards the Roman state, and what kind of community found this useful. The conclusion distinguishes between the 'historical Pilate' and the different 'Pilate of interpretation' preserved in our first century literary sources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gvh9km_b7gsC&dq=Pontius+Pilate+in+History+and+Interpretation+(Society+for+New+Testament+Studies+Monograph+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nihongo Notes 5: Studying Japanese in Context","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T9kpAQAAIAAJ&dq=Nihongo+Notes+5:+Studying+Japanese+in+Context&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The game of life (Future history series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kXq8zgEACAAJ&dq=The+game+of+life+(Future+history+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Wife and Other Stories (Malthouse African short stories)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qNAZMhzi4PMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The natural","description":"The theme of the present volume concerns people' s response to the natural environment, considered at scales varying from that of a house hold plant to that of vast wilderness areas. Our decision to focus on this particular segment of the physical environment was prompted in part by the intrinsic interest in this subject on the part of a diverse group of sodal scientists and professionals-and of laypersons, for that matter and in part by the relative neglect of this topic in standard treatments of the environment-behavior field. It also serves to bring out once again the interdisdplinary nature of that field, and we are pleased to have been able to inc1ude representatives from geography, sodology, soda! ecology, and natural recreation among our contributors. We believe that this volume will serve a useful purpose in helping to integrate the find ings and concepts in this presently somewhat fragmented field, scat tered as they are over a very diverse array of publications representing a similarly varied group of spedalties. It is hoped that the result will be to stimulate future development of this area and to add a measure of in creased coherence to it.

Considered to be among the continent's earliest human inhabitants, the Clovis peoples were probably nomadic hunters and gatherers whose remaining traces include camp sites and caches of goods stored for utilitarian or ritual purposes. This book offers the first comprehensive study of a little-known aspect of Clovis culture stone blade technology. Michael Collins introduces the topic with a close look at the nature of blades and the techniques of their manufacture, followed by a discussion of the full spectrum of Clovis lithic technology and how blade production relates to the production of other stone tools. He then provides a full report of the discovery and examination of fourteen blades found in 1988 in the Keven Davis Cache in Navarro County, Texas. Collins also presents a comparative study of known and presumed Clovis blades from many sites, discusses the Clovis peoples' caching practices, and considers what lithic technology and caching behavior can add to our knowledge of Clovis lifeways. These findings will be important reading for both specialists and amateurs who are piecing together the puzzle of the peopling of the Americas, since the manufacture of blades is a trait that Clovis peoples shared with the Upper Paleolithic peoples in Europe and northern Asia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pcF7AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linux Routers: A Primer For Network Administrators","description":"Linux Routers, Second Edition shows you exactly how to reduce your costs and extend your network with Linux-based routing.

Adrian Tempany, Observer 'In a few weeks' time, it would be thirty-five years to the day since those men and women had walked 340 miles to try to save their communities and their culture, and thirty-five years since I had turned down Pete's invitation to join them. I called work and booked some time off. Then I bought a one-way train ticket to Liverpool.' In 1981, Mike Carter's dad, Pete, organised the People's March for Jobs, which saw 300 people walk from Liverpool to London to protest as the Thatcher government's policies devastated industrial Britain and sent unemployment skyrocketing. Just before the 2016 EU referendum, Mike set off to walk the same route in a quest to better understand his dad and his country. As he walked, Mike found many echoes of the early eighties: a working class overlooked and ignored by Westminster politicans; communities hollowed out but fiercely resistant; anger and despair co-existing with hope and determination for change. And he also found that he and Pete shared more in common than he might have thought. All Together Now? maps the intricate, overlapping path of one man's journey and that of an entire country. It is a book about belonging, about whether to stay or go, and about the need to write new stories for our communities and ourselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GFtDyQEACAAJ&dq=All+Together+Now&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daring to Be Abigail","description":"During her summer at Camp Nashaquitsa, eleven-year-old Abby tries to reinvent herself, while worrying about her mother, missing her dead father, and getting to know her equally self-conscious bunkmates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=a1Kg7WhRd3sC&dq=Daring+to+Be+Abigail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A is for Alibi (SIGNED)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oU61PAAACAAJ&dq=A+is+for+Alibi+(SIGNED)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roughing It Easy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ofC0QA-a6qIC&dq=Roughing+It+Easy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Handbook of Alternative Investment Strategies","description":"Since the first edition of the Handbook of Alternative Assets was published, significant events-from the popping of the technology bubble and massive accounting scandals to recessions and bear markets-have shifted the financial landscape.

Arthur Wheelock begins by placing Vermeer's art in historical perspective, with emphasis on the artistic environment in his home city of Delft and the importance of history painting in the mid-1600s. He then closely examines seventeen of the thirty-six extant paintings in Vermeer's oeuvre, works that span the range of the artist's career. Using the results of x-rays, pigment analysis, and infrared reflectography, some of the secrets of Vermeer's wonderfully elusive artistry are revealed. For example, Vermeer was able to simulate reality, simplify and highlight meaning, establish a sense of time and permanence, and enhance the mood he wished to create through inventive use of brushwork, color, and compositional refinements. Lavishly illustrated with color reproductions of Vermeer's paintings, the book is certain to appeal to all devotees of Dutch art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=B5uFQgAACAAJ&dq=Vermeer+and+the+Art+of+Painting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The decline and fall of the Roman Empire","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b6BeAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paws for Thought: A Look at the Conflicts, Questions and Challenges of Animal Euthanasia","description":"Over eight million animals a year die in the arms of people who had hoped to save them.

Islam's Black Slaves documents a centuries-old institution that still survives, and traces the business of slavery and its repercussions from Islam's inception in the seventh century, through its history in China, India, Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Libya, and Spain, and on to Sudan and Mauritania, where, even today, slaves continue to be sold. Ronald Segal reveals for the first time the numbers involved in this trade--as many millions as were transported to the Americas--and explores the differences between the traffic in the East and the West. Islam's Black Slaves also examines the continued denial of the very existence of this sector of the black diaspora, although it survives today in significant numbers; and in an illuminating conclusion, Segal addresses the appeal of Islam to African-American communities, and the perplexing refusal of Black Muslim leaders to acknowledge black slavery and oppression in present-day Mauritania and Sudan. A fitting companion to Segal's previous work, Islam's Black Slaves is a fascinating account of an often unacknowledged tradition, and a riveting cross-cultural commentary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fdh3GYnXvrAC&dq=Islam%27s+Black+Slaves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Know Your Dog Owns You If","description":"Household tips by a popular columnist include fast tidy jobs for unexpected visitors, organizing clutter, creating a self-maintained kitchen, coping with mess-makers, and keeping the bathroom clean.

Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio was a highly unusual candidate for the papacy for two main reasons: the 'pope from far away' is the first non-European to be elected, and, furthermore, he began his career as a Jesuit, one of 'God's soldiers'. Members of the order traditionally do not ascend the hierarchy of the Church, and it took a personal request from Pope John Paul II for Bergoglio to leave the Society of Jesus and accept his appointment as bishop. Bergoglio's theological principles have been profoundly shaped by these two factors. However, the author also reveals that the evolution of his thought was deeply affected by his simple Argentinean upbringing and his fearless work in the slums of Buenos Aires as a young Jesuit and as a senior member of the Church. Bergoglio has consistently emphasised the importance of alleviatingthe suffering of the poor, following the teaching of Vatican II, and in keeping with his own unflinching morality. This volume reveals Pope Francis as remarkably humble and altruistic man, doctrinally conservative, and engaged less in politics thanin the struggle to re-centre the Church at the margins of society. It will be of great interest to any reader who wishes to know more about this inspiring individual.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LIziDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The International Jew Volume II: Jewish Activities in the United States","description":"\\"\\"The International Jew is a four volume set of booklets or pamphlets originally published and distributed in the early 1920s by Henry Ford, an American industrialist and automobile manufacturer.

Under the leadership of Vojin Oklobdzija and a stellar editorial board, some of the industry's foremost experts have joined forces to create what promises to be the definitive resource for computer design and engineering. Instead of focusing on basic, introductory material, it forms a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of the field's most recent achievements, outstanding issues, and future directions. The world of computer engineering is vast and evolving so rapidly that what is cutting-edge today may be obsolete in a few months.

With the influx of many German Jews in the 1840s, the community expanded above Spring Garden Street into the Northern Liberties neighborhood. Urban settlement of Philadelphia's Jewish population during the last quarter of the nineteenth century shifted to North Broad Street when the economy improved for the city's residents after the Civil War. North Broad Street soon boasted two elegantly designed synagogues and the newly relocated Jewish Hospital from West Philadelphia.The Jewish Community around North Broad Street weaves the tale of the Jewish community in this part of Philadelphia through a collection of rare and stunning images. The construction of the North Broad Street subway in the 1920s and the row house Jewish community known as Logan are parts of this story. The development of business districts led to a more cohesive north and northwest Jewish community that allowed for satellite Jewish enclaves to flourish, complete with their own synagogues, bakeries, kosher meat markets, and hundreds of other shops that served the general population. In the 1950s, new neighborhoods, such as Mount Airy and West Oak Lane, alleviated an acute housing shortage at a time when 110,000 Jews lived in north-central and northwest Philadelphia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WodwK9yRoQwC&dq=The+Jewish+Community+Around+North+Broad+Street+(PA)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Batting Cleanup Bill Conlin (Baseball In America)","description":"Presents three decades of reporting from the provocative sports writer","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pUMa89SMrjsC&dq=Batting+Cleanup+Bill+Conlin+(Baseball+In+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nature,: Addresses, and lectures, (His Complete works, v.1.

That is what all the mythology throughout the world uniformly states. Mythology from every nation, region, tribe, and period, in thousands of languages, in hundreds of forms, from every continent; they all resound,  a large planet stood above the North Pole for a very long time.  Every country is accounted for except those located more than 10 degrees below the equator. The mythology of regions as far removed from each other as Siberia, North Africa, and Guatemala all agree. As others have indicated, I will also suggest that this planet was Saturn and that Saturn was initially a brown dwarf star that created Earth, Mars and later Venus. In order to put the story into context, I will make it abundantly clear that the framework will be based upon plasma physics and the existence of the aether. The Solvay Conference, founded by the Belgian industrialist Ernest Solvay in 1912, was considered a turning point in the world of physics. Located in Brussels, the conferences were devoted to outstanding open problems in both physics and chemistry. The most famous conference was the October 1927 Fifth Solvay International Conference on Electrons and Photons, where the world s most so-called notable physicists met to discuss the newly formulated quantum theory. The leading figures were Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr.  Settled Science  and  Consensus Science  began at this time and it is also the moment we stopped doing real physics in the 20th and 21st centuries. The bold theoretical and experimental era of physics, by the likes of Maxwell, at the very dawn of science, as we know it, ended abruptly at the start of the 20th Century. That was when our currently accepted, and very different, view of  physics , everything from the  Big Bang  Expanding Universe Cosmology, to Relativistic limitations imposed by  flat  space and non-simultaneous time, complicated by a non-intuitive  Quantum Mechanics  of suddenly uncertain atomic  realities , all took a very different turn from where they had been headed. The quantum theory discarded the basic physics principle of cause followed by effect. Einstein was disenchanted with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and created his own fatal damage when his  thought experiment  made-up the theory of relativity. He isolated his arbitrary observer from the rest of the universe, discarded the absolute standards of length and time, invented an imaginary proper clock that does not exist, removed the aether, and the effect of gravity became an illusion. Make sure you understand this was not done using any scientific method, i.e., observation, experimentation and replication, but by what became known as a  thought experiment . Einstein should have kept his day job in the post office, as he has set physics, the so-called Queen of the Sciences back 100 years. This conference was also the culmination of the struggle between Einstein and the scientific realists, who wanted strict rules of scientific method as laid out by Charles Peirce and Karl Popper, versus Bohr and the instrumentalists, who wanted looser rules based on  expected  outcomes, regardless of causes and effects. Starting at this point, the instrumentalists won, instrumentalism having been seen as the norm ever since. And that has been the insurmountable problem with science ever since, the loss of the scientific method and accepting causes without effects and conversely. These are all unforgivable losses to the great physicists of the past. We were propelled nearly 2,000 years into past to the Greek Ptolemaic era when geometric symmetry and mathematical beauty dictated that endless the ad-hoc epicycles be added to perfect circular planetary orbits in order to match appearances. That dogma lasted almost 1500 years. How long will we allow relativity dogma and its taboos to persist? It should be no surprise that since that fateful conference in 1927, science has failed to produce any fundamental breakthroughs anything like the 19th century, when some of the finest experimental physicists, such as Ampere, Gauss, Faraday, and Maxwell were discovering the secrets of electricity and electromagnetism. The electric universe and plasma physics and cosmology follows the lead of these experimenting electrical pioneers. According, I will also discard the  thought experiments  of Einstein and defer to real scientists, namely Tesla, Maxwell, Thornhill, and others, who long ago recognized that all perceptible matter comes from a primary substance, of a tenuity beyond conception and filling all space, the Akasha, or luminiferous aether, which is acted upon by the life-giving Prana or creative force, calling into existence, in never ending cycles, all things and phenomena. This primary substance, thrown into infinitesimal whirls of prodigious velocity, becomes gross matter; the force subsiding, the motion ceases and matter disappears, reverting to the primary substance. The structure and nature is most likely a vortex, appearing like a donut from above or below. What I will attempt to present to you in the book, is the real story of our history and the real fact that we, and the universe and everything in it, is electric in nature. I will present facts and evidence that demonstrate that all religions, mystery schools, the Bible, and other religious books are nothing more than a rewritten and edited story of a solar system wide cataclysm. A story that was written, rewritten and edited to make it appear that Jewish people were the  Chosen People of God , We will see that all the pyramids, especially those on the Giza Plateau were built as an energy gathering, converting and storing machines to try to save the Earth and Mankind from the electromagnetic perturbations caused by the Sirius System (the Sun s binary twin) that occurs approximately every 24,000 years. The Great Pyramid was not a weapon, and certainly not a death star used to explode planets. There has been no atomic wars on Earth and no landings by  alien  beings on Earth, nor on any other planet in our solar system. There is no Planet X and there is no Nibiru. The so-called  Planet of the Crossing  is actually the star Sirius, the Sun s binary twin. We will see that all the five visible planets, Saturn, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and the two luminaries, the Moon and our current Sun, became the Gods, with several of them, coming down to Earth from the Heavens to write our history only a few thousand years ago. We will also see and understand that the vast amount of cratering and channels on all of the planets in our solar system are not the result of random meteor or comet strikes, wind or water erosion, but are the results of electrical arcing between planets that has scarred the surface of the planets and has been demonstrated and replicated, in exact detail, in plasma laboratories. We will examine the Exodus, within the context of the Earth in upheaval from a natural solar system-wide cataclysm, and how Akhenaton, Moses and the Ark are main characters in the event. We will also examine Mount Sinai and its real identity and location, as well as, the Sacred Stone(s), its use, who stole them, and why. This story does not depend on miracles or faith, but is based upon evidence, both ancient and current. It is our genuine history that has been kept from us in order to maintain control by those in power. If you can not see the truth in this story and you want to believe in religions or the current false, consensus or settled  science , you must believe them in one of three ways: by faith; by ignorance; or by indoctrination: by faith, because you cannot believe something which does not have adequate scientific evidence except as a philosophical viewpoint; by ignorance, because the only way to be certain in your mind that these theories could work, is because you do not have all the facts; or, if you have been so far indoctrinated you have not made a logical conclusion with your own rational mind, you may have never even tried to question what you have been told to believe. You must decide for yourself what you will believe. If you decide to believe in today s biblical religious myths or  consensus and settled pseudoscience of the quackademics and media , that is fine, just realize that none are supported by true science using the Scientific Method. They are myths, and not even good ones, at that. Just remember, believing this nonsense and everything else the  authorities  say is just what they want, i.e., no change in the status quo and leave the thinking to them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gkniDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big-time criminals speak!","description":"Rooted in the creative success of over 30 years of supermarket tabloid publishing, the Weekly World News has been the world's only reliable news source since 1979.

The fall of Petersburg and Richmond, the last battles at Five Forks, Sailor's Creek, and Dinwiddie Court House, and the final surrender at Appomattox are all described by an author whose knowledge of the historical sources is equaled by his familiarity with the area over which the armies marched and fought.The author provides a day-to-day narrative of this fascinating campaign, with a series of specially commissioned maps that make clear the complex series of maneuvers that finally brought Lee's beleaguered army to bay. Special sidebars highlight many incidents and personalities of the campaign, including never-before-published information on African-Americans in Confederate service.

Outside of trade there were three channels by which a certain amount Of coin reached Maryland from the mother - country. The first and most important Of these was through settlers. It is natural to suppose that most emigrants, on leaving Eng land, would provide themselves with more or less pocket money to meet immediate demands. The amount Of such a supply is very difficult to estimate, but with four or five thousand settlers a year, it was probably an appreciable addition to the monetary resources Of the colony.

Beard and V.L. Parrington. These men, whose views of history were shaped in large part by the political battles of the Progressive era, provided the Progressive movement with a usable past and the American liberal mind with a historical tradition. The Progressive Historians is at once a critique of historical thought during this decisive period of American development and an account of how these three writers led American historians into the controversial political world of the twentieth century. Turner, in developing his idea that American democracy is the outcome of the experience of frontier expansion and the settlement of the West, introduced his fellow historians to a set of new concepts and methods, and in doing so doing re-drew the guidelines of American historiography. Beard insisted upon the elitist origins of the Constitution, crusaded for the economic interpretation of history, and ultimately staked his historical reputation on an isolationist view of recent American foreign policy. Parrington emphasized the moral and social functions of literature, and read the history of literature as a history of the national political mind. In recent years, the tide has run against the Progressive historians, as one specialist after another has taken issue with their interpretations. The movement of contemporary historical thought has led to a rediscovery of the complexity of the American past. Although he cannot share the faith of the Progressive historians in the sufficiency of American liberalism as a guide to the modern world, Richard Hofstadter believes we have much to learn about ourselves from a reconsideration of their insights.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iLdMzbv2IDQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romanticism and the Materiality of Nature","description":"Oerlemans extends current eco-critical views by synthesizing a range of viewpoints from the Romantic period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QNlHZGaGmwsC&dq=Romanticism+and+the+Materiality+of+Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The RVer's Friend, 2001: National Diesel and Parking Directory","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6cG4AAAACAAJ&dq=The+RVer%27s+Friend,+2001:+National+Diesel+and+Parking+Directory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edward the Second","description":"Dramatically compressing the reign of Edward II and enlivening the historical narrative with humour, romance, and horrific violence, Marlowe interrogates how the transgression of accepted codes of behaviour affects even those at the highest level of society.

The attack hardly came as a surprise to Josef Stalin; in fact, history has long held that Stalin spent the two intervening years building up his defenses against a Nazi attack. With the gradual declassifying of former Soviet documents, though, historians are learning more and more about Stalin's grand plan during the years 1939-1941. Longtime Soviet expert Albert L. Weeks has studied the newly-released information and come to a different conclusion about the Soviet Union's pre-war buildup_it was not precaution against German invasion at all. In fact, Weeks argues, the evidence now suggests Soviet mobilization was aimed at an eventual invasion of Nazi Germany. The Soviets were quietly biding their time between 1939 and 1941, allowing the capitalist powers to destroy one another, all the while preparing for their own Westward march.

Murder is seen as a chaotic, disorganized act beyond the realm of reason. In Wicked Deeds, James O'Kane shows that homicide is actually rather predictable, and patterned with respect to its assailants and victims, the circumstances in which it takes place, the time and location where it occurs, and the motives which precipitate the murderous act. Engagingly written and solidly grounded in evidence, this is a definitive study of murder in the United States. O'Kane explores the phenomena of homicide, illustrating the journalists' \\"who, what, why, when, and where\\" of murder. He differentiates criminal homicide, such as murder in the first and second degree, from other types of killings, including legal and quasi-legal killings. These include suicide, abortion, accidental death, terrorism, and other non-criminal types of homicide, such as justifiable and excusable homicide. The author's focus is criminal homicide, and he uses age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status, as well as demographic data to explain ever-recurring patterns of murder in the United States. Wicked Deeds analyzes numerous categories of murder: intimate partner homicide, child and family murders, multiple victim killings, including mass murder and serial homicide. Each type of murder is illustrated by accounts of actual murders reported in the media and on internet sites. Approximately 200 cases illustrate the typical homicides as well as the bizarre ones. In portraying the patterns and regularities of murder in the United States, Wicked Deeds is an essential treatment of a subject too often given over to sensationalism. It will be of keen interest to professionals and students of criminal justice, as well as those interested in American culture and the general reader who wants to grasp the patterns underlying the headlines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1Tc7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magen David: How the Six-Pointed Star Became an Emblem for the Jewish People","description":"The hexagram was a symbol used by Jews and non-Jews from ancient times on, often as a decoration or a protective device. It became associated with Jews in 14th-century Prague, when the Jews were given their own flag (red, with a yellow Magen David), and spread through the Austrian Empire. The Zionists adopted the symbol as part of the national ensign. Pp. 97-104 deal with the Nazi use of the Magen David to mark the Jews.

Drawing on interviews as well as unpublished sources, he vividly conjures the spirit of this restless observer of American postwar malaise who subverted the materials of science fiction--parallel universes, intricate time loops, collective delusions--to create classic works of contemporary anxiety.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mhQ4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Canadian Heraldic Primer","description":"Heraldry is now.

This created the need for a small air force of pilots ferry pilots willing to fly thousands of planes to clients in every corner of the globe.

Millionaire welfare queens? Tort lawyers run amok? A $330,000 outhouse, paid for with your tax dollars? John Stossel says, \\"Give me a break.\\" When he hit the airwaves thirty years ago, Stossel helped create a whole new category of news, dedicated to protecting and informing consumers. As a crusading reporter, he chased snake-oil peddlers, rip-off artists, and corporate thieves, winning the applause of his peers. But along the way, he noticed that there was something far more troublesome going on: While the networks screamed about the dangers of exploding BIC lighters and coffeepots, worse risks were ignored. And while reporters were teaming up with lawyers and legislators to stick it to big business, they seldom reported the ways the free market made life better. In Give Me a Break, Stossel explains how ambitious bureaucrats, intellectually lazy reporters, and greedy lawyers make your life worse even as they claim to protect your interests. Taking on such sacred cows as the FDA, the War on Drugs, and scaremongering environmental activists -- and backing up his trademark irreverence with careful reasoning and research -- he shows how the problems that government tries and fails to fix can be solved better by the extraordinary power of the free market. He traces his journey from cub reporter to 20/20 co-anchor, revealing his battles to get his ideas to the public, his struggle to overcome stuttering, and his eventual realization that, for years, much of his reporting missed the point. Stossel concludes the book with a provocative blueprint for change: a simple plan in the spirit of the Founding Fathers to ensure that America remains a place \\"where free minds -- and free markets -- make good things happen.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3UYRki0rCHgC&dq=Give+Me+a+Break+:+How+I+Exposed+Hucksters,+Cheats,+and+Scam+Artists+and+Became+the+Scourge+of+the+Liberal+Media...&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Delicate Fade","description":"Using an intense, stream-of-conscious, personal-narrative style, the author records his struggle with the question of what to do when the experience of life does not match what the church has always taught as he tries to sort out how to live between what is and what should be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=78a3PQAACAAJ&dq=A+Delicate+Fade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Case of Conscience","description":"A space-traveling Jesuit priest confronts a moral but godless alien race in this Hugo Awardwinning novel by the author of the Cities in Flight saga. Father Ruiz-Sanchez is a dedicated man, a Jesuit priest who is also a scientist, and a scientist who is also a human being. He doesn t feel any genuine conflicts in his belief system until he is sent to Lithia. The reptilian inhabitants of this distant world appear to be admirable in every way. Untroubled by greed or lust, they live in peace. But they have no concept of God, no literature, and no art. They rely purely on cold reason. But something darker lies beneath the surface: Do the Lithians pose a hidden threat? The answers that unfold could affect the fate of two worlds. Will Ruiz-Sanchez, a priest driven by his deeply human understanding of good and evil, do the right thing when confronted by a race that is alien to its core? The Science Fiction Encyclopedia lauds A Case of Conscience as  one of the first serious attempts to deal with religion [in science fiction], and [it] remains one of the most sophisticated. It is generally regarded as an SF classic.  Readers of Isaac Asimov s Foundation Trilogy, Mary Doria Russell s The Sparrow, or Walter M.

From the dawn of human civilization they have been a dangerous figure in our imaginations poisonous, precise, and deadly quiet but as Louise M. Pryke shows in this book, their bad reputation has overshadowed many exceptional qualities. Scurrying across hundreds of millions of years and across every continent except Antarctica, this book gives the scorpion its due as one of nature s longest lasting survivors. Indeed scorpions are older than dinosaurs. An ancient arthropod, their form notable for its pair of pincers and an elegant tail that holds a menacing stinger high in the air in a permanent striking position hasn t changed since prehistoric times, though today there are some 1700 different species. Throughout our existence scorpions have served as a powerful cultural and religious symbol sometimes dangerous, sometimes protecting from the Egyptian goddess Serket to Zodiac astrology to folk medicine. A fascinating tour that takes us from the art of North Africa to the American Civil War to the markets of Beijing, Scorpion is an homage to one of earth s oldest residents.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=40SkDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advancement of Learning: Novum Organum, New Atlantis (Great Books of the Western World, Vol. 30)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LSOnAQAACAAJ&dq=Advancement+of+Learning:+Novum+Organum,+New+Atlantis+(Great+Books+of+the+Western+World,+Vol.+30)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Citizen Soldiers in the War of 1812","description":"\\"For nearly two years during the War of 1812, the British treated the Chesapeake Bay as their private lake. But in 1814, as attention moved from the northern frontier to the mid-Atlantic region, the Americans fought back and drove the invaders from the bay. Christopher T. George traces the abuses of the inhabitants of the Chesapeake Bay by Royal Navy raiding parties under arrogant Rear Admiral George Cockburn. Cockburn's burning and pillaging of bay communities preceded the burning of our nation's capital, Washington, D.C., on August 24-25, 1814, by Major General Robert Ross. Cockburn persuaded Ross that the Americans could not stand up to Lord Wellington's Peninsular War veterans. But he miscalculated when it came to attacking Baltimore, where citizen soldiers, strongly led by Revolutionary War veterans Generals Samuel Smith and John Stricker, and backed by U.S. Navy regulars, held the British at bay, killing Ross and reclaiming American pride.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Yet, the economic issues affecting this industry have been paid relatively little attention. In this collection of eight essays, experts in economics and education bring economic analysis to bear on such underexamined topics as the nature of competition in higher education, higher education's use of resources, and who chooses to purchase what kind of education and why. In higher education, supply refers to such issues as government support for public colleges and universities, the means by which graduate programs allocate financial support to students, and the criteria that universities use for investing endowments. Demand pertains to patterns of student enrollment and to the government, business, and individual market for the service and research activities of higher education. Why are tuitions nearly the same among schools despite differences in prestige? How are institutions with small endowments able to compete successfully with institutions that have huge endowments? How are race and ethnicity reflected in enrollment trends? Where do the best students go? What choices among colleges do young people from low-income backgrounds face? This volume addresses these questions and suggests subjects for further study of the economics of higher education.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1aGYCuKtuYgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Timeless (Dreamspun)","description":"Robyn Delany is thrust back into eighteenth-century England where she finds love with William Bowleigh, Lord Starke, a mysterious man of the past.

The Lizzie haters say: \\"If Lizzie is innocent, why didn't the killer kill her too? Why didn't she see him in the house?\\" while the Lizzie lovers say: \\"Andrew had enemies; and besides, Lizzie couldn't have accomplished the murders so cleanly.\\" On Thursday morning, August the 4th 1892, in the safe and sleepy mill town of Fall River, Massachusetts, Andrew and Abby Borden were savagely hacked to death in their home. Their upstanding and respectable younger daughter, Lizzie, was suspected and tried for their murders but was acquitted of the crime. If she was guilty, one can say she severed her family ties in the bloodiest way imaginable. If she wasn't guilty, she is one of the most maliciously maligned innocents that criminal history has ever seen. Unlike most books on Lizzie Borden (which have a theory or agenda), this book instead poses the strongest clear factual arguments for why Lizzie may be either guilty or innocent, without any biased conclusions on the author's part. It also includes striking rare new revelations and anecdotes about Lizzie's private life, in addition to known facts being presented in a new way, and many rare and previously unpublished photographs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P7PQRAAACAAJ&dq=Did+Lizzie+Borden+Axe+For+It%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"David and Bathsheba","description":"With her devout husband away fighting the king's wars for many months at a time, Bathsheba longs for love and easily succumbs to King David's charm and attention, but even though she she immediately regrets her involvement with the powerful king, the pieces are set in motion to destroy everything she holds dear.

Eileen tells of her initial interest in tennis when, in 1987, she joined the British Tennis Umpires Association (BTUA). This game, set and match narrative continues through until 2012 with the Association of British Tennis Officials (ABTO) as a top tennis official and having served as a member of the Committee of Management. Eileen wrote everything down with meticulous detail throughout her distinguished officiating career, reminiscing details of matches she officiated, including pro-celebrity tournaments and several conversations with officials, players, royalty, celebrities and her beloved, Cliff Richard. What you do find in this book is a very revealing account of the tennis officiating industry. You also get the distinct feeling that writing the book was actually cathartic for Eileen, putting her concerns to print and righting some wrongs with those within the industry. Her book reads like the history of British tennis over the last four decades, and it is a revealing account of the camaraderie, favouritism, in-fighting and back-biting within the tennis association. Sadly, Eileen s exceptional and eventful career was tinged with bitterness and seems sad that her fantastic experiences and years of devotion to the tennis association would end in such a way. There are stories she tells that will shock you. However, with her three children, also as top tennis officials, there are plenty of amusing stories Eileen tells that will make you laugh and even the odd words with her and her children s wonderful sense of humour and fun. This book is a really interesting read for any tennis aficionado.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eiyPDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the Twenty-first Century","description":"Discusses many of the age-old beliefs held by humankind concerning nature, and argues that it is these that threaten our ability to deal with the ongoing ecological crisis","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wwYUAQAAIAAJ&dq=Discordant+Harmonies:+A+New+Ecology+for+the+Twenty-first+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The poems of Heine,: Complete;","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ue8oAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+poems+of+Heine,:+Complete%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wall Street Journal Crossword Puzzles, Volume 4","description":"Inside this gilt-edged puzzle offering from the Wall Street Journal are 250 Sunday-size crosswords that take the bull (and bear) by the horns to prove that finance can be fun!

Carrese provides a provocative analysis of the intellectual sources of today s powerful judiciary, arguing that Montesquieu, in his Spirit of the Laws, first articulated a new conception of the separation of powers and strong but subtle courts. Montesquieu instructed statesmen to  cloak power  by placing judges at the center of politics, while concealing them behind juries and subtle reforms. Tracing this conception through Blackstone, Hamilton, and Tocqueville, Carrese shows how it led to the prominence of judges, courts, and lawyers in America today. But he places the blame for contemporary judicial activism squarely at the feet of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and his jurisprudential revolution, which he believes to be the source of the now-prevalent view that judging is merely political. To address this crisis, Carrese argues for a rediscovery of an independent judiciary one that blends prudence and natural law with common law and that observes the moderate jurisprudence of Montesquieu and Blackstone, balancing abstract principles with realistic views of human nature and institutions. He also advocates for a return to the complex constitutionalism of the American founders and Tocqueville and for judges who understand their responsibility to elevate citizens above individualism, instructing them in law and right.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xdTJSXd1th0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WAGES OF SIN","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IWggAQAAIAAJ&dq=WAGES+OF+SIN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Operative Neurosurgery, 2 Volumes","description":"The first book to be published in this region, it describes the scientific basis of the procedures, as also their indications, scope and limitations.

Making daring connections between the personal and the political, Janet McAdams draws new lines in the conflict between the new and old worlds as she redefines the struggle to remain human. This award-winning collection of poetry forges surprising links among seemingly unrelated forms of violence and resistance in today's world: war in Central America, abuses against Nature, the battleground of the bedroom. McAdams evokes the absurdity of everyday existence as she sends out a new call for social responsibility. The Island of Lost Luggage is the poetry winner of the 1999 First Book Awards competition of the Native Writers' Circle of the Americas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FBacNOEBTGwC&dq=The+Island+of+Lost+Luggage+(First+Book+Award+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Copenhagen Papers: An Intrigue","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XErHbwAACAAJ&dq=The+Copenhagen+Papers:+An+Intrigue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marxism, Modernity and Postcolonial Studies (Cultural Margins)","description":"Marxism, Modernity and Postcolonial Studies provides a specifically Marxist intervention into postcolonial and cultural studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LZjb88O-pmwC&dq=Marxism,+Modernity+and+Postcolonial+Studies+(Cultural+Margins)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snake Dance: Unravelling the Mysteries of Jonestown","description":"Survivor's riveting tale.

Even so, he takes under his wing a troubled young boy named Danny who's fighting incest rumors to repair a shattered family, wondering every day if his sister will return to clear it all up. In southern Arizona, John the New Baptist has created a new religion promising salvation. Most people believe in his strange ways. They don't understand he is establishing a herd for his personal use. Only Simon, a faithless Alexian Brother, and a homeless man named Billy Bones who speaks in palindromes, anagrams and metaphor realize the evil and engage the Scarecrow Gods-a circle of immense saguaro dressed in Salvation Army clothes who speak wisdom in the wind from pursed coke bottle lips. Maxom, Simon, Danny and Billy, all fight and converge upon the center of evil as each journeys through the world of imagination, the Land of Inside-Out and across America, striving to defeat demons both personal and real to ultimately discover their deserved salvations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jfhRMAAACAAJ&dq=Scarecrow+Gods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mothers And Daughters","description":"Sam is nog maar kort moeder terwijl ze haar eigen moeder Iris onlangs heeft verloren.

While these two initially seem like doubtful dialogue partners, the conversation between them yields a rich and compelling account of intersubjectivity between man and woman--an account that moves beyond the limited and tired debate over egalitarianism vs. complementarianism. Through engagement with Irigaray and Kierkegaard, this book develops a constructive, theological ethics of sexual difference that focuses on an epistemological and subjective gap that sets man and woman at a decisive distance from each other. They are a mystery to each other. Yet it is also an ethical framework that allows woman and man to encounter one another in ways that respect the independence, subjectivity, and becoming of each. Above all, this is a theological ethics of sexual difference that centers on Jesus Christ, who is defined as the middle term in every relationship and whose love command defines the encounter between man and woman in difference.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=riFTAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Iowa (Celebrate the States)","description":"\\"Provides comprehensive information on the geography, history, wildlife, governmental structure, economy, cultural diversity, peoples, religion, and landmarks of Iowa\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IVcfZvCXxI0C&dq=Iowa+(Celebrate+the+States)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Panic Broadcast: The Whole Story of Orson Welles' Legendary Radio Show Invasion from Mars","description":"Through his radio and film works, such as The War of the Worlds and Citizen Kane, Orson Welles became a household name in the United States. Yet Welles s multifaceted career went beyond these classic titles and included lesser-known but nonetheless important contributions to television, theater, newspaper columns, and political activism. Orson Welles in Focus: Texts and Contexts examines neglected areas of Welles s work, shedding light on aspects of his art that have been eclipsed by a narrow focus on his films. By positioning Welles s work during a critical period of his activity (the mid-1930s through the 1950s) in its larger cultural, political, aesthetic, and industrial contexts, the contributors to this volume examine how he participated in and helped to shape modern media. This exploration of Welles in his totality illuminates and expands our perception of his contributions that continue to resonate today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iIxODwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Panic+Broadcast:+The+Whole+Story+of+Orson+Welles%27+Legendary+Radio+Show+Invasion+from+Mars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No-Nonsense Guide to Coastal Fishing (Saltwater Strategies)","description":"Pat Murray's No-Nonsense Guide To Coastal Fishing is an in-depth look at the details that transform the sport of coastal fishing into an art.

David Brock pilloried Anita Hill in a bestseller. His reporting in The American Spectator as part of the infamous  Arkansas Project  triggered the course of events that led to the historic impeachment trial of President Clinton. Brock was at the center of the right-wing dirty tricks operation of the Gingrich era and a true believer until he could no longer deny that the political force he was advancing was built on little more than lies, hate, and hypocrisy. In Blinded By the Right, Brock, who came out of the closet at the height of his conservative renown, tells his riveting story from the beginning, giving us the first insider s view of what Hillary Rodham Clinton called  the vast right-wing conspiracy.  Whether dealing with the right-wing press, the richly endowed think tanks, Republican political operatives, or the Paula Jones case, Brock names names from Clarence Thomas on down, uncovers hidden links, and demonstrates how the Republican Right s zeal for power created the poisonous political climate that culminated in George W. Bush s election.

The details of this inexhaustively rich style-- ornate wrought iron and wood balconies, colorful tiles, graceful arches, and palm-dotted gardens-- reflect the region's Spanish, Mexican, and southwestern history and culture as well as its popular outdoor lifestyle. This book showcases Southern California's most historically significant and beautifully preserved Spanish-revival houses of this century. Twenty-one private homes built between 1922 and 1991 are featured in stunning color photography that captures exterior and interior architectural details, Spanish and Mexican antique furnishings and folk art, and lush landscaping and tiled fountains. Among these are the Adamson House in Malibu, with its extraordinary collection of custom tile from Malibu Potteries; the contemporary Greenberg House in Brentwood, by Ricardo Legorreta; The Andalusia Courtyard Apartments in Hollywood; and Casa Pacifica, the former home of Richard Nixon, overlooking the ocean in San Clemente. Brief narratives highlight the history of each building and its design influences on the Spanish-revival movement in California. The Spanish revival grew in popularity around the turn of the century when many young American architects traveled to Spain, Italy, and Mexico, bringing back sketches and, as the foreword notes, romantic memories of \\"graceful foliage...small Indian towns...tiled dome and rococo towers.\\" Hundreds of Spanish-style houses, apartments, and bungalows were built throughout Southern California in the following decades, many of them commissioned for movie stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Rudolph Valentino. The Spanish revival is marked by two main phases: the mission revival, which incorporates the white stucco, cloistered patios, tile roofs, and exposed-beam ceilings typical of eighteenth-century California missions; and the more elaborate Mediterranean revival, influenced by Spanish and Italian Renaissance sources, eighteenth-century Spanish plateresque and churrigueresque forms, and Moorish-Andalusian styles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kjtUAAAAMAAJ&dq=Casa+California:+Spanish-Style+Houses+from+Santa+Barbara+to+San+Clemente&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hooked on Phonics","description":"Hooked on Phonics?

But if the commentary is a rarity, its subject matter the seven-line invocation of Padmasambhava is one of the best-known prayers in the Tibetan Buddhist world. The overall significance of the Seven-Line Prayer is perhaps best appreciated in relation to a practice called guru-yoga, or \\"union with the nature of the guru.\\" The purpose of guru-yoga is to purify and deepen the student's relationship with his or her teacher. It is introduced as one of the preliminary practices, and it remains crucial in fact, its importance increases as one progresses through the more advanced levels of the tantric path. The cultivation of devotion to the guru and the blending of one's mind with his or her enlightened mind is, in the words of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, \\"the most vital and necessary of all practices and is in itself the surest and fastest way to reach the goal of enlightenment.\\" Regarding the origin of this commentary, Mipham refers in the colophon to an event that triggered the abrupt appearance in his mind of the hidden meaning of the prayer. It is interesting to note that the language Mipham uses suggests that the commentary itself is not an ordinary composition but perhaps a treasure teaching, specifically a \\"mind-treasure\\" or gongter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LWLZCwAAQBAJ&dq=White+Lotus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE LOVED DEAD","description":"H.P.

The second part examines contemporary theories of world politics, including liberal and realist International Relations theories and the work of Habermas, Hardt and Negri, Virilio and Agamben. In each case, it is argued, assumptions about political time ensure the identification of the particular temporality of western experience with the political temporality of the world as such and put the theorist in the unsustainable position of holding the key to the direction of world history. In the final chapter, the book draws on postcolonial and feminist thinking, and the philosophical accounts of political time in the work of Derrida and Deleuze, to develop a new  untimely  way of thinking about time in world politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O2S5DwAAQBAJ&dq=This+Time+The+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Two-mile Time Machine: Ice Cores, Abrupt Climate Change, and Our Future","description":"In the 1990s Richard B. Alley and his colleagues made headlines with the discovery that the last ice age came to an abrupt end over a period of only three years. In The Two-Mile Time Machine, Alley tells the fascinating history of global climate changes as revealed by reading the annual rings of ice from cores drilled in Greenland. He explains that humans have experienced an unusually temperate climate compared to the wild fluctuations that characterized most of prehistory. He warns that our comfortable environment could come to an end in a matter of years and tells us what we need to know in order to understand and perhaps overcome climate changes in the future. In a new preface, the author weighs in on whether our understanding of global climate change has altered in the years since the book was first published, what the latest research tells us, and what he is working on next.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ImqYDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Two-mile+Time+Machine:+Ice+Cores,+Abrupt+Climate+Change,+and+Our+Future&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Survey of Zairian Art:","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Kq5kswEACAAJ&dq=Survey+of+Zairian+Art:&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anne Frank the Diary of a Young Girl","description":"Anne Frank hield van 12 juni 1942 tot 1 augustus 1944 een dagboek bij. Zij schreef haar brieven alleen voor zichzelf, tot ze in de lente van 1944 op radio Oranje de minister van Onderwijs, Kunsten en Wetenschappen in ballingschap, Bolkestein, hoorde spreken. Hij zei dat na de oorlog alle getuigenissen van het lijden van het Nederlandse volk onder de Duitse bezetting verzameld en openbaar moesten worden gemaakt. Als voorbeeld noemde hij onder andere dagboeken. Onder de indruk van deze redevoering besloot Anne Frank na de oorlog een boek te publiceren. Haar dagboek zou daarvoor als basis dienen. In maart 1945 stierf Anne Frank op vijftienjarige leeftijd in het concentratiekamp Bergen-Belsen. De enige overlevende van de familie, Otto Frank, zorgde ervoor dat het dagboek van zijn dochter toch gepubliceerd werd. In 1947 verscheen Het Achterhuis. Het is sindsdien een van de meest gelezen boeken ter wereld. Het is in meer dan dertig landen verschenen en er zijn meer dan zestien miljoen exemplaren van verkocht. \\"E n enkele Anne Frank ontroert ons meer dan de ontelbaren die net zo leden als zij, maar wier beeld in de schaduw is gebleven. Misschien moet dat ook zo zijn: als we het leed van alle mensen moesten en konden meelijden, zouden we niet kunnen leven.\\" Primo Levi","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ouD9Ifi8WQUC&dq=Anne+Frank+the+Diary+of+a+Young+Girl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photoelectron Spectroscopy: Principles and Applications (Advanced Texts in Physics)","description":"The author, S.

The 1970s terrorist attacks by the PLO, the Provisional Irish Republican Army, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Japanese Red Army, the Unabomber, Aum Shinrikyo, Timothy McVeigh, the World Trade Center attacks, the assault on a school in Russia, and suicide bombers have all made the term terrorism an all-too-common part of our vocabulary.This edition of Political Terrorism was originally published in the 1980s, well before some of the horrific events noted above.

Beginning in Britain, Freemasonry swept across Europe in the mid-eighteenth century in astonishing fashion--yet its origins are still hotly debated today. The prevailing assumption has been that it emerged in England around 1700, but David Stevenson demonstrates that the real origins of modern Freemasonry lie in Scotland around 1600, when the system of lodges was created by stonemasons with rituals and secrets blending medieval mythology with Renaissance and seventeenth-century history. This fascinating work of historical detection will be essential reading for anyone interested in Renaissance and seventeenth-century history, for freemasons themselves, and for those readers captivated by the secret societies at the heart of the bestselling The Da Vinci Code. David Stevenson is Emeritus Professor of Scottish History at the University of St. Andrews. His many previous publications include The Scottish Revolution, 1637-1644; Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Scotland, 1644-1651; and The First Freemasons; Scotland, Early Lodges and their Members.

In punishment, Zeus chained him to a rock, where an eagle clawed unceasingly at his liver, until Herakles freed him. For the Greeks, the myth of Prometheus's release reflected a primordial law of existence and the fate of humankind. Carl Ker nyi examines the story of Prometheus and the very process of mythmaking as a reflection of the archetypal function and seeks to discover how this primitive tale was invested with a universal fatality, first in the Greek imagination, and then in the Western tradition of Romantic poetry. Ker nyi traces the evolving myth from Hesiod and Aeschylus, and in its epic treatment by Goethe and Shelley; he moves on to consider the myth from the perspective of Jungian psychology, as the archetype of human daring signifying the transformation of suffering into the mystery of the sacrifice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FdPgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"24: The House Special Subcommittee's Findings at CTU","description":"Last season, CIA agent Jack Bauer, played by Golden Globe award-winning actor Keifer Sutherland, had us glued to our TVs and cursing the time clock as he uncovered a plot to assassinate presidential nominee, David Palmer. With just 24 hours to identify the killer, Bauer also had to deal with the kidnapping of his wife and daughter and the existence of a mole at the agency. This season he's at it again, helping President David Palmer save Los Angeles from nuclear ravage. Lest you think Jack had some down time between life-altering experiences, check out 24: The House Special Subcommittees Findings at CTU. It's a new book providing a riveting account of Jack's grueling appearance before our government's most inquiring minds during their probe into alleged wrongdoings at CTU that first fateful 24 hour period.

Do the ancient writings of the Bible and other texts provide proof of their existence? Did the \\"prophets\\" have close encounters with ancient aliens? Were the \\"angels\\" physical beings sent to perform specific tasks by their alien masters? Ancient Aliens in the Bible answers these questions and more. Analyzing the historical and archaeological evidence, and using the work of former Vatican translator Mauro Biglino as his guide, Xaviant Haze provides ample proof that what our ancestors described in ancient biblical texts were real-life events and not visions. The UFO encounters in the Bible are described as concrete experiences by flesh-and-blood beings. The angels were assigned specific duties and struggled to carry them out; some even rebelled and took earthly wives, forbidden by their superiors. Ancient Aliens in the Bible reveals that: Lamech's wife gave birth to the son of an angel with glowing eyes. Moses was led to the promised land by UFOs. Noah's great-grandfather, Enoch, got a heavenly tour of space.

After years of hype, extended reality augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) has entered the mainstream. Commercially available, relatively inexpensive VR headsets transport wearers to other realities fantasy worlds, faraway countries, sporting events in ways that even the most ultra-high-definition screen cannot. AR glasses receive data in visual and auditory forms that are more useful than any laptop or smartphone can deliver. Immersive MR environments blend physical and virtual reality to create a new reality. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, technology writer Samuel Greengard offers an accessible overview of developments in extended reality, explaining the technology, considering the social and psychological ramifications, and discussing possible future directions. Greengard describes the history and technological development of augmented and virtual realities, including the latest research in the field, and surveys the various shapes and forms of VR, AR, and MR, including head-mounted displays, mobile systems, and goggles. He examines the way these technologies are shaping and reshaping some professions and industries, and explores how extended reality affects psychology, morality, law, and social constructs. It's not a question of whether extended reality will become a standard part of our world, he argues, but how, when, and where these technologies will take hold. Will extended reality help create a better world? Will it benefit society as a whole? Or will it merely provide financial windfalls for a select few? Greengard's account equips us to ask the right questions about a transformative technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=a06qDwAAQBAJ&dq=Virtual+Reality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jews Without Money.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=p80RAQAAIAAJ&dq=Jews+Without+Money.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fashion doll fantasy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HOa_AAAACAAJ&dq=Fashion+doll+fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Little Something: More Than 150 Snacks, Appetizers, And Hors D'oeuvres For Every Craving And Occasion","description":"Every now and then, you need A Little Something.

It demonstrates that the handbooks of Aristotle, Cicero, et al. discuss a form of oratory which was limited with respect to subject, venue and style of communication, and that Galatians falls outside such boundaries. The inapplicability of ancient canons of rhetoric is reinforced by a detailed comparison of Galatians with the handbooks, a survey of patristic attitudes towards Paul's communicative technique, and interaction with twentieth-century discussions of the nature of New Testament Greek. Dr Kern concludes that rhetorical handbooks were never a tool of literary criticism and that they cannot assist the search for a distinctly Pauline rhetoric. Thus this study has implications not only for Galatians, but also for other New Testament epistles.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O5cpVemb8B8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adela Cathcart,","description":"A collection of fairy tales, parables and poems by MacDonald--some of which had already appeared in periodicals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qvf3l5bNOkgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to the American Legal System","description":"The authors have retained most of the original text with revisions to reflect new developments, while adding edited reports of many new cases.

But on March 24, 1944, in a courageous attempt by two hundred prisoners to break out through a series of tunnels, seventy-six Allied officers managed to evade capture -- and create havoc behind enemy lines in the months before the Normandy Invasion. This is the incredible story of these brave men who broke free from the supposedly impenetrable barbed wire and watchtowers of Stalag Luft III -- and who played an important role in Allied intelligence operations within occupied Europe. The prisoners developed an intricate espionage network, relaying details of military deployment, bombings, and raids. Some of them were involved in other daring escape attempts, including the famous Wooden Horse episode, also turned into a classic film, and the little-known Sachsenhausen breakout, engineered by five Great Escapers sent to die in the notorious concentration camp on Hitler's personal orders. Tragically, fifty of those involved in the Great Escape were murdered by the Gestapo. Others were recaptured; only a few made it all the way to freedom. This dramatic account of personal heroism is a testament to their ingenuity and achievement -- a stirring tribute to the men who never gave up fighting. Includes eight pages of photographs and illustrations, excerpts from G?ring's testimony during postwar investigations, and a list of the men who escaped.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9PrwiLMqW6YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vaqueros, Cowboys, and Buckaroos: The Genesis and Life of the Mounted North American Herders (M.K.

ETH Zrich)","description":"Combinatorial group theory is a loosely defined subject, with close connections to topology and logic. With surprising frequency, problems in a wide variety of disciplines, including differential equations, automorphic functions and geometry, have been distilled into explicit questions about groups, typically of the following kind: Are the groups in a given class finite (e.g., the Burnside problem)? Finitely generated? Finitely presented? What are the conjugates of a given element in a given group? What are the subgroups of that group? Is there an algorithm for deciding for every pair of groups in a given class whether they are isomorphic or not? The objective of combinatorial group theory is the systematic development of algebraic techniques to settle such questions. In view of the scope of the subject and the extraordinary variety of groups involved, it is not surprising that no really general theory exists. These notes, bridging the very beginning of the theory to new results and developments, are devoted to a number of topics in combinatorial group theory and serve as an introduction to the subject on the graduate level.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0T4BCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spell Compendium (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZpH7uQEACAAJ&dq=Spell+Compendium+(Dungeons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Idiot's Guide to PCS","description":"A guide for the beginning PC user who needs help in the selection, set-up, and maintenance of a computer, its software, and other features such as on-line services","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Fk53PwAACAAJ&dq=Complete+Idiot%27s+Guide+to+PCS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruts in the road","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wl17SwAACAAJ&dq=Ruts+in+the+road&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"eBible Deluxe Edition: The One-Click Bible Study Library","description":"Three Kentucky women find themselves in unexpected and difficult life situations.

Alcoholics who refuse to recognize their condition, people who brush aside suspicions of their partner's infidelity, the wife who doesn't notice that her husband is abusing their daughter - are supposedly 'in denial'. Governments deny their responsibility for atrocities, and plan them to achieve 'maximum deniability'. Truth Commissions try to overcome the suppression and denial of past horrors. Bystander nations deny their responsibility to intervene. Do these phenomena have anything in common? When we deny, are we aware of what we are doing or is this an unconscious defence mechanism to protect us from unwelcome truths? Can there be cultures of denial? How do organizations like Amnesty and Oxfam try to overcome the public's apparent indifference to distant suffering and cruelty? Is denial always so bad - or do we need positive illusions to retain our sanity? States of Denial is the first comprehensive study of both the personal and political ways in which uncomfortable realities are avoided and evaded. It ranges from clinical studies of depression, to media images of suffering, to explanations of the 'passive bystander' and 'compassion fatigue'. The book shows how organized atrocities - the Holocaust and other genocides, torture, and political massacres - are denied by perpetrators and by bystanders, those who stand by and do nothing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wUWaAAAAQBAJ&dq=States+of+Denial&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sophie Horowitz Story","description":"Comic send-up of radical lesbian feminist mores in the","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cLUNsT-gP54C&dq=Sophie+Horowitz+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mercury Outboards, 1-2 Cyl 1965-89 Vol 1(Seloc Publications Marine Manuals)","description":"Nu Lily weet dat Chris verliefd op haar is, wordt ze geconfronteerd met harde keuzes die ze moet maken.

Intimate Enemies, however, is the spellbinding true account of this resilient woman's life -- and the three men who most affected its course. Immediately upon marrying C lestin de Pontalba, Micaela was removed to his family's estate in France. For twenty years her father-in-law attempted to drive her to abandon C lestin; by law he could then seize control of her fortune. He tried dozens of strategies, including at one point instructing the entire Pontalba household to pretend she was invisible. Finally, in 1834, the despairing elder Pontalba trapped Micaela in a bedroom and shot her four times before turning his gun on himself. Miraculously, she survived. Five years later, after securing both a separation from C lestin and legal power over her wealth, Micaela focused her attention on building, following in the footsteps of her late, illustrious father, Andr s Almonester. Her Parisian mansion, the H?tel Pontalba, is today the official residence of the American embassy in France; and her Pontalba Buildings, which flank Jackson's Square in New Orleans, form together with her father's St. Louis Cathedral, Presbytere, and Cabildo one of the loveliest architectural complexes in America. As for C lestin, he eventually suffered a total physical and mental breakdown and begged Micaela to return. She did so, caring for him for the next twenty-three years until her death in 1874. In Intimate Enemies, Christina Vella embroiders the compelling story of the Almonester-Pontalba alliance against a richly woven background of the events and cultures of two centuries and two vivid societies. She provides a window into the yellow fever epidemics that raged in New Orleans; the rebuilding of Paris, the Paris Commune uprising, and the Second Empire of Napoleon III; European ideas of power, class, money, marriage, and love during the baroness' lifetime and their inflection in the New World setting of New Orleans; medical treatments, legal procedures, imperial court life, banking practices, and much more. Combining the historian's meticulous research with the biographer's exacting knowledge of her subject and the novelist's gift for narrative, Vella has crafted a rare cross-genre work that will capture the imagination and admiration of every reader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ti6H71SaTRUC&dq=Intimate+Enemies,+The+Two+Worlds+of+the+Baroness+de+Pontalba&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Machines,","description":"Ray Kurzweil is the inventor of the most innovative and compelling technology of our era, an international authority on artificial intelligence, and one of our greatest living visionaries.

By looking at massacres in schools and offices as post-industrial rebellions, Mark Ames is able to juxtapose the historical place of rage in America with the social climate after Reaganomics began to effect worker's paychecks. But why high schools? Why post offices? Mark Ames examines the most fascinating and unexpected cases, crafting a convincing argument for workplace massacres as modern day slave rebellions. Like slave rebellions, rage massacres are doomed, gory, sometimes inadvertently comic, and grossly misunderstood. Going Postal seeks to contextualize this violence in a world where working isn't and doesn t pay what it used to. Part social critique and part true crime page-turner, Going Postal answers the questions asked by commentators on the nightly news and films such as Bowling for Columbine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EdEDAQAAIAAJ&dq=Going+Postal:+Rage,+Murder,+and+Rebellion:+From+Reagan%27s+Workplaces+to+Clinton%27s+Columbine+and+Beyond&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Broken Angel","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GwqrDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memory Games","description":"The playfulness has great potential in education and children have a natural attraction to games because of the interactivity that they are proportionate.

Moving Mountain delivers Gilman's program for reforming society. She concentrates on measures of rationality and efficiency that could be instituted in her own time, largely with greater social cooperation - equal education and treatment for girls and boys, day-care centers for working women, and other issues still relevant a century later. Herland is a utopian novel. The book describes an isolated society composed entirely of women who reproduce via parthenogenesis. The result is an ideal social order, free of war, conflict and domination. The story is told from the perspective of Van Jennings, a student of sociology who, along with two friends, Terry O. Nicholson and Jeff Margrave, forms an expedition party to explore an area of unchartered land where it is rumored lives a society consisting entirely of women. The three friends do not really believe the rumors as they are unable to conceive of how human reproduction could occur without males. The men speculate about what a society of women would be like, each guessing differently based on the stereotype of women which he holds most dear  With Her in Ourland is the third book in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's utopian trilogy which begins where Moving the Mountain and Herland left off. Gilman masterfully compares our real modern male dominated WORLD with an imaginary perfect society comprised of only woman. Charlotte Perkins Gilman (18601935) was a prominent American feminist, sociologist, novelist, writer of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction, and a lecturer for social reform.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H09ODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where Once We Feared Enemies","description":"Whether we are conscious of it or not, we fear difference. That often unwarranted fear leads us to create enemies in our hearts and minds, and fear was no stranger to Oakhurst Presbyterian Church, as confessed by Pastor Nibs Stroupe: \\"We have listened to one another's stories here, and we have discovered that the people we feared, those monsters we thought would destroy us -- because of different skin colors, different genders, different sexual orientations, different economic categories -- they are really our sisters and brothers, the folks for whom our hearts long.\\" In the 1960s the Oakhurst congregation was 900 members strong, but by the time Nibs Stroupe arrived in 1983, \\"white flight\\" had left less than 100 on the church's dwindling membership rolls. Since then, Oakhurst has undergone an extraordinary transformation, re-inventing itself as a growing community that welcomes everyone. The congregation has attracted national attention for its radically inclusive and egalitarian diversity, which extends beyond racial integration to class, gender, sexual orientation, and theological perspective. How have people from such dissimilar backgrounds come together to create a harmonious and thriving whole? In what biblical vision is it rooted and shaped? By what theological resources is it fed and sustained? The heart of the answer to these questions lies in the exceptional sermons of Nibs Stroupe. Growing out of the experience of a multicultural congregation in which diversity is both valued and feared, these messages offer an uncompromising prophetic vision of the American church's identity and mission. Stroupe firmly grounds a liberal social viewpoint within the biblical and theological traditions of the church, and he calls us to hear God's claim on us in our place and in our time. Underlying his powerful sermons is the fundamental conviction that the barriers that separate us from our neighbors have been brought down in Jesus Christ. \\"Where Once We Feared Enemies\\" will be an indispensable addition to any pastor's library. It is also inspiring and enlightening reading for anyone interested in the future of the American church, as well as its role in the continuing stories of race relations, civil rights, and peace and justice issues. \\"These sermons are not your typical \\"social action\\" homilies. Rather Nibs Stroupe cuts to the quick of the biblical message of Jesus as it impacts the minds and hearts of thinking people of every race, class, and political stripe. This is theologically rich fare that will satisfy and energize Christians and non-Christians alike. These are the kind of no-nonsense sermons that have made Oakhurst one of the most faithful and consistent witnesses to the love and justice-making of the gospel that I have seen in more than half a century of ministry.\\" Gayraud S. Wilmore Emeritus Professor of African-American Church History Interdenominational Theological Center Gibson \\"Nibs\\" Stroupe and his wife, Caroline Leach, have been the pastors of Oakhurst Presbyterian Church in Decatur, Georgia, since 1983. They are the co-authors of \\"O Lord, Hold Our Hands,\\" a book detailing Oakhurst's unique multicultural ministry. Stroupe is also the author of\\" While We Run This Race,\\" which won the 1996 Gustavus Myers Award for outstanding book on human rights. Stroupe and his Oakhurst ministry have been featured in\\" Time,\\" the \\"Wall Street Journal,\\" and the \\"Christian Science Monitor,\\" on \\"NBC Nightly News,\\" CNN, and National Public Radio, and in several books.

Many authors offer advice on adapting plants to the desert; now Mary Irish tells how gardeners can better adapt themselves to the challenge. Drawing on her experience with public horticulture in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Irish explores the vexations and delights of desert gardening. She offers practical advice on plants and gardening practices for anyone who lives in the Southwest, from El Paso to Palm Springs, Tucson to Las Vegas. Irish encourages readers who may be new to the desert?or desert dwellers who may be new to gardening?to stop struggling against heat, aridity, and poor soils and instead learn to use and appreciate the wonderful and well-adapted plants native to the desert. She shares information and anecdotes about trees, shrubs, perennials, agaves, cacti, and other plants that make gardening in the Southwest a unique experience, and provides further information about plants from other desert regions that will easily adapt to the Southwest. In addition to descriptions of plants, Irish also offers tips on planting, watering, pruning, and propagation. For anyone who has struggled to maintain a patch of green or blanched at their water bill after unproductive irrigation, the answer to an attractive landscape may be as close as the desert around you. And for anyone who has bought a catalog guide to desert plants and not known which to choose, this book can set you on the right path. Mary Irish shows how to take heart in available plants of adaptable beauty in a book to enjoy while waiting for the next planting cycle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wa5h_RTZDpUC&dq=Gardening+in+the+Desert:+A+Guide+to+Plant+Selection+and+Care&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fireworks","description":"For centuries fireworks have been a source of delight and amazement in cultures around the world.

We now know that there is much more to classical mechanics than previously suspected. Derivations of the equations of motion, the focus of traditional presentations of mechanics, are just the beginning. This innovative textbook, now in its second edition, concentrates on developing general methods for studying the behavior of classical systems, whether or not they have a symbolic solution. It focuses on the phenomenon of motion and makes extensive use of computer simulation in its explorations of the topic. It weaves recent discoveries in nonlinear dynamics throughout the text, rather than presenting them as an afterthought. Explorations of phenomena such as the transition to chaos, nonlinear resonances, and resonance overlap to help the student develop appropriate analytic tools for understanding. The book uses computation to constrain notation, to capture and formalize methods, and for simulation and symbolic analysis.

Pages: 45. Chapters: List of One Tree Hill characters, Brooke Davis, Peyton Sawyer, Lucas Scott, Haley James Scott, Nathan Scott, Lily Roe Scott. Excerpt: One Tree Hill is an American television series created by Mark Schwahn for The WB in 2003. After its third season, The WB and UPN merged to form The CW, which is the current broadcaster for the show in the United States. Schwahn serves as executive producer while also writing and directing for the show, including the premieres and finales of all seasons. The show began with nine main characters in its first season. Since then, characters from that first season have left the show, with new main characters having been both written in and out of the series. Originally it followed two half-brothers Lucas and Nathan Scott who started out as enemies but later formed a close bond as brothers. It also followed the brothers various relationships with other female leads during their high-school years and in their early twenties. Chad Michael Murray was the first person to be cast for One Tree Hill. The producers were originally unsure as to who Murray would play. Series creator Mark Schwahn wanted him to play the character of Nathan Scott since Murray had played a bad guy several times before, he felt it was only natural to give him this role. Murray, however, wanted to portray Lucas due to a connection he felt with the character. He felt that he could inhabit the character as the two share several similarities. Murray's mother left him when he was young, and Lucas was abandoned by his father. Murray's passion for the role led the producers to cast him as Lucas. Murray had turned down the lead role of Ryan Atwood in The O.C. to accept the role of Lucas Scott. James Lafferty was later cast in the role of Nathan as he was a good basketball player.

In 1958 Gordon R. Willey and Philip Phillips first published Method and Theory in American Archaeology  a volume that went through five printings, the last in 1967 at the height of what became known as the new, or processual, archaeology. The advent of processual archaeology, according to Willey and Phillips, represented a \\"theoretical debate . . . a question of whether archaeology should be the study of cultural history or the study of cultural process.\\" Willey and Phillips suggested that little interpretation had taken place in American archaeology, and their book offered an analytical perspective; the methods they described and the structural framework they used for synthesizing American prehistory were all geared toward interpretation. Method and Theory served as the catalyst and primary reader on the topic for over a decade. This facsimile reprint edition of the original University of Chicago Press volume includes a new foreword by Gordon R. Willey, which outlines the state of American archaeology at the time of the original publication, and a new introduction by the editors to place the book in historical context.

A radio broadcaster and journalist for Edward R. Murrow at CBS, William Shirer was new to the world of broadcast journalism when he began keeping a diary while on assignment in Europe during the 1930s. It was in 1940, when he was still a virtual unknown, that Shirer wondered whether his eyewitness account of the collapse of the world around Nazi Germany could be of any interest or value as a book. Shirer s Berlin Diary, which is considered the first full record of what was happening in Germany during the rise of the Third Reich, appeared in 1941. The book was an instant success and would not be the last of his expert observations on Europe. Shirer returned to the European front in 1944 to cover the end of the war. As the smoke cleared, Shirer who watched the birth of a monster that threatened to engulf the world now stood witness to the death of the Third Reich. End of a Berlin Diary chronicles this year-long study of Germany after Hitler. Through a combination of Shirer s lucid, honest reporting, along with passages on the Nuremberg trials, copies of captured Nazi documents, and an eyewitness account of Hitler s last days, Shirer provides insight into the unrest, the weariness, and the tentative steps world leaders took towards peace.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PqgJDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abraham: The First Historical Biography","description":"The world's three largest faiths all find a common root in one man: Abraham.

Editor Hesseltine tackles the historiography of northern and southern prisons during the American Civil War. He attempts to bring closure to the legendary northern myth that the Southern government did its best to \\"exterminate\\" Union prisoners by calling the effective northern war propaganda a wartime \\"psychosis.\\" Furthermore, the author offers his analysis over the much debated prisoner exchange system, and comes down hard on the North, especially its government and General Ulysses S. Grant, for their questionable approach to this issue. For all the serious scholarship and popular writing devoted to the American Civil War, the topic of prisoner-of-war camps, more than any other, retains the feeling of horror and passion that characterized the war years themselves, \\"Men held captive under such circumstances, guilty of no offense other than the deplorable misfortune of having been captured by the enemy, suffer tremendous psychological punishment as well as physical hardship. Monotony, estrangement and fear, along with privation and often brutality, combine to create nearly as wretched a quality of human life as is imaginable. The sufferings of Civil War prisoners (are) documented in this re-issue of an early number of the journal Civil War History ....Recounted there....are prisoner experiences in four Confederate installations: Andersonville, Georgia; Libby in Richmond, Virginia; Cahaba, Alabama; and Charleston, South Carolina. The remaining articles treat conditions in four Union prisons: Fort Warren in Boston harb  Rock Island, Illinois; Elmira, New York; and Johnson's Island on Lake Erie....in addition to some examples of sparkling and vivid prose, this volume contains a number of excellent photographs as well as an introduction by the late William B.

On the one hand, ecology is a field science that has thrived on the study of concrete spatial entities, such as islands, forests or rivers. These spaces are the workplaces in which ecological phenomena are identified, observed and experimented on. They provide both epistemic opportunities and constraints that structure the agenda and the analytical sensibilities of ecological researchers. On the other hand, ecological knowledge and practices have become important resources through which spaces and places are classified, delineated, explained, experienced and managed. The impact of these activities reaches far beyond the realms of the ecological discipline. Many ecological concepts such as \\"biotopes,\\" \\"ecosystems\\" and \\"the biosphere\\" have become entities that widely resonate in public life and policy making. This book explores the mutual entanglement between space and knowledge-making in the history of ecology. Its first goal is to explore to which extent a spatial perspective can shed new light on the history of ecological science. Second, it uses ecology as a critical site to gain broader insights into the history of the environment in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Via a series of case studies  discussing topics that range from ecological field stations in the early-twentieth century Caribbean over wisent breeding in Nazi Germany to computer modelling in North American deserts  the book offers a tour through the changing landscapes of modern ecology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5AkqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary Ranches of Texas (Texas Pan American Series)","description":"Alphabetically arranged entries explore the lives and works of seventy-five contemporary poets representing a dozen different ethnic backgrounds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FYK0Cqd-m-kC&dq=Contemporary+Ranches+of+Texas+(Texas+Pan+American+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foreign Studies","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CGbmC-9y_WQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Total Control: The Monkees Michael Nesmith Story","description":"Hey!

Drawing on a vast corpus of over 80 works and integrating the latest research in multimodality and stylistics, Linda Pilli re analyses the modifications introduced to make British English texts more culturally acceptable and accessible to the American English reader. From paratextual differences in cover, illustrations, typeface and footnotes to dialectal changes to lexis, tense, syntax and punctuation, Pilli re explores the sociocultural and ideological pressures involved in intralingual translation and shows how the stylistic effects of such changes  including loss of meaning, voice, rhythm and word play  often result in a more muted American edition. In doing so, she reveals how homing in on numerous small adjustments can provide fascinating insights into the American publishing process and readership.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h6IjEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sleigh Bells and Snowflakes: A Celebration of Christmas","description":"From dashing through the snowdrifts on an open sleigh to celebrating the magic of the season with family and friends, a stunning collection of poems and songs captures the warmth, cheer, and excitement of Christmas. 17,500 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OvqZjKC_n1UC&dq=Sleigh+Bells+and+Snowflakes:+A+Celebration+of+Christmas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Amazing Art of Pyrography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qyX3PAAACAAJ&dq=The+Amazing+Art+of+Pyrography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The war with Hannibal: Books XXI-XXX of The history of Rome from its foundation (Penguin classics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xLVHngEACAAJ&dq=The+war+with+Hannibal:+Books+XXI-XXX+of+The+history+of+Rome+from+its+foundation+(Penguin+classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jutland 1916: Clash of the Dreadnoughts (Campaign)","description":"The only major fleet engagement of World War I (1914-1918), the Battle of Jutland (1916) has been surrounded by controversy ever since.

Now the Emperor of the West, the Augustus Galen Atreus, will come to the aid of the Emperor of the East, the Augustus Heraclius, to lift the siege of Constantinople and carry a great war to the very doorstep of the Shahanshah of Persia. It is a war that will be fought with armies both conventional and magical, with bright swords and the darkest necromancy. Against this richly detailed canvas of alternate history and military strategy, Thomas Harlan sets the intricate and moving stories of four people. Dwyrin MacDonald is a Hibernian student at a school for sorcerers in Upper Egypt, until he runs afoul of powerful political interests and is sent off half-trained to the Legions. His teacher, Ahmet,undertakes to follow Dwyrin and aid him, but Ahmet is drawn into service with the queen of Palmeyra. Thyatis is a young female warrior, extensively trained by her patron in the arts of covert warfare. And Maxian Atreus is Galens youngest brother, a physician and sorcerer. He has discovered that an enemy of Rome has placed a dreadful curse on the City, which must be broken before Rome can triumph.

This edition includes far-reaching suggestions for research that could increase the impact that classroom teaching has on actual learning. Like the original edition, this book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to a number of compelling questions. When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do-with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively? New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb. How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. Topics include: How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain. How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn. What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach. The amazing learning potential of infants. The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace. Learning needs and opportunities for teachers. A realistic look at the role of technology in education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QZb7PnTgSCgC&dq=How+People+Learn:+Brain,+Mind,+Experience,+and+School:+Expanded+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cat Island (Privateers and Gentlemen, Volume Five)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ENsYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Cat+Island+(Privateers+and+Gentlemen,+Volume+Five)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Research Methods for the Behavioral Sciences","description":"RESEARCH METHODS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, Fifth Edition, helps readers see how interesting and exciting experimental and nonexperimental research can be.

Schoeps interprets Paul's theology in the light of his Jewish background, which coloured and conditioned his Christological teaching. Paul's conception of Jesus differs from that of the Synoptics: what and how extensive the difference is and whence it is derived are among the questions Schoeps examines. After surveying major problems in Pauline research, the Author relates the apostle to primitive Christianity, discussing his eschatology and his teachings on salvation, the law, and saving history. The final chapter shows that Paul's distinctive doctrines result from two converging factors, that Paul never saw Jesus in the flesh, and the influence of Jewish teaching. The consequence was his concern with the resurrected Saviour of the world, the pre-existent and eternal Son of God. Schoeps shows that Paul betrayed a fundamental misconception of the law and the covenantal agreement between God and his chosen people. The result is a thought-provoking, and somewhat startling, study of the first, the greatest, and the most difficult of all Christian theologians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OIviDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Community That Is Christian","description":"Makes theology accessible to a wider audience, introducing readers to the core doctrines of the Christian faith and encouraging them to connect belief with everyday life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0vVqlfXX7fQC&dq=Community+That+Is+Christian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Face: Images of Christ in Art","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=o-JBzwEACAAJ&dq=His+Face:+Images+of+Christ+in+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mom Doth Murder Sleep","description":"Trouble is afoot, and Mom is on the case!

Lawrence, writing of the poems that had meant most to him, said that they were \`still not woven so deep in me as the rather banal Nonconformist hymns that penetrated through and through my childhood'. It is not easy to account for this, and most writing about hymns has not helped because it has concentrated on their content and function in worship and liturgy. In the present book the author tries to account for feelings like Lawrence's by examining the hymn form and its progress through the centuries from the Reformation to the present day. He begins by discussing the status of a hymn text and relates it to the demands made upon it by the needs of singing. A chronological study then traces the development of the English hymn, from the metrical psalms of the Reformation, through the seventeenth century and Isaac Watts to the Wesleys, Cowper, Toplady, and others, and then to the great flood of hymn writing that occurred during the Victorian period, together with the great success of Hymns Ancient and Modern. There are chapters on American hymnody and women's hymn writing, and sections on gospel hymns and the translation of German hymnody. A final chapter takes the story into the twentieth century, with a brief postscript on the revival of hymn writing since 1960.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TQhREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Entitlement","description":"Mead's timely and closely reasoned analysis makes a strong intellectual and moral case for a more authoritative welfare policy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J7VD5plVv_YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Endophysics: The World As an Interface","description":"What do yin-yang and the Lorenzian butterfly in chaos have in common?

Defined as  the quality of being masculine, 1 which means  having the qualities or appearance considered to be typical of men; connected with or like men, 2 the term  Black Masculinity  refers to  the qualities of being masculine and black.  This definition sounds very logical at first sight. Moreover, when using this term as normative standard,  the asymmetrical pendant to the more critically investigated femininity, 3 and therefore inventing fictional characters enacting or rejecting stereotypes of masculinity, it serves a certain order and makes life and abstract understanding easier. But if you reflect on the analysis of masculinity which should not be limited to  typical male behaviour and sexuality  and which should not only be a matter of individual identity but the organisation and representation of the social, these formal definitions are too easy. Therefore masculinity in a wider sense is understood as a form of identity of men that cannot be isolated from other dimensions of identity. Social conditions of manliness and equality are always connected with issues of race, class, gender and sexuality. Especially within the ideological structure of a patriarchal culture, heterosexual masculinity has traditionally been structured as the normative gender. Therefore patriarchal culture has a simple interpretation of gay men:  They lack masculinity, 4 which is reinforced by the statement:  If someone is attracted to the masculine, then that person must be feminine. 5 These beliefs create a dilemma about masculinity for men who are attracted to other men, that means homosexual white men, but also black men, if you think of living in a multicultural society and consider the colour of skin. 1 Sally Wehmeier/ A S Hornby (1999), Oxford Advanced Learner ?s Dictionary Sixth Edition (Oxford University Press), p.786. 2 Ibid. 3 Maurice Berger et al.

They are a wide-ranging hunter who is more than capable of hunting in both fields and wet or dry moorland terrain. The Irish Setter has a moderately long, silky double coat that is normally either of a red or chestnut coloration. The breed's undercoat is abundant in winter weather, while the top coat is fine all year around. The Irish Setter's coat feathers around their tail, chest, ears, legs and body. The temperament of dogs is normally affected by the following factors: individual personality, heredity, training and socialization. It is therefore important to make sure that you meet the puppy's mother before purchasing a Irish Setter. It is also important to make sure to thoroughly socialize your Irish Setter with strangers, children and other animals during its puppyhood. Generally speaking, the Irish Setter is an incredibly friendly, intelligent, enthusiastic and loyal household pet. They get along well with strangers and small children. However it is important to note that the Irish Setter has a high prey drive, due to their hunting history. It is therefore not recommend to keep an Irish Setter in the same household as a smaller pet (such as a cat) - although it is possible to socialize your Irish Setter with small animals during its puppyhood which could lead to the Irish Setter living peacefully with smaller household pets. The Irish Setter responds well to human interaction and companionship. The breed is therefore relatively easy to train with positive reinforcement. It is important to note that as a working breed, the Irish Setter has a high amount of energy which needs to be expended. If the Irish Setter has a buildup of energy it is likely to develop destructive behaviors due to boredom or hyperactivity. Before purchasing any pet it is important to understand that as a pet owner you are responsible for the care and wellbeing of your pet. It is important to try and learn as much as you can about the animal you are considering to keep as a pet to make sure that your lifestyle, household and financial status are suited to provide your pet with the best possible care. This guide has been designed to provide you with both precise and concise information about a Irish Setter's basic needs to help you provide your pet with the best quality care practices. This guide will give an in-depth explanation on training your Irish Setter, raising your Irish Setter from a puppy, grooming, health care and everything in between! \\"The Irish Setter: A Complete and Comprehensive Owners Guide to: Buying, Owning, Health, Grooming, Training, Obedience, Understanding and Caring for Your Irish Setter,\\" by Michael Stonewood is the perfect purchase or gift for a first time Irish Setter owner.

Such incredibly rapid brain activity can lead to confusion, fear, tension, stress, and anxiety.

All efficient short-term distractions, none is a permanent salve.The One-Minute Meditator shows readers how to harness the innate drive for quick mental escapes and use that urge to quiet our thoughts from within. Proving that meditation is both physically and emotionally healthful, Nichol and Birchard show readers how to meditate whenever they have a solitary minute or more: on the walk from the parking lot to the office, while waiting in line, while on hold on the phone, or while trying to fall asleep.

He inherited a strong dollar and sound fiscal policy. He inherited a nation whose economy was so strong that commentators who just a decade before were predicting American decline were now complaining about American dominance. And yet, Dubya blew it.

It's Still the Economy, Stupid is the story of how America's CEO -- our first MBA president -- has trashed our economy. It shows: ? How he wasted the surplus on massive tax cuts for the hyper-rich. ? How he talked down the economy for his short-term political gain, then passed an economic program that has put 1.8 million Americans out of work and cost investors $4.4 trillion. ? How he abandoned his free-trade rhetoric to adopt protectionist tariffs, effectively raising taxes on consumers. ? How he walked away from needed investments in education, training, and all the things that make us smarter, safer, and stronger economically. ? How he plans to go on from here to cripple Social Security and to allow the privileged to avoid even more taxes.

It concerns the nature and function, reality and fiction of such images in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden past and present. The book is intended to be a source of solid information as well as a starting point for further inquiries into its cultural territory. Part of its focus is on images of America rooted in printed sources, but, in addition, general surveys of other cultural signs of America in the Scandinavian countries present a broader picture and provide some of the background for the predominantly literary images. Issues such as government and politics, popular and vanguard music and art, and socio-cultural institutions intermittently come to the fore. Framing the volume's three pairs of national surveys is an introductory chapter, which addresses the entire subject from a bird's-eye view, and a concluding chapter, which, by contrast, delves into the cross-fire of sentiments defining people whose images of America, are both American and Scandinavian. The discussion of America as perceived in Scandinavia sheds new light on intriguing inter-Scandinavian cultural distinctions and borderlines. Countless books and articles, methods and theories, have been devoted to the study of national and cultural identity. Still, the exchanges between such identities and the images they engender - so indispensable for the participants in a global culture - remain clouded by many misconceptions. Images of America in Scandinavia whose editors and authors all have Scandinavian backgrounds, will contribute an improved understanding of the cultural interplay between Scandinavia and the United States of America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FxcK1c3s5JYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crusader Rabbit in Bubble Trouble","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8ukwtwAACAAJ&dq=Crusader+Rabbit+in+Bubble+Trouble&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The electric kool-aid acid test","description":"Relates the escapades of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, a drug-saturated group of hippies who journey in and out of trouble with the law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gr6gkDxyxnIC&dq=The+electric+kool-aid+acid+test&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Don't Want to Take a Nap!","description":"Bobby the bear does not want to leave his friends to nap over the long winter, and he keeps thinking of reasons to get out of bed and disturb his parents' rest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=i-YRtAEACAAJ&dq=I+Don%27t+Want+to+Take+a+Nap!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Countries and Concepts","description":"NOTE: You are purchasing a standalone product; MyPoliSciLab? does not come packaged with this content.

Then, suddenly and without warning, Gerald disappears to far-off America in the company of the caddish Fitzwilliam Canterby, there to fall into the clutches of the lovely, dangerous Miss Chastity Brown. When Charlotte finds herself forced by her father into an engagement to the notorious Marquis of Beresford, who can promise her only a lifetime of cold courtesy and callous betrayal, she can bear it no longer.

The breed is commonly also known as the 'Dutch Barge Dog' and the 'Smiling Dutchman.' The breed is known for its unique plush two-layered coat, curled tail and its silver and black fur with a ruff around its neck. The breed is closely related to other breeds within the Spitz typing such as the Mittelsplitz, Kleinspitz and Pomeranian. The breed was originally called the 'German Spitz,' but the breed's name was changed in 1926 to the Keeshond. The first breed standard for the Keeshond was posted at a dog show in Berlin in 1880. The breed is sturdily built with a wedge-shaped head, a medium-sized muzzle, a tightly curled tail and a pair of small pointed ears. The Keeshond's ruff is a good way to guess the dog's gender: males tend to have a much thicker and more pronounced ruff than females. The temperament of dogs is normally affected by the following factors: individual personality, heredity, training and socialization. It is therefore important to make sure that you meet the puppy's mother before purchasing a Keeshond. It is also important to make sure to thoroughly socialize your Keeshond with strangers, children and other animals during its puppyhood. Generally speaking, the Keeshond is known to be an extremely playful breed with a love of physical exercise and athletics. The breed as a whole seems very eager to please humans, which actually leads to the Keeshond being a highly trainable breed. Their intelligence and trainability has led to the Keeshond being used as a guide dog. The Keeshond makes an excellent family dog as they love human contact and get along very well with children and other household pets. The breed is also known to be incredibly empathetic as was actually the first choice for 'comfort dogs' to help the rescue works after the tragedy of 9/11. It is important to note that as a working and sporting breed, the Keeshond has a high amount of energy which needs to be expended. If the Keeshond has a buildup of energy it is likely to develop destructive behaviors due to boredom or hyperactivity. Before purchasing any pet it is important to understand that as a pet owner you are responsible for the care and wellbeing of your pet. It is important to try and learn as much as you can about the animal you are considering to keep as a pet to make sure that your lifestyle, household and financial status are suited to provide your pet with the best possible care. This guide has been designed to provide you with both precise and concise information about a Keeshond's basic needs to help you provide your pet with the best quality care practices. This guide will give an in-depth explanation on training your Keeshond, raising your Keeshond from a puppy, grooming, health care and everything in between! \\"The Keeshond: A Complete and Comprehensive Owners Guide to: Buying, Owning, Health, Grooming, Training, Obedience, Understanding and Caring for Your Keeshond,\\" by Michael Stonewood is the perfect purchase or gift for a first time Keeshond owner.

Much of what research there is has explored the experience of laboring or impoverished women, or women of the social elite; by contrast, the essays in this collection take up the study of the participation of middling women in urban life. This volume brings into sharper focus the relationship between changes consequent upon urban development and shifts in the pattern of gender relations in the 18th century. The contributors address such themes as the extent to which to what extent urban change accelerated a redefinition of gender relations; the connections between urban growth, changing definitions of citizenship, and the emergence of the male gendered political subject; the role of women in a literate, consumer and industrializing society; the place of women's networks in the economic, political and social life of the town and the distinctive role played by women in areas such as philanthropy and business; and how the development of urban society in turn inflected contemporary conceputalizations of gender.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V9pADgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cowboy in art,","description":"\\"When Cort s landed at Veracruz in 1519, a band of Aztec artists dispatched by Montezuma hastily sketched pictures of a new and terrifying monster that accompanied the Spaniards--a strange four-legged creature with a tail like straws and the body of a man rising from its shoulders. These drawings were the first pictorial representations of a man on horseback created in the New World. Horses spread rapidly throughout South America and ultimately wild hordes invaded Texas and California. The era of the American cowboy was born. Since that time, the cowboy and his horse have inspired thousands of remarkable works of art. In a magnificent pictorial survey, Ed Ainsworth shows the various ways in which this folk hero has been depicted in painting and sculpture, from the arrival of the Spaniards in the New World to the present. Steeped in the legend and nostalgia that have always surrounded the American cowboy, [this book] tells the complete history of cowboy art and artists--a story as romantic and exciting as the rugged conquests of the cowboys themselves. The artists lured West to paint the visual history of that region in the 19th and early 20th centuries were a restless, spirited breed. Many were cowpunchers and bronco busters; they were courageous men dedicated to a life of adventure. Every important artist of the West is covered in this survey: Charlie Russell and Frederic Remington, most critics' choice for the two greatest painters of the cowboy and Western range scene; Frank Reaugh, dubbed the 'Rembrandt of the Longhorns'; Charles Schreyvogel, whose paintings won special commendation from President Theodore Roosevelt; Olaf Seltzer, who ruined his eyes painting more than l00 miniatures--only 5? x 6?--that are prized by collectors throughout the world; and many, many other noteworthy painters and sculptors. In a fascinating chapter devoted to 'Will James,' Mr. Ainsworth clears up many of the mysteries surrounding this 'Lone Cowboy.' The author also examines the work of the top cowboy artists of today--among them: Peter Hurd, Ken Ralston, Burt Procter, Olaf Wieghorst (who did the painting on the front jacket of this book), Joe De Yong, and Melvin C. Warren (whose paintings have been bought by President Johnson and Governor John Connally of Texas). A chapter entitled 'Cowpunchers in Cartoons' takes a look at Western artists who gained their primary fame as cartoonists--J.R. Williams ('Out Our Way'), Vic Forsythe ('Way Out West'), and Fred Harmon, Jr. ('Red Ryder'). A volume that will be treasured by Western buffs and art lovers alike, The Cowboy in Art is sumptuously illustrated with 250 illustrations in black-and-white and I6 pages in full color.\\"--Dust jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=t7ifAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+cowboy+in+art,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Brothers : A Medic's Sketch Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r9EfAQAACAAJ&dq=Blood+Brothers+:+A+Medic%27s+Sketch+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Morning, Midnight","description":"Saved, rescued, fished-up, half-drowned, out of the deep, dark river, dry clothes, hair shampooed and set...

It was a torturous route across deserts and mountains requiring the kind of expert survival skills that made Kit Carson famous. The scout, who was carrying the news that would begin the rush for gold, went as far as Taos, where he was reunited with his wife. From there Brewerton joined a wagon train that labored over the Santa F  Trail to Independence, Missouri.

Ian Kershaw In de Tweede Wereldoorlog gebruikten Hitler, de nazi-legerleiding en soldaten op grote schaal drugs. Pervitin (methamfetamine), opiaten en morfine waren zeer gangbaar vanaf 1933. Dit is het eerste, veelomvattende boek over drugsgebruik in het Derde Rijk. Norman Ohler bestudeerde vele archieven en bronnen, zoals de logboeken van Hitlers lijfarts, en relateert het drugsgebruik van de nazi's aan militaire acties en historische gebeurtenissen. Het resultaat is een sensationeel boek dat leest als een thriller. Achterin Drugs in het Derde Rijk staan een bijdrage van dr. Stephen Snelders over Nederlands drugsgebruik tijdens WO II, en een bijdrage van de Duitse historicus Hans Mommsen. De Duitse wetenschapsjournalist Norman Ohler (1970) studeerde culturele wetenschappen en filosofie. Voor Drugs in het Derde Rijk wist hij van zijn ruime onderzoeksgegevens een toegankelijk, gedegen en interessant verhaal te maken, dat een unieke bijdrage levert aan onze kennis van en onze visie op Adolf Hitler en de Tweede Wereldoorlog. www.normanohler.com 'Een gedurfd, fascinerend boek.'

This exhaustively researched, well-paced book should take its place as the new, standard biography of the ill-tempered man who helped to save the Union. It is fair, judicious, authoritative, and comprehensive  (The Wall Street Journal). Of the crucial men close to President Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (18141869) was the most powerful and controversial. Stanton raised, armed, and supervised the army of a million men who won the Civil War. He directed military movements. He arrested and imprisoned thousands for  war crimes,  such as resisting the draft or calling for an armistice. Stanton was so controversial that some accused him at that time of complicity in Lincoln s assassination. He was a stubborn genius who was both reviled and revered in his time. Stanton was a Democrat before the war and a prominent trial lawyer. He opposed slavery, but only in private. He served briefly as President Buchanan s Attorney General and then as Lincoln s aggressive Secretary of War. On the night of April 14, 1865, Stanton rushed to Lincoln s deathbed and took over the government since Secretary of State William Seward had been critically wounded the same evening. He informed the nation of the President s death, summoned General Grant to protect the Capitol, and started collecting the evidence from those who had been with the Lincolns at the theater in order to prepare a murder trial. Now Walter Stahr s  highly recommended  (Library Journal, starred review) essential book is the first major account of Stanton in fifty years, restoring this underexplored figure to his proper place in American history.

These all have something in common. They provide great illustrations of the types of profound and wise changes needed in the way we run our affairs if we are to respond to the scale of environmental and social challenges and opportunities facing us. They are examples of \\"societal learning and change\\". Today, this phenomenon is occurring across industries as diverse as resources extraction, infrastructure development, agriculture and information technology at the local, national, regional and global levels. Its essence involves the ability to create rich relationships that bridge large differences. This book describes this phenomenon for practitioners to help them address issues and develop opportunities more effectively. Building on the traditions of individual and organizational learning, this book suggests that our challenge is to create learning societies and processes. This involves both change in ourselves as individuals, but also change in the way the three key systems that make up our societies  the political system (government), economic system (business) and social system (civil society)  function by creating more robust interactions that respond to human and environmental imperatives rather than organizational ones. Societal Learning and Change presents a meta-framework that covers diverse approaches, including corporate citizenship, social responsibility, community development, private-public partnerships, inter-sectoral collaboration and sustainability strategies. It makes sense of all of these by emphasising that they all share the need to change relationships at the societal level and explaining how to do this from a systems perspective. The book helps overcome the conundrum where individual organisations are unsuccessfully trying to achieve big change with their stakeholders. Rather than stakeholder management with an organization-centric viewpoint, this book describes the importance of taking a stakeholder engagement and issue/opportunity-centric strategy. Wherever you are, you can make a contribution to shifting the paradigm through a societal learning and change strategy. The critical contribution is creating new relationships between people and organizations that traditionally would not interact but in fact have common interests. When these relationships become meaningful by addressing a problem or developing an opportunity, people begin to learn about each other and develop mutual appreciation and understanding. Often this process is complicated and confusing. People do not use words in the same way even if they speak the same formal language; they do not learn or perceive the world the same way although they may share a common culture; their organizations have diverse goals, resources and weaknesses that make working together problematic. However, it is these very differences that are the source of the value of working together. Societal Learning and Change aims to make it easier to solve differences in order to work together successfully; it does this by identifying some of the differences as sources of tension and opportunity and describing the development processes of building relationships that can produce mutually rewarding innovation that is unimaginable when the relationship begins. This is an extremely optimistic book at a time of great pessimism about the huge forces of globalization and corporate power that seem to be overwhelming us. It will be essential reading for students and practitioners in the fields of organizational learning, sustainability, poverty, international development and stakeholder relations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3G1QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The comic Blackstone","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mKADAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Algebra (Barron's College Review Series.

But, as John Shaw shows, the campaign also proved to be a major military success. Most histories of the Vietnam War either give the Cambodian invasion short shrift or merely criticize it for its political fallout, thus neglecting one of the campaign's key dimensions. Approaching the subject from a distinctly military perspective, Shaw shows how this carefully planned and executed offensive provided essential support for Nixon's \\"decent interval\\" and \\"peace with honor\\" strategies-by eliminating North Vietnamese sanctuaries and supply bases located less than a hundred miles from Saigon and by pushing Communist troops off the Vietnamese border. Despite the political cloud under which the operation was conducted, Shaw argues that it was not only the best of available choices but one of the most successful operations of the entire war, sustaining light casualties while protecting American troop withdrawal and buying time for Nixon's pacification and \\"Vietnamization\\" strategies. He also shows how the United States took full advantage of fortuitous events, such as the overthrow of Cambodia's Prince Sihanouk, the redeployment of North Vietnamese forces, and the late arrival of spring monsoons. Although critics of the operation have protested that the North Vietnamese never did attack out of Cambodia, Shaw makes a persuasive case that the near-border threat was very real and imminent. In the end, he contends, the campaign effectively precluded any major North Vietnamese military operations for over a year. Based on exhaustive research and a deep analysis of the invasion's objectives, planning, organization, and operations, Shaw's shrewd study encourages a newfound respect for one of America's genuine military successes during the war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3oBuAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Cambodian+Campaign:+The+1970+Offensive+and+America%27s+Vietnam+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crashing Suns","description":"CRASHING SUNS BY EDMOND HAMILTONFrom mighty Canopus, capital of the Federated Stars, to the outer fringes of our great galaxy, the Interstellar Patrol was on the watch.

As a composer and balladeer, Niles drew inspiration from the deep well of traditional Appalachian and African American folk songs. At the age of sixteen Niles wrote one of his most enduring tunes,  Go  Way from My Window,  basing it on a song fragment from a black farm worker. This iconic song has been performed by folk artists ever since and may even have inspired the opening line of Bob Dylan s  It Ain t Me Babe.  In I Wonder as I Wander: The Life of John Jacob Niles, the first full-length biography of Niles, Ron Pen offers a rich portrait of the musician s character and career. Using Niles s own accounts from his journals, notebooks, and unpublished autobiography, Pen tracks his rise from farm boy to songwriter and folk collector extraordinaire. Niles was especially interested in documenting the voices of his fellow World War I soldiers, the people of Appalachia, and the spirituals of African Americans. In the 1920s he collaborated with noted photographer Doris Ulmann during trips to Appalachia, where he transcribed, adapted, and arranged traditional songs and ballads such as  Pretty Polly  and  Black Is the Color of My True Love s Hair.  Niles s preservation and presentation of American folk songs earned him the title of  Dean of American Balladeers,  and his theatrical use of the dulcimer is credited with contributing to the popularity of that instrument today. Niles s dedication to the folk music tradition lives on in generations of folk revival artists such as Jean Ritchie, Joan Baez, and Oscar Brand. I Wonder as I Wander explores the origins and influences of the American folk music resurgence of the 1950s and 1960s, and finally tells the story of a man at the forefront of that movement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9_-CTA98IyoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dragon Ball Daizenshu: World Guide","description":"See Dragon Ball with new eyes.

Jakes has emerged as one of the most prolific spiritual leaders of our time. He is pastor of one of the largest churches in the country, CEO of a multimillion dollar empire, the host of a television program, author of a dozen bestsellers, and the producer of two Grammy Award-nominated CDs and three critically acclaimed plays. In 2001 Time magazine featured Jakes on the cover and asked: Is Jakes the next Billy Graham T.D. Jakes draws on extensive research, including interviews with numerous friends and colleagues of Jakes, to examine both Jakes s rise to prominence and proliferation of a faith industry bent on producing spiritual commodities for mass consumption. Lee frames Jakes and his success as a metaphor for changes in the Black Church and American Protestantism more broadly, looking at the ramifications of his rise and the rise of similar preachers for the way in which religion is practiced in this country, how social issues are confronted or ignored, and what is distinctly  American  about Jakes's emergence. While offering elements of biography, the work also seeks to shed light on important aspects of the contemporary American and African American religious experience. Lee contends that Jakes s widespread success symbolizes a religious realignment in which mainline churches nationwide are in decline, while innovative churches are experiencing phenomenal growth. He emphasizes the  American-ness  of Jakes s story and reveals how preachers like Jakes are drawing followers by delivering therapeutic and transformative messages and providing spiritual commodities that are more in tune with postmodern sensibilities. As the first work to critically examine Bishop Jakes s life and message, T.D. Jakes is an important contribution to contemporary American religion as well as popular culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3hYVCgAAQBAJ&dq=Homecooking+with+T+D+Jakes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big Yawn, The","description":"Increasingly larger animals, from a little bug to a terrible tiger, open their mouths in yawns before closing their eyes to go to sleep.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1oY1PAAACAAJ&dq=Big+Yawn,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maggot","description":"A starkly original and heartbreaking tale of friendship and rebellion Winner of the Carnegie Medal and a 2012 Costa Award winner.

Geoffrey Samuel argues that religion in these societies developed as a dynamic amalgam of strands of Indian Buddhism and the indigenous spirit-cults of Tibet. Samuel stresses the diversity of Tibetan societies, demonstrating that central Tibet, the Dalai Lama's government at Lhasa, and the great monastic institutions around Lhasa formed only a part of the context within which Tibetan Buddhism matured. Employing anthropological research, historical inquiry, rich interview material, and a deep understanding of religious texts, the author explores the relationship between Tibet's social and political institutions and the emergence of new modes of consciousness that characterize Tibetan Buddhist spirituality. Samuel identifies the two main orientations of this religion as clerical (primarily monastic) and shamanic (associated with Tantric yoga). The specific form that Buddhism has taken in Tibet is rooted in the pursuit of enlightenment by a minority of the people - lamas, monks, and yogins - and the desire for shamanic services (in quest of health, long life, and prosperity) by the majority. Shamanic traditions of achieving altered states of consciousness have been incorporated into Tantric Buddhism, which aims to communicate with Tantric deities through yoga. The author contends that this incorporation forms the basis for much of the Tibetan lamas' role in their society and that their subtle scholarship reflects the many ways in which they have reconciled the shamanic and clerical orientations. This book, the first full account of TibetanBuddhism in two decades, ranges as no other study has over several disciplines and languages, incorporating historical and anthropological discussion. Viewing Tibetan Buddhism as one of the great spiritual and psychological achievements of humanity, Samuel analyzes a complex society that combines the literacy and rationality associated with centralized states with the shamanic processes more familiar among tribal peoples.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TIkuwQEACAAJ&dq=CIVILIZED+SHAMANS:+Buddhism+in+Tibetan+Societies+(Smithsonian+Series+in+Ethnographic+Inquiry)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Characters from Shakespeare Paper Dolls (Dover Paper Dolls)","description":"Two dolls, 30 detailed period costumes from Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Othello, The Tempest, The Merchant of Venice, Macbeth, Henry V, Richard III, and 7 other great plays.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_HbsGUDC5W8C&dq=Great+Characters+from+Shakespeare+Paper+Dolls+(Dover+Paper+Dolls)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Immortal: The Invisible War (An Alternative Personality Role-Playing Experience)","description":"Haar naam was Henrietta Lacks, maar de medische wereld kent haar als HeLa.

Critics and public alike savaged Guston for his return to figurative art, but today his late work is recognized for the singular power of its darkly hilarious vision. Musa Mayer augments her firsthand knowledge with extensive interviews with his family, friends, students, and colleagues, as well as Guston's own letters, notes, and autobiographical writings, to re-create a turbulent era in American art.

When Norse raiders slaughtered his family and abducted his sister, Corban Loosestrife set out on an odyssey that took him across half the world, from the Viking fortress of Jorvik to the wild and desolate shores of Vinland in the New World. Now, with The Serpent Dreamer, Holland continues this powerful epic, as Corban struggles to make a new life alone in this strange land amid bloody clashes between warring native clans. His service to the King of the Danes concluded, Corban returned to his new home in Vinland to find the colony destroyed, his beloved wife dead, and his twin sister Mav, with whom he shared a mystic bond, transfigured into a numinous being caught between this world and the next. Seeking shelter with a nearby tribe, Corban was shunned for his pale skin and dark, coarse hair, and feared for his strange powers to make fire and cut through the toughest skins with his magic blade. Epashti, the tribe's healer, came to love Corban, and in time bear him children. But Miska, the proud and cunning chief of the Wolf clan, despised Corban - in part because of his strangeness, but more because of Corban's bond with his twin sister, who Miska loves. Mav gave Miska a daughter, but spurned him ever after. Now, Mav's young daughter Ahanton has begun to show some of her mother's strange gifts. When her dream of a mighty army that worships a serpent convinces Miska that his old enemies, the Sun People, are approaching, he sets out to the east to unite the warring tribes into a force that may stand up to the invading army. But another vision compels Corban to travel west, toward the home of the Sun People, taking Espashti and young Anhaton with him. Hailed as an incarnation of Ixewe, the White Buffalo god, and kept as a curiosity by Itza Balam, the Lord of the Serpent Wand,. ruler of the great city of Cibal, Corban will play a pivotal role in a great destiny that will forever alter the world he has come to know.

Through a pioneering application of the theoretical approaches of moral and political economy to Stalin's peasant policy, Hughes reevaluates the causes and processes involved in the great political, economic and social changes in the Soviet countryside. Rather than a bipolarized conflict between state and peasant, he profiles the socially variegated response of different peasant groups to collectivization and dekulakization and argues that it was as much a process involving social conflict between peasants.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QUuEDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quotable Lou: The Wit, Wisdom, and Inspiration of Lou Holtz, College Football's Most Colorful and Engaging Coach (Potent Quotables)","description":"Lou Holtz is one of the most popular, successful, and quotable football coaches in America.

M xico s Nobodies examines two key figures in Mexican history that have remained anonymous despite their proliferation in the arts: the soldadera and the figure of the mulata. B. Christine Arce unravels the stunning paradox evident in the simultaneous erasure (in official circles) and ongoing fascination (in the popular imagination) with the nameless people who both define and fall outside of traditional norms of national identity. The book traces the legacy of these extraordinary figures in popular histories and legends, the Inquisition, ballads such as  La Adelita  and  La Cucaracha,  iconic performers like To?a la Negra, and musical genres such as the son jarocho and danz n. This study is the first of its kind to draw attention to art s crucial role in bearing witness to the rich heritage of blacks and women in contemporary M xico.  No one has written as lovingly and profusely on Mexican minorities as the wonderful B. Christine Arce. Here she writes about soldaderas, women of color, and camp followers the courageous women who followed the troops during the Mexican Revolution. Without these women, soldiers would have deserted and the men would have run back home. Arce has not only captured the essence of Mexican women but also of Afro-Mexicans, who are typically forgotten and purposefully neglected.

Timber is revealed in a different light, and the reader is taught to stop thinking of it in terms of defective beams and boards. Wood only fails as a part of the living tree. To us, the tree and wood biologists, this new definition is a real, inspiring challenge, which is just what Kubler and Mattheck intended it to be.

Their field studies prove the incredible, their hypotheses makes us want to get to the bottom of the un proven unbelievable. The authors' answers and arguments are bold and cour ageous. They arouse our curiosity and force us to fathom the facts. It seems as if Kubler and Mattheck wanted to trick us into believing that trees only live and react following mechanical rules and strategies.

It signalled the end of the monochrome 1950s and heralded the 'Swinging Sixties'. It put rock'n'roll on the map, paving the way for the Beatles, Merseybeat and the 'British invasion' of America. Cochran and Vincent were unlikely friends. Eddie was a West Coast pin-up, prodigiously talented as a guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer. Gene, on the other hand, was a crippled, gun-toting alcoholic, a devil with the voice of an angel and the most potent image in rock'n'roll, that of the dangerous, black leather rebel. Their influence has been felt ever since, from the Sex Pistols to the Jam and the Clash, in songs such as 'Summertime Blues' and 'Be Bop a Lula'. fascinating story of these two men, who defined not just the rock'n'roll way of life but its way of death too: Eddie died prematurely in a crash, with Gene eventually losing a long fight against drugs, drink and despair. Among rock'n'roll fans Eddie and Gene are revered like no one else, even Elvis and Buddy Holly.

Love animates a world where the tangled web of sexuality, commitment, language, place, and history enthralls us with its tantalizing detours, its cruel pretenders, and its unexpected pleasures. These tumultuous pages introduce us to people we can instantly recognize and never forget. From adventures that vividly signal a lifetime's meaning each returns with something new-something utterly different from that which was sought. Here in her first major work in English, we find the pulsing, streaming vision of time, place, history and character that distinguishes Roznoveanu's work in her native Romanian. Roznoveanu restores a visionary spirit lost to English for two or more generations. These stories come to us in the circuitous wake of the great early modernists, offering prodigious healing power for the grave psychic wounds that have afflicted the human condition since the crucial turning point of 1945. The Life Manager and Other Stories scintillates with cascades of luminous images and narrative reversals that seize our attention and don't let go.

Tracking the development of American \\"neighborhood unit\\" concept in independent India s planning practice and literature from the national level policies to on-the-ground applications in the city of Jaipur Vidyarthi explains how a host of actors including neighborhood residents, squatters, politicians and developers made different kinds of plans that assimilated the design concept in line with their practical concerns and cultural preferences creating unique variants of neighborhood urbanism over time. One Idea, Many Plans counters misguided characterization of these unforeseen efforts as  unauthorized  by state authorities. It shows how the frequently informal and tacit plans were neither arbitrary actions nor aimless subversions but purposeful future-oriented efforts that shaped the envisaged sociality and spatiality of Indian cities in more meaningful ways than the official master plans promoting planned neighborhoods. Carefully illustrating the different kinds of plans local actors use to guide incremental adaptation, improvement and investment, Vidyarthi offers insights about how we might improve formal plan making. Scholars, students and professional practitioners interested in different regions of the global south would find these lessons useful as a new generation of city design ideas like sustainability and new urbanism gain traction in an increasingly globalized World.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H72gBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spanish for Teachers","description":"Communicate with your Spanish-speaking students and parents as easy as uno, dos, tres A working knowledge of the Spanish language is an indispensable part of an educator s skill set.

The Rescript contains Confucian and Shinto precepts and was to become the codification of the moral standards of the Japanese way of life in pre-surrender Japan. Despite the attempts of the Japanese education system to embrace democratic principles, postwar dotoku moral education has been essentially the same as that of the prewar system. The author concludes that Confucian ethics is still the engine of Japanese social cohesion and dynamics, and predicts that it will continue to be so for generations to come. Japan needs to find a way to converge the long-held Confucian ideology with more democratic ideals and fairness to all people through moral education.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pKmt85w7atsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Longing (Topaz historical romances)","description":"Unable to overcome the stigma of being a lord's illegitimate daughter despite her education, Sian Jones accepts a job as governess under the wealthy Marquess of Craille, and is unable to deny the ignited passion between them.

The turbulent sixteenth century saw the disintegration of medieval Christendom as it was split into sovereign states. This was particularly destructive in Tudor England, where rapid switches in government policy and religious persecution shattered the lives of many. Especially affected were the monks and nuns who were persecuted by the wholesale dissolution of the monasteries carried out under Henry VIII. One of these monks, Robert Fletcher, a Carthusian of the dismantled priory of Mount Grace in Yorkshire, is the hero of this novel. The story of this strong, vulnerable man is told in counterpoint with the story of one of the most interesting men in all of English history, Reginald Pole, a nobleman, scholar and theologian who was exiled to Italy for twenty years. He was a cardinal of the Church and a papal legate at the Council of Trent. As the archbishop of Canterbury, with his cousin Queen Mary Tudor, he tried, in too short a time, to renew Catholic England. This man, in the tragic last months of his life, becomes in the novel the friend of Robert Fletcher, condemned as a heretic. Readers will learn much from this novel of the anguished period that gave birth to Tridentine Catholicism, the Anglican Church, and other Protestant churches. This same period saw the martyrdom of Thomas More, Thomas Cranmer, John Fisher and many others. The profound issues raised in this novel, which contains no altered historical facts but more human truth than facts alone can deliver, have not gone away.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0-5cDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Time+Before+You+Die:+A+Novel+of+the+Reformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BELLSOUTH DISTRIBUTES THE REAL YELLOW PAGES TO LOUISVILLE AREA.: An article from: RBOC Update","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"ExamWise For A+ Core Hardware Exam 220-221 (With Online Exam)","description":"Annotation.

The Elephant Man is based on the life of John Merrick, who lived in London during the latter part of the nineteenth century. A horribly deformed young man, a freak attraction in traveling side shows, is found abandoned and helpless and is admitted for observation to Whitechapel, a prestigious London hospital. Under the care of a famous young doctor who educates him and introduces him to London society, Merrick changes from a sensational object of pity to the urbane and witty favorite of the aristocracy and literati. But his belief that he can become a man like any other is a dream never to be realized. After premiering in London, The Elephant Man went on to Broadway where it won the Tony for Best Play in 1979. It was later revived in a Broadway production starring Bradley Cooper.  TheElephant Man is a moving drama. Lofted on poetic wings, it nests on the human heart.

Carol Delaney discloses the powerful meanings condensed in the seemingly innocent images of \\"seed\\" and \\"soil.\\" Drawing on her work in a small Turkish village of Sunni Muslims, she shows us that the images are categorically different, hierarchically ordered, and unequally valued. The ways in which the creation of a child is understood in Turkey furnish a key to understanding a whole range of Turkish attitudes toward sexuality and gender, honor and shame, authority and submission, time and space, inside and outside, open and closed. Moreover, the symbols and meanings by which they represent procreation provide the means for understanding relationships between such seemingly disparate elements as the body, family, house, village, nation, this-world and other-world. Delaney points out that these symbols do not embellish reality; they provide the key to a particular conception of it, a conception that gives coherence to social life. The patterns revealed are not distinctly Turkish; they also comment on some of our own deeply-held assumptions and values about procreation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GjE6r7srMz4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deliverance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=08xdt0Zw0LgC&dq=Deliverance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The alchemist, (Materials for the study of the old English drama)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jJcazwEACAAJ&dq=The+alchemist,+(Materials+for+the+study+of+the+old+English+drama)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Photograph (Today Show Book Club #21)","description":"Traces the story of the New York Giants star, from his childhood with identical twin brother and football player Ronde Barber and early struggles in his career to the controversial 2006 season and his surprise early retirement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cyIQCHkJqekC&dq=The+Photograph+(Today+Show+Book+Club&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Straight Ahead Jazz Fakebook: Piano Edition (Fakebooks)","description":"DVD provides over three hours of audio and video demonstrations of rehearsal techniques and teaching methods for jazz improvisation, improving the rhythm section, and Latin jazz styles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7pjNgehSSDIC&dq=Straight+Ahead+Jazz+Fakebook:+Piano+Edition+(Fakebooks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"L.A.

Compiled from scratch with the assistance of dozens of Coltrane's colleagues, friends, and family, John Coltrane: His Life and Music corrects numerous errors from previous biographies. The significant people in Coltrane's life were reinterviewed, yielding new insights; some were interviewed for the first time ever. The musical analysis, which is accessible to the nonspecialist, makes its own revelations--for example, that some of Coltrane's well-known pieces are based on previously unrecognized sources. The Appendix is the most detailed chronology of Coltrane's performing career ever compiled, listing scores of previously unknown performances from the 1940s and early 1950s. Coltrane has become a musical inspiration for thousands of fans and musicians and a personal inspiration to as many more.

Spengler predicted that industrialisation would lead to serious environmental problems and that countless species would become extinct. He also predicted that labour from Third World countries would increasingly outcompete Western workers by doing the same work for much lower wages, and that industrial production would therefore move to other parts of the world, such as East Asia, India, and South America. According to Spengler, technology has not only made it possible for man to harness the forces of nature; it has also alienated him from nature. Modern technology now dominates our culture instead of that which is natural and organic. After having made himself the master of nature, man has himself become technology s slave.  The victor, crashed, is dragged to death by the team , Spengler summarises. Finally, Spengler foresaw that Western man would eventually grow weary of his increasingly artificial lifestyle and begin to hate the civilisation he himself created. There is no way out of this conundrum as the unrelenting progress of technological development cannot be halted. The current high-tech culture of the West is therefore doomed, destined to be consumed from within and destroyed. A time will come, Spengler writes, when our giant cities and skyscrapers have fallen in ruins and lie forgotten  just like the palaces of old Memphis and Babylon . It remains to be seen if this last, and most dire, of Spengler s prophecies will also come true.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1vjCCAAAQBAJ&dq=Man+and+Technics:+A+Contribution+to+a+Philosophy+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw","description":"Rising '44 is a brilliant narrative account of one of the most dramatic episodes in 20th century history, drawing on Davies' unique understanding of the issues and characters involved. In August 1944 Warsaw offered the Wehrmacht the last line of defence against the Red Army's march from Moscow to Berlin. When the Red Army reached the river Vistula, the people of Warsaw believed that liberation had come. The Resistance took to the streets in celebration, but the Soviets remained where they were, allowing the Wehrmacht time to regroup and Hitler to order that the city of Warsaw be razed to the ground. For 63 days the Resistance fought on in the cellars and the sewers. Defenceless citizens were slaughtered in their tens of thousands. One by one the City's monuments were reduced to rubble, watched by Soviet troops on the other bank of the river. The Allies expressed regret but decided that there was nothing to be done, Poland would not be allowed to be governed by Poles. The sacrifice was in vain and the Soviet tanks rolled in to the flattened city.

Dick (Studies in speculative fiction)","description":"Swiss Diploma Thesis from the year 2000 in the subject American Studies - Literature, grade: 1.5 (A), University of Zurich (English Seminar), 77 entries in the bibliography, language: English, abstract: Philip K. Dick's science fiction can be seen as a discussion of the human condition in a world where nothing is what it seems. Human identity has become uncertain, as has the nature of reality itself. This Dickian ontology has a striking similarity to postmodernist theories by thinkers such as Jameson, Baudrillard and McHale, most of whom, by the way, have a weak spot for science fiction. The discussion of Philip K. Dick's novels and short stories against a backdrop of postmodernist theory leads to conclusions that are not only relevant for the author's particular poetics, but for the ontology of our lives in times that science fiction couldn't have imagined. This work focusses on Philip K. Dick's unstable worlds and subjects, investigating Dickian space, time and meaning as well as the author's subjects and the question of schizophrenia and paranoia. Works discussed include Ubik, Time Out of Joint, The Man in the High Castle, A Maze of Death, Eye in the Sky, A Scanner Darkly, Martian Time-Slip and Impostor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wNMOy31xwt8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dear Store: An Affectionate Portrait of Rich's","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CERtQgAACAAJ&dq=Dear+Store:+An+Affectionate+Portrait+of+Rich%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional PHP5 (Programmer to Programmer)","description":"What is this book about? With the release of PHP 5 and the Zend Engine 2, PHP finally graduates from it earliest days as a lightweight scripting syntax to an powerful object oriented programming language that can hold its own against the Java and .NET architectures that currently dominate corporate software development. This book has a pragmatic focus on how to use PHP in the larger scheme of enterprise-class software development. What does this book cover? Unlike Java or .NET, there is little discussion of the application of design patterns, component architectures, and best-practices to the development of applications using PHP. Software written in the absence of this sort of higher-order architecture will never be able to match the robust frameworks that Java and .NET ship with out of the box. This book addresses this issue by covering the following material: Part 1 discusses the OO concepts that were initially explored in Beginning PHP 5 and a demonstration of how to implement them in PHP 5. This section also covers UML modeling and provides a brief introduction to project management techniques that are covered in more depth in Part 4. Parts 2 and 3 present objects and object hierarchies that, when completed, comprise a robust toolkit that developers will be able to reuse on future projects. These chapters are designed to arm the professional PHP developer with the sort of constructs that are available out of the box with platforms such as Java and .NET   from simple utility classes like Collection and Iterator, to more complex constructs like Model/View/Controller architectures and state machines. Part 4 shows how to use the toolkit from Parts 2 and 3 to create real-world applications. We look at the development of a robust contact management system that will leverage the componentry and concepts already discussed and introduce project management and software architecture concepts that enable developers to accurately identify business requirements, design scalable, extensible platforms, and handle change management effectively. It covers the waterfall and spiral project management paradigms and include a discussion on eXtreme Programming and other approaches to software development. The Appendices include an extended discussion on the effective use of CVS, introduce the Zend Studio IDE and related tools, and discuss performance tuning and scalability.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DQRBMWN_VJ0C&dq=Professional+PHP5+(Programmer+to+Programmer)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cascade Effect","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GvStDAEACAAJ&dq=Cascade+Effect&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist: Movie Tie-in [UNABRIDGED]","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RKcdiPWyJ_AC&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},I=["disabled"],E={key:0},P={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,n){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(n.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,I)):c("",!0)])}const J=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-656b8362"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/7.md","filePath":"glossary/7.md"}'),x={name:"glossary/7.md"},R=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[k(J)]))}});export{W as __pageData,R as default};
