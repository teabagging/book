Zubrin brings to life the close reality of a Mars Mission in human as well as technological terms. His imagination makes the story as real as it can get...until we can get to Mars ourselves. A true page turner and great Summer read."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"I was afraid, on first picking this book up and trying to decide whether to buy it or not, that I was going to be sorely disappointed; like I was when I read Aldrin's &quot;Encounter with Tiber&quot;. I expected a dull, technical, rambling, unexciting and implausible kind of novel. In other words, a boring engineering rationale for going to Mars dressed up as fiction. Boy, was I wrong! This is an exciting, gripping, emotional and self-consistent story about a 5-member crew that lands in Mars in the year 2011, becoming the first humans in history to do so. I say self-consistent because, on reading, and as is the case in many novels, one has to forget what one knows. One has to forget, for example, that it is more probable that a multi-national crew will be the first to go to Mars, instead of a purely American one, given the present state of affairs. One has to forget that NASA would never consent to be left out of the loop of communication and decision-making. Other than that, this novel is as engaging as Back to the Moon by Homer Hickam. My only hope is that this book is someday remembered as having come the closest to predicting our first actual visit to Mars."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"Having read books like &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; (Zubrin's non fiction offering) I could hardly wait to read First Landing. Unfortunately, this book conclusively proves that Zubrin is a first class scientist but he shouldn't give up his day job. Character development is either non-existent or childish. Plot development is transparent and dialogue is juvenile. The technical aspects were first rate but I guess you can't get everything."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"You haven't! This book is the most incredible, best told story I have ever read. The book could have been quadrupled in length and I still would read it. The character development is this book is superb. Some characters go from seemingly useless to the best man on the mission, or from all tough to showing a good side. This is the best book in terms of character development that I have read in ALL genres.Dr. Zubrin tells the story of 5 astronauts who travel to Mars- and get stranded there. Those of you who may read Dr. Zubrin's other books, you may ask how this happened. For those of you who haven't, you'll find out. This book shows what a 5-minute speech and the clapping of one person can do to the public opinion of the United States. If you like to read books, this deserves a permanent place on your bookshelf. If you don't, read it anyway! There is no excuse for not reading this book, so get it now. You should also pick up Dr. Zubrin's other 2 superb books- The Case for Mars ,and Entering Space.READ THIS BOOK TODAY!!"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"As His Holiness A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupadha has pointed out, nobody can go to Mars except devotees of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). The author of this book cannot go. That's simply a fact. One cannot reach other planets without spiritual preparation. Robert Zubrin and the Mars Society might whine about it for as long as they care, but they lack the inner qualifications. They'll never reach Mars.Nor have we been to the Moon. The Moon landing was a hoax, perpetrated by the New York Post in association with Hollywood, Bollywood, Nittywood and one \\"Buzz\\" Aldrin (actually a nephew of recently deposed Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi). Swami Prabhupada exposed the Moon landing hoax already in 1968, over the objections of faint-hearted gurus and assorted hippies and libertarian \\"space cadets\\".Yeah, you can whine about this too, Mr. Zubrin, but the facts remain. Lord Krishna stopped humanity from reaching the Moon.Besides, what on Earth (pun intended) do we want to do on Mars anyway? Let's all go down in lotus position at the shores of Goa, smoke some hash, and meditate like crazy to the sound of the Great AUM. Then we'll eventually reach Mars, but beyond that, we'll find the Atman, not to mention the groves where the Lord plays his transcendental flute and dances with Radha and the cow-herd girls. Really, who needs Mars anyway? It's just a big, red rock suspended in a vacuum.The inner journey is clearly more important."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"Every once in a while, I pick up a book thats tough to put down. I read this one in several sittings and as I read, I kept thinking of what a great film it would make. I make this statement because the novel is very visual, has a great cast of characters, and a story line with a interesting perspective on the first manned Mars mission. I like my Science Fiction with a heavy emphasis on science and technology, and this book delivered. I found myself deeply involved with the characters, and their situations as well. The last few chapters, especially the epilog, brought a tear or two to my eyes. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"I have read most of the modern Mars novels, including Ben Bova's MARS, Jack Williamson's BEACHHEAD, Stephen Baxter's VOYAGE, and Kim Stanley Robinson's RED MARS. Until now, I have always felt Williamson's book was the worst -- the equivalent of CBS' soap opera 'Dallas' set in space. But Robert Zubrin's FIRST LANDING actually sets a new low.The characters are drawn in absurdly basic types, showing no shades of subtlety whatsoever. Luke the Texan is almost literally a cowboy, right down to his \\"Yee-haw!\\" exclamation. Gwen is a head-to-toe Atlanta Braves fan, a God-fearing country hick with a rebel yell (I'm not making this up!). Rebecca is the intellectually and morally superior type, accustomed to winning every battle, and her awestruck fan is McGee the historian (a WHAT?), a nerdy bookworm and token outcast. Finally, the commander and Right Stuff guy, Townsend, feels the need to wear a leather pilot's jacket and peaked hat while putting in the stick time! How could these people possibly get chosen for history's first flight to the red planet? It is simply some of the most cartoonish characterization I've ever read in any supposedly serious novel. And I thought Bova was bad.The plot is even worse. It has so many holes and it's so driven by cliches that I simply had to give up looking for any substance. Every obligatory plot device in the handbook is thrown at us in the interest of furthering the story -- and moving the story along is all it's there for -- intrigue, personal conflict, conspiracy, politics, despair, love interests, murderous rage, hairy scrapes, life-and-death cliffhangers, good guys and bad guys, you name it. I found myself shaking my head at almost every page. All the novel has to offer are extremes. It's an old-fashioned pot-boiler, setting the scenes, throwing in conflict and resolving them, over and over again. All we need now is for a villain to be unmasked in a Scooby Doo ending.Incredibly, the novel's third major failure is that Zubrin, a trained engineer, doesn't even include much hard science here (and whenever he does, they're usually the best parts of the book). We never find out why the crew marks days by the terrestrial calendar rather than with sols (martian days), and we never get a genuine feeling of the crew's physical distance from earth. We don't find out many details of how the mission actually got to Mars. We get nothing more than a thumbnail sketch of mission control, and we don't see any of the program's background. There simply isn't much for the reader to chew on besides the soap opera.This should have been the guts of his earlier book, THE CASE FOR MARS, set in motion in novel form. Instead, the adventure of going to Mars takes a back seat to the melodrama, so we have the equivalent of 'Survivor: Mars Outpost.' Now I know why Zubrin never addressed the human factors issue in his earlier book -- it's because it just doesn't matter enough to him.Don't be fooled into thinking this is \\"hard sci-fi.\\" It isn't. It is strictly old school -- and I mean very old. Zubrin must have watered down the writing to try to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, but instead, he came up with a \\"young adults\\" Mars novel that manages to insult everyone's intelligence. Considering its source, FIRST LANDING is a major disappointment, and I think it's so bad that it actually undermines his non-fiction.Read FIRST LANDING only if you're interested in finding out how not to write a good science fiction novel. It may be appropriate reading for the beach, but not for the armchair adventurer."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"Author Robert Zubrin obviously has great scientific credentials. He must be brilliant. His non-fiction book, A Case for Mars, added valuable insight and understanding to the body of thought on this subject and generated kudos from the likes of Buzz Aldrin, Carl Sagan, and the revered Arthur C. Clarke.Unfortunately, however, this novel about man's first voyage to the red planet is idiotic. It supposes that five incompatible personalities travel to Mars for a years-long mission, about which they have no clear sense of what they're supposed to accomplish. Laughably, having arrived, they can't agree on why they're there, as if NASA sent them with simply\\"take a look around and let us know.\\" Even the earthbound scientists directing the mission are yet arguing about what they should be about on the martian surface.Then there's a rediculous scenario about a phony \\"expert\\" riling up the entire country with the idea that the crew, having been contaminated, shouldn't be allowed to return to earth, as if NASA hadn't considered beforehand what exposure to the martian envoirnment might entail.I gave it a good try, but halfway through the book I could suspend my disbelief no longer; NASA just couldn't be that inept. This story appears to be the result of someone saying, \\"You know so much about this stuff; you ought to write a novel,\\" and our scientific and technological genius rising to his level of incompetence.So, in my opinion, this book is a waste of time.A successful science fiction novel must, I believe, not only have good, or at least feasible, science, but also believable characters and a story line that makes sense. Zubrin's characters are believable as people, I suppose, but not in this nonsensical scenario. Were Arther C. Clarke or Orson Scott Card to write a similar tale, there would surely be no suspension of disbelief problems nor confusion about who the reader would be pulling for.. Come to think of it, they already have!"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"This first novel by Mars enthusiast, Robert Zubrin, follows hard on several much more successfully realized works by Ben Bova, Gregory Benford, Geoffrey Landis, and others. It is ironic and disappointing that one of the leading voices on behalf of Mars exploration should turn in such a half-hearted effort. What's missing here are the very minutiae that writers such as Bova and Stephen Baxter excell at detailing. Zubrin fails to make his story as much about the expedition and the planet on which it is set as it is about the people, all of whom remain mere thumbnail sketches, caricatures. That any space agency would group these five disparate souls together for the first expedition to Mars is not only unlikely, but completely improbable. Among them number Rebecca the empiricist, Gwen the religious zealot, Luke the good ole Texas boy, and so on. Didn't NASA conduct any psyche profiles before selecting this crew? And how unlikely is it that NASA would ever select historian/chronicler McGee for such a mission? Wishful thinking on Zubrin's part. NASA, furthermore, is reknowned for exercising control over virtually every detail of an expedition such as that depicted in the novel. It borders on the ludicrous then that upon arrival, the crew and Mission Control suddenly debate the priorities of the expedition: geology or biology. Like other recent novels, Mars Crossing and The Martian Race, First Landing is as much about suspense and thrills as it is about science and planetary exploration. It succeeds slightly better on this score, I think, through a series of improbable but exciting mishaps. What's missing, however, is the wonder of walking on the Martian surface, of walking on a new, unexplored world. The author hurries through the science unneccessarily, as if his audience would somehow be bored by the very things that made them, certainly me, pick up the book in the first place. I don't doubt that Zubrin has a better Mars novel in him; he needs, however, to trust his reader's enthusiasm as much as his own."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"I felt like I was reading two books in one. When it focused on the Mars mission, the book was thought-provoking and seemed quite plausible (though I'm literally no rocket scientist). However, the characters seemed straight out of daytime drama; overwrought and not what you'd expect from highly skilled pros selected from the top of their respective fields for a Mars mission. The human aspect lacked dimension and the inevitable conflict in an isolated survival situation that could have been as fascinating as the operations aspect, was jarringly overdone."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"Dr Zubrin's book is as hard as hard scifi can get. Set ten years in the future, this story is almost tomorrow's news. A must for read for those following the developments of the Mars Society. This book is absolutely great on technical merit while engaging and fun to read."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"I'm fairly forgiving when it comes to science fiction but this book exceeded my limits. I found myself hoping the entire crew would die a quick and painful death so I wouldn't have to read any more about them. Character development is obviously not one of Zubrin's skill sets. I'd offer that perhaps in time he'd be able to get it right but this one novel was enough of an agony to last me a lifetime. There's no way I'm willing to sit through another attempt in the hopes he'd eventually get it right. Save your money."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"This is great stuff, Zubrin is one cool dude and writes fiction with the best of them. The story entranced me and drew me in and I could not stop myself from reading. If you wonder how it may be like to explore and survive on the planet Mars in the first expedition (circa 2011) read this book, I bet when we finally reach Mars with a human crew it will be very much as depicted by Zubrin here in this novel.The mission Zubrin describes here is beset with many technical hurdles, some may be from sabotage, and political intrigue exists as well. Mars is a beautiful planet in it's own unique way and Zubrin conveys with success that beauty and wonder to the reader. I thought the resourcefulness of the crew, consisting of five members, was amazing, and the trip to the bottom of the Valley Of The Mariners was very well done. Character development was superb, I loved Rebecca, the biologist. Their ordeal is realistically put forth by Zubrin, again it was a page turner for me. This novel portrays our future exploration of Mars in the grandest sense, a joy to read, expertly written, and should be read by all science fiction fans and others as well.At the end of this novel resides a short appendix where Zubrin details the Mars Direct plan, interesting indeed. In fact, Zubrin believes spacefaring countries could send humans to Mars within a decade or so, if support developed, and we could become a two planet species. Dr. Zubrin is an astronautical engineer and has written two non-fiction space related books, Entering Space, and The Case For Mars, also well worth reading"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"I would like to say first that I haven't read any previous Mars books, and the only Science Fiction books I read before were Star Wars novels, which I'm not sure that counts. So, for someone who is fairly new to the genre, I have to say that I was quite disappointed with \\"First Landing\\".First of all, I found it hard to imagine. I couldn't picture the story in my head; there was no feeling to it, no atmosphere. The crew was supposed to be on Mars, but as far as I could tell, it might as well have been Arizona (albeit on a grander scale). The technical jargon was not up to par either, which surprised me the most since the author, I believe, used to be with NASA. Just to compare, a few years back I read \\"Apollo 13\\" by Jim Lovell, the book on which the movie was based. Granted, that book was non-fiction, yet it was so gripping, I just couldn't put it down. The technical detail and NASA jargon was well handled and easy to understand, even for someone like me who is not a scientific type of a person. In case of this book, it was all 'Martian' to me.Another problem was with the characters. Okay, maybe two feisty women having a cat fight is every man's dream, but it really has no place in this supposedly 'realistic' novel. All of the crew are stereotypes and laughable ones at that. I would never send these people to space. And that brings me to NASA itself. If the personnel working there was really this inept and, frankly stupid, we would never have gone to the Moon, or even reached the Earth's orbit for that matter. That is my opinion anyway. Maybe the author knows something we don't?Another problem I had was with the whole protest thing. It beggared the imagination that a country as enlightened as US would all of a sudden turn on their own astronauts because of some flaky novelist's views, which were not even based on facts. That whole story line was ridiculous. I understand paranoia and mob mentality, but come on, that's just going too far. Although, judging by the world's reaction to Dan Brown's opus, I could be wrong. I guess we could be that gullible; enough to believe just about anything if it's fed to us properly.Basically, I feel that this author should stick to writing non-fiction. As someone here already pointed out, this book reads like \\"Dallas\\". I wholeheartedly agree."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"&quot;First Landing&quot; is Mars Society founder and rocket pioneer Robert Zubrin's first work of fiction, and it shows. His characters have the depth of cardboard, the dialogue is often hilariously stilted, and the prose is riddled with cliches and irrepressible sentimentality. But I really liked this book. For its failings, it has a page-turning premise and a taut, charged plot; I read &quot;First Landing&quot; in two sittings and enjoyed every moment of it. Zubrin's tale of a near-future mission to Mars contains some satisfying moments (including a believably cynical portrait of Washington politics) and not a little genuine excitement. &quot;First Landing&quot; isn't the sleekest Mars novel to roll out of the hangar, but it tells a good story, and Zubrin's enthusiasm is infectious."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"I really liked the fact that the achievements of the first martians was realistic, and the technology they used to reach a point where colonization became inevitable sounded very realistic - something possible in the near future without any mega projects. I find the political drama unfolding on Earth regarding the opposition faced in bringing them back to Earth a little unrealistic. Overall the book was amazing - a littlemore visualization of Mars's physical surroundings would have been nice - something Arthur C. Clarke knows very well how to achieve. But overall I think Zubrin has done an excellent job -very readably, inspiring and fast paced novel - you will finish it even before you realize it. Its not a very big novel unlike the Mars series from Kim Stanley."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"There is nothing in First Landing that you could not have gotten from watching the film Mission to Mars (which Zubrin helped create). The plot is boring and the characters are one dimensional. Zubrin cops out by using lots of verbalized thoughts, and it is distracting. At the end Zubrin gives us a revised version of the Turner Thesis (which he does excellently in Entering Space), but it comes out poorly.This is definitely NOT worth reading. But if he keeps trying, he'll get fiction right eventually. Give Zubrin two more books, and they'll start to get good!"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"Zubrin is a gifted and talented writer that can easily blend fact with fiction, and &quot;First Landing&quot; has all the right stuff: intrigue and wonder, clashing personalities and cold-hearted politicians, integrity and intellect, danger and the human will to survive despite the odds, dicovery and mystery both human and alien... Gary S. Potter Author/Poet"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"exciting through out, realistic characters and scenarios. Characters portray a good cross-section of attitudes towards Mars exploration. A must read for Mars enthusiasts"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"If you have read Zubrin's The Case for Mars, DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES read First Landing. Basically, First Landing is a poorly-written, unedited fictionalization of The Case for Mars (which, incidentally, is a largely coherent and compelling nonfiction argument for the feasibility of exploring/colonizing the red planet). DO NOT read First Landing. Read The Case for Mars instead."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"Another great book by Dr Robert Zubrin. First Landing is a fast reading, well written novel 262 pages. An easy read. Read it in 1 day. Couldn't put it down.This one is a sci fi novel of the first landing by 5 astronaut/scientists to Mars. We see a strange mixture of a top gun Air Force Colonel, a Tomboy Army Major/head mechanic, a top notch beautiful female life scientist PHD/medical doctor, a Texas cowboy type PHD Geologist and a historian.Don't ruin this great sci fi by super analyzing it by trying to say NASA would never allow such a group that has problems getting along and the mission members would never do the things they do against NASA protocols. Remember its a novel...just enjoy it.Robert also has an end chapter describing the low cost Mars Direct approach to send 5 to Mars allowing them to live off the land using a nuke reactor to make fuel from with the help of the Martian atmosphere and a HAB shelter already deposited.I'm a big believer in Mars Direct and support the Mars Society in its efforts to get NASA, Congress and the President up to speed for the need to go to Mars via Mars Direct. I joined the Mars Society as a life member. Also read Robert's The Case For Mars 5 stars, Mars on Earth 5 stars, Entering Space 5 stars, and How to Live on Mars 3 stars. Robert is the President of the Mars Society, a great rocket scientist who knows his Mars stuff and is a great writer.The end of the book is great. I'd tell you it but I'd ruin the ending for you. I'll just say its a happy ending and all the heroes do great in different things and a big plus for mankind. After reading First Landing you feel good. Good sci fi using pre existing technology that can take us to Mars. 5 stars. Enjoy"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"As I read this book and thought about the other books I have read by Robert Zubrin, I realized that this it was as if Albert Einstein had written a book of fiction on relativity. Dr. Zubrin breadth of knowledge regarding Mars is so vast that he can make us &quot;feel, breath, and smell&quot; Mars. It should (and probably already is) required reading for NASA astronauts and scientists interested in Mars. Dr. Zubrin gives us a template for understanding what to expect when we get there. Laced in the story I read was the well thought out method to get to Mars, including the production of artificial gravity. In addition, the selection of crew was well thought out as well. As with his other books, I felt closer to really understanding the challenges of a voyage to Mars. Finally, I believe after reading this book, that we should listen and learn from Robert Zubrin and look forward to the habitation of Mars."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"Robert Zubrin's First Landing is a definite page-turner. This action packed novel leaves nothing out in terms of both technical and interpersonal problems that could possibly be encountered during a human mission to Mars. Each crewmember rises to the occasion in their own way to overcome personal differences with other crew members, difficulties in dealing with missions support, and solving technical problems that come about during the mission. This is a story of human strength and heroism, as this crew becomes the pioneers of a new world"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"After the excellent but technical &quot;Case for Mars&quot; Zubrin positions himself as a great fiction writer with &quot;First Landing&quot;. The people in &quot;First Landing&quot; are real, with their flaws and quirks. This is not Star trek, there are no warp drives and teleporters. Life on Mars is hard and dirty, but eventually the people prevail due to their own strength and ingenuity.Going to Mars is not a frivolous idea. Mars is within reach, and it must be done. If we shy from this challenge, ignorance and terrorists will prevail over America, over that country which in distant past landed its people on the Moon."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"This is the first good, new sci-fi I've read in years; or I should say, finished reading. I like science fiction, mystery, adventure, and many other types of novels, and it is so very refreshing to find a sci-fi novel that's readable and doesn't take 100 pages to introduce the characters, plot, or name its characters after chemical elements and freezer bags. This is apparently Dr. Zubrin's first novel and he does an excellent job of &quot;showing, not telling&quot; and letting the characters move the story along. I previously read &quot;Case for Mars&quot; and &quot;Entering Space&quot; and when I learned the author was writing an SF novel about Mars, figured it would be an interesting read. It was. One of Dr. Zubrin's strengths is his ability to weave-in technical facts without mucking-up the story line by making it overly technical and boring. In my opinion, too many modern SF writers try to sound smart and only succeed in writing boring stories with characters named Benzicrome or Zip-Loc, that no one finishes. Anyone can go to the library and get a textbook. First Landing is not a textbook, but it could be used as one. I would like to see the author write novels about a space-fairing race that explores the solar system and beyond. Congratulations Dr. Zubrin! And keep writing!"},{"Title":"Rudimental divine science","review":"We often forget that the author of book came from an era when science was trying to edge out conventional faith. Just the name of the book \\"Divine Science\\" hints at the attempt to marry the two systems into something useful for humanity. The book gives good insight into the era it was created and if you are interested in what is divine and what is science this could be your magic key. Bottom line not a bad read at all."},{"Title":"Miss Bianca","review":"I read this book in one afternoon as a child of 9. I could not put it down. My Mom was having a party and I was reading this book in the midst. I'l never forget the characters or the sadness that came when the book was finished.

They just mean new."},{"Title":"The Faces of Fantasy: Intimate Photos of Over 100 Top Fantasy Authors","review":"In 1984, photoessayist Patti Perret and (the now vanished) Bluejay Press released a collection of photographs entitled Faces of Science Fiction. The book instantly became a collector's item and used for autographs at science fiction conventions. Twelve years later, Tor has come out with Perret's companion volume, The Face of Fantasy.Perret's book is filled with a random assortment of more than 100 modern fantasy authors. Each author received one page in which to describe who they are, their philosophy, or anything else that seemed appropriate. Although it is nice to hear from the authors about themselves in their own words, it might have been nice to have a little more editorial content, especially, for instance, in the case of Edward Whittemore whose page simply reads, &quot;Edward Whittemore passed away.&quot;Most of the images in the book are nice and clean, if not particularly imaginative. One jarring exception is Perret's blurry time exposure of Joel Rosenberg which makes him look like he moved when the picture was taken and Perret only had the single shot. Since there is no explanation for the selection of this picture, the reader is left wondering why such a poor photograph was used, assuming the purpose of the book is to permit fans to see what their favorite author looks like.Perret fails to provide an explanation for her selection of authors, either. Did she chose certain authors because she happened to have pictures of them lying around? Because those were the authors who responded to a questionnaire? Because these are the authors Perret, herself, reads? No criteria is given for the sometimes strange selection.The pictures also appear to be arranged at random. They are not in alphabetical order or chronological order. While this is not a tremendous drawback, sorting the pictures in a logical manner would do away with the need for the index at the end of the book.However, for all its drawbacks, The Faces of Fantasy, is a fun book to have, providing pictures of more than 100 fantasy authors from Lynn Abbey to Jane Yolen. And, of course, it makes a great place to keep all those autographs."},{"Title":"Penthouse Adult Magazine:August 1981","review":"I selected an original collector's edition and was charged the $25 plus shipping.

Each chapter covers one of the 15 neighborboods, and includes a narrative and a brief tour description. The book is almost 20 years old so is a little out of date, but is really worth getting a copy of if you can."},{"Title":"Chicago, City of Neighborhoods: Histories & Tours","review":"This book was published in 1986, so it's already 25 years old and some of the information about the neighborhoods is no longer true: that is, some of the buildings mentioned as being there are gone, and buildings that weren't there 25 years ago are now part of the neighborhood. Still, this is a wonderful book on the history (and location, of course) of Chicago's many, many neighborhoods, with suggestions on what to see when touring them. If you need to know facts about Chicago's neighborhoods, this book is a good resource. I wish it were updated."},{"Title":"Corpses of Angels: Poems","review":"Henry J. Morro's Corpses of Angels is a stunning debut of powerful and tender poems about identity, the gender wars and survival. These poems reveal the beauty and terror of awakening in a new country, searching for the touchstones to memory, reaching back and finding \\" the language of peasants and machetes, of machine guns and priests, of gods and flesh.\\" Here is a record of the pain and scars of the gender wars, the wild sexuality at the core of this country's values, the sexual icons that distort love, physical beauty, and the human touch. At the center of this collection is the brutal spirituality of the survivor - the guerillas in a dictatorship, the molested children, the runaways, the suicides - all grappling for a better life or moving on to the next life.--- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Cartooning for Suffrage","review":"As American editorial cartooning becomes more and more irrelevant, Alice Sheppard's fine book shows what a powerful tool this once popular medium can be. For ten brief years starting around 1910, dozens of women came out of nowhere and began cartooning for the womens' right to vote. Two or three like Rose O'Neil were well known as illustrators but most of the others picked up their pens simply to fight for what they thought was justice. Imagine! They won no prizes. No reprints in Newsweek. No 401K plans through their newspapers' corporate pension plans. Their only prize was the 19th Amendment. Sheppard does a great job of exhuming the stories of these funny, talented, now mostly forgotten cartoonists. Signe Wilkinson"},{"Title":"Curse of the Spawn, Book 4: Lost Values","review":"Spawn fans often dog the character Jessica Priest. Why? Because she took the place of Chapel in the overall arc of the Spawn mythos. I would submit that Priest would be absolutely LOVED had she been introduced as anything other than the assassin of Al Simmons. 'Lost Values' contains a three issue story from the sorely missed 'Curse of the Spawn' series that delves into the absolutely psychotic nature of Jessica Priest. It also contains a single issue bonus called 'Deadland' (CotS # 22) that feaures some zombies and a new character: Hatchet."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"As I have lived through and studied the period this book covers, I found it interesting to read about these important people as human beings with personalities and human frailities. The burden of responsibility that they bore was enormous during WW2 and it was good to read that they occasionally could enjoy the peace of the countryside or a theatre.I think Kay was treated shabbily by the press in her dying days. Some people may find fault with her writing such a personal account but for me it was interesting reading and a worthy effort on her part."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"As the 1950s fade more and more from the American consciousness, so does the story of Kay Summersby. During World War 2, Kay, a driver for the British Mechanized Transport Corps, was assigned to U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower. There was much behind-the-scenes whispering about the General and the attractive woman who accompanied him, but his supporters always dismissed any rumors out of hand. During the final months of her life, Kay worked with a ghost writer to produce this book, which purports to tell Kay's story of what happened between her and her beloved Ike.Yes, this book was extremely controversial at the time, and remains controversial to this day. Was there actually a relationship between the two, or was the General a true paragon of virtue who would never commit such a sin? Well, there's evidence on both sides. Personally, I found this book to be a compelling read, and Kay's story to be extremely human and quite touching. I really liked it!(Review of Past Forgetting by Kay Summersby Morgan)"},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"I found this an interesting account of Summersby's alleged wartime affair with Eisenhower, and quite believable despite the denials by others on Ike's staff and, apparently, by Ike himself at the end of his life. Her account is supported by Truman's claim about Ike's letter to Marshall and Marshall's response and also by Ike's rather indiscreet actions in having her with him at social and recreational functions, almost like an official hostess, which strongly indicates a passionate attachment overcoming his judgment. I suspect that Churchill, Marshall and others (maybe including Mamie and his sone John) took the view that if she helped him cope with his enormous stresses, let it be, at least until after the war. Most interesting to me is the light shed on the characters of Kay and Ike -- Kay as a sort of English Geisha, whose interests center on clothes, partying and pleasing powerful men, and Ike as a rather pathetic and not very interesting personality -- a slave to his cigarettes, a stickler for protocol and proper saluting, a man whose non-military interests were limited to westerns, bridge, gardening and golf, and a besotted middle-aged man who couldn't perform the only two times they attempted sex."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"Memoirs invariably raise the question of where factual history stops and fiction begins, or vice versa. This light story is Kay Summersby's recollection of her wartime romance with General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower. It is set against the backdrop of the Second World War. Ms. Summersby was a 34-year old Irisher who was volunteering as a civil defense driver in war-torn London. By sheer chance, she was assigned as a driver for Eisenhower, who was then a 52-year old two-star general in the American army. The general's wife remained behind in the United States. In the meanwhile, the general and the driver get along very well. As the general's rank increases to 5-stars, he makes sure that his Irish driver continues to be assigned to him, even as his headquarters move to North Africa and continental Europe. By the war's end, Ms. Summersby suggests that the general was making arrangements for her to become an American citizen so that she would be able to join him in the United States. As we all know, that did not happen.The book is very well written, undoubtedly by a ghost-writer. One of the reasons that it holds the reader's interest is that the chapters are short. The chapters average less than ten pages in length. It is almost as though the book was written to be published in serial form in a major magazine. Each chapter focuses on one thought, or one part of the war, or one of the important people with whom they deal, e.g., Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, General George S. Patton et al. Ms. Summerby's off-hand comments about those personalities add to the interest.The subject structure is also interesting. In the first few pages, mention is made of a letter supposedly written by Eisenhower to his commanding officer, General George C. Marshall. In that letter, Eisenhower states that he wants to divorce his wife and marry Ms. Summersby. Summersby suggests that the romance was cooled by the intervention of General Marshall. Was it? History buffs may recall that General Marshall's archives contain a letter from Eisenhower requesting that his wife be permitted to join him in England.On the other hand, who cares? It is a light romance story. It is an easy read."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"Although I didn't feel the writing was that great, as it never really flowed very well in parts, it was VERY hard to put down. It was intriguing to visualize a lot of the \\"behind the scenes\\" related to the war, aside from the affair. It is a quick and interesting read."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"First, I believed it hook, line and sinker. There was no bragging or self-aggrandizement here. It is her small story in a monumental time: two people quietly falling in love amidst the calamitous backdrop of WW2. In fact, in the couple of love scenes mentioned, DDE is reportedly impotent (although I think one has to read between the lines as to whether that was always the case or whether she's being discreet).Kay, no feminist pioneer despite her job, was a woman of her time. She wasn't an impressive or unique character throughout the first half or so of the book, other than the fact that she drove the Supreme Commander. She was interesting solely for having a front-row seat to history at the side of Ike, as no other person knew him. Her descriptions of Ike's negative feelings towards Montgomery, Churchill's bad manners, the generals' mistresses and the wives back home in the States are amusing. But her oft-repeated emphasis on nightly bridge games and afternoon horse rides while so many were suffering and in danger was disappointing. The rotten cherry on this cake was that Churchill awarded her a medal for service which, she rightfully admits, was undeserved.But towards the end, her humanity is full-blown and very moving. She is deserted by Ike, who states he'll send for her to come to the US, then sends an impersonal telex to all of his staff and she is let go from the group. Ike turns out to be a cad - he doesn't have the decency to tell her himself - geez, what happened to courage? (He came down a few pegs on my hero list.) Alone, except for the dog that she and Ike adopted and loved, she mildly stalks him but is rejected. (I've read elsewhere that she turned to alcohol in her disappointment, and that Ike referred to her as \\"Irish and tragic\\" in those later years.)Her parting with her dying, beloved dog - the embodiment of the best years of her life - was so beautiful and poignant that it brought me to tears (I miss you Sporty). In the end, I was sad to see her go as the book ended. Like my parents, she was part of the greatest generation - warts and all - and they won't be back again as time marches on. I found the book had much to recommend it - imperfect but memorable: a story of true love and happiness: found and lost."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"Don't bother to read this book if you are looking for a juicy love story. I found this book very interesting with respect to describing some of the events of WWII. But I must admit that the love story part of it was a real let-down. It certainly was all very believable. Kay was dying when she wrote it and she wanted to set the record straight because at the time everyone wanted to know, \\"Did she, or didn't she\\". When I told my friend I had just read this book, he said, \\"Oh, you mean Eisenhower's mistress?\\" Well, I don't think that term fit their relationship. But the best parts of the book showed Generals Patton and Marshall, and Montgomery and Churchill, and some of how the high mukti mucks are involved in the business of fighting a war. Now, so long after WWII who really cares whether the two of them did or didn't. I had always thought of Eisenhower as a weak man and though Kay was certainly starstruck with her boss, I didn't find much reason to change my opinion about Ike from reading this book. The conclusion for me was that a high commander no longer has to be an Attila the Hun in order to direct the forces so as to win the war. MacArthur was more of the tough S.O.B. stereotypically thought of as a 'powerful' general. Ike apparently was a master of diplomacy which apparently was what was needed over in the European Theater. Patton could take the rap as the tough guy. All in all I found the book to be a good true war story, but as a love story - it fell flat."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"My overall impression is that the book is entertaining. It appears to be fairly accurate with respeect to the time and places mentioned. the book is used as a source document in other books about Eisenhower. Considering the period of time it covers, it moves at a fairly good pace."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"Kay Summersby's book is a fascinating look at the inner workings of the Supreme Allied Headquarters during World War II. She writes clearly and consicely about the organization that helped win World War II in Europe, and provides key details about the personalities and relationships between such notable historical figures such as Eisenhower, Churchill, Montgomery, Patton, Bradley, and such.However, the nature of her relationship with General Dwight D. Eisenhower is the central theme of the book and she repeatedly alludes to their stolen moments together. To a person, all others on Eisenhower's staff deny her accusations, including Eisenhower before his death, and can refute most of her stories of their love. For example, she describes in candid detail interludes and rendevous they supposedly shared, but at the time of many of these, Eisenhower was away from his headquarters or with others, including his wife and/or son.In her first book, &quot;Eisenhower Was My Boss,&quot; written in 1947, she makes no mention of this romantic relationship. Why, then, 30 years later, did she expose the &quot;truth.&quot; Perhaps it was because she was on her death bed and looking back on a life unfulfilled. She had two failed marriages, no children, and no job history. A fantasized relationship with Eisenhower, one of the most powerful men in history, could be her legacy.Aside from the falacious story of the relationship with Eisenhower, &quot;Past Forgetting&quot; is a good read if you are interested in the manner in which World War II in Europe was fought and won on both the political and military fronts."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"I loved this book! I loved her honesty and understanding of the man she loved. This is not an affair one could judge them about. It was truly love by a man who loved his country more than his own happiness. It is unfortunate that she had to reveal that, in fact, Ike was impotent. He was the greatest leader of WW11 but lived a very sad, depressed and lonely life. As she wrote this book while she was dying I do believe every word is true.The history in her book is spectacular! I am a lover of history and great people. This one has to top the list. I highly recommend it. She was an honorable woman who unfortunately fell in love with a great man who chose his country over love."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"I already had a copy of the &#34;Sun and the Moon&#34; book and it is very good. I had listed the Eisenhower book for sale on my Alibris book seller site and somehow or other it was lost or I couldn't find it so needed to buy the copy to send to the customer who ordered it from me. Typical book of its type. Politicians and famous people and their lies and coverups."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"A really good book. Lots of history from a different view, then we usually hear.Very worth reading, moves quickly."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"Perhaps the saddest book I ever read (non-fiction). Showed the another collateral cost of war. Much better than her first book."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"for about 50 years, but I have never read much of anything about the lives of European generals during WWII. This book was very very interesting. I talks about generals when they are not in the office. George S. Patton, Mark Clark, and others.It also talks about George Marshall, President Roosevelt, President Truman, Churchill. Fascinating.I think Kay Summersby really knew General Eisenhower more than anyone else in his life.So many interesting events, personalities, things that happened to her. Some comments on Amazon state that they do not believe that she actually lived all that is in the book, but I can not agree. I am astounded at what she saw and the people that she met.This book shows the shortness of life. So many experiences in life. So many unfulfilled dreams and hopes-- yet so many unexpected joys and much happiness too.I am so glad that she wrote about this side of these people, other wise we might not know them as well."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"If anything is proved by this book it is that Ike was a lover boy and poster child of Jewish press. He was never a good soldier or a good field-general."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"Kay Summersby produced this book while dying of cancer. It was actually ghostwritten, but based on material she provided the shadowy author, who writes extremely well. In fact, it's very difficult to put this one down and I have read it several times over the years. Kay paints fascinating word portraits of various WWII personalities she met, including the profane and hilarious Patton, the bombastic Monty, the loquacious Churchill and the shy Omar Bradley.Of course the most interesting character is Ike himself. There is no doubt Kay was utterly besotted with Eisenhower. She was wildly infatuated with him, as well as being physically attracted to him. How Ike felt about Kay is more nebulous and one can't dismiss the hundreds of love letters Ike penned to Mamie during the time he was entwined with Kay. The fact that Ike's staff denied he was sexually involved with Kay doesn't count for much; for a discreet couple, it's easy to fool outsiders.Kay writes of two thwarted sexual encounters. Both occurred in public houses where people could presumably walk in on the amorous couple. Their first attempt at being intimate was in England, but Ike couldn't perform. He apologized profusely for this failure, but Kay assured him still she still loved him anyway. Their second attempt at consummation was after VE Day, in Germany. Kay claims that clothes were wildly discarded and they tried to get down to business... but again, Ike was unable to complete the act. Poor Kay!Historians debate whether this is all wishful thinking. One might question why a woman would invent a situation where her would-be lover is impotent. If you're going to lie, why not go the whole nine yards and invent passionate couplings all over WWII Europe? Indeed, the dialogue Kay invents is more upsetting that her sexual depictions. It's hard to imagine Ike grabbing her and saying, &quot;God-----, Kay, I love you!&quot; Or fantasizing about having a baby with her. This sounds like pure fiction.Despite all these problems, it's still an incredibly interesting book. You either accept Kay's romance with Ike or you believe she invented it all. I tend to think he was extremely attracted to her but was too uptight to commit adultery, especially with his chauffeur. Still, an excellent read."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"First, I must admit to not caring much for books by people who \\"hung around\\" famous people. In fact I, for the most part, despise them. They, the writers, either have an axe to grind, want money or crave attention. I did not find this to be so with this particular work. Due to the circumstances in which it was written, time lines, the author's impending death, etc. I found it to be none of the things I usually dislike this type of work for. The book of course was written by a ghost writer, Barbara Widen, but it is obvious that Widen has captured perfectly the thoughts and perceptions of Kay. I found the book to be quite fascinating as to the late General and the details of his very private life during the height of the war in Europe. Now those that are expecting a torrid, sex filled autobiography tell all will be quite disappointed. The affair between these two people was not the almost gross stuff we read of today. It actually reads more like a high school romance than a story of an affair. The reader also must make up his or her own mind as to how truthful Kay is. For myself, I tend to believe most of what she has written. She had no real reason of make anything up at this point in her life. It would be very interesting to have available Eisenhower's side of the story, in his own words, but that is not going to happen. Most of what the author has recorded is perfectly logical and quite believable. One of the most interesting aspects of this story for me was, the unreal pressure that Eisenhower was under during this period of his life. This work brings this point out quite graphically. The book is an easy read, but I did find that after reading the first few pages, I could not put it down, ergo, I lost a full nights sleep. All in all, this is a very worth while read. It is handled with dignity and insight. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"I grew up in a time when a honorable man kept his mouth shut and did his duty, not only to his country but to his family. And Dwight Eisenhower did just that. I found this to be a touching story. And I believe her story. She was truly a beautiful woman and I do not question he loved her. But being the honor bound man he was, he realized this could never be. \\"Loved I not country more....\\" He may have been a great military man, but on a personal level, he could not destroy the lives of those he had left at home. And he didn't.One thing that continues to go through my mind is this: Didn't anyone question the fact he took his \\"driver\\" everywhere he went?? She HAD to have been more than that to him. Any enlisted man could have driven him where he needed to go. But he took her all over Europe with him, not mention Africa as well. Jobs were created for her. He helped her get US citizenship. Why? Because he loved her........And wanted her near him.But when he got back home, he came back to reality. This was not going to work for him. And he did what was expected of him. Which makes me feel sorry for Kay Summersby. She may have dreamed of a future with him, but deep down she knew it would never happen. And it didn't."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"This book by a dying Kay Summersby is a poignant account of what can happen when a man and a woman are thrown into a wartime work relationship that is unrelentingly stressful and from which neither dare retreat.In her book, written largely from memory, Kay has no regrets and makes no accusations. She treats her infatuation and love for her near-genius and overstressed boss, Dwight Eisenhower, with grace and sensitive restraint, focusing more on the emotional than the physical. Her book reveals how their extreme discression ensured that virtually no one on Eisenhower's staff understood their special relationship. Anyone who has read the book will understand the post-war denials of truth by those on the periphery of Eisenhower's inner circle. Both knew that when the war ended their love affair also had to end. It is a very personal story without a storybook ending.Her book gives first-hand insight into the personalities and quirks of the major leaders of WW2. Kay treated the emotional aspects of her mutual relationship with Eisenhower with honesty and objectivity. It was a story that needed telling."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"The characters Kay met during the war were not described in the depth I had hoped they would be. Her descriptions of the high points of her romance with Ike were pretty subdued. She was very starry-eyed and smitten with Ike, but I got the feeling that her visons of a perfect romance were about like those of a typical teenager.I think that with all the time Kay and Ike were thrown together for several years, they each naturaly developed a close feeling toward the other. Ike was by nature a warm and caring person. Ike was as responsible as Kay for the closeness that developed. He always found ways to keep Kay with him. If I had personally been in Ike's position, I would have kept Kay as close as Ike kept her. I don't think there is any question about how much Ike needed Kay to get him through the war.Ike was under enormous pressure to manage the war, and especially the planning for the D-day invasion. Kay became someone he could take refuge in -- a warm human shelter from the storm.When the war ended, their romance ended as in \\"The French Lieutenant's Woman,\\" or like a shipboard romance. Life moved on in a monumental way for Ike; Kay was left hanging. She could never manage forgetting.Many have speculated that the romance could never have happened, that Kay must have made the whole thing up. What was the truth? I could not tell. I tend to think Kay believed the facts to be as presented in her book. I think she believed she was in love. Many of the high ranking officers in the war had live-in housemates. Oftentimes they made scant attempts to hide it. To now say Ike and Kay went through all they did together for as long as they did, and under such trying circumstances, without developing a romantic attraction toward each other, is nothing less than the denial of human nature.I'm not troubled that Kay kept the story of the romance secret until she was nearly on her death-bed. As a close friend and confidante to Ike, this is what I would have expected and predicted."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"I have read the biography on Eisenhower by Stephen Ambrose and I wanted to read ''Past Forgetting'' by Kay Summersby Morgan to judge for myself whether Eisenhower and Summersby Morgan did have an affair.The straight answer is that-according to todays standards -they did not have an affair.However, it is a very enjoyable book and the descriptions of Eisenhower and others in the book make fascinating reading.Summersby Morgan was in a unique position to see first hand how the second world war was fought and won.Summersby Morgan comes across as a very intelligent fun person and it is easy to see how she and Eisenhower got so close to each other.I think it was a pity they could not have continue their friendship after the war but one can understand this would have been difficult .Firstly because Mrs Eisenhower was jealous of Summersby for good reason and secondly ,Eisenhower was totally committed to becoming President.By her own admission Summersby was hopelessly in love with Eisenhower and the risk of a scandal would have been too great.It is a love story set in an historical context so if you like history and the tale of a woman hopelessly in love with her boss this book is for you.At 250 pages it is the right length for what it has to tell."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"I have no doubt that Kay Summersby's account of her \\"affair\\" with Dwight Eisenhower is true. As to why she waited so long to tell the whole story, well, she was a product of her time, and she no longer had anything to lose. To be accurate, it was not much of an \\"affair,\\" because Ike was impotent (being married to a dowdy frump like Mamie would have made any man impotent). One can love in other ways than physical--Kay Summersby was quite a dish (a photo in the copy I read has a photograph of her with her legs crossed--great stems!), and I am not surprised that Ike was attracted to her. It is well known that most of the high-ranking American generals in WWII had mistresses, and apparently Ike was no exception. This is a very sad story, especially when Kay speaks of having to have her little Scotty dog put down (named \\"Telek\\" by Ike--an acronym of Telegraph Cottege and Kay, two things that Ike said made him happy). This is a must-read for anyone who enjoys, or sheds a tear over, sad wartime romances."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"For 3 years during one of the most tumultuous times in modern world history, Irishwoman Kay Summersby had a view of world events as few others could experience it as the personal driver and assistant of Supreme Allied Commander and future American President Dwight David Eisenhower.This book was written after Eisenhower had passed away in 1969, and after Kay Summersby learned in 1973 that she had terminal liver cancer. It is an update of her earlier sanitized memoir - \\"Eisenhower Was My Boss\\" - written shortly after the end of the war, and this version leaves absolutely no doubt that Summersby was wildly, madly in love with Eisenhower and had never stopped loving him, to her dying days.Eisenhower, isolated from his wife, and burdened with the task of saving the Western World from the Nazis, was also undoubtedly strongly attracted to her and found her companionship a welcome relief from the pressures of his work. For them to have developed a romantic attachment was only a very human response.However, it is also clear, even within this book, that Eisenhower wavered many times in his commitment to Summersby, and that once he had returned to the U.S. and was fully in the grips of his wife and handlers that he decided that he could absolutely have nothing further to do with her. Thus her exclusion from the group of personal aides flying back to the US to join Eisenhower at the Pentagon at the end of the war.From the beginning, this was an asymmetrical love affair. A young woman falling in love with her boss, an older and very powerful man, who could choose her or choose to follow his ambitions. Early on in the book, Eisenhower more or less telegraphed his ultimate intentions with his disapproving tale to Kay Summersby of how he viewed the Duke of Windsor's decision to abandon duty to country for the woman he loved.I am one of those who believe that everything in this book happened as she described them. It was undoubtedly the most intense period of her life and she must have reviewed in her mind her conversations and interactions with Eisenhower many times in the aftermath of their separation. This sort of mental review tends to reinforce and lock in memories, especially the pleasant ones.I think that it is also quite likely that Kay Summersby selectively forgot or ignored other memories that would have told her that Eisenhower would never leave his wife Mamie.As this book was published while Mamie was still alive, the Eisenhower family published in response their collection of over 300 letters (\\"Letters to Mamie\\") that Ike had written to Mamie Eisenhower, written at the rate of two a week during WWII, which professed his love and devotion to her. In the collection of Gen. Marshall's papers is a copy of a letter from Ike to Gen. Marshall requesting that Mamie be allowed to live in England with him. Summersby mentions none of this in her book.Merle Miller's biography of Truman, which claimed that Ike had written to Marshall requesting permission to divorce Mamie and marry Kay Summersby (mentioned at the beginning and end of Summersby's book) is suspected by some historians to be a mistake or a fake, as there is no documentation - Miller's original tapes of his interviews with Truman do not mention Summersby at all. The weight of the evidence and Eisenhower's natural political instincts, especially in regard to his relationship with Marshall, also make it highly incongruous for Eisenhower to ever write such a letter to Marshall.Eisenhower, always frugal and financially practical, was hardly a rich man at the time, and he did not become well off until the national adulation that accompanied him on his return home led to the success of his memoirs (\\"Crusade in Europe\\") and easy access to wealthy patrons eager to associate with him. He would simply not have been able to afford Kay Summersby as a second wife at the end of WWII.Although some articles about Kay Summersby have intimated that she had become an alcoholic and was short of money at the time of her death, I don't see why she would want to embellish the book and lie about and smear the one person in her life who meant all the world to her. I do see that she might not have picked up all the negative signals coming from Eisenhower, which made his final rejection of her so sudden and crushing.Could the publisher and the ghost writer have embellished the book after her death without her knowledge in order to boost sales? If it were my deathbed confessional memoir, I'd give copies of the final approved proof to trusted friends and relatives to make sure that didn't happen. Surely her friends and relatives knew what she was writing and would have come out against the publisher and ghost writer if it were all a lie. Surely the only reason for Kay Summersby to even want to re-write the book of her experiences with Eisenhower while on her deathbed would be tell the whole truth as she remembered it.There is actually nothing in this book that conflicts with other well-documented history. Photographic and eyewitness accounts all attest to the fact that Eisenhower was enormously fond of Kay Summersby while he was in Europe and kept her close to him at all times. The intimate encounters described in this book by Summersby were all brief and secretive and unobserved by others.A tale of two ships passing in the night, an asymmetrical love affair never entirely consummated, and a great read."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"Kay Summersby is a classy lady! No doubt Eisenhower was in love with her and &quot;If the situation would have been different&quot; as he always said, he sure would have married her after the war. But the circumstances being as they were, it was impossible for him to do so. All during the war, Kay was his nearest companion, his moral support. She had a unique place in Ike's heart, they shared so many historical and unique situations together, some crucials and some happy ones also. No wonder she was shattered when she realized there was no hope of them being together again after the war. They have been as close as a couple might be, and regardless of what the &quot;entourage&quot; and Einsenhower himself said of the &quot;affair&quot; afterwards, theirs was a beautiful love story and, frankly, I just couldn't put that book down."},{"Title":"Past forgetting : my love affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower","review":"I enjoyed this book very much and I believe it really happened. This does not lower my affection for President Eisenhower. He is only human and this type of story happened to hundreds of G.I.s who went home to wives and girlfriends that they loved. I don't belive that Ike stopped loving his wife, and when the war was over, he was able to leave his war time romance behind him and go home to the wife who he loved and loved him. I met Ike and Mamie when they owned their winter home on the grounds of the El Dorado Country Club near Palm Desert, Ca. This happened because I delivered flowers to them many times when I was a delivery boy working for a florist in Indio, Ca."},{"Title":"Steichen at War: The Navy's Pacific Air Battles","review":"Edward Steichen virtually created the world of high fashion and advertising photography, but his military coverage of two World Wars was equally remarkable. He received the Croix de Guerre for pioneering photoreconnaissance as part of Pershing's American Expeditionary Force in 1918, and his team's shots of the American Navy's advance across the Pacific from 1942 to 1945 form the visual core of our memory of that crucial period. Tragically, however, Steichen's thousands of incisive images of military action were dissolved into the morass of the National Archives, and attempts to retrieve specific subjects of his are often as effective as trying to taste fine brandy after pouring it into a swimming pool.Hence the value of retrospectives such as Christopher Phillips' hefty book on Steichen's coverage of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific War. Combining skillfully chosen anecdotes from Steichen's life with vivid evocation of the pioneering photographer's joy in capturing memorable images, Phillips gives us not only an unforgettable slice of Steichen's work but also enough historical background to let readers sense the excitement and drama of a nation's best young warriors fighting for freedom's sake. Lieutenant Commander Steichen's parade of images didn't begin until after the pivotal Battle of Midway in June 1942, but the ensuing carrier warfare and savage island fighting appear in unforgettable clarity. As in all great photographs, the humanity of the subjects shines through amid their triumph, or pain, or mere existence. Students of both military history and photography can spend days poring over these astonishingly revealing images."},{"Title":"Steichen at War: The Navy's Pacific Air Battles","review":"Consider how Christopher Phillips wrote this in 1983 well before his popular philosophy books such as Six Questions of Socrates, The Philosopher's Club and Socrates Cafe. Then in 1987 Steichen himself wrote on this topic. How does it all relate? Carefully...."},{"Title":"Foreign Policy Theory in Menem's Argentina","review":"Carlos Escude provides a strikingly original approach to international relations theory, using Argentina as a frame of reference. He finds mainstream theory lacking from the perspective of peripheral states. He claims that both realist and liberal theories lead to normative flaws harmful to the interests of citizens.Escude convincingly explains the problem with the language of international relations discourse. The unconscious discussion of states as if they were individuals by these theorists has negative effects on the citizens in peripheral states. When the state is viewed as an individual, its constituent parts are considered to be subordinate to the whole. This language, heargues, legitimizes the state and allows for repression of its citizenry.He attacks the realism of Waltz and Morgenthau on a number of issues but especially their refusal to theorize about states that are not great powers. Escude rightly points out that peripheral countries can and do destabilize the international system and thus should not be excluded from analyses.Furthermore, realists do not consider that other goals, such as economic development, might be more important to some states than political military power. From this perspective, Escude is closer to Rosecrance than to traditional realist analysis.Yet Escude claims to share Morgenthau's methodological approach to theory, and he thus terms his theory peripheral realism. Both peripheral realism and realism support self-interested behavior. However, Escude asserts that it is futile to attempt to design a scientific international relations theory and thus emphasizes the normative elements of peripheral realism.Many realists would object to his terminology. Escude believes that peripheral states should commit themselves to economic development. This includes acquiescence to the great powers, which have the ability to negatively affect development in the periphery. Policies that focus on citizen welfare, Escude argues, will contribute to national well-being.The title of the book is quite misleading, as the volume is only minimally concerned with Argentina and much less so with Menem.Instead, it pulls selected examples from Argentina's foreign policy in order to highlight Escude's points. Escude asserts that Argentina's nonconfrontational foreign policies since 1989 have been citizen-centric.The withdrawal of Argentina from the Non-Aligned Movement and its decision to cancel the Condor II, according to Escude, contribute to eliminate obstacles to Argentine development, although they do not in themselves generate development. Although Argentina's social and economic policies under Menem have probably not been citizen-centric, Escude claims that in the foreign policy sphere, the elimination of traditional confrontation with the Western great powers constitutes a damage-control that is in itself citizen-centric.While Escude's analysis is thought provoking, many scholars will disagree with his conclusions. International relations theorists will likely resist Escude's assertion that they are partially responsible for the underdevelopment and repression in many parts of the South. Furthermore, Escude's insistence on Third World submission to great-power dominance will make more thana few scholars uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Foreign Policy Theory in Menem's Argentina","review":"Escude's book is an extraordinary challenge to state-centric theories of international relations. The book's name is misleading, inasmuch as it has little to do with the Menem presidency in Argentina. Rather, it is an analytical critique of international relations theory that focuses mainly on the exposure of the fallacious analogy whereby the state is to the interstate system what the individual is to the state. The ultimate logical consequence of this fallacy leads to thinking in anthropomorphic terms.For example, &quot;freedom&quot; vis-a-vis the state is clearly an asset for the individual and a value to be redeemed from an ethical point of view. But in order for the state to be absolutely &quot;free&quot; in the interstate system, it must not only be powerful but must also subject its citizens to tyranny: otherwise it is bound by constraints. Almost all mainstream Anglo-American international relations theory suffers from this logical flaw. Escude exposes it clearly, and goes on to show that the normative consequences of this flaw are more serious the weaker a state is. Hence, weak states have a greater obligation to pursue &quot;citizen-centric&quot; foreign policies. It is in the interests of the citizens of weaker states that the pursuit of interstate power be left to powerful states, who are the &quot;rule-makers&quot; of the interstate system. It follows that Kenneth Waltz is wrong: states are not &quot;like units&quot;, and they do not have the same functions in the system. Escude posits the existence of three types of states with three types of functions: states that command, states that obey, and rebel (or rogue) states.The original title in Spanish of this book is &quot;The Realism of Weak States&quot;. Commercial reasons probably led the publishers to use a misleading title in its English-language version. References to Menem's administration in Argentina are found only as examples of a foreign policy shift, from state-centric to citizen-centric policies. This is clearly visible in Argentina's alignement with the United States; its signature of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and the dismantlement of the Condor II ballistic missile project, all of which were undertaken during the 1990s. Whatever appraisal Menem's economic and social policies may warrant, it is clear that his foreign policies were a contribution to world governance.Prof. Carlos Escude may be a &quot;colorful character&quot; who is often on Argentine television (as another reviewer claims), but he is also the author of numerous academic books in Spanish, holds a Ph.D. from Yale University, and has been Visiting Professor at Harvard's Department of Government. His &quot;Introduction to peripheral realism&quot;, published in Stephanie Neuman (ed.), &quot;International Relations Theory and the Third World&quot; (St. Martin's Press, 1998), is obligatory reading in courses from Columbia University to West Point."},{"Title":"Close-Up","review":"this wasnt one of Deightons best books, a little of of date and not worth the read."},{"Title":"WOODROW WILSON","review":"August Heckscher's one-volume biography of Woodrow Wilson is a lucidly written and admirable account of our 28th president, but marred by troubling omissions and inconsistencies.Heckscher persuasively argues that the first southerner elected to the presidency since Reconstruction wasn't really southern at all. In fact, with the exception of Andrew Jackson, no other American president had family roots so newly established in this country (his mother and all four grandparents were born in England). Although he was reared in the South -- born in Virginia, and spending his childhood as a Presbyterian preacher's son in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina -- his family was not a member of the Old South aristocracy, but rather missionaries of the church in what Heckscher implies was more or less a foreign land. He was, in short, no more a southerner in the White House than an American missionary returning from Africa is a Cameroonian.Also, we learn little of Wilson's political consciousness as he progressed in his academic career at Bryn Mawr, Wesleyan, and finally Princeton. Why was he a Democrat? Because nearly all white men hailing from the South in post-bellum America were Democrats? Heckscher doesn't bother to explain. We hear nothing of Wilson's opinions of presidents Cleveland or McKinley, or other leading party statesmen of the day. Why did the Democratic Party's conservative wing consider Wilson to be &quot;their candidate&quot; in the 1910 New Jersey gubernatorial race? Because he was an inveterate foe of William Jennings Bryan, the Party's progressive standard-bearer? But he was also highly thought of at the time by Teddy Roosevelt, a &quot;progressive's progressive.\\"&quot; Heckscher tries to shed a little more light on this question, but it is still far from clear how or why a liberal academic with Wilson's publications could have been pegged as a conservative Democrat.Most surprisingly (and disappointingly), the implications of Wilson's devout Christianity and his now infamous racism are almost totally shunted aside. Heckscher notes that Wilson had something of an epiphany while a teenager and that henceforth his relationship to God was central to his character and subsequent behavior, but that relationship plays no major role throughout the rest of the narrative of his life. Based on other readings of Wilson's life, it seems to me that one can't fully understand Wilson without understanding his faith and how that faith shaped his worldview and his actions -- particularly in his fight for the League of Nations -- and Heckscher's work does almost nothing in that regard.There is an ongoing debate about how much an historical figure should be held to modern standards of racial or religious tolerance and acceptance (Truman's anti-Semitism is a good example, and, of course, there are the slaveholding presidents of the 18th and early 19th centuries). Wilson has been one president excoriated for his racist views, which seem all the more grotesque because they came from one of the nation's most progressive and visionary leaders, and without doubt its most educated (Wilson dropped out of UVA Law School but passed the bar in Georgia, and received his Ph.D. in political science from Johns Hopkins). Rather than taking this question squarely on and offering an explanation and assessment of Wilson's views on race, Heckscher just avoids it entirely. He says that Wilson personally favored promotion of civil rights for black Americans, but the passage of the New Freedom was the sine qua non of his administration's domestic agenda and for that to succeed he needed a united Democratic Party. The only way he could achieve unity was to abandon civil rights, which, Heckscher says, he did unhesitatingly, but with a heavy heart. There isn't a single reference to Wilson's many racist statements in this massive tome. If you'd read nothing more on Wilson, this biography would give you the impression that he was a moral crusader for black equality.The Wilson that emerges from the pages of Heckscher's work is something of a pathetic figure, which is astounding because the author is so clearing sympathetic with his subject, as is often the case in presidential hagiographies. Wilson comes across as a politician who was not-quite-ready-for-prime-time. When confronted with political opposition -- whether as president of Princeton, governor of New Jersey, delegate to the 1919 Peace Conference, or as president trying to pass the League of Nations -- Wilson showed no art of political persuasion or ability to compromise. Rather, his visceral reaction was to go over the heads of his opponents making demagogic appeals to the people. His hope was always to crush his opponents under the strain of popular approval, but it almost never worked out that way. Moreover, he was quick to attack anyone not 100% with him as being in the enemy camp, which further eroded his ability to affect an outcome in his favor.In the end, after a series of strokes left him an invalid, Wilson succeeded in alientating even his most ardent loyalists, such as Joseph Tumulty and Colonel House, with his erratic and vindictive behavior. Heckscher accuses Wilson's second wife, Edith Bolling Galt, with deliberately fostering animosity in the cabinet and making sure that Wilson would not resign for reasons of health despite the fact it left the country virtually rudderless in the stormiest of international seas. Many figures in the Wilson administration take a few lumps in this biography, but none more than Galt, to whom the author attributes no redeeming qualities or positive contributions.What is most frustrating about this book is that it is so good in so many ways that its few notable shortcomings seem almost tragic. Neverthess, the good outweighs the bad, and it is to be recommended in spite of its warts."},{"Title":"WOODROW WILSON","review":"This is a good biography of Wilson.

Starting with how to's for content rich charting and other record keeping the book also provides lists of medical abbreviations.The book is organized by diagnostic category with the subspecialties and their unique presentations are also provided. The 'appearance' of the condition as well as the features that distinguish it from another can be the difference between needing to call a code or needing to make a page that may take hours to answer. The authors also provide checklists whenever applicable. Most line staff will be able to comprehend enough of what is pertinent to inform their management style and to discriminate pertinent details for treatment docs. Why not teach them?In partial programs, sheltered workshops and residential treatment, supported living etc., the nature of psychiatry is such that many different classifications and treatment plans are joined in one service and in one building. The qualifications of staff- at best- are not up to par in neurology. This book can provide some assistance and when augmented with staff training, the treatment setting is likely to be more secure and productive.The popular pediatrician in special ed., Mel Levine, is attempting to rebuild the role and qualifications for teachers in this manner. He uses a medical-like model for his training programs. If \\"hands-on\\" could be applied to neurology education Levine certainly succeeds. His program exposes teachers to the condition first, they go to an on-site hospital and residential diagnostic unit where they review charts, meet the child, make observations and dialogue about programs of accomodation and remediation. At the school, they further observe the learning differences and their behavioral co-morbid or psychiatric symptoms. They become familiar with more than a definition, (After all, no one really has figured out the Disorder of Written Expression- everyone has a different version and none matter when it comes to the poor child stuck with it.)Levine's fortunate few must come up with concise explanation, what's wrong, strengths and weaknesses and an integrated response. That can be expanded to several unique arenas and adjunctive therapies.In summary, this is an excellent brief and handy pocket handbook and one that would be well-placed for staff providing different therapies and/or manageing a unit to review and refer to under many circumstances. Nursing homes, special education settings, trauma rehabs and psychiatric units will all find relevant and highly understandable details here. The federal entitlement for Early Intervention is another woefully neglected subgroup. Special educators, poorly paid and with high turnover, are the primary therapists and team leaders with at-risk and medically fragile infants and toddlers. They go into homes, often impoverished, and provide services, developmental activities and do assessments. They have many checklists and standardized tests which are on the whole, completed carefully. Yet there are so many other things, not necessarily on those tests, but enormously important that are outside of their professional scope. This book has vital explanations around Toxic Exposure, symptoms and 'mimic' conditions. The substance abuse sections too are vital for professionals evaluating a maternal child relationship or in cases of an addicted family member. There is high frequence for fetal substance abuse conditions and HIV genetically transmitted diagnoses. These generally brave and devoted staff see siblings who manifest behaviors or motor skills that may be uniquely relevant to understanding the baby.

It includes &quot;Where to get a cat&quot;, an interesting section on &quot;The cat's body: How it functions&quot;, &quot;Nutrition&quot;, and &quot;Care and training&quot;, where the only thing I disagree with is the option of declawing, which was done so frequently decades ago.It ends with &quot;Your cat and the community&quot;, on laws, and your responsibilites as a cat owner.Part Three: &quot;Your Cat's Health&quot;, details a wide range of ailments, first aid treatment, and home care for the sick or injured cat.Part Four is &quot;Reproduction&quot;. Spaying/neutering, the care of a pregnant cat, and much more.Part Five is &quot;Old Age&quot;. This is a small section, but covers all the important points.J.J. McCoy was manager of the Bide-A-Wee Home for Animals in New York City, and chairman on the Board of Animal Regulation.

While it makes a good basis for long-standing theories, it definitely shows its age. A version that reflects more recent ideas and events would be more useful."},{"Title":"Sleep Disorders Medicine: Basic Science, Technical Considerations, and Clinical Aspects","review":"The strengths of this book are the &quot;Basic Aspects of Sleep&quot;, and &quot;Clinical Aspects&quot; sections. The &quot;Technical Considerations&quot; section needs work. In particular, Chapter 9 has an old description of electrode application techniques, which can be confusing to new practitioners. This same chapter also describes EOG placements with no room for additional (acceptable) options. Also, several other areas of this chapter tends to date the information. Chapter 11 has excellent text on cardiac arrhythmias, however, the graphics are very poor quality.One table (and chapter) which I enjoyed seeing was the &quot;Drugs that Effect Sleep&quot; table, in chapter 28. This was a short, but well written chapter on &quot;Sleep in Psychiatric Disorders&quot;. Also, chapter 32 covered the &quot;autonomic nervous system changes with aging&quot; (pp. 665 and 666) in a concise, but well written manner.This is a well-written textbook, which I would recommend to anyone new to the field of sleep disorders medicine. However, it still falls slightly short of the target as an all-inclusive sleep disorders textbook (if one truly exists)."},{"Title":"Sleep Disorders Medicine: Basic Science, Technical Considerations, and Clinical Aspects","review":"BRPT recommends this book.

In this book, there's very little of that; rather, this novel should be the darling of the Mickey Spillane set. Every two or three pages, someone (usually the protagonist, Bruce Gordon) is attacked with fists, knives, clubs, or guns (not blasters, the old-fashioned type). But this isn't just a crime novel put into space; this is a hard sf novel, and the terraforming of Mars, while not dwelt upon, is central to the story. Give this to your mean, tough brother who beats up sf fans and steals their lunch money. He'll love it..."},{"Title":"Police Your Planet","review":"This was a gift for my son, an adult male who loved to read Del Ray as a boy, so I bought this book as I read about it being one of those 'little known' works of an author, and I am always intrigued and like to read these. So I purchased it for my son, knowing I'd read it later(as I have).First his feed back was short and sweet, he loved it, it was very much a detective type novel set on Mars. From my perspective, I had to remember this was science fiction, because the story was so good, I'd forget that the action was on Mars.It reminded me of the movie Outland, which is a western story set on IO, a moon of Jupiter. In this case, its like a film noir, totally - but set on Mars.So, if you like film noir type novels, or science fiction, than you will love Police Your Planet.If you love both, than perfect!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Police Your Planet","review":"A great story, a great adventure, and lots of action and real men! I forgot that stories could be like this! A great story set on Mars, with a noir like hero that lets no one get in this way, kinda like a wise cracking Clint Eastwood type, just plane lots of fun!Read it! You wont' put it down, its fantastic!"},{"Title":"Police Your Planet","review":"Although Lester del Rey was one of the leading editors in the history of science fiction, and a good SF author in his own right, this book falls more into the hard-boiled detective genre than science fiction, even if it is set on Mars. The hero is an ex-cop, ex-prize fighter, ex-investigative reporter who is exiled to Mars by earth authorities for digging into sensitive stories. He becomes a policeman on Mars and discovers that Mars is a hotbed of police and governmental corruption. The book is full of fights, all fought with pistols, fists and clubs, not rayguns. There is some science fictional content in the background, involving earth's tangled relationships with its planetary colonies, but the foreground reminded me far more of Dashiell Hammett's \\"Red Harvest\\" than of conventional science fiction; del Rey seems to have been interested in protesting the extreme police corruption found in many American cities in the 1950s, and using a science fiction background as cover. Nonetheless, this is a fast, exciting read, even if not a true SF classic."},{"Title":"Police Your Planet","review":"This is a classic of Science Fiction.More people of course who profess the love of Science Fiction need to search out and read such classics. It explains how we got to what is currently read. It shows the forms and precepts that got us to this point.Del Rey of course is a master and later in life became a well known editor with his own imprint of books. The story deals with not just the idea of Mars and what we might expect if we ever get there. It deals with man and how man reacts to the situations in his life, whether on Mars, or here on Earth.That is what makes the story masterful. Why it should be read. It clarifies for us that men can do things for noble reasons, for justice, or because it is the means to the next meal. Police Your Planet has us thinking what would we do, if we were asked to take a stand. If we knew that there was such terrible corruption holding back the very oxygen we need to breath, would we do what was right, or what was expedient.If you have never read this, it is one to read. I used to read it every other year. Now, having passed the middle of life, I will undoubtedly read it again."},{"Title":"Police Your Planet","review":"This 1950s sci-fi adventure story has been a favorite of mine for many years. I am not sure what it is about the 1950s era sci-fi that I like so much. Much of it, as is Police Your Planet, is light on the science and most of it is geared more to the juvenile (now more commonly called young adult) market but I have enjoyed most which I have read. The setting is Mars but much of the story could just as easily have been 1920's Chicago with a few modifications to the setting and technology. It is the story of Bruce Gordon, ex-fighter, ex-cop, ex-gambler, ex-reporter and ex-earth resident, who is deported to Mars with a one-way ticket, a few credits, a knife and a pack of reader (marked) cards. This is all that Bruce needs to survive in a Mars which is reminiscent of 1920s Chicago where the government and the gangs are competing to be the most corrupt but mostly in cahoots to get rich. Mars is ready to collapse under its own corruption. The only savior in sight is the mysterious near-omnipotent Security who secretly recruited Bruce prior to his deportation. Bruce is confronted with many opportunities to either make money or save Mars. It is a light, fun and fast read to follow Bruce on his Mars adventure.This story is copyrighted in 1956. However, original publication date was 1953 as four parts in the periodical Science Fiction Adventures (reference: The Internet Speculative Fiction Database). Much of this story's science fiction is characteristic of this time period with focus on rockets, radios and newspapers. Sexual references are muted as is typical of the times - I would guess that this is particularly the case for a work that was first published piecemeal in sci-fi magazines. This is part of the charm and historic sci-fi insight that comes from reading a classic.Police Your Planet is 1,851 Kindle locations long (more of a novella than a novel). Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range. For example, books in Jack Campbell's first Lost Fleet series were approximately 5,000 Kindle locations."},{"Title":"Police Your Planet","review":"I don't think this story was ever intended to be taken too seriously. It has the feel of a crime comic book set on Mars. Still, it was fun to read. Certain aspects were predictable. I could pick out the good and bad guys, who'd be loyal and who wouldn't. I could also figure out whether or not the hero would \\"get the girl\\". If you are looking for a fun read, rather than the ultimate truth, this is a good one."},{"Title":"Police Your Planet","review":"A good old fashion story. Could be an old west novel except you are on Mars. Interesting side note: I read this in the early 1980's and again in Kindle version.

There were a lot of scriptural references too. Best of all - my fiance read through the whole book in less than a week! He said the writer gave him a different perspective on several subjects, most importantly, how to communicate and share the love of Christ in every relationship (not just marriage).

Personally, we have benefitted greatly from the material and the conversations that we had prior to marriage. The material, along with time spent with our counselors, facilitated much-needed conversation that we likely would have overlooked otherwise. The Prokopchaks do a nice job of blending teaching and scripture with personal reflection, journaling, and direction for couple conversation.In more recent years, we have found Called Together to be an excellent resource as we have walked alongside other couples in their preparation for marriage.

His proofs are extremely elegant, and it is always clear where he is going with the material. His writing flows very smoothly, and the addition of exercises to this edition is very helpful in the process of learning to prove things in the various areas covered in the chapter. He also does a great job of allowing one to make the connections between complex analysis and other fields of mathematics, and the notes at the end of each chapter offer interesting insight into the material such as various mathematicians involved in developing the topics and other areas of interest relative to the particular chapter. It is rare that an elementary book on complex analysis goes into further topics like several complex variables and complex manifolds, so if you are interested in learning complex analysis and preparing to extend to further related topics, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"P.y.b....21st Century Circe","review":"Something like I never read before.

Tenzing Norgay Sherpa (where did Amazon come up with 'Norkey'??) was the first man to reach the summit of Mount Everest, along with Sir Edmond Hillary, and they famously refused to ever say who reached the summit first, instead insisting that it was a collaborative effort which could not have succeeded without each partner's efforts. This autobiography, written with James Ramsey Ullman, reads authentically as Tenzing's voice. First published in 1955, two years after the summit victory of 1953, this is rightly a classic of adventure writing, as well as a good view of Sherpa society."},{"Title":"Tiger of the snows: The Autobiography of Tenzing of Everest","review":"It had been a year of waiting to locate this book. Tenzing, as anyone knew, had to bean exceptional man, yet the book revealed so much more. He is a tremendous hero, a legend,and a deeply honest man, considering all the risks he undertook to put Hillary into history.Such a wonderful read, and I will be re-reading it several times in the future."},{"Title":"Tiger of the snows: The Autobiography of Tenzing of Everest","review":"A genuinely inspiring book, and a totally inspiring man. It's a great autobiography, full of stories of incredible hardship overcome by a love of the mountains and personal drive far beyond most of his contemporaries. It leaves you in no doubt that he was one of the great climbers, repeatedly going back up to try and rescue people when others lacked the strength. But he always had the right instincts for a turnaround, even when he and Raymond Lambert could probably have made the first ascent of Everest. It's also quite clear that he loved Lambert and would have died trying to rescue him if it had come to that. This is not a man who steps over a climber in trouble.Although told to Ullman in a mix of English and Nepali, you really get a sense of Tenzing's voice throughout. I laughed out loud a couple of times at his dry wit. This sentence on the final walk-in sums up both the man and the style for me: 'As I thought of Everest and the great days ahead of us the complaints of my companions sounded like the cackling of so many hens'.I found a battered 1955 reprint some time ago and am very happy I did. A real shame that this is out of print."},{"Title":"Tiger of the snows: The Autobiography of Tenzing of Everest","review":"Does one need to review this book. It speaks for its\` self.

Lars and Chuck ran first descents on many of these rivers, and they share their stories and the stories of other pioneering paddlers. Their self-deprecating humor keeps the book from turning into a brag-fest. I bought my copy of the 1st edition in 1987 -- now I have copies of the 2nd and 3rd editions as well and can't bring myself to part with any of them!"},{"Title":"Best Whitewater in California: The Guide to 180 Runs","review":"Holbek and Stanley first published their guidebook in 1984. Amazingly, their descriptions have stood the test of time. The format for the guide is pleasantly succinct. More recent guidebooks have used the format provided by Holbek and Stanley (Idaho the WW State, and CO Rivers and Creeks).The authors get right down to business providing the info necessary to determine flows, arrive at put-in, run shuttle, and proceed down the run. Some might find the info related to running the river a bit sparce. Personally, I appreciate the fact that paddlers are left to figure out a variety of the details related to each run.In regard to the difficulty ratings for rapids and runs, this is the book that set the standards for contmporary river running in the western states. If Holbek and Stanley give a rapid a V+ rating, hang on!This guidebook should be placed firmly on the dashboard of every California paddlers beat up truck."},{"Title":"Best Whitewater in California: The Guide to 180 Runs","review":"Lars and Chuck explored most of the steep California rivers, and their book makes it a lot easier to follow in their footsteps.

I am a ferocious reader of dictionaries, a college student, and I do a lot of writing so in the interest of precision or simply bolstering my vocabulary with words like taciturnity, illinition, and temporicide--this dictionary's arsenal of obscure/obsolete treasures is not to be trifled with.The lense for this version is actually not at all an annoyance, except if you go off the page a little. It covers the whole row, so you don't have to move it left and right like I thought, and it isn't a hand lense it sets on the page--which is really convenient in comparison to the last groggy edition. It's really easy to read. The problem I have with all this is that when the lense goes off the page, if you aren't careful you will rip the page. And you probably will rip a few. The glue they use for the binding also gets into the pages and glues some of them together at the edges, which is really annoying, but you can get them apart without incident if you exercise some caution.In order be able to understand all of the abbreviations (and by abbreviations I don't mean n. or adj., in order to reduce size they have to abbreviate everything they can about the structure of the word and it's basic history, but the definitions and references themselves are in tact) you need to familiarize yourself with the book that comes with it, explaining how to decipher everything. It isn't long, and if you are interested in buying this anyways you are probably either a really pretentious feign flauting some fictitious intellect or a really intense need-to-know-everything freak/professor/student of the universe--in which case (the latter case) fifty or so pages on how to be friends with this big book is no big deal.Now, if you are interested in getting this it would be wise to warn you that it is not a good idea to have this as your only dictionary. I supplement mine with online dictionaries and an older Random House dictionary. It does take forever just to find a single word in the OED, and for casual use it simply isn't practical. If you are just looking up the meaning of say caricature, hyperbolize, or expatiate--a smaller dictionary really is more useful.Finally, one of the huge advantages to this dictionary, which is really why they made it, is mobility. I am on the go between several houses so I need to be able to take my books from my library to different places with as little hassle as possible. Ok, if I am lugging along two dictionaries along with god-knows-what you can imagine how much of a hassle I must be book wise, but this to the twenty-volume edition (plus supplementary texts) is an absolute joy.

I probably refer to it every day because it'sso darn interesting. It's not just definitions -- it's the history of every word in the English language from its first recorded use. This dictionary is indispensible if you are reading any older English authors (Chaucer, Milton, Shakespeare) because you don't have to guess -- you can see just what the word meant at that point in time. Half the time when you look up a word, you'll note that Shakespeare is the first recorded usage of the word. In case you weren't in awe of Shakespeare before, now you will be since many of our English usages are thanks to his skill. For the past few years I've kept this reference in my school office and almost everyday a student will come in to look up a word. Once you're done being in awe of this book, you'll probably want to read about how James Murray spent his whole life on the project.

I often find myself wanting to jump around a lot. For that purpose the 20 volume full-size version is far more unwieldy than this monster -- it's easier to deal with one big volume than 8 or 10 open books, which STILL won't contain something I want to look at, which means another trip to the bookshelf (not that it's so far away; it's just much less hassle to simply turn a bunch of pages).

If you count how many pages the OED contains--approx. 50,000--compared with your average Webster dictionary, then look up a single word and read the extensive amount of information that is provided, that should be enough logic to buy it for any serious writer or English major or linguist, etc. Trust me, they will treasure it second to the Bible. Happy holidays."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":".If you love words, their meanings and origins, (and you've got a few dollars to spare and have got the shelf space), you've just got to get yourself a hardcopy set of the OED.With the world of words rapidly going on-line, this definitive 20-volume lexicon of the English language will in a generation or so almost certainly become a collector's item if not a museum piece.The OED is an incredible record of 19th and 20th Century Anglophone civilization, and deserves to become a treasured heirloom by our grandchildren and further generations in this new Millennium.Dictionaries are much more than spellcheckers and crossword puzzle solvers. A dictionary like the OED has its real power and value in its use as an etymological tool. It's the origin of words and where they were first used that gives us a fundamental understanding of our language.For lovers of Shakespeare there are references to words first appearing in his works on almost every page of the OED. A great on-line project would be to hyperlink a &quot;Complete Works&quot; of the Bard to the OED with all the non-common words he uses.One word of warning to book lovers and potential owners of the OED ---- Make sure your four feet of shelf space is well shielded from direct sunlight. Those gorgeous royal blue fly-covers will fade very quickly if over exposed to UV.If you were given the choice of what books you could take to that hypothetical desert island, the OED would have to be the linguaphiles choice. It is the perfect encapsulation and guide to what our language and culture is all about.As a footnote you have to admire that quirky but subtle British humour that shines through even in the serious world of dictionary publishing. Check out the spines of Volumes VII and XVII where they are indexed with the first and last word in each volume.In Volume VII we have &quot; Hat -- Intervacuum &quot;. Is the OED subtly telling us what lurks under a Stetson? Volume XVI is indexed from &quot; Soot -- Styx'. Is this evidence that there is a hot and smoky welcome on the other side of that river between here and hell?"},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"I currently have the 2 volume thumb indexed Shorter Oxford English Dictionary and although it has one third of definitions that the 20 volume set has it does seem to cover most words that you will encounter. I would like to get the full 20 volume version though and not because it covers so many more words since most of these are obsolete anyway. The reason I would like to get the full version is that the Shorter version has far fewer literary quotes than the 20 volume version. One reviewer here, from Zurich I believe, said what a bargain the shorter version is and went on to say how it is one third the size. Not exactly; because of the abrigement of the literary references it actually is about one tenth the size. If the literary quotes are of little or no importance to you the Shorter version probably is the way to go. Myself I find these quotes and their way of showing how the word has been used through the years unbelievably fascinating and one of the reasons I'd want to get this dictionary. The Shorter version has 83,500 literary quotations and the 20 volume version has 2 and a half million! So it would not be accurate to say that the Shorter version has one third the contents of the larger; words defined but not content.Beyond that I now have to decide which version of the 20 volume to get. I wish to be able to actually see a copy of the Compact version to see if I'll find it impossible to read, with the magnifying glass, or not. One reviewer on amazon's UK page said he used 2 magnifying glasses; the one that sits on the page and then another that he holds above that. I thought it interesting that, although on the UK page, he gave his address as a state prison here in the US. Anyway, that's one idea. The cd rom version seems to have some problems with the protection software so I'm not sure about that for that and other reasons as well, ability to browse for another. The full 20 volume set is really more than I have any business spending so I'm thinking the Compact may be the answer. Now I have to have a look at it and see if I would be one of the people for whom it works or one of those who can't deal with the small print no matter how many magnifying glasses they use!"},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"Some of the reviewers commented about installation/operation issues with Windows XP SP2.

Suppl. 187/2 She is perhaps history's most outstanding case of Torschlusspanik: the panic at shutting of the door.I was alerted to this word by the Concise Oxford's list of Fascinating Words, although the entry could not be found in the Concise Oxford text entries. Torschlusspanik is not found in the Shorter Oxford either. This word, which encapsulates the \\"male menopause syndrome\\" was to be found in the 1989 unabridged Oxford, the entry as above. There are some human feelings which can only be found in other languages. I predict that this word will be used increasingly, and will eventually not need to be capitalised nor italicised, as with the word \\"schadenfreude\\", now used liberally without capitalisation.I experience two types of torschlusspanik. Type A when I pass a house which I should have bought when it was dirt cheap, or when I reminisce on a Romance I stupidly did not capitalise on in my younger days, or just simply \\"why didn't I do this and my life would be so different now\\". Then there is Type B torschlusspanik, like when I realise that I left the Oxford English Dictionary largely untouched on the shelf for 20 years and did not use it, and wasted the opportunities presented by this excellent work.I now know why. This dictionary was not placed within easy and ready access, a flaw my current re-purchase will redress. Secondly, there is \\"kleptophobia\\", where I was so afraid of losing an individual volume, that the Oxford set was spoilt silly and left largely disused - a reason the lower pricing today will make irrelevant.I leave 20 volumes within arms reach of my work table nowadays. That is the way to move this valuable chess piece into the centre of the board to advantage. I am no longer afraid of having loose copies nicked.20 years later, and I find that there is a whole subsidiary industry in the Amazon marketplace where loose copies can be purchased rather cheaply. If fact, if you live in the USA where shipping is just $3.99 per volume, it is possible to assemble a whole set of the OED cheaply by buying individual volumes. Some sellers can ship internationally for only 4.99 shipping per volume. It may be that a few volumes will not be new, and be G or VG or ex-libris copies and these are options for the impatient. I am just making the point that fear of having individual copies nicked is no longer a valid reason for the OED to be accursed to roam only the night, shunning sunlight.Torschlusspanik is when I realise that the $4,800 (US Dollar equivalent of 2,500 sterling then) I paid for the Oxford set 1989 equates to the 10% down-payment for a Manhattan apartment in 1989. 2,500 was also 10% down-payment for a flat in London's West End in 1989. Torschlusspanik is when I realise I should have put the Oxford to better use all this time.There are extremely competent technical reviews of the CD 4.0 version elsewhere. Click on the \\"sold separately\\" $234 dollar software and find a lively discussion of the Oxford CD rom. Amazonians occasionally get their sums wrong. This hard copy and CD set is currently priced at $1,290. The 20 volume set is $995 and the software bought separately add up to only $1,229 for both. The 20 volume hard copy is priced quite consistently in recent years, with one drop to $950 last year for a brief period. The CD rom, on the other hand, is priced close to $200 at times. I bought my Oxford set/CD rom set at $1,099. I thought this kind of yo-yo pricing is reserved for Blu-ray movies and far removed from the august Oxford Dictionary set.Even so, Oxford's price today can barely pay a month rental on the same time-travelled Manhattan apartment. The price has come down so much that whether or not to buy the Oxford unabridged is dependent on whether there is space in the aforementioned Manhattan apartment, not the absolute price. Then again, if you click on \\"Show 3 more formats\\", there is a 2002 reprint from Intelligent Entertainment at $799.99. Being blessed with fortuitous disposable income, I bought a few new sets from Intelligent Entertainment, so I no longer ever will live in fear of losing copies. These volumes just get thrashed around, underlined, highlighted, whatever; actually utilised and working. That is the way to use this 20 volume sucker - like any other dictionary, instead of treating it with kids' gloves. If you have three queens on the chess board in exchange for three pawns, you can afford a queen sacrifice, a decision which would normally be a crushing loss in chess.In one episode of the Gilmore Girls, Alexis Bledel really wanted this dictionary very badly. Her father wanted to buy her a set for her birthday, but could not afford it. (The Oxford by then costing a mere 10% down payment for a house in Stars Hollow, a fictional town near Connecticut, actually on a WB studio set behind where they filmed My Fair Lady) Eventually, her father got the grateful Alexis Bledel a copy of the micrographically produced Oxford set, replete with a magnifying glass. If my daughter were so hung up the mother Oxford, I could, at today's prices, afford to buy Miss Gilmore 2 sets, one for Yale and one for home use. Or casually send a CD rom 4.0 version over with some zucchinis.There must be a catch. The 2009 set with the CD rom is printed in China. It says so clearly on all the 5 boxes. The paper is brighter, whiter, the semi-gloss paper easier to read more pleasing to touch than the 1989 version manufactured by Rand McNally in Mass., USA. This 1989 1st edition has has matt paper which has a beige tint and feels thicker. The edges are blue speckled. The brown speckling from age is camouflaged by the blue speckling, so much so that it has a two tone speckling effect. Otherwise, the 1989 Made in USA version looks as new as the day it was delivered (3 months waiting time then, instead of 3 days currently). This is in spite of the tropical weather in my country which is very harsh to books. My 1989 Oxford never lived in air-conditioned comfort - I did not have round-the-clock library ambient temperature control, so it followed the fate of its owner. The 2002 USA reprint started to have wavy page edges (from humidity) on its own soon after it was taken out of its plastic wrapping, but not the 2009 Chinese reprint which has thicker pages. Nothing which ought to deter you from buying it. At the time of my purchase, $1,099 meant that the CD was thrown in for only $100 more, instead of the full price of $220 (then). There is always a risk of the price going up for something Manufactured in USA, but I very much doubt a China print can command this type of respect and not meet consumer resistance.My 2002 reprint (mine was the 7th reprint) was printed in the USA, but has the same physical qualities as the China print. Same type of bright white paper, no artistic blue speckling associated with classier tomes. Page edges also go wavy in humidity when taken out of the plastic wrap in the tropics. The 2002 USA reprint only cost me 799.99 from Intelligent Entertainment (Fulfilment by Amazon).My 1989 edition, of course, did not have the corrections made in 1991.Still, the 1989 one that cost a 10% deposit on a prime apartment has a touch of class. (The Leather Bound set must have been the 10% deposit on a Penthouse with a view of the Hudson, but I do not put myself in this league, so you have to read the review specifically for that de luxe edition: the gist was that the owner could barely use it as it needed very careful handling) The 1989 set is unwieldy, not so well balanced and the pages are harder to flip. For practical use, and for the price today, the 2002 USA or 2009 printed in China sets are good value and look very solid.The same Volume 18 with the word Torchlusspanik was put on my Paediatric weighing scale (appropriately accurate for this weight range). The 1989 version with matt pages tips the scale at 2.85 kg, the later white page versions at a lesser 2.75 kg.Not all volumes are of the same weight or thickness, and the difference is visible. Hence all the volumes had to be individually hand-wrapped with plastic. If you are trying to put the volumes on two shelves, the top volumes 1-10 combined is actually 1 1/2 inches longer than Volumes 11 - 20 combined, so you need to be prepared for asymmetry. I stuck the Shorter Oxford at the end at Volume 20 when I stacked the Oxford vertically on two planks on the same shelving unit, and it looked good. I also ran another 20 volumes contiguously over two adjacent shelving units horizontally and that worked as well. The one that was actually most used was the one where I did not care where I stuck the volumes. It kind of looked \\"creative\\" in arrangement.Whether you buy this set depends on simple addition, which cannot be dignified by calling it mathematics. Add the cost of the hard copy 20 volumes and the software together. If there is a saving, get it (as I did, when the price made sense). If not, getting a cheaper 2002 USA re-print Intelligent Entertainment (Amazon Fulfilment), while stocks last, at 799.99; then wait for the Made in Unspecified Country software to drop in price. I was unaware of this viable option at the time of my purchase. Intelligent Entertainment also offers the 20 Volume/CD set for only $999.99. This situation evokes Torschlusspanik."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"I wish I could tell you more about the product, but I can't get it to load.

The main issue in my mind was, \\"Can I live with the small print size\\" ? In short, yes I can. I actually really love it !! It's really easy to scan through the main meanings of the word. Be advised though that reading the etymological entries are admittedly more difficult because of the smaller font size and the fact that the magnifier is rounded and gives off some reflections that can interfere with reading. Sounds bad, but it isn't for me. Just make sure you have a good strong light which makes it so much more readable and be prepared for a different kind of reading experience. The whole process is slowed down, not unlike reading a manuscript !!!

To paraphrase the old G.B. Shaw joke, the scholarship of the OED is, of course, beyond dispute; it's just the physical size and format we're debating now.If you have five feet of shelf space--with shelves strong enough to support its massive 135+ lb. weight--and about $1,000 to spend (the original price was $3,000), the full-size Second is the obvious choice: Nothing will impress your friends and intimidate your critics more effectively. However, this one-volume micrographically reduced version of the Second's complete text puts all of its words and wisdom into a...well, a Compact package that will fit into even the smallest apartment or office, at roughly a third of the cost.The type size is, necessarily, tiny. Of course it is. At 56, I wear bifocals; but there's an excellent \\"reading glass\\"--i.e. magnifying glass--included with the book. And like one reviewer, I can lay my bifocals aside and, in good light, with my face close enough to the page, read the entries without optical assistance.Due solely to the near-microscopic size of the print, this wouldn't be the first choice if you want to \\"read the dictionary for recreational pleasure,\\" as I sometimes do; for that, get the full-size Second Edition. But if you want to look up any English word--especially an obscure one--along with its every known recorded use and meaning, along with its etymology, derivation, and history, without spending a thousand dollars or more and building new, heavy-duty shelves in your library or office, I recommend the one-volume Compact edition as a solution. Take off your bifocals, snap on the lamp, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"This dictionary is unequalled (see the praise of all the other reviewers, with whom I agree regarding the quality of this reference). Beyond excellence loom are other issues, however: weight and legibility are the most obvious. My balance beam scale indicates that it weighs (approximately) 11-3/4 pounds (i.e. 5-1/3 kg). So when a reviewer says this edition is 'heavy' this is what he means.... Note that the dimensions (sometimes called 'big') are 3.89 inches x 17.55 inches x 11.21 inches.... As to legibility, I cannot find any mention of the point size, so I will be more subjective. I am 55 years old and I wear progressive lens (in other words I'm both farsighted and nearsighted!). In average light if I take my glasses off I can read the definitions WITHOUT the magnifying glass, though the words sometimes alternately blur and sharpen, so it's sometimes a stretch. I find it quite easy to read WITH the magnifying glass, especially under a lamp. True, the tiny print means it's not like reading a John LeCarre paperback, but this is a * dictionary *, for Pete's sake! I use it to solve linguistics puzzles. Tonight I was stumped by the words &quot;theophoric&quot; and &quot;enclitic&quot; (both in reference to scribal practices involving the copying of the Hebrew Bible). So I lugged the monster down from my bookcase (where it lies flat!), skipped pulling out the magnifying glass, and looked up the definitions, pausing as my eyes would go in and out of focus (I can be quite lazy when I'm lying prone on the carpet and don't want to get up to get the magnifier!). I am absolutely happy with my purchase. My wife would not be, partly because she would be shocked to discover what I paid for it, and partly because her case of early macular degeneration would probably make it unavailable to her. So it's a decision to be made carefully, and one should be honest with oneself. If you are visually handicapped, or if you lack an obsession with the English language, there are 'digest condensed' dictionaries which would drive me to tears but which might completely satisfy you...

And now, if we choose to, we can actually own the set, in its 2nd Edition. This is a very desirable acquisition.Perhaps you worry that it might be an unwise purchase. We live in the age of the CD ROM, so why buy the printed volumes? The language seems to operate like a wheel rolling down a muddy slope picking up all manner of accretions as it progresses downhill. Will a work like this, then, become irrelevant? I think not. The citation formula used will always be relevant for readers interested in historical usage. The entire work constitutes, in a way, a history of the English Language, as well as a social history of English speaking peoples from the 12th century through to the end of the 20th century. Some scholars say it is unduly biased in the direction of English Victorian values, with a creeping pre-disposition toward a prescriptive rather than a descriptive stance on definitions. The compilers seem to want to position it to be a final arbiter on &quot;Correct Usage&quot;. Who cares? It is manna in the wilderness to anyone who loves the language, who likes to browse, and is not stimulated by the inanity of television. If Political Correctness is the filter through which all literature must pass for you, you'll probably not read very much of value, anyway.No other dictionary is so richly enjoyable as a work to read on its own. One does not go to the OED just to find the meaning of a word, one is beguiled, on opening a volume, to read many pages about all kinds of words. You'll never walk into the British Museum or the Louvre just to look at a single piece of Art and leave having looked only at that one piece. Here is the great exhibition of the language, its gallery.All speakers and students of the language are in Oxford's debt, and will forever be so. No dictionary comes close in comprehensiveness of coverage (its word count, i.e., the quantity of words defined, exceeds that covered in any other competing dictionary). This set, rightly, is the central jewel in OUP's crown of publications. If you're a writer, you can't afford not to purchase this set.Legend has it that a new &quot;improved&quot; edition will be out some time between 2001 and 2003. I sense that the improvements will appeal particularly to the ultra-scholarly linguist/lexicographers among its readers. Improvements shall include the addition of citations that might, for instance, antedate the earliest citation shown in a previous edition. It might, however, not be utterly essential to you you to know, for example, that the first user of the term &quot;Byronic&quot; was Byron himself. The changes from the 2nd to the 3rd edition may be minimal, in print at least. Doubtless, there will be significant improvements to the search capability, appearance, and user friendliness of the software version. But, don't hesitate to purchase the printed 2nd edition. If you feel the CD ROM version is superior to the printed edition, this will boil down to whether or not you are a bibliophile. Nothing equals the tactile pleasure of the printed page, bound well. OED 2 is one of the handsomest printing jobs I've ever seen. The cloth binding is extremely rugged and well designed, elegant and solidly conservative in physical appearance. The paper is itself bright and smooth, the font/type clear and eminently readable. Even the dust jackets are beautiful, a real improvement over the previous design. &quot;Additions&quot; volumes (times 3) are available for anyone interested in the vocabulary of the 90s. The 3rd edition will integrate these into the main work. But, a dictionary in the hand is worth two in the planning stage. And the beautiful volumes of the 2nd edition are available from Amazon.com at what amounts to bargain price.Buy this wonderful, beautifully produced and enduring work; it is a treasure for life that will never fail to impress you with the alluring beauty and quirky mutability of this most glorious of languages."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"I've wanted one of these beasts since I was about 12 and saw one at a friend's house. Quite aside from the content, it's beautiful. A work of love and tremendous labour.I'm surprised by those that complain that it's hard to lug around. It belongs on a writing desk or its own plinth. It should never move more than 2 feet. Oxford University Press publish many abridged versions that cater to the more mobile readership.Remember, this is a 20 volume book squished into one (more on that in a moment). The print will be small. I have nearly perfect eyesight though and having arrived off a long-haul flight the other day to find this waiting for me, I must admit that tiredness did indeed necessitate use of the magnifying glass. However, I just tried again and can read it just fine in good light without any artificial aid.Now. Amazon. Dear dear me. When one pays $217 (the price has gone up in the past couple of days, I see) for a delicate gem of a book (remember, you started life as booksellers, after all), even though that book should cost nearly twice as much, one does not expect some intern to have removed it from its packaging, and stuck two security tags in it. One on a page over the tiny exquisite print (a delicate operation to remove without apparent damage). One in the box at the back. Nor indeed does one expect this process to have folded the accompanying guidebook in two. Furthermore (and worse still) a number of the pages of the dictionary itself had been folded en-masse, presumably also during this clumsy tagging process. Fortunately, the book is so heavy and well made that the pages appear to have been rescued by gravity and a night on its side, but I'm nonetheless displeased as the guide still looks like it's accompanied me on a long train journey, stuffed into a trouser pocket and slept upon in the mid-day sun.Tut tut.I've seldom been more pleased with a book purchase though. I just wish Amazon had treated it a little better but: Pay money, get choice.UPDATE: The photo is now accurate - here's what I had to say about it originally: Ah. Yes. The photos on the product page. Now, I should have done my research and perhaps realised that OUP no longer produce the two-volume edition and I was going to get a single volume. The photos here at Amazon showing two volumes with a drawer for the magnifying glass (to be honest, the bit I actually liked aged twelve) are out-of-date.

It includes buggy software protection that requires that you place CD number 2 in the drive every 90 days in order for the program to run. This always occurs for me when I am traveling and do not have the CD with me. Oops, can't use the program until I get home and dig out the CD in my office.The next problem is that even once the program has done this ridiculous 90 day check, it still may not run. This is because the copy protection conflicts with the Windows operating system and Norton Antivirus in unpredictable ways. This can result in running out of system memory or in Microsoft Word crashing when attempting to open documents, both of which require restarting my computer.If you are lucky enough to get the program to run, you will find it has a horrible user interface, like it was written back in the late 80's. The program loads so slowly that I never bother using it to look up a single word while writing, and instead use my other dictionary programs. When the program does come up, it goes to a credits screen, so that you still must click to get to the page where you can do your searches, which wastes a few more seconds. The searches themselves return fast results, but reviewing the results is hindered by there not being any back button. So if you are looking at an entry and click on a hyperlinked term, there is no way to get back to the entry you were just viewing. This is terribly cumbersome if you want to cross-reference different entries to get a broader sense of word's meaning.I should add that I am not a nave user with a buggy computer. I have a recent model IBM notebook running Windows XP Professional, and I have worked as a computer technician in the past. I also do not have some hidden axe to grind with Oxford; I simply paid a reasonable chunk of money for what I thought would be a comprehensive and useable dictionary. The content is comprehensive--the very, very best--but it is nearly useless in this implementation.Let me end my review by telling about my latest experience with this lovely program. I clicked on the dictionary to lookup a word and it wanted the CD ROM to be inserted for the copy protection check. This time, I had the disk near at hand. I placed the CD in the drive and the program read the copy protection key, but it still wouldn't run. I restarted my computer and turned off Norton Antivirus, but this did not get the program to work. I then re-installed the Oxford dictionary, which takes a long, long time, and still no luck. Finally, I went and checked the tech support page at Oxford, and evidently their program does not work with a recent Windows XP security update. Their suggestion? Uninstall the update (which Microsoft considers critical, the maximum severity level) and turn off automatic security updates for your computer. Sure, no problem. I will just open up my computer to every virus in the world so I can run a stupid program that never ran correctly in the first place. I am now relegating the Oxford Dictionary to the trash can where it rightfully belongs. So if you are considering buying this software, just keep in mind that it will not run on Windows XP if you have up-to-date security updates on your system. I also encourage you to read the Amazon reviews for the previous versions (2.0 and 3.0) of the OED CD, many of which report similar problems with the flakey copy protection used in the program. It is rare for me to write a negative review when I am disappointed with a product. But in this case it goes beyond basic dissatisfaction and feels more like I have been robbed of $250. It just boggles my mind that such an unreliable and poorly executed program exists from a major publishing house."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"As a volunteer reader for the OED [we're the people who supply the quotations that illustrate the usages of the words], I can let you in on a little secret. The next edition of this dictionary is not due out until 2010. The ne plus ultra of dictionaries."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"When I first bought this, I thought sticking the disk in every 90 days did not seem so bad. Now I wish I'd listened to the reviewers who warned that this software can be a real pain.The first 90 days, I loved this dictionary. When it works, it's awesome.Then, right around the time it first prompted me to insert the disk and prove I really am the rightful owner, I started having problems. I stuck the disk in no problem and at first it all seemed fine. Then it started demanding weird things - that I stick in a disk, or that I connect to the internet. Using the dictionary became a real pain. THEN, it decided that I'm not the legitimate user, so now I can't use the software at all.GET THE PRINT VERSION OF THE DICTIONARY! This dictionary is really nice. But the software is a nightmare. The greedy bloodsuckers who invented this product are SO worried about bootlegging that they have solved the problem by making a product that isn't worth bootlegging!I feel so incredibly ripped off. I can't believe I paid for this garbage."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"I have no complaints about the actual content of the book - this is by far the best dictionary in the world - but everyone should seriously consider whether they want to spend this much money to look at text the size of microfiche print. That isn't an exaggeration; each page actually looks like it has several of those little microfiche slides printed on it. Even with the magnifying glass, the print is incredibly tiny, and anyone at all far-sighted should stay away from this book.Although I appreciate the efforts of the OED to put so much material into one book, the product is just too unwieldy - to hold, to read, to carry around. In addition to the print being tiny, the book is huge. It's nice as an object, but as a functional dictionary it proves to be rather inconvenient - especially if you don't have a nice big stand for it to rest on, which I don't.I really dislike staring at a computer screen, and prefer to get a paper copy of any text if at all possible - but for the OED that isn't economically feasible. I didn't want the abridged version, and buying all twenty volumes is prohibitively expensive - so I really do recommend the CD Rom version or subscribing to the dictionary online if you have Internet access. You can't really browse in those, which is too bad, but you can't really browse while trawling around this Lilliputian thicket of letters with a magnifying glass either.The electronic sources have the additional feature of being searchable by multiple terms, so you can find quotes from a particular author, or book - and many other things that aren't possible with paper.Buy this if you only plan on dipping into it on rare occasions, and want a lovely object, but there are better options for people really hoping to use it as a dictionary."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"It goes without saying that the OED has no equal. The content is a lexicographical masterpiece. The compact edition, though potentially unusable for those with poor vision, is the only practical format for this content.I do have an issue with the quality of the book itself. My first copy was not quite in alphabetical order. The book was bound out of order, so that pages 2143-2238 were intermixed.Amazon seemed eager to remedy the problem and sent me a second copy. This copy had a number of misprinted pages where the text ran off of the page. Also, some of the pages were partially glued together causing them to tear.After this, I was effectively told to deal with it. Amazon refused to send a second replacement (this is their policy). Oxford University Press required me to pay shipping.I chose to live with my first copy. It's still a fantastic reference, but considering its quality issues, I can rate it no better than average."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"All hail the &quot;OED&quot;!

In what way are they and in what way could a 20-volume dictionary be useful to you? And also, most of the definitions belong to the late 19th century and early 20th century by the first editors-the second edition is the incorporation of new words in the old dictionary in the late 80s. You can actually test it's usefulness: go to the the central library in your town ( it probably has the print edition) and sit as long as you wish, and see how many people will pick it frome the shelf and actually use it; you might see someone just pick one volume and turn pages to browse thru just to see what it is, but I can assure you seeing someone actually using this dictionary is something rare. This dictionary is indeed overpriced, does not have any drawing, and if you wish to learn about words, this is the longest, most expensive, most tiring, and most frustrating road to take.

The print is quite small, but the information it contains is invaluable. This is not a Webster's Dictionary, though Webster is a fine, general, every day resource. The OED, on the other hand, is a venerable tradition and should both be consulted on a regular basis and proudly displayed.

I suspect that anyone researching this dictionary knows what it is, and whether a 20-volume extensive history of every word in the English language fascinates him or bores him senseless. Either you must have this dictionary at any price, or you wouldn't waste your shelf space with it if it were free. I might be willing to give up buying food, clothing, and shelter to save up for the OED.So, my fabulous husband ordered the Oxford English Dictionary for my birthday. It was delivered a few days before my birthday, but only one box, containing 4 (of 20) volumes. There was a bright orange sticker on the box, stating clearly that this box is one of five and all should be shipped together. So, my husband called Amazon, who apologized and said to return the box and all volumes would be shipped again, all together, though now not in time for my birthday. I don't know why they couldn't just ship the missing volumes, but they said they could not; all boxes must be shipped as a set. So, he returned the box, and I eagerly awaited my gift, no longer a surprise. A couple of weeks later, we received notification that our order had been shipped,and I waited by the door (almost literally. I was excited.) Finally, the box arrived. That's right. Box. Singular. On the upside, this was a different 4 volumes. Again, a large, safety-orange sticker was affixed to the side, alerting anyone who came in contact with this box that it was part of a set, and all must be shipped together. I called FedEx, who checked the tracking number and said that only one box had been sent from Amazon, and I needed to contact them. My husband did, and they apologized and said to return the box and they would send the entire order again. I decided not to give them a third chance, and told my husband to cancel the order and order straight from Oxford University Press. We did that, and the whole order was shipped together this time, and slightly cheaper. Moral of the story : I wouldn't order this from Amazon. I love my dictionaries, though, and I have given up caring for my children in order to read them. (Okay, not really. But I do love it.)"},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"I just got my set today, so I can't really say anything more about it other than what has been said.

However, it is worthwhile noting that all that glitters is not gold.Although aware that this 20-volume set is cumbersome for the average day-to-day use, its publishers, (the Oxford University Press), instilled extreme restrictive flexibility on the only easy way out: the use of its CD-ROM version. This fact made the choice of \\"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\\" seem more attractive.Unlike the bulky twenty-volume 'real thing', this 'Shorter' alternative is a relatively portable two-volume set, which impressively contains 33% of what its 'big-brother' boasts of. Also, its listed price is a meagre 5% of what the 'real thing' costs: thus making it a wiser choice (and a greater value for money).In conclusion, I acknowledge the fact that the versatility of \\"Oxford English Dictionary (20-volume set)\\" is superlative. But unless you need the most extensive dictionary money can buy, and be prepared to peruse twenty texts when in need of definitions, I would suggest that you act wisely and invest on its 'Shorter' cousin. The size of the \\"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\\" is a portable one-tenth that of this 20-volume set. It offers a respectable one-third of its coverage; and sells for paltry one-twentieth of its price. Call it an economic sense, if you will.

The twenty volume set leaves no utterance out and comes in an attractive set that one would be proud to display in their office."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"It has been almost exactly one year since I started using this program. My previous review giving this software only two stars was somewhat premature and it was also abstruse for some people. Given my relatively long usage experience (this dictionary is not just an accessory in my computer - I use it very frequently), I thought that a revision is due. Some of my suggestions may help you to use this software because I have had to reinstall this software a dozen times.Just like with most things, there are good and bad aspects to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Most people know that OED is one of the most respectable dictionaries and it will be difficult to list all the good things about it. But I will try to compile a software-specific list:- OED likely has the most accurate word definitions- Every entry tells you all the acceptable forms of Spellings of the given word- It has Etymology - describes the origin of the words- A Date Chart - a graphical representation from the year 0 to 2000 as to when the given word was born- Quotations - the words are used in context in a sentence, often from famous writers like ShakespeareThis last aspect is sometimes very important if you want to understand the true meaning of a word - seeing it used in a sentence can be very beneficial.Another great aspect of this software is that it is very portable. You can install it on multiple computers (such as at home and at work), or better yet, you can carry it in a laptop. I personally do not like the paper edition because the only place you can use it is at home. Imagine you are writing a research paper at work or at school. Do you think you can carry 20 volumes of dictionary with you? Not likely; whereas this portable version is much more user friendly and not as sedentary. Even if you use the dictionary mostly at home, 20 volumes is still too much to handle. So if you like OED, you are pretty much stuck with the software version.With that said, there are many negative aspects to this software. They can be divided into two parts - non-technical and technical. Some non-technical deficiencies:- Some of the definitions might be outdated. Volume 3 was edited in 1997 and as you know, language evolves fast these days- The user interface is not pretty. There are few functions you can use- There is no thesaurus- If you misspell the word, even if a very simple mistake, the software is incapable of giving you suggestions. You are left wondering whether the word exists or using an online dictionary to find out if you have misspelled it- Pronunciation keys are too esoteric. You will have to learn all those unnecessary symbols before you can understand them - a waste of time- Some of the definitions are too obscure to understand. You will find that you cannot rely on OED for all your definitions - you will need to consult another source before you can grasp the word- Some of the quotations are too brief or too old to be usable for understanding the word in context.Then we get to the notorious technical problems:- The protection system prevents many users from authenticating the product- The search for words is sometimes very slow even on faster computers. So if you have an old computer, I wonder if you can use this dictionary at all- Vista is around the corner - I think you will lose $300 if you switch because it doesn't work with Vista as far as I know- There is no version for Macintosh- There are no upgrades that would keep the definitions up to dateI have had the fortune of installing this program on more than 10 different occasions and I want to help you with some tips:1. BEFORE you install the program, make sure that your XP SP2 has the most recent updates. Go to Microsoft Windows Update to check2. Disable ALL your protection - antivirus, firewall (if you have a personal firewall program), AND antispyware. Do not disable them, but shut them down completely.3. Only then proceed with reinstallation.4. After you reboot your computer, repeat step 2 again BEFORE you open the program.5. Make sure the authentication CD is in the driver (I think CD2)6. Only then proceed to opening the program for the first time.NOTES: You should repeat step 2 every time you re-authenticate. Now, this is very important: in my experience, OED DOES NOT WORK WITH KASPERSKY ANTIVIRUS. You can never really completely shut down Kaspersky - it has too many functions. This may also be true for Norton. When I had Kaspersky, not only OED did not install, but it was permanently damaged even after uninstalling Kaspersky. I had to reinstall the entire windows before I could install OED again (OED is that important to me). I know that OED works fine with NOD32 (in my opinion, this is the best antivirus) because in almost a year I have had no problems. Keep in mind that Zone Alarm might be just as bad. Here is my system: NOD32 (antivirus), Agnitum Outpost (firewall), Spysweeper (antispyware). These are the best and they do not interfere with OED. If you absolutely cannot have a similar system, I suggest that first you uninstall your security, install OED, and then reinstall your security and see if that helps - it might.Finally, in order to avoid losing or damaging your expensive CDs and rendering the program useless, I suggest you back them up. You can copy them (it is legal to make your own backup), but better yet, you should use a program like WinIso, create an image on your computer, and then use Daemon Tools (with Safedisk emulation) to permanently keep the authentication CD mounted in your computer. That's it! You will never need to use and scratch the authentication CD again.This is a great dictionary. The technical difficulties made me give it two stars a year ago, but now that I have found a way to deal with it, I think it is worth three to four stars.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"The BEST one volume reference work ever.

Well, it's a function of passion. If you really love the language, there is no other dictionary what even comes close. Certainly, any Webster's or American Heritage will likely suit most of your purposes (and electronic Franklin dictionaries are very good for readers wanting quick definitions); but the OED is utterly comprehensive. Many words have page-long definitions and every entry has a complete etymology (or rather, as complete an etymology as possible for any given entry). Any dispute on the topic of English can be authoritatively resolved, and this only with this set.I purchased mine recently, new, for 630 dollars American. I felt this to be an exceedingly good deal, and -- while surely you can find it for less now -- I would not hesitate to buy it again. Luckily, I won't need to, for the books are quality-made and hardbound to last a lifetime (with careful use, of course). The reason the set can be had for so little (MSRP was 1750 right up 'til November 2006) is that a new edition is slated for release soon. This, for potential buyers, is a good thing. The differences between this 1989 edition and the upcoming third version are sure to be trivial to the average English enthusiast, for they will be mostly medical and technological. And the price drop of '89's makes it the obvious buy even after the next edition surfaces.And if you can read two volumes a year with even 5 percent recall (over ten years), you will have one of the largest single vocabularies any human has ever achieved. The average person has readily available a vocabular of only between 7500 and 9000 words. The set's got 800,000-plus. Perhaps over a million...As I always say, the only thing that can make you a better writer is knowing more words."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"Other reviewers have done such a good job describing the physicality of this book, yet I was still surprised by how massive this thing is. I have one other Unabridged dictionary, which I use regularly; a 1942 Webster's. The OED is half as thick but weighs twice as much as the Webster's. Very nice binding and covers grace this volume.I flipped on all the lights in my library, opened the tome, and plopped the magnifier down on my favorite word, \\"Ninny-hammer.\\" At first I was shocked at how difficult the text was for me to read. As one reviewer said, it's like reading microfiche. I grew a little despondent. My vision is still 20/20, barely. I use 1.25 power reading glasses on occasion. One pair helped. I put on a second pair of reading glasses, over the first, peered through the magic crystal, and voila, the magic of the OED came alive. After an adjustment period, one pair of glasses was sufficient. Before I knew it, I'd spent two hours perusing rare, obsolete, and many thoroughly English, words. I have no complaints about this book, aside from the print size. Once you get used to it, the OED becomes a joy to use.The paper, while thin, is not translucent. It is smooth, but opaque, making reading a lot easier than some thin-paged books I own.I chose this version of the OED over the 20-volume set somewhat for cost issues, but mostly for space issues. My library shelves are nearly full, and every inch is precious as I continue my quest for rare and wonderful books. The entire 20 volumes in one \\"compact\\" edition was simply irresistible. I'm definitely a proud owner.In my opinion, this is not the book to own if you can only have one dictionary. I can find 99% of all the words I need in one of my many collegiate dictionaries. This is not the dictionary for me to keep Scrabble, Balderdash, and Perquacky players honest. This is a book in which to immerse oneself in the rich and diverse history of the English language. It is far more than a simple reference book; it is an etymological adventure."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"For anyone who is a lover of the English language, this set is incomparable. The scope of the achievement of the OED is epic. You will need four feet of bookshelf space to house the set, but it will anchor any literary collection and allow you to peruse not only words but the history of the english language itself. Churchill once said, \\"The man who cannot say what he has to say in good English cannot have very much to say that is worth listening to.\\" The OED will back his assessment."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"If my house, God Forbid, were burning down, this would be the book I would risk my life to save.

I need to use a second hand held magnifying glass with the supplied magnifier to see the smaller fonts.

I was finally able to order it this month and was extremely sad to have to return it because despite having fairly decent eye sight even with the magnifying glass there were many parts of the dictionary I could not read. Who knew small microfiche type could get smaller. The magnifying glass provided doesn't encompass an entire column so to read a section you have to move it back and forth and it becomes difficult to keep track of which line you're on. I considered purchasing a stronger and larger magnifying glass but it also took a lot of time to find a word and I realized that after spending all that money I may not utilize it as often because of it's difficulties.What I would recommend to those considering this dictionary is to be honest with yourself. I thought to sell such a dictionary you'd have to be able to read it with the magnifier or what was the use but it really is a challenge so how much time do you want to spend looking around for a word and strain while trying to focus and read.

When I slid volume two of the Compact Oxford from the slipcase and grabbed the magnifying glass and turned to the W's, there I found wolf's bane, on page 3807. I was delighted. I have found other words in the Oxford that I have not found in other dictionaries, such as those words used by many British authors. I love the dictionary. I like to feel its solid heftiness in my hands and I like to read the etymology of each word, which the Oxford so aptly provides. The $260 is a great deal. Try checking the price of the 20 volume set! I recommend this set to all lovers of the English language."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"RE: Production Quality of OED 2nd Edition (print version)My copy of the OED 2nd edition is the third printing. It was printed and bound by World Color Book Services, at Taunton, Massachusetts, in 1998, nearly 13 years ago, timed perhaps for the huge price drop around that time.Purchase of a print copy of OED2 ought to be a well considered decision. There are features of this set, besides price, which might make it an imposition to own. This is a massive set of books. Each volume is approximately 12.5 x 9.5 x 2.3 inches and weighs about 8 lbs. These books are too heavy and awkward for reading in bed. They need to be read at a spacious, well lighted table. What's more, the whole set needs at least 45 inches of sturdy shelving. If you anticipate relocating your residence, packing and lugging 320 lbs of books isn't likely to ease the process.My set came packed in 20 individually sealed and printed corrugated cartons, with each box displaying volume number and contents. This would seem to insure that each volume will have arrived in perfect condition. Nevertheless, one book of my set had a binding defect--a roughly sheered block. The seller replaced the volume without question. After almost 12 years of use, I have not discovered any other defects.The OED2 bindings are handsome, with gilt stamped lettering on deep royal blue buckram. There is no embossing, but the books sport attractive blue and white endpapers tastefully decorated with the Oxford University arms, (crown and manuscript) along with its motto: \\"DOMINUS ILLUMINATIO MEA\\"*. This image repeats in miniature so as to fully cover the endpapers, which are of thick durable stock.The bindings are robust, with extra-heavy boards and sturdy hinges. The pages are sewn in signatures, which is the method traditionally used by the finest bookmakers. Pages will not fall out as often happens with glued bindings.The dust jackets are on thick plastic coated stock. These books are likely to be consulted often, and due to their bulk, the jackets are likely to be damaged over the years, so I recommend covering the jackets in tough, clear, mylar protectors (Demco, Brodart, et al.) It is possible to affix the mylar sleeves to the boards without applying tape or adhesives to the actual book, so that the books can be slipped in and out of the mylar covered jackets without any damage to the boards, endpapers, etc. Such removal will then be possible only with reasonable effort, yet will leave no traces of adhesive, etc. (See note below at **) Thus the condition and value of the books remains unaffected.Each volume of the OED2 contains more than a thousand pages of triple columned, closely printed text. Some readers will want to have a magnifier handy. The typography is remarkable, with perhaps a half dozen different type styles and sizes, which are used logically and consistently. Indeed, tasteful restraint is shown, as many of the type faces serve more than a single function. The use of fonts is exhaustively explained in the lengthy introduction found in vol. I,The following statement from the introduction summarizes the use of non-standard characters: \\"Between them, the two parent texts [OED1 and Supplements] make use of approximately 660 characters, apart from the ninety or so available on the typical keyboard. Virtually all of these have been retained [in OED2]\\".Each volume contains a page with the \\"Key To The Pronunciation\\", as well as several pages listing the hundreds of abbreviations used within the work. A 143 page bibliography is found at the back of volume XX.Page layouts are a bit intimidating, as one would expect, but margins are ample with text staying well out of the gutter. As for typos, no doubt there will be a few, but over a decade I haven't noticed any. Sadly, this must be considered remarkable, in our era of slapdash publications and understaffed editorial offices. The OED2 undoubtedly represents the high watermark of contemporary editing.These books are printed using modern, low-cost, water soluble, cold-setting ink, which requires a higher porosity paper stock in order for the ink to be quickly absorbed and dried. This, to me, is the most telling step down in production quality, compared to the venerable first edition and its supplements.These books ideally should be shelved in a climate controlled room at 40-55% RH since the porous uncoated paper is more prone to warping when subjected to high humidity. The paper also tends to soil more easily, and it will wrinkle and curl when handled by sweaty hands. But the paper has sufficient body. Despite the large format, pages do not flop over on themselves, so page turning presents minimal risk of page damage.I cannot find a statement touting acid-free or alkaline buffered paper, but after 12 years of use, I see little or no effect of aging. Paper stock thickness measures 3.2 mil. (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate is 2 mil.)The print image is consistently sharp and dark, but I miss the true blacks and sharper text of the oil-based inks used formerly. But, all things considered, I would say the paper quality and image are about as good as one can expect with modern cost-effective book printing. For those of us who prefer print rather than electronic media, water soluble ink and high porosity paper should be an acceptable compromise, made on behalf of our precious environment. Still, I shudder to think how many trees were consumed for a print run of this work. It therefore behooves us all to consider the options of an on-line subscription or the DVD ROM edition (they're also searchable!) Not surprisingly, the editors have stated that the expanded OED 3rd edition might not be offered in a print edition, at all. The projected 30 volume print set of OED3 would seem to be moving beyond the physical and economical limits of most users.Final note: our local public library acquired their print copy of OED2 before the big price drop, and the only difference I can see between their higher cost set and mine is that my copy does not have the attractive blue marbling on the outside edges of the \\"perfect-cut\\" block. My copy is without decoration on the block edges, which, aside from the aesthetics, means the edges may exhibit more noticeable soiling from handling. I suppose, to be fair to those who paid the much higher price for the earlier printing, some such refinement had to be reserved for them.In summary, I would give the OED2 high marks for production quality, and feel that my set was fairly priced. This is definitely NOT \\"print-on-demand\\" quality. Could production quality have been better? Of course. E.g. by using dense polished paper stock and heat setting ink, but such a move would entail a significantly higher price tag.I hope I have answered most of C.D. Jensen's concerns. If anyone has a more recent printing, please update us.----------* Dominus illuminatio mea (Latin--Oxford University motto) = (literally) The Lord is my light, (or more liberally) The Lord is the source of my enlightenment.** How to affix mylar sleeved book jackets without damage to books: This process is recommended for folks who are patient and like to work with their hands. Start by installing the jacket inside a mylar sleeve (Demco, Brodart, etc.) Trim the sleeve as needed. When the jacket is properly mounted in the sleeve, cut a piece of repositionable transparent tape 2\\" wide x 5\\" long. (High-quality, clear, 2\\" wide packaging tape can give even better results, but can be difficult to work with, particularly before the following techniques are mastered.) The length of the tape strip should be cut a bit shorter than the width of the inside jacket flap, which for OED2 is typically a bit under 5\\" wide.Leaving the sleeved jacket on the book, carefully apply the cut strip of tape along the bottom outside edge of the mylar sleeve from the flap fold toward the spine, so that one inch of the tape width (about half) overhangs the bottom edge of the jacket. Now, using an Exacto knife (or a single-edge razor blade) and steel straightedge, cut a 3/16\\" (5mm) wide mylar strip from mylar scraps. Cut this mylar strip an inch or so longer than the strip of tape just affixed. Then attach the thin mylar strip along the whole length of the tape strip, on the adhesive side, precisely where the tape would come in contact with the exposed edge of the board, i.e. where the tape is to be wrapped around the bottom edge of the board. The excess length of the mylar strip will make it easier to position the mylar strip.With the thin mylar protective strip thus applied, the bottom edge of the book will be shielded from contact with the tape adhesive. The adhesive will only come in contact with mylar, and not the book itself. Once the thin mylar strip is in place on the tape, carefully wrap the tape overhang, over and around the book edge, while pulling the tape taut, to prevent wrinkles and puckers, and affix the tape to the inside bottom flap of the mylar sleeve, with the sleeved jacket still on the book. Repeat the procedure on the remaining three board edges. Afterwards, use the Exacto knife to trim the excess length from the thin mylar strips. When finished, the jacket/sleeve should fit snug, yet slip back and forth effortlessly, as the book is opened and closed. Experiment on a discardable jacket/book till the proper techniques are mastered. Patience will reward.You may find that better results are obtained by starting on the inside edge of the flap and wrapping the tape around to the outside. Experiment until you find the method that works best for you. The process can be a bit frustrating at first, but it will become easier with practice. By the time you have completed a few volumes, you will have perfected your method.If you should ever wish to remove the jacket, stand the book on its bottom edge, and carefully open the book beyond a normal position, with boards forming, say, a 270 degree angle. The jacket should then slip right off. Of course, failing this, one can resort to an Exacto knife, carefully slid along a taped edge. Either way, your book will be free of any adhesive stains."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"There is something fundamentally repulsive about a company that sells expensive items and then refuses to answer letters (very polite letters, such as I send) from customers that brought the product and are having problems with it. I am referring, of course, to Oxford University Press, USA, located in Cary, N.C. As a result of my experience with this company, I swore profusely, and then I swore on the proverbial stack of Oxford Self-Pronouncing Bibles that I would never in my LIFE have anything to do with Oxford University Press, or their products, ever again.So, you may ask, what am I doing giving the product involved (the OED CD-ROM) the best of all possible reviews? The truth is that the company has a monopoly on one of the greatest works in the history of mankind, and being able to have that work on my computer and at my finger tips constitutes a huge privilege. If my original investment of $398.95 for the 1988 version (1.13) of the OED on CD-ROM turned sour, the fact is that for years now I had not partaken of the incredible joys that this dictionary imparts; and that, for a mere $224.63 additional investment, I could remedy the situation in a matter of days. Yes, I reneged on my promise not to deal with these publishers and bought version 3.1, which now sits in my computer, dispensing, in an instant, some of the most amazing, profound, and complete knowledge about English words ever assembled.The program is entirely different from the first version I owned (and still own). It installed in a snap, it appears to be extremely stable (not the slightest hitch so far) and nothing of its feel gives the impression of being \\"buggy,\\" as one reviewer put it. Another reviewer suggested that one should keep one's expectations low, that this dictionary is not a panacea. Don't be silly...keep your expectations as high as you like, and they will be surpassed. No other dictionary even comes close to this one, but yes, I also keep a Merriam-Webster auditory pronunciation dictionary and the M-W unabridged on hand in my desktop.It would be pretentious nonsense to attempt to evaluate the content of the OED in a brief review such as this one. No other language (so far as I know) possesses the incalculable lexical richness found in the OED. Only a couple of hundred bucks made it mine, and so far it has been worth every cent. The ugliness of the company that puts it out is still evident in their grasping attempt to protect their property rather than to serve their public. I have not reached the point where I will have to insert one of the discs in the computer to prove my ownership of the program: that point will happen four times a year, and frankly I can put up with such a minor indignity considering what I get in return. I do not know what will happen when new versions of Windows appear; I will be very cautious about changing my set-up precisely because of my OED. For those interested, my computer runs on a Pentium (R) 4 CPU, 2.8 Ghz, 1 GB of RAM, and Windows XP. Addendum: (August 30, 2006): The program, as it had warned me, in due time called for the insertion of the data disc. I followed the instructions exactly and Lo! the dictionary refused to open. After a few hours of increasing desperation and anger, I called the toll-free number that came with the disks. Within five minutes I was speaking to the well informed geek in charge, who told me to delete a Windows file put in my computer automatically by Windows. He took me through the paces, I found and deleted the file, and my OED opened normally. It has been working perfectly since then. I must reconsider my ill feelings towards Oxford University Press. I highly recommend owning this jewel."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"What a fantastic dictionary!

The only complaint I have is that even with the magnifying glass, the print is not easy to read. &lt;sigh!&gt; If only I could afford the 20 volume set."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"When ordering furniture, prudence dictates some allowance be made for the size of the furniture and floor plans. Housing dimensions are always wishful mental impressions which are rapidly brought down to earth when the actual stuff arrives.When ordering the Oxford English Dictionary, I recommend preparations for 120 cm (47 to 48 inches) of shelf space to be set aside. 4 feet is safe. Anything less than 4 feet is slicing it a bit thin. Very few shelves today are more than a metre (37-38 inches)wide. I run mine across two shelves with the planks at the same height. Anything less spacious and all 20 volumes will be wedged so tightly that retrieval of individual volumes become tiresome. I cover my volumes with plastic wrap, some uncompressed area every few volumes avoids \\"stickiness\\" and helps the hand grasp a volume.Each volume is slightly more than 2 inches thick. They are not of uniform thickness. Volumes 1-10 is about 1.5 inches wider on the shelf than Volumes 11-20.The height of the shelves should be just over 32 cm. 13 inch height is fine. Anything more and the volumes will not look aesthetically pleasing. Such an august collection should not look as if it were an ill-fitting after-thought. Too much head space in the shelf is to be avoided.Getting a shelf 30 cm or 12 inches deep should not be a problem.For 20 years, my first set sat on scandinavian solid pine 1 inch thick shelves, so that was uneventful, but such furniture is now virtually unavailable. Another set meant for more robust use sat on half inch thick shelves made of tropical teak ply, each 32 inch wide. After a few months, the two shelves started bowing (warping downwards at the centre). There were some other books on these shelves to act as \\"book-ends\\". I turned over the teak ply planks, only to have them bow from convexity to concavity again. I bought some extra half inch planks and two planks held the Dictionary without them warping downwards.I would advise against IKEA \\"Billy\\" shelves (suggested by a reviewer) for long term use. Other lighter volumes (like law journals) have collapsed a shelf every now and then, spilling the books on to the floor. Perhaps the fault was in my poor workmanship as an outsourced assembler of otherwise sturdy Swedish furniture. The volumes look solidly bound to survive such a fall, but I am loathe to crash-test them.The weather in my country is tropical, and is harsh to books. The Dust Jacket colour has held up extremely well, with no noticeable deterioration of colour over 20 years. The page edges are blue-speckled, and my earlier type-set in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England and MANUFACTURED IN THE USA shows some additional light brown speckling from age. Otherwise it is like the day it was bought. There is no mention of where it was printed. The latest sets are printed in China (it says so on the box and in the book), and the jury is out on which country produces the better product. For example, Volume 15 2002 7th reprint in the USA weighs 2.8 kg, while the same Vol 15 8th reprint PRINTED IN CHINA on acid-free paper weighs 3.0 kg. The Printed in China volume looks less glossy, and duller, which makes the print easier to read, and feels far more solid. I prefer the United States marque although evidence in the physical product points to the contrary.It is a dilemma looking at the three versions: 1989, 2002 and the present China one, each having its own merits. The irony is that the 2002 version from Fulfilment by Amazon (click under \\"see 2 other formats\\") from Intelligent Entertainment is $799.99; the USA product being $200 to $400 cheaper than the China product is an irony when the balance of trade points to the contrary. Maybe the Chinese, as they told you in their 2008 Olympics, were the inventors of paper and had several millenia advantage over Yankee newbies.20 years ago, I bought the Oxford for the USD equivalent of about $4,000, and shipping from England cost about $800 and it took 3 months to arrive. Nowadays, a set with the CD is just 1,099. And Amazon got it to Singapore by Standard Shipping by DHL from USA to Singapore in just 3 days for a mere $71 dollars.It got cheaper when I ordered the 2002 reprint from the Amazon Fulfilment centre, at USD799. The shipping was just a nominal $9.99 (the same as a normal book - $5 plus 4.99 for an overseas Standard Shipping). And Amazon delivered it by DHL in just 3 days yet again, and again. For the price of ONE set in 1989, I can have multiple sets in 2010. Plus instant gratification too. I do not have to worry about misplacing a volume any more. In 1989, a Manhattan apartment cost around $40,000, so $4,000 for the Oxford was a 10% down-payment on an apartment.I thought I should put things in perspective if anyone is wondering if the 20 volume set is good value for money. The only considerations in acquisition are: (1) the availability of 4 feet of shelf space, and(2) current fortuitous availability of disposable income, which otherwise might have been misspent elsewhere.Fortunately, I live in an area where tropical hardwood shelves are bountiful. My dvd collection looks great on stylish IKEA shelves, but I urge caution when using the terms \\"IKEA\\" and \\"OXFORD 20 VOLUME SET\\" in the same context.July 2010 update: I have had the 20 volume set on a professionally assembled IKEA basic economy \\"billy\\" 30 inch bookshelf and it seems to have held up well for months. The $50 shelf and the $799.99 Fulfilment by Amazon USA set placed within arm's reach of my work station really encourage its use, even over the Shorter Oxford, which is on the same Ikea bookshelf.Christmas 2010 update: The same stuff plus CD Rom under \\"Oxford English Dictionary Set\\" is just $1,091.78. So if clicked \\"Check Out\\" under this heading, you would be paying about $200 extra. If you were suckered, write to Amazon to demand a refund.I take the point of another reviewer that the cost of the Oxford does fluctuate from time to time. The 20 volume set with the CD-rom Version 4.0 dropped from $1,299 to $1,099 during the three months when it was \\"out of stock\\" at Amazon in 2009. The CD rom ($220 if bought separately) is thrown in for just $100 more, now that 20 volume Hard Copy+ CD is in stock.That reviewer's claim that he got his set at only $300, during what must be a Black Friday Gold Box flash sale, rubs salt into wound. The same Oxford is readily available today for what is less than a month's mortgage payment on the same time-travelled Manhattan apartment. However, that claim of a give-away $300 for 20 volumes grates on my nerves.I want to whack that guy on the head with a volume of Oxford. Individual volumes of the Oxford are finely balanced and handles well for its size, both for reading as well as for use as a blunt instrument."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"Worth it's weight in gold.

Some of the literary entries go back nearly 1000 years, so there is a lot of history accompanying each definition. However, this version was re-released in 1989, so you will not find any very recent words in the volume. Also, this is a British dictionary, and while it includes American usages, it tends to favor British usage. If you are looking for something with a great deal of current slang or words which have entered our vocabularies since the internet explosion, you will likely not find them in the OED.The \\"compact\\" OED it is a very large, very heavy volume. It comes in a slipcase, although I find taking it in and out of the slipcase is rather bothersome. As 20 volumes have been condensed into one volume, the type is very small, and the pages are thin. There are 9 pages from the full-sized edition on each page. There are 2386 pages in the compact volume containing over 21,000 pages of information. Nonethless, I am near-sighted, and can usually read the text (at least the definitions) without the magnifying glass if I hold it very close, and read under light. As for the literary references which follow all entries, I usually need the magnifying glass. The definitions of the words are in a slightly larger type than the literary references. With the magnifying glass, I can read both with no difficulty.This dictionary is probably not for everyone, as it is cumbersome and contains a lot of archaic entires. However, for those whose profession requires a great deal of well-written work, or those with a natural linguistic curiosity, you will not be disappointed with the OED."},{"Title":"Oxford English Dictionary: Single User Version","review":"Forget the CD-ROM version, this print edition is the way to go.

With over 600,000 words in its twenty volumes and addenda, the Oxford provides not just exhaustive definitions, but pronounciations, a glossary of quotations, a complete etymology, cognates in virtually all languages, and variants, of each word.Since its birth in Victorian England under the stewardship of James Murray, the Oxford has been considered definitive. Working with a small staff (including J.R.R. Tolkien in his younger days), Murray's original plan was for a three volume reference. Today, hundreds of lexicographers, philologists, and technicians contribute to the Oxford.The sensual joy of browsing the hardcover edition is still unmatched, though with the rise of the Internet OED and its virtually instantaneous updates, the hardback edition is relegated to the same status as legal Case Reporters---attractive on the shelf, but less practical than online researching. (Legal publishers now often include a set of Case Reporters free with online subscriptions, knowing that clients like to see books on the shelves.)The OED books (with the addenda) work out to about a $1,000.00 investment. Updates are additional. The Online OED is about $300 a year for individuals. Updates are included.

Even installed on the hard drive, the interface does not load very fast. Yes, searches are fast, and that's great. But, to pop this application open for a single word in the middle of a task, where a faster-working program would do, is probably not something you are going to want to do.

There is also a magic to books and the ability to pick up a volume at random and find a word you never knew or learn the origin of a familiar word is simply wonderful. Everything known about the meaning and origins of words used in the English language -- their linguistic derivation, the earliest known usage in English, the evolution of the word's meaning, interesting examples of their use -- all of that is here. I'm writing a novel set in the middle ages and this set has proved invaluable for helping me weed out anachronistic words while keeping words that I thought were modern but which turn out to have been used by the Venerable Bede all the way back in the eighth century! The book even tells you which words are primarily American, English, Scottish or Australian in their uses.The primary weakness of the Oxford English Dictionary is that it is missing some modern usages of words that are not primarily slang. For instance, the dictionary lists many meanings for the word \\"crash,\\" but nowhere suggests that the word can be used to mean a sudden loss of energy or coming down from a drug high. Still, this is the most comprehensive dictionary of the English language and you'll never have trouble finding words no one knows when you're playing word games with your friends.

Anyone who is a PROFESSIONAL scholar of English MUST have it in order to carry out research, or even proper teaching. There is no equivalent to the OED, which is far more comprehensive than anything one might seek to compare it with. And this cheap edition is excellent value. I myself cannot use it without a magnifying glass, but that is only a minor inconvenience. The print is excellent for what it is, and not only is the price of the book low, but it is much handier to use than any other version of the OED.The second edition (which this is) incorporates a fair bit of new material, but much more often on very recent words than old or \\"perennial\\" ones: for a reader like myself, chiefly interested in older words or older meanings of words still current, the essential work was in essence done, already, for the first edition.A disappointing feature of the second (1991) edition (here under review) is that the opportunity was NOT used to do supplementary work in areas in which the OED's information had always been deficient. This is notably the case when one looks for explanations of words, or senses of words, held \\"indecent\\" at the time the original dictionary was compiled. Anyone who wishes to find out what e.g. bawdy quibbles in Shakespeare mean will have to look farther afield: the best (but very expensive and in some ways hard-to-use) book would be Gordon Williams's *Dictionary of Sexual Language amd Imagery in Shakespearean and Stuart Literature*, but Eric Partridge's *Shakespeare's Bawdy* is often helpful also, and much cheaper. But a good deal of work in this area still remains to be done: see e.g. Joost Daalder and Antony Telford Moore: \\"*Mandrakes* and *Whiblins* in *The Honest Whore*\\" (*Studies in Philology*, Fall 1997, 494-507). Another area where the OED is not strong is that of proverbs and sayings, for which one needs to consult e.g. *The Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs*.But to say that the OED is not complete is not to suggest that it often lets one down. It does not, and especially its work on the HISTORY of words (their etymology, developing meanings, etc.) will never be replaced, and provides help which simply cannot be found anywhere else. Obviously, one will never regret owning this monumental, informative and stimulating work.Readers should NOT assume that an abridged version will be an adequate replacement or only leave out inessentials: it is \\"the complete article\\" one should buy, nothing less.The history of the creation of the OED is a fascinating subject by itself.

Joel's birth date is, astrologically, on the cusp of Scorpio and Sagittarius, which is the celestial position of Galactic Centre, and even more accurately, the Galactic equator. When he heard that the 13-baktun cycle of the Maya was designed to terminate at the point when the winter solstice sun converges on this very point, in 2012, and concurrently found that the Biblical book of Joel, (which is his name), seems to describe Earth's future passage through the tail of a comet, Joel became aware of a clustering of more synchronicities around himself. He started to write it all down in a fictional format, because it was all so incredible, but like Robert Anton Wilson, when he wrote the fact-based but fictional Illuminatus trilogy, Joel found that the synchronicities were continuing. For example, he had written of a 2012-convergence of a burst of energy from Galactic Centre, and the return of the shattered remains of a comet, only to find that astro-physicist Paul LaViolette had already said that we are overdue for a burst of energy from Galactic Centre, and connected it with the Mayan end-point (see item 48 and Whats New item 84), and that dendro-chronologist, Mike Baillie has found evidence that an ancient shattered comet became associated with the mythology of the Birth of Venus, (Quetzalcoatl) which is also associated with the start of the 13-Baktun cycle. Then he found in Ray Stanford's book, The Fatima Prophecy, that the famous series of prophecies of the end-times given to the children at Fatima, spoke of the birth of the planet Venus being responsible for the ascension of mankind.Joel knew nothing about diagnosis2012 until I brought his attention to it in an email, and he said..\\"..I slapped my head upon seeing and hearing your home page.

The title of the book, \\"What Social Classes Owe to Each Other,\\" is answered by the author, essentially, as: \\"nothing.\\" At one point in his body of work, he noted that life is like \\"Root, hog, or die.\\" You have to work hard to make it or. . . .A classic line from this work illustrates the logic (Page 17): \\"certain ills belong to the hardships of human life. They are natural. They are part of the struggle with Nature for existence. We cannot blame our fellow-men for our share of these. My neighbor and I are struggling to free ourselves from these ills. The fact that my neighbor has succeeded in his struggle better than I constitutes no grievance for me.\\"If you have value as a person, you will \\"make it.\\" And those who cannot make it have no claim on the bounty that your success has created. It is a perspective that can be associated with the phrase \\"Nature, red in tooth and claw.\\" A battle, a struggle for survival between individuals.Most biologists of behavior today would reject this mano e mano perspective, noting that altruism and cooperation are a considerable part of human nature--as is conflict.In his day, though, Sumner was a major figure, along with Herbert Spencer and others, in the Social Darwinist movement."},{"Title":"What social classes owe to each other (The Freeman)","review":"The term \\"social Darwinism\\" was popularized by Richard Hofstadter's interesting 1944 book ~Social Darwinism In American Thought~ which has an entire chapter dedicated to the author now under review (William Graham Sumner). The term \\"social Darwinism\\" today is nothing more than a clever epitaph used by people to evade discussion of ideas and stifle debate (for the most part). Once invoked it congers up images of brutal savagery that coincides with terms like \\"survival of the fittest,\\" (coined by H. Spencer) \\"nature, red tooth and claw,\\" \\"Root, hog, or die.\\" etc. So what is \\"social Darwinism?\\" In this case I will refer to the type fixated with Herbert Spencer and W. G. Sumner. That is the individualist laissez-faire social Darwinism that has associated itself with the description above and the late 19th century \\"survival of the fittest\\" capitalism that portrays imagery depicting the viciousness of a world dominated by a dog-eat-dog type individualism.This 1883 book ~What Social Classes Owe Each Other~ by W.G. Sumner is often seen as the pinnacle work espousing the social Darwinism doctrine of the late 19th century. The book was originally a compilation of eleven short essays that were delivered (January 1883) in response to an invitation from Harper's Weekly.I believe there is a problem with the simple depictions (as described in the first paragraph) that are often attributed to William Graham Sumner. After careful reading, what I found in Sumner's work was something more complex and different from the earlier stated attributes that have been overlooked/forgotten because of his alleged association with \\"social Darwinism.\\"One review of the book (Liberty, Capital, and the Forgotten man) has already highlighted the essential question found in the introduction which is, \\"What ought All-of-us to do for some-of-us? But Some-of-us are included in All-of-us, and, so far as they get the benefit of their own efforts, it is the same as if they worked for themselves, and they may be cancelled out of All-of-us. Then the question which remains is, What ought Some-of-us to do for Others-of-us? or, What do social classes owe to each other? Sumner's answer to this question is not \\"nothing,\\" but something a bit more interesting. Sumner's argument is essentially that, \\"each owe to the other mutual redress of grievances\\" and that \\"the duty of All-of-us (that is, the State) to establish justice for all, from the least to the greatest, and in all matters,\\" as well as that \\"All-of-us ought to guarantee rights to each of us.\\" Rights for Sumner \\"do not pertain to result, but only to chances.\\" Deviating from this principle to assert some social class owes something to another according to Spencer diminishes liberty and invites oligarchy, plutocracy, etc.Sumner spends a few chapters of the book providing a detailed discussion of capital and labor. In many instances, social scientists fall into folly by developing one sided arguments when focusing on the problems of capital and labor (some focus solely on capital and others labor). Sumner goes on to argue that capital and labor are mutually dependent on each other i.e. capital needs labor and labor needs capital. (Also, for an interesting argument along the lines of capital/labor see the first paragraph in Chapter 4: On The Reasons Why Man is Not Altogether A Brute.)The argument that Sumner was a proponent/defender of the status quo and argued that \\"the owners of property and capital\\" are \\"unjustly\\" exploited against is nothing but a fallacious argument. In this work Sumner defends labor unions calling them, \\"right, useful, and necessary (paraphrased).\\" Arguing that Sumner was against regulations of working conditions, child labor, working hours, etc. is also a misunderstanding of this work. He believed that the best results would come from the interested parties involved (laborers and their institutions) instead of government bureaucrats who have no other experience in the world, but behind a desk in a government office. He also defends the right to strike defining it as a \\"legitimate resort,\\" but warned that strikes can have both beneficial and harmful effects. He recognized that there are \\"cases of fraud, swindling, and...financial crimes,\\" good/bad employers/employees and that \\"greed and selfishness of men are perpetual.\\" Unlike many social Darwinists who believed in human perfection via government regulations (eugenics) or natural evolution, Sumner believed in the fallibility of human beings, i.e. we humans are susceptible to \\"the vices and passions of human nature cupidity, lust, vindictiveness, ambition, and vanity. These vices are confined to no nation, class, or age.\\" He argues that the remedy for such exploits is an improvement in criminal law to \\"meet [the] new forms of crime.\\"Sumner begins chapter 9 and 10 with a discussion of the forgotten man and the troubles that arise from plutocracy (which he was against). Another reviewer has already pointed out the eloquent formula of Sumner's used by the humanitarians/philanthropists that is, \\"A and B put their heads together to decide what C shall be made to do for D...I call C the Forgotten Man.\\" The Forgotten Man \\"C\\" is just the typical middle class man who, \\"is the man who wants alcoholic liquors for any honest purpose whatsoever, who would use his liberty without abusing it, who would [be] trouble to nobody at all\\" who is often \\"passed by for the noisy, pushing, importunate, and incompetent.\\" A and B are almost always devoid of any responsibility or pressure, while D tries to be evasive. According to Sumner, \\"The pressure all comes on C.\\" In other words, those who fall under C the Forgotten Man assume all the responsibility legislated for D making their (C) own effort a struggle, etc.So this brings me to my last two questions; What does Sumner think of charitable aid (is he the cold, heartless theorist who believe we should \\"Root, hog, or die?\\" And Who is D?Beginning with the latter, D is often regarded as the \\"poor\\" and the \\"weak,\\" however Sumner uses the terms differently than what is commonly understood. He argues that people should be on guard and \\"always scrutinize the terms \`poor' and \`weak' as used\\" because often the terms are combined to include the honest wage-receivers with the \\"negligent, shiftless, inefficient, silly, and imprudent (the drunkard, etc.).\\" Now Sumner also introduced a term \\"the pauper\\" to distinguish between his use of the term poor. The pauper meaning the destitute of which he states, \\"The paupers and the physically incapacitated are an inevitable charge on society. About them no more need be said\\" (~The Forgotten Man~ which was an essay/lecture on an article from the book). So D, the group targeted by the humanitarians/philanthropists to remedy \\"the social ills,\\" makes up the \\"shiftless, negligent\\" drunkards etc. that Sumner argues against. Sumner goes on to argue that, \\"almost all legislative effort to prevent vice is really protective of vice, because all such legislation saves the vicious man from the penalty of his vice...we never can annihilate a penalty. We can only divert it from the head of the man who has incurred it to the heads of others who have not incurred it.\\" So D in the end is not the pauper, the physically incapacitated, the unskilled laborer, etc. but the negligent, shiftless, and vicious.Finally, we can now deal with Sumner's position on charitable aid which can be found in the last chapter entitled ~Wherefore We Should Love One Another~. \\"A man who had no sympathies and no sentiments would be a very poor creature\\" Sumner argued. He believed however that charitable work should be relegated to private relations, \\"where personal acquaintance and personal estimates may furnish the proper limitations and guarantees.\\" He argues that \\"the public charities, more especially the legislative charities, nourish no man's sympathies and sentiments.\\" Thus, he concludes charity should be voluntary action that builds on man's sympathies and sentiments and not be forced upon by third parties. When building his case for the necessity of charity he falls back on the fallibility of man as a prime reason. He concludes that at times, \\"We are all careless...Therefore the man under the tree (he opened the chapter describing a man trapped under a fallen tree) is the one of us who for the moment is smitten. It may be you tomorrow, and I next day....Men, therefore, owe to men, in the chances and perils of this life, aid and sympathy, on account of the common participation in human frailty and folly.\\" So to conclude, I believe Sumner was far from the sentiment associated with the characterization of this work being \\"Root, hog, or die.\\" Sumner regarded sympathy and aid to our fellow men as a necessary condition of human society.Overall this book makes for an interesting read, however I would caution readers to read it CAREFULLY to understand the arguments presented in it."},{"Title":"What social classes owe to each other (The Freeman)","review":"The content of this book is fabulous. Sumner makes a very good case against humanitarianism of all shapes and sizes.However, I would not recommend this publication. It is not sized like a regular book. It's perfectly legible, but I prefer something closer to a rectangle than a square shape."},{"Title":"What social classes owe to each other (The Freeman)","review":"\\"What ought All-of-us to do for some-of-us? But some-of-us are included in all-of-us and, so far as they get the benefit of their own efforts, it is the same as if they worked for themselves, and tehy must be cancelled out of All-of-us. Then the question which remains is, What ought Some-of-us do for Others-of-us, or, What do social classes owe to eachother?\\"This is the question William Graham Sumner poses and attempts to answer in What Do Social Classes Owe to Eachother. His answer, in brief, is that, the minute we suggest that social classes owe anything to eachother is the minute that some become the dictators of others and, by result, liberty is fractured.Sumner starts out by championing civic liberty and the idea that all persons have an equal right to their own earnings. Tamper with this, he writes, and no matter how good the intention, some will begin to rule others. By extension, Sumner reminds us that talk about \\"the State\\" as if it is a benevolent abstraction misses the fact that \\"the State\\" - particularly in a democratic country - is just some individuals governing other individuals.Sumner spends a good deal of time talking about the ideas of capital and labor. Capital is the means of production, and labor is the effort put forth to make capital into things we use. In Sumner's time, and in ours, there is much championing of the labor force but little championing of those who hold capital. Sumner, like Rand after, reminds us that labor needs capital to create wealth. Unlike Rand, however, Sumner reminds us taht just as much as labor needs capital, capital needs labor (in order to make it into something). For the reviewer below, who complains that Sumner is too individualistic, it is remarkable to note how many times Sumner stresses this, and similar, points: labor and capital need eachother, and the economy cannot function unless we all are doing our parts (harkening back to Adam Smith's division of labor and invisible hand.)Lastly, Sumner talks about the \\"forgotten man.\\" \\"The type and formula of most schemes of philanthropy or humanitarianism is this: A and B put their heads together to decide what C shall be made to do for D... I call C the Forgotten Man.\\" While much is always made of the rich being made to give to the poor, all too often, what happens is that the rich (who are often in power) decide that the middle class will give to the poor. Therefore, those who are on the verge of bettering themselves via their own effort are forced to give to those who are not, when their money could have been used to create more wealth (by making money, buying goods, and helping others who are trying to better their lot in the process.)In our own time, Sumner's book is a very interesting defense of economic liberty and the danger of statism and regulation. As you can see, the argument is much more philosophical than economic (whether capitalism leads to a better economy is secondary to whether it is morally justified). My biggest complaint is that the argument is somewhat myopic, and Sumner relies on rhetoric a bit too much. (Sumner does not consider the difficulties in his argument, like what to do with those who lack the ability to do for themselves do to no fault of their own, like the handicapped. A difficult moral case, which is perhaps why Sumner doesn't bring it up.)Anyhow, this is a good read for a cogent defense of the morality of capitalism and perils of do-gooding statism."},{"Title":"What social classes owe to each other (The Freeman)","review":"Sumner was the leading 19th century American champion of what for decades was called Social Darwinism, and what is now re-branded as \\"Libertarianism\\" by its contemporary proponents, a set of ideas originally popularized by English thinker Herbert Spencer. Sumner's thinking is essentially prejudices and clich&eacute;'s about how the poor have no one to blame but themselves for their plight. It's theoretical grounding insofar as it has one is John Locke's imaginary self-reliant individuals who appear ready-made outside society, and who come together to create society and its institutions to better protect their liberty and property through limited government based on the rule of law. The emergence of Social Darwinism/Libertarianism in Sumer and others as a latter-day expression of this fantasy-world of the self-actualizing propertied citizen is directly connected with challenges to the laissez-faire version of capitalism already evident in the first British factory legislation in the first decade of the 19th century regulating child factory labor in the textile industry. By the time Sumner publishes this book, British legislation had already forced employers to give up much of the cheap labor of children, set the standard work-day at ten hours, and mounting pressures in the United States were pushing similar agendas. This book was a push-back against these trends.I use chapters from this book in a course on modern intellectual history. While it is neither original nor insightful, it is an invaluable documentation of the true face of Social Darwinism. Sumner is writing well before regulation of working conditions has advanced very far in the U.S., when child factory labor, unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, low wages and insecurity are still the norm in American industrial capitalism. He is nonetheless fighting a rear-guard battle to maintain laissez-faire in the face of mounting criticism even within parts of the propertied classes. This explains the contempt and dismissiveness with which he address the conditions of the poor and poorly paid, and why he presents the owners of property and capital as the victims of unjust exploitation at the hands of those who wish to fleece them for the benefit of the lazy and shiftless (his words). He is in fact driven by the logic of Social Darwinism/Libertarianism to defend the indefensible at a time when the consequences of unregulated capitalism are all-too obvious for all to see: those who have great wealth deserve it; those who live in a misery that one could hardly find today in the centers of advanced, prosperous - and highly regulated - capitalism are exactly where they belong. This text should be read by anyone who might be seduced by the chimera of contemporary Social Darwinism; at least Sumner is far more honest about the world he is prepared to accept and live in than are his modern Libertarian disciples."},{"Title":"What social classes owe to each other (The Freeman)","review":"The book is accurate in asking the question that the title implies.

Most of the members are slaves, the others are poor, though free. Part one gives us the background of some of the church members: where they came from, how they got to Rome (if not born there), and how they became a Christian. The second part deals with the fire and the beginning of the persecution of the Christians, who were blamed with starting it. The last part details how individuals responded to the persecution. Among the Christians, there is heroism and cowardice - mostly the former. Among the non-Christians, there are those who become Christians because of the witness of those killed for an IDEA.Although Paul, Luke, Nero, Claudia Acte and other well-known historical people appear in this book, the main characters have humbler backgrounds. With one exception - Beric, son of a British king and adopted by Roman Senator Flavius Crispus. However, he was subject to humiliation like the others which opened the door to his salvation. Manasses, Lalage, Euphemia, Phaon, Persis, Niger, Eunice and the others showed the roots of the Church: the poor, the outcasts, the uneducated. This novel allows us to see underneath: they were individuals with different strengths and weaknesses, personalities and talents.It was refreshing to read a novel set in ancient Rome that focused on the lower classes. Life was hard, perhaps unbearable, but these people had the Kingdom to look forward to. Far from being victims, or seeing themselves as victims, they were victorious in Christ. Forgiving those who hated and/or persecuted them was not always easy, but gave them a freedom and a joy that others could not know or understand."},{"Title":"Drive Time: French (Cassette): Learn French While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"The first section of this course was fantastic -- they pronounced each French phrase very slowly, had you repeat each syllable, and then sped it up to full speed.

The format is completely different. Gone are the baby steps to help you get a handle on things (it is, after all BEGINNER French). This CD starts throwing grammar, sentence structure, and what I would consider slightly more intermediate French at you. The pace is faster, and some things are difficult to understand.

For me he has written three of the great books of the second half of the twentieth century and this is one of them (Money and London Fields being the other two).I will not bore you with a resume of how the book works, many other reviewers have talked about the backward story telling and the consciousness of the narrator, both of which richly enhance the book, but what I will say is that the techniques deliver two wonderfully inverted stand points.The first, is that by reversing the story, we are, of course, presented with a reversal of the main characters life as a Doctor. The \\"good\\" doctor, when he works in American Hospitals mutilates and makes the healthy sick. The \\"bad\\" Doctor, when working in the Holocaust camps brings the Jews to life, digging them from the ground, or in what is the most powerful passages of the book, summonsing their souls from the sky and returning them to life through the ovens.The second, and for me, equally as profound, is what the story telling does to our point of view about the main character. At no time do we really like him, there is nothing to like for much of the book, but at the ultimate point of his evil, we are forced to dislike him the most when he is, by nature of the story, bringing life to the dead.By telling the story backwards, the warping of the idea of time, not only warps our sense and sensibilities of the Holocaust, but it also forces us into an uneasy understanding of the main character. We know we can not like this person, yet...yet.Read this book. Challenge yourself. Ignore those who decry it. Once read you will read other novels and wish they are capable of delivering such a profound message in so few pages with such devastating technique."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read.

From his last hospital breaths to his conception, we see Amis's protagonist's life - affairs and medical career progressing backward to reveal a horrific dark secret in his past. It would be a shame to reveal this in a review, but even so, the charge made that Amis has exploited a certain unsavoury period in Twentieth Century history for entertainment value seems difficult to credit, any more than Beryl Bainbridge exploited the Crimean War to such effect in Master Georgie or Hilary Mantel the French Revolution, in A Place of Greater Safety. A 1990s British classic."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"Good stuff!

I knew something was going on, but I was completely missing the point. So I had to look it up on trusty old Amazon.com (I didn't have the jacket cover with me), and I realized that the story is being told from the present (death) to the past (birth).Okay, okay...this does take a while to get used to, regardless of whether you know what's going on or not. Dialogue is particularly difficult, but if you read it the way it's written, and then read it backwards (which is really forwards), then you'll be okay.What I love about this book is viewing the world in a completely different way. Doctors are torturers, torturers are doctors. This is a new concept for me -- I have never sat back and though how certain professions or actions can be viewed in the reverse. Definitely some fun mind play.Now the concept of the book isn't so much about this, but is a nice way to take an innocent narrator and have him show us the world through his eyes (albeit backwards). The central plot to the story is about a Nazi death camp doctor -- who he was before, during and after. It certainly isn't trying to pull at your heartstrings one way or another, but it makes you see things differently throughout. It allows you to come up with your own opinion without someone using the Nazis or concentration camps as a way to push you into one mood.Time's Arrow is worth the time and the effort. I even went back to the beginning when I finished and re-read it because I wanted to make sure I read and comprehend the whole book -- not just when I realized that the story was going backward."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"This is a great book for a mid-winter read. The characters are not likeable, the images are disturbing and (not often enough) haunting, and there are parts that lag; but the reason I read this book was its unique narrative device. A story told backwards, even if it is clich&eacute;d and devoid of any new insight, is worth any reader's time,--simply for the experience. I teach English and when going over the concept of narration with my students I brought in this book and read an excerpt. The kids were instantly hooked and I recieved numerous requests to borrow the book (sadly impossible since many of the book's themes are inappropriate for adolescent readers), but to see them excited about a book was a pleasant experience.

By fun I mean horrifying, nauseating and insane, of course. There are big moments in this story, but the things I found more interesting are the moments that we all experience every day--experienced in reverse here. This novel will not only make you question the faith and convictions of your fellow man, it will make you question yourself every time you put something in your mouth or throw something in the garbage. Amis does an incredible job of taking his near impossible gimmick and not only making it work logically, but also making it the glue of this narrative. Whether you come away from this novel shivering, cackling, stunned or callused, you will never see the sequence of life the same again. We are assured that our lives flash before us when we die, but no one guarantees in which direction."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"It's commonplace for hyperbolic reviews to claim that the book or film in question has somehow altered something about the reviewer: moral sensibility, ideas about race, historical perspective, etc. My favorites are the reviews that you see in trailers for films that have not fared so well with critics. Usually these one-to-five-word exclamations appear on the screen with the critic's name in microscopic print (translation: not Pauline Kael--or even Roger Ebert). Often in these cases the film has affected the reviewer in some startlingly physical manner: &quot;This film flattened me!&quot; Or the claim will predict such an effect for the prospective viewer: &quot;This movie will blow you away!&quot; (&quot;I'm not sure that I like the sound of that,&quot; I say to myself.)Book reviews are usually a bit more subtle. One recent reviewer of a Patrick O'Brian novel claims that the book altered him morally (I paraphrase). Most of you know that O'Brian is one of my favorites, but I'm not sure that I can honestly claim that his books have altered my morality in any profound sense. It would, I think, be odd if they had.I can claim honestly, however, that Time's Arrow altered my perceptions of time and space, and I mean this not in a speculative or cosmological sense, but in a real, palpable sense. This book affected me like the dream that haunts in remembered bits and pieces throughout the next day. The explanation for this effect lies in Amis's deft execution of his singular premise: the book tells the story of a man's life backwards, from his death to his birth.Amis makes this premise work by accumulating detail, a method that at times borders on jokiness: &quot;Tennis is a pretty dumb game, I'm finding: the fuzzy ball jumps out of the net, or out of the chicken wire at the back of the court, and the four of us bat it around until it is pocketed--quite arbitrarily, it seems to me--by the server.&quot; The tendency becomes laugh-out-loud funny in descriptions of bodily functions, though this is certainly a cheap kind of comedy. But the cumulative effect is that the reader begins making imaginative leaps, begins positing a backwards life until it becomes plausible.The plausibility is important, because it prepares us for the real source of the book's power. The most difficult aspect of this life for the narrator (who inhabits the body but not the mind of the central character) is his knowledge of the future combined with his ignorance of the past; he does not know he is living backwards. This existential position makes guilt into the strangest of emotions, and guilt becomes the centerpiece of the book as we approach the Holocaust. Only in reverse does the Holocaust make any kind of sense: the creation of a race, the healing of bodies, the integration of Jews into German society.I must stress, however, that Amis is no kind of apologist. His story is a kind of Nabokovian pathology of evil, made all the more disturbing through the reader's proximity to it. Thus I repeat and augment my initial claim in order to keep this review brief: this book altered my perception of time and space, and it frightened me by transforming evil in its backwards world."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"\\"London Fields,\\" Amis' previous novel, he tells us in its forward, could have been called \\"Time's Arrow,\\" and that term comes up a couple of times in that sprawling narrative epic of environmental and personal chaos near the millennium. His experimental style in that novel (also reviewed by me) took on a mock-heroic, satirical tone that tried to fit its bitter social critiques and mordant humor. For \\"Time's Arrow,\\" wisely, Amis stays sober. The voice assumed sounds much more American than the earlier novel, and this matter-of-fact style, reminding me in parts of Philip Roth's \\"Everyman,\\" makes the mix of the bizarre and the mundane convincing. The daring of this novel may undo it from reaching perfection, but it remains worthwhile as an intellectual and spiritual quest into how a human contorts under pressures to do the wrong thing.Reading it, I feared continuing as the horrors loomed ahead-- or behind. The ingenious structure of the tale fascinates. You fear how Dr. Friendly's medical skills will be warped, and how his care for children in his elderly incognito existence in America will be demonstrated to have emerged from the Nazi camps. This becomes a truly cathartic novel, in which fear and pity mingle as you turn the pages forward, backward into the origins of the doctor's past crimes.An early passage: \\"A child's breathless wailing calmed by the firm slap of a father's hand, a dead ant revived by the careless press of a passing sole, a wounded finger healed and sealed by the knife's blade: anything like that made me flinch and veer. But the body I live and move in, Tod's body, feels nothing.\\" (28) So we learn as his soul tells his tale. Like his spirit, we may not wish to continue the journey as the future recedes and the memories left repressed rear up and assault our senses, but this sometimes stunning depiction of the last century's historical regression into savagery, in its often relentless momentum, pulls us into their maelstrom.The strain of this structure, perhaps, means that the underlying moral condition, buried as it is under the weight of time and of apparent suppression by the doctor, becomes less distinct. This may be intentional, but it blunts the impact of the novel. Perhaps, on the other hand, this has been an effective step back by Amis, for how many fictional works have tried and also stumbled in trying to \\"explain\\" the camps, the doctors, and the evil?Amis, with relative reticence, and restraint, manages to take us into the labs of Auschwitz without exploitation or bathos. Parts remained rather unclear, but in retrospect I sense this shows the soul, and then Amis, stepping back from fully confronting the terrors that are summoned back from the lands of the dead. The necessary details that evoke this terrestrial hell, both in Tod's later life and his earlier years, have been integrated subtly, to show off by the estrangement of the form their parallel distortion in content, compared with conventional fiction and moral standards. This feat, in a novel that by its daring may (like \\"London Fields\\" in its range and hubris) show that Amis, even when he writes a less than perfect tale, can earn acclaim for his imagination, his innovation, and his performance in a bravura turn that compels you."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"Martin Amis delivers a clever book that tries to examine the horrors of the Nazis and what happened to the Nazi fugitives after the Red Army captured the concentration camps.Tod Friendly starts the novel by dying and lives his life backwards from the viewpoint of a narrating spirit or doppelganger. This clever device of living backwards, unbeknownst to the narrator, takes a little getting used to but you get the hang of it shortly. Sadly, we realize that Tod is not who he seems and continues to have nightmares from his future (his youth in this case.) Tod is really Odilo Unverdorben, a fugitive war criminal that experimented on Jews in the concentration camps during the holocaust.Tod is a surgeon who carefully breaks bones or impales victims (again living backwards) where the injured go off and heal themselves in the chaotic world. Ironically, the spirit doesn't realize the difference between the alias Tod as a surgeon hurting people so that they get better in the chaos, versus Odilo Unverdorben in Nazi Germany in the past that brings the Jew's back to life from the gas chambers (the alter ego again is experiencing everything backwards.)It sounds confusing, but it's a clever writing device. It's a short book, anything longer with the backwards time would get tiresome, but I think Amis handles it all masterfully."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"oh yeah. this one's a keeper.

I would read while walking -- wouldn't you think that disorienting, what with time moving backward and all that? well it wasn't, it was so very fascinating that I almost started walking backward as some tribute to the plot device.The very fact that the protagonist's name is Tod T Friendly should tell you bunches about M Amis. First you have to know that the word &quot;tod&quot; is German for &quot;death.&quot; From there you extrapolate that the middle &quot;T&quot; likely stands for &quot;the&quot; and you find his name means &quot;friendly death.&quot; Keep this in mind as you unravel Tod's life.as always, Martin Amis has out-clevered the mass of folks who crack his books and run their eyes over the pages. the synaptic misfires causing some to not or mis-understand this book is *NOT* a fault of the book or its author... it's the reader who's fallen short of the task of understanding M Amis's take on the various historical and cultural events and trends documented in this fine reverse-frame flicker."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"By narrating the life of his protagonist backwards, from death to birth, Amis takes us through a delightful reconsideration of both the mundane and the profound. While many passges seem to be just showing off - and these are great passages! - the technical achievements support rather than obviate new looks at important subjects. The description of holocaust victims being brought back to life and sent back to their homes is extraordinary (our seemingly benevolent narrator extracts gasoline from the victims by a hypodermic). The new look at male-female relationships is a riot: affairs begin with a slap and end in ritualized last (first) dates. Much of the richness of the novel comes from the dramatic irony of the narrator (the protagonist's soul?), whose simple pride in the protagonist's virtue is hopelessly backwards. This is a terrific novel for readers who like playful, skillful, comic, and serious unconventional writing."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"In a reverse spin of the unreliable narrator, Martin Amis pays homage to Kurt Vonneygut and Isaac Bashevis Singer in his story that opens to a reverse chronology of events, jarring the reader and allowing us to see humanity as the reverse of amorality and immorality. This technique of reversing age was used as a terrible gimmick inThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button(corrupted from F. Scott Fitzgerald and exploited for Hollywood), but in Amis' morality tale, it was employed as a perspective that was tantamount to the moral. (Also, in BUTTON, only Benjamin is reversing in age.)It is difficult to adjust to the narrative at first, because I did not know what I was witnessing. In fact, the protagonist experiencing his own reverse from old man to embryo does not straightaway understand it, either. What makes it so engaging is the character (and his secondary consciousness, i.e. the narrator) accepting it with an almost chaste goodwill, and describing his backward life with open-minded candor. The dialog is brilliantly conceived and, depending on your point-of-view (whether read forward or backward), contains subtle or compelling differences. What is even more canny--or uncanny--is when the dialog's meaning is stacked up against itself when read both ways.As this character--with the benign name of Tod Friendly--views his life from this new perspective, we learn that he is a medical doctor. The ironies accumulate, which often forced me to stop reading in order to contemplate and consider the implications. For example, it appears that violent injuries sustained by a patient actually heal the wounds, and that a doctor inflicted them. A woman's trauma is healed by assault in this backward chronology.When the reader is taken to certain key events in World War II, the reverse reality takes on a more riveting poignancy. The scenes here are the heart of the book's excellence and the humanity is bestowed via the ultimate paradox, the meaning of which still pierces me. I do not want to reveal too much for readers coming fresh to this book; however, I recommend that you let events lead you unencumbered, and don't try to intellectualize too much while you are reading. Eventually, the pieces interlock with deadly alacrity.My small problem was that Amis' use of reverse events, while central to the theme, did distract me and cause me to intellectualize too much at intervals (which is why I recommend going with the flow). I intend to read this again in the future, and I am confident that a second reading may have more emotional immediacy by allowing me to stop attending to the distractions about chronology, and go deeper into the apparent misinterpretations of the narrator. I will be ahead of the protagonist rather than beside him, which does alter Amis' intention, but a heady book such as this deserves another read.I highly recommend this to literature lovers, and to anyone interested in unusual literary perspectives. Amis executed a World War II morality tale that examines consciousness by transposing time, and excites awareness through time's reversal of consciousness."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"I can't recommend this novel enough. I've spread the Amis joy to all of my smart friends -- the less clever ones I recommend, say, Nick Hornby.Amis requires an effort but is absolutely worth it. If you've never read him, start with The Rachel Papers, then move on to Time's Arrow. Don't read the back of the book or any more of these reviews -- there's a certain plot development that they reveal for you that you'll want not to have revealed."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"I agree with quidamCS@usa.net when she says that by the middle of the book, the conceit of the &quot;running backwards&quot; device begins to kind of wear thin. But where I would have to seriously disagree is where she takes Amis to task for trivializing the Holocaust - that is missing the point. The Holocaust is not merely a device to show off this clever trick - the trick itself is secondary to it; when man's nature and all it serves is warped in such an insane fashion, when all morality is reversed, what looks normal only does so when viewed through a distorting filter. In this case, his literary device - and when you take it off, you see the horrifying nature of the beast, as it were!So, I would think this book makes the list of those books that you simply *should* read - to see one of the stars of Eng Lit at (close to) the peak of his powers.P.s. As for his magazine pieces, never mind what you think of his editors, he is one of the best essayists around. If you don't believe me try and read his review of &quot;Hannibal&quot; in the first issue of Talk, or read &quot;Visiting Mrs. Nabokov&quot;, then post a review."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"When I told him that I was writing about nuclear weapons, he said, with a lilt, 'Ah. I suppose you're. . . ''against them,'' are you?'-Martin Amis on his father, Kingsley, Einstein's MonstersNobody can imagine in physical terms the act of reversing the order of time. Time is not reversible.-Vladimir NabokovWhen we were kids, there was a toy from Kenner called, I believe, the Give-a-Show Projector. You'd tack a sheet up on the wall and use the hand-cranked projector to show a short film, typically an old Three Stooges. That was cool enough, but what made it really terrific was that you could run it backwards, so that the pie flew off of one Stooge's faces into the other's hand, and so on and so forth. Terrific that is for about ten minutes at a time and for a couple months, then it was exiled to a box in some closet and never heard from again. Martin Amis, apparently unaware of how quickly the novelty of such backward motion wears off, writes this entire novel from the perspective of a nascent human soul watching a man's life unspool in reverse.Dr. Tod T. Friendly dies as the book opens and the narrator is &quot;born&quot;. From this beginning/ending in an American city, the doppleganger (&quot;the soul he should have had&quot;) observes the progression/regression of Friendly's life, which takes them back to New York City, where he was known as John Young, to Portugal and Italy (Hamilton de Souza), to Germany (Odilo Unverdorben) and to Auschwitz, where Unverdorben worked under Mengele, performing horrific experiments on the inmates.It is at Auschwitz that we see just what Amis has intended, as, rather than a mass murderer, Unverdorben appears to be a healer, his experiments, run backwards, seeming to bring his &quot;patients&quot; back to life and health, the camp filling with people &quot;as good as new&quot;, the Zyklon B repackaged, the ghettos dismantled, the Jewish Laws repealed, the windows unshattered on Kristalnacht, the entire Holocaust itself being undone. And back and back until Unverdorben is unborn, crawling back into his mother, as if none of it had ever happened, a kind of cosmic do-over.Martin Amis has variously said that either the Holocaust is the central fact of modern life or that the &quot;nuclear experience&quot; was :Nuclear war never happened, but this was the nuclear experience, unknowable to anyone born toosoon or too late. In order to know what it was, you have to have been a schoolchild, crouched underyour desk, hoping it would protect you from the end of the world.And, indeed, his response to these two facts seems to be to want to hide under a desk or, as in Time's Arrow, to crawl back into the womb. Actually, this is his reaction to the general tendency towards entropy in all of existence. He seems terrified of disorder, longing for a return to the perfectly ordered world that existed before Adam and Eve ate of the apple.The problem with this yearning for security is that it is ultimately antihuman. The Holocaust, the prospect of nuclear war, all of the evils that we commit or of which we are capable, are all part and parcel of what it is to be human. Terrible as they are to contemplate, they are facts which we, as a species, must come to terms with if we are ever to overcome this capacity for evil. In this sense, Time's Arrow is representative of a literature of defeat. The security that Amis is in search of could only come at the expense of Man's free will. Many would find this a price worth paying, and since at least the time of Cain and Abel, humanity has divided into two camps over whether to pay it, but it would basically reduce us to the status of sheep. This prospect, of permanently surrendering our humanity, is surely more frightening than the knowledge that we are frequently susceptible to actions which are inhuman, more frightening even when that inhumanity occurs on such a horrific scale as did the Holocaust.Some critics have credited Amis with enhancing our understanding of the Holocaust by approaching it from a novel perspective, and it is always worthwhile to do so. But the time reversal technique is not compelling enough to carry the story along for all of its hundreds of pages. This is the type of clever trick that the Twilight Zone used to toss off in a half hour. This might have been an effective short story, but it's a rather tedious novel.GRADE : C"},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"An enormous disappointment.I have usually greatly enjoyed Martin Amis's novels. Sadly, not this one.The central premise is a neat one but there is more truth &amp; beauty in the single line from Vonnegut describing the bombers flying backwards over Dresden than there is in the whole of this book.Somewhere in the middle of this book Amis loses interest in the central premise. Maybe he is bored by it, maybe he lacks the intellectual rigour to see it through or may be he knows that the first 100 pages simply do not measure up and only the huge advance keeps him going."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"I love to read novels but could not get relate in any fashion to this book and gave up after page 50 of the short 160 pages. Many reviews for this book are positive, but the book does not seem to measure up to the hype - Booker short list, etc. - and in retrospect I would not have bought the book, and perhaps this review can save someone else some money.The book is written from the perspective of time going backwards, similar to watching a movie film played backwards. It covers some of the large and small events of modern urban life. For example, and going backwards, it describes a range of things from historical events to a bowl movement. Yes, a backward bowl movement, and a backward car crash, and a backward baby being sucked back into the womb, and on and on. There was a temptation to get around all of this and simply turn to the last page and read the book from the back, and I did try that briefly.After a while - about 10 pages for me - it is all a bit too much. It is a lot of work for a small gain. There are many better and more rewarding reads.Madame Bovary or a PD James novel is an ideal read for myself: these novels have realism, a predictable structure, one can follow the story without a fuss, one can stop and think, admire the prose, etc. That is all missing here. This is similar to a backwards in time chaotic urban Jack Kerouac.Not all will like it.I could not finish and gave up after two tries at around page 50."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"Whenever an author uses a literary gimmick like, say, writing a whole novel without using words with the letter &quot;e&quot; or making time flow backwards, or any such concept, two things inevitably happen: one, at first you may feel fascinated and you cannot help admiring the skill you need for such tour-de-force (which, I suspect, is the main point of the exercise), but eventually, the whole concept becomes tiresome. The second thing is that whatever it is you are writing about will inevitably be at the service to the gimmick in question and become trivialized. This is why it is aggravating that a subject like the Holocaust should be chosen for such an exercise, since a less trivial subject can hardly be imagined.If the whole idea was to express this person's regret about his crimes, his manner to erase the past by making it go backwards, making &quot;people come wounded, and go away healed,&quot; I should say it is a pretty primary manner to express it, especially because the doctor does not seem to be otherwise very repentant. Rather, he comes across as a kind of robot or zombie. If you like this kind of literature-as-a-game stuff probably this is the book for you, but if you want to read something more serious and compelling about a repentant Holocaust accomplice, try the Vanadium chapter in Primo Levi's &quot;The Periodic Table.&quot; In fact, try anything Levi, instead of this."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"Time*s Arrow is both a novel idea-a man living his life in reverse, and a macabre *happy ending* to the Final Solution--ultimately leaving me confused, disappointed, and with no idea of the point Amis wanted to make. The initial idea of backwards living--*vomiting* up food, cooling it in the oven, returning it to its original ingredients, for example, is fascinating, yet the luster of this soon fades. The life seems to makes sense either forwards or backwards for the book*s first half--and then we reach Germany, realize who the man is. This is where creditability falters. In *resurrecting* the Jews, Amis cannot eradicate what really happened--the tragedy cuts too deeply to be reversed, even in fiction. Digging up and reviving dead bodies, six million dead Jewish bodies, grips attention the way a plane wreck does, you hate yourself for gawking, but you still do. The book suffers from its point of view, the narrator is not the German doctor himself, which might be unwriteable, but a detached *observer* who keeps a running commentary of the reversed life. One point never cleared up is who or what *I* is. Does it naturally live backwards, or did Time itself flip over? Why is *I* following, (preceding?) this man? Why choose a Holocaust doctor? Amis provokes the reader without even trying to consider the questions. He spins the life, ever younger, back out of the horror, back out of marraige and love, back into the beginning of childhood, and decides to end. I wanted to see if the Observer would go all the way back to the womb--it doesn*t. Amis has taken two major themes, the Holocaust, the idea of a backwards life, and spun them together into a work that wobbles between them. If this is macabre comfort for genocide it fails. If not, it plays a ghastly game. The book does make the reader think, but think about what?"},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"The claim to fame of this book, I suppose, is that the plot runs backward in time and follows the life story of a man whose identity we don't really know. It does render some curious effects for the reader, such as most of the dialog running backward. The prose itself is at times somewhat confusing. If you are interested in a short account of the (backward) life story of a nazi doctor and his personal role in the holocaust this may be your book. But why bother? Why not read either a real account of such things or a good si-fi book which has the time travel angle covered a whole lot better than most prose fiction writers could ever do. Cheers.

I'm a huge fan of his writing and while I don't think this matches up with London Fields (in my opinion, few novels can), I really loved this novel. I was so into this book that in the week that I was reading it, I had dreams that my life was in reverse (very disorienting when I'd wake up). In retrospect, the backwards novel as a literary trick is a bit cheap, and using the Holocaust is possibly cheaper, nevertheless, I was absolutely wrapped up in this book.

I doubt that many writers could figure out a way to still insert some sort of social commentary, and yet Amis manages to do just that. I loved the way he snatches us right up in the beginning with the character's death, and we then spend the rest of the novel trying to piece together how or why he died, what he did in his life, and how these experiences shaped the character we saw in the beginning/end. It's an interesting read, and one that I'd recommend doing in one sitting if possible!"},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"As the impact of the holocaust recedes out of living memory forever, Amis renders the event anew. The narrator is an intelligent passenger inside the head of a man as his life unfolds in reverse. The narrator is intelligent, though his conclusions are based upon a world where letters first spring from fire and then are read, and where life is mended with the knife's edge. As a result, the narrator's perspective on events are innocent and pure like a child's. The effect is [hopefully] to re-awaken the world so they do not forget.With highly praised films such as \\"Life is Beautiful\\" portraying the holocaust as a Disney World, works like this one by Amis are increasingly more important.Aside from the obvious subject which isn't overtly revealed until the last quarter of the book, this little post-modern narrative experiment also reveals much more about the human condition where chess boards are painstakingly organized from chaos, the participant celebrate their work with a handshake, and the world moves towards a green promised land. A land that is known to exist, and it is only a matter of time before it is reached."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"Must read.

So what happens if you write the story backwards? All of a sudden the villains become saints: dying people are become healthier and healthier uner the hands of the guards of the camp until they walk out of the camp intact.

A story told in reverse, where effect is cause and cause effect. The simple premise of telling a story faithfully in reverse, starting with death and ending with birth, yields achingly poetic descriptions and opens a whole can of metaphysical worms. What's most amazing is the degree of suspense in wanting to know where the protagonist (a tragic figure) was before he got to where he ended up.

I'd think we can give Amis more credit than that...he's using the structure as a means to comment on existence, on time, not really a grandiose theme when you consider human life...that is, our entire way of being and seeing is wrapped up in memory, deep-rooted sorrows, things of the like.Profound? Yeah, but not pretentiously so.

He makes wry observations about daily life, and uses that to &quot;lull&quot;, if you will, the reader into getting comfortable with the perspective of someone experiencing reality that way, and then hits the reader over the head with far greater implications.- The Scope - Amis' presents a new, thought-provoking way to look at difficult questions about the Holocaust, an event that shaped history and has been looked at from countless directions. But he also contemplates more invidual questions about life, its meaning, and one's perception of self.Utimately, the book is like a good Impressionist painting, accessible yet ultimately profound. It is very easy to read and presented in an attention-grabbing style, and yet, upon further review, stands up to the rigor of in-depth query and changes the reader, which is the most you can ask from a book"},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"I just finished \\"Time's Arrow\\" (lent to me by a colleague who had it assigned in her university course). ...

No tricks or mirrors--just vivid, wrenching storytelling of unutterable poignancy.As for Amis's writing in general, I enjoyed the poetic imagery of his descriptions, as long as he was not using words like \\"coprocentric' that do not even appear in the 75,000 word \\"Oxford Dictionary of Current English\\"...."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"I wish I could give 10 for technique and 1 for morality where this strange book - which puports to travel though time and examine the Nazi mentality - is concerned.Amis skillfully uses the concept of an &quot;innocent narrator&quot; as a &quot;conscience&quot; in the novel to counterpoint the actions of the body which it inhabits. Backwards time and this commentary shed new light on everyday situations and if this had been the extent of the novel, this would have been clever and amusing.However, Amis has a major, and serious, theme in the novel which claims to examine the &quot;nature of the offence&quot;, ie the holocaust. Amis appears to reduce the horror of this genocide to an ironic literary technique, a methodology which is as heartless in its area as the experiments performed by &quot;Uncle Pepi&quot; on the inmates of the unnamed concentration camp.Perhaps this is the point of the novel, that technique overtakes feeling and sensibility, but even this is simplistic.

In Time's Arrow he proves that the line between good and evil can be blurred with a simple device, in this case telling the story in reverse.Dr. Friendly's tale, as told by Amis, shows good as a banal force that can be twisted at the will of the storyteller. Doctors become butchers and smokestacks scrub the sky. However, evil remains evil in the hands of even the most skilled wordsmith. Nazis, in this novel, are no longer genocidal automitons.

If you find these ideas brilliant, praise Martin Amis. If you find them callow, blame Martin Amis.An act of good turns into evil if one runs it backwards in time. And vice versa. A healer becomes a sadist; a killer becomes a healer. Amis chooses this ploy to depict some of the atrocities of the Nazi era. Predictably, savagery turns into philanthropy, if that's any solace.Fiction writers have been facing this challenge of depicting the Holocaust without making documentaries out of their novels. Gunter Grass (in Tin Drum) succeeded brilliantly by using the perspective of a mentally-retarded midget who refused to grow up after the age of three. I'm afraid I can't say the same of Martin Amis. Though the literary device is spectacular, it's not something that can stand repeated application. The author almost realizes this and restricts the novel to 170 odd pages. That's a relief."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"From beginning to end, Amis has managed to sustain a wonderful conceit: the inversion of time. The idea isn't original but this execution is complete and nearly perfect. Yes, the story somewhat pays homage to Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five but it is a weak parallel. Slaughterhouse-Five is a book where time is treated non-linearly and yet the narrative follows more or less the conventional marching forward. A better example really is T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone where a major character lives backwards in time. Merlin comes from the future, converges towards the age of young King Arthur and sweeps past into the past.In Time's Arrow, the narrator from the very first words &quot;I moved forward, out of the blackest sleep, ...&quot; experiences time inverted. From death to birth, the narrator must learn of the past by experiencing the world - he is naive as to the events of the past - day-by-day inside Tod's body (growing younger). Tod is the Nazi war criminal whose secret life unfolds - backwards. Oddly, the narrator appears naive has he is forced to speculate on the past based only on his knowledge of the present and future. He does not know the past. And he is often wrong, just as we are in predicting the future.Perhaps the most puzzingly aspect of the novel is the identity of the narrator. The narrator may be the protagonist or may be not ...It is ambiguous. Certainly, the narrator &quot;rides&quot; in the head of Tod Friendly (and his aliases) but he experiences the world mechanically like a closed circuit security camera. The narrator can only see and smell and hear what Tod sees and smells and hears. The narrator can not experience the thoughts or emotions of Tod. Strange but very rewarding. The narrator does see Tod's dreams. All very disorienting.But the de-familiarization of this backwards world has a peculiar effect on the re-telling of the atrocities of Auschwitz. Simply, narrator cuts through this horrifyingly familiar world of evil and allows the reader to ponder it as new - just as the naive narrator encounters it all for the first time.In short, this is a great book not because of its virtuosity in creating an inverted world, but by opening up a new possibility in literature. Why not tell stories backwards? Knowing what we know now, can we predict the past? Funnily enough, the world of science - geology, biology - is all too familiar with this novelty. It is only in literature where time must march forward."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"In Time's Arrow, British novelist Martin Amis begins with the death of Dr. Tod Friendly and then traces his life--backwards--into his sinister past. Though the outlandish premise of time running backwards wears thin at times, the story Amis tells is compelling enough to keep the reader interested until the very end...or beginning.Make no mistake, this book is weird. Amis maintains the backwards motif scrupulously, with dialogues printed in reverse order (Amis' one concession to the reader is to render the individual sentences forward) and every event described backwards. For instance: to eat,&quot;You select a soiled dish, collect some scraps from the garbage, and settle down for a short wait. Various items get gulped up into my mouth, and after skillful massage with tongue and teeth I transfer them to the plate for additional sculpture with knife and fork and spoon.&quot;The narrator is not Tod himself, exactly, but a sort of secondary consciousness, a spectator who is independent from Tod's thoughts but hostage inside his body. Amis never explains the peculiar identity of his narrator, who views the reverse unfolding of Tod's life as a forward-moving story.Amis uses the backwards perspective to showcase his powers of description. The narrator's ingenious explanations of everyday processes reversed, like eating, are pearls of smart, funny writing. His adept usage of the gleefully oblivious narrator results in delicious irony, as in this exposition on taxis:&quot;This business with the yellow cabs, it sure looks like an unimprovable deal. They're always there when you need one, even in the rain or when the theaters are closing. They pay you up front, no questions asked. They always know where you're going. They're great. No wonder we stand there, for hours on end, waving goodbye, or saluting--saluting this fine service. The streets are full of people with their arms raised, drenched and weary, thanking the yellow cabs.&quot;By looking at the world backwards, Amis offers uncommon but resonant observations on the way it functions. Following a story told backwards is a formidable challenge for the reader, though; it makes the head spin at first. Only after much reading do the rhythms of this world of reverse causation start to make sense.It becomes clear early in the book that something is seriously wrong with Tod's life. Ominous signs are everywhere; Tod's many relationships with women, dysfunctional backwards or forwards, suggest he has serious emotional problems. Shortly before (after?) his death, one girlfriend harasses him about &quot;his secret.&quot; The readers move onward, conscious that they are getting ever closer to the answers in Tod's past. Amis' structuring of the story to provide suspense through foreshadowing (or after-shadowing?) is masterful. By reversing causality, he turns all principles of literary development on their head. We see the endings first and anticipate the beginnings; we seek the causes of events, not their results.Why tell a story backwards? The text suggests a few answers early on. Recounting a life backwards invites the reader to ask where the life is going. At times, it seems that Amis' message is that the life does not make any progress. The end of Friendly's life is decidedly inauspicious; did he accomplish anything? Through the ultimate futility of all Friendly's personal relations, Amis hints that run either way, life lacks real direction:&quot;I have noticed in the past, of course, that most conversations would make much better sense if you ran them backward. But with this man-woman stuff, you could run them anyway you liked--and still get no further forward.&quot;The more positive side of the reversal is that it highlights the good parts of life people are apt to miss going forward. Like the dead in Our Town, who recognize how precious and fleeting life is, the narrator rebukes Friendly for not enjoying his &quot;improvement&quot; in health as he gets younger. For better or worse, the reversal offers a new perspective on life and a new way of evaluating it.The narrator moves with Tod through a series of identity changes, over into Europe, and ultimately to the darkness which haunts all that proceeds it: Tod (really named Odilo) works as a &quot;doctor&quot; at Auschwitz. The narrator describes the obscene murder and brutality which Tod oversees, but in the same cheerfully uncomprehending manner as before. For the narrator, the laws of reverse causation are in effect: the officers at the camp are creating a people, using fire and gas--dead men are taken from the pile outside, Tod extracts poisons from them with a syringe, and they come back to life. Suddenly, the accustomed irony of the narrator's descriptions has become unbearably bitter; for instance: &quot;I saw the old Jew struggle to the surface of the deep latrine, how he splashed and struggled into life, and was hoisted out by the jubilant guards, his clothes cleansed by the mire.&quot; Amis achieves the desired effect: by describing the atrocities obliquely, through the upbeat, backwards narrator, the impact on the reader is more painful than it could be with a direct description.Now we understand the primary significance of the book's backwardness. The Holocaust was the ultimate repudiation and reversal of human morality. Its world of gas chambers and crematoriums was obscenely wrong, still inconceivable to most people even today. For the narrator, of course, it was the only world which made sense--a happy world, dedicated to feeding the Jews, joining their families together, giving them property, rights, and even life. Only in a backwards world where taking is giving, where destruction is creation can the Holocaust make sense.Now the puzzle of Tod's later life all fits together; even his assumed name acquires a new significance, if one knows that &quot;Tod&quot; is German for death. &quot;Tod Friendly&quot; represents the two phases of his life: the German years occupied with death, followed by the desperate friendliness he offered as atonement. But Amis makes clear that the &quot;Friendly&quot; years can never erase his sins; he is tied to them by the unbreakable line of time. And though following a story backwards can border on tedious at moments, Amis' sharp writing, intriguing story line, and disturbing study of the Holocaust keep the reader following the trail of the arrow."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"At the moment of Dr Tod T. Friendly's death, a consciousness is born and then witnesses the doctor's entire life - lived backwards. The voice trails the doctor through his early retirement, his last years of work and degenerating relationships, then back through his heyday as a surgeon, his life in New York, various name changes, and then back via ship to postwar Europe. At first nothing seems to make sense for the narrating consciousness: people are talking and walking backwards; relationships begin with tearful meetings and slapped faces and end with coy moments in hospital corridors; mysterious, coded letters emerge from the flames of the fireplace; and the doctor and his colleagues work passionately at making healthy people sick, or wounding them and throwing them into ambulances to be taken back onto the streets. But finally, when we follow the good doctor back to his time at Auschwitz, life begins to make sense at last. There, he and his colleagues are doing something wonderful: they are creating the Jewish race. Pulling smoke and ashes from the sky, assembling the debris into human beings, bringing them to life with gas, letting them work their way into health, then uniting them with family members and sending them off by train to flourish in the towns and cities of Europe... What at first seems like a rather trivial exercise in literary game-playing - the conceit of narrating a life lived backwards - becomes, in fact, the device which enables Amis to deliver one of the most effective and affecting condemnations of the Holocaust without writing a single word against it. By showing it in reverse - by inverting its objectives, its sequence and its consequences - Amis renders the Nazi program in all its grotesque obscenity. The camps are plainly revealed as the sickening inversion, the opposite, of everything good in the world: love, decency, creativity, freedom. Many have noted that these places, these crimes, have an existential meaning beyond politics or shock or pity. They have become symbols of our own inturned nihilism. As Peter Handke has explained, the idea of the camps is so compelling for us because in them the whole of life's demonic undertow has found, at last, its specific image. Amis draws it clearly - he shows us how and why Handke's statement is true, and that makes this bold and striking novel essential reading."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"When I first picked up this book, I was worried that the whole &quot;backwards time thing&quot; would be just another literary gimmick with no depth. Then I started reading it -- and found myself sitting around the house unable to remember whether I was supposed to tie my shoes or put them on first... and a friend of mine said, when she read it, that she &quot;would wake up in the middle of the night having to consciously think about which direction time was going.&quot;To my mind, this psychological/temporal craziness makes a certain kind of unthinkability real (in literary form) -- and thus makes the mindset of Nazi (or any) atrocity real in a way that conventional wisdom, with its constant labelling of all atrocity as committed by some &quot;evil other,&quot; could never do.The fact that one would have to so maul the basic temporality of existence just to get into the head of the committer of atrocity and have it make any sense at all is incredibly powerful.What's more, the incredible horrific irony of many of the actual medical scenes breaks down (at least in this reader) any possibility of &quot;desensitization to violence.&quot; All I had to do was think of dead Jews piled in a room, then filled with the &quot;life-giving Zyklon-B&quot; and shipped back to idyllic homelands, to shock me into feeling the true horror of genocidal politics."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"Tod Friendly, a doctor living in the US, dies. Somehow an alter ego of Dr. Friendly is born during his death and proceeds to live his life backwards. He watches people walk backwards and talk backwards as he lives Friendly's life in reverse all the way back to his birth. We find out that the good doctor hides a horrible secret in his past-He was a Holocaust Doctor who experimented on Jews and others at Auschwitz during World War 2.Amis uses this unique approach and it works well until the very end which I thought got a little too mystical for me. It is a short book (I agree with others who say that any longer and the backwards-in-time trick would've been a bit much) that is at time hilarious and powerful. Reading the section about his experimentations on the prisoners in Aushwitz was horrible, and the irony of the whole situation (since the doctor's alter ego is watching it backward, he believes that many Jews were actually brought to life by the death camp) is not lost at all. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"It is perhaps Martin Amis greatest misfortune that in decade plus since he wrote Time's Arrow telling tales backwards has become so in vogue. Following the film Memento, movies and novels both have grasped on to the device, sometimes using it well where it fits, more often just relying on it to make a story seem more clever than it is. Yet few tales better suit the backwards telling of a tale than Time's Arrow, which begins at the death of an American doctor, Todd Friendly, where an errant spirit enters him at death and proceeds to live his life in reverse. Some reviewers oddly complain that there is not enough explanation as to the why of this premise -- as if most modern stories suffer from lack of explosition! -- but that is far from the point.Amis here tackles one of the Herculean tasks of writing -- finding a wholly original way to examine perhaps the most over examined topic of the second half of the 20th century. Guided only by Dr. Friendly's \\"second spirit\\" we live the whole of his life in reverse as the narrator tries to understand a world where people derive sustenance from toilets and garbage pails regurgitate at meals, and eventually return perfectly formed food to the super market. So to Amis explores the perverse notion of Nazism, the taking of ash and teeth to build human beings, first molding them in ovens, then applying gas to return them to life, slowly tending them back towards health, eventually sending them off into the world with possessions and dignity gifted to them by their creators.Obviously by its nature the novel must dwell on this single device. Not only does Amis use it to the fullest, but to his credit he understands that it cannot take him past 200 pages, so he keeps the tale mercifully short, rarely belaboring his premise. As one can see, some loved this novel, others hated it. At less than 180 pages, any reader can pick it up and judge for themselves."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"In fact, you may want to back up towards this book, shielding your eyes from the back cover and any glowing comments in the first few pages.

Open up..."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"One reviewer said \\"the backwards novel as a literary trick is a bit cheap, and using the Holocaust is possibly cheaper\\"I think this misses the point. The backwards novel is used entirely because the Holocaust is the subject, not just randomly alongside it as another trick.The editorial review above nails it. How can you make sense of the Holocaust? Only backwards. How can Amis sneak the horror of the Holocaust past your baggage of knowledge about it? Backwards.What was getting better is getting worse, what was getting worse is getting better. That is the new perspective that lets us see again, as if for the first time.Sebb"},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"While at first I believed that Amis first decided to employ the litterary device of telling a story backwards through a &quot;narrator trapped in the mind&quot; of Dr. Friendly, as I reflect on the book, I believe the litterary device resulted in an effort to explain the actions of &quot;doctors&quot; in Nazi death camps. Whether the egg came first or the chicken did, however, only Amis can answer. I do believe that the author succeeds in showing the reader that the only time the narrator finds fufillment is in the death camps. When Friendly is in private practice in America, the narrator is angered every time a prefectly healthy patient begins seeing Friendly, then becomes sicker and sicker until the patient leaves near death, rarely to be seen again (telling the story backwards) or how his long time girlfriend arrives to a perfectly clean house, then procedes to dirty the dishes, windows, carpet, etc. The only time the narrator inside Friendly's head feels good about the events going on around him is when bodies are brought to Friendly for him to make living humans. In all, it's the strangest book I've read (made much easier once I started reading skipping a few pages and reading the dialoge the in &quot;correct&quot; order), but worth reading in that it gives the reader something to think about: is this an accurate representation of how Nazi doctors saw themselves?"},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"This book begins with the near-death collapse of a sucessful American doctor, Tod Friendly, then traces his life backwards through his years as an illegal immigrant and the horrors of his wartime service in the SS, ending with his upbringing in a Germany destroyed by the first World War. But these are no mere flashbacks; everything happens in reverse, down to the mechanics of eating, defecation, and sex. The central character's work as a physician thus involves taking in healthy patients and sending them out with illnesses or injuries. The payoff, however, is that the same doctor's work at Auschwitz, now under his given name of Odilo Unverdorben (\\"innocent\\"), involves bringing Jews to life out of the ashes, restoring their property, and distributing them around Europe. It is a powerful conceit that gives an unexpected way of revisiting the Holocaust. The problem, however, is that the sheer cleverness of Amis' technique takes center stage, and gets in the way of his deeper study of how a man could be born in innocence, immerse himself in horror, and still reach towards some sort of personal redemption."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this book after reading the review in the New Yorker.

The actual life story of the main character is compelling and interesting, but it could be about anyone really. The fascinating thing about this book is it's concept of time flowing backwards.

It reminded me of how I felt after reading the first half of Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot; everytime someone coughed I got a creepy feeling a deadly virus was being spread.

That is to say, it doesn't over-intellectualize the horror of Auschwitz to the point that it dehumanizes the victims--or their Nazi captors. It doesn't allow evil to be comfortably externalized in the Nazi Other, and instead forces the reader to confront their own complicity in the violence of the story.Ultimately, the phrase \\"here there is no why\\" becomes a mantra and a rallying cry for the restoration to reason and humanity as reader and author delve into a trauma so horrific that it resists any sort of linear narrative, forcing the novel itself to come apart at the seams."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"Martin Amis' Booker Prize shortlisted book Time's Arrow is a powerful narration of the life of a Nazi war criminal doctor that explores the concepts of cause and effect, love and domination, perspective and reality, creation and destruction, stereotypes and the individual. The story, told backwards and by a third person but in the first person (you'll have to read it to understand this point), is a truly original method in which to render environment, emotion, and time, and is full of Amis' usual relentless irony and wit.The relationship of cause and effect is perhaps the most powerful and poignant of all in the universe and something that interests me deeply. The inextricable nature of cause always preceding effect has important ramifications for everything. For one, it means time travel is impossible (which calls into question the central premise of this book; however it is a work of fiction so one need not worry about adherence to fundamentals like universal laws of physics!). Second, it means that we humans can foresee the outcomes of our actions by comparison to prior knowledge and experience. It is our ability to predict cause and effect that allows us to view a world that (mostly) makes sense. If effect could arise before cause then one would have no ability to predict the next event and the world would not make sense. Time's Arrow deals with this problem page by page in its backward tense. Eating involves food going from mouth to plate, just for an example. Interestingly, it is the atrocities of Auschwitz (Josef Mengele and his human experimentation is superbly interwoven into the storyline) that make the most sense in the backward monologue, perhaps because it is an act that made the least sense in reality. This paradox is a particularly difficult setting in which to discuss the dualities of creation and destruction, and also of stereotypes.Ask anyone what traits are found in the average German and you'll most likely get some gormless statement about them being cold, detached, having clinical precision and adhering to procedural excellence. I never pay much interest to stereotypes of any kind as by definition they are an attempt to ascribe traits about individuals that cannot be readily attributed to the geographic or ethnic bounds in which they are prescribed. However, it is difficult to think the atrocities of the Nazi's and not subsume at least some vision of the generic Germanic traits into your thoughts. It is as Martin Amis says in the acknowledgements of his book, Time's Arrow - \\"The offence was unique, not in its cruelty, nor in its cowardice, but in its style - in its combination of the atavistic and the modern\\". Indeed there have been many examples of violence, murder and genocide throughout the ages - the Soviet Terror famines, the crusades and inquisitions, the various genocides of the late 20th century. What sets the Nazi \`Final Solution' apart is that far from being a pornographic display of gratuitous violence, the Germans instituted mass murder with production line efficiency. It was the most wicked debasement of human solidarity. Amis captures this throughout, all the while the narrator gets the whole damned world wrong (e.g. the Jews are created by the Nazi's).In contrast to the generally inconsequential Germanic stereotype, anti-Semitism is without question the most despicable of prejudices, owing to the irrational conjoining of the view that Jews are subhuman and archaic with the belief that they collectively form a planned and organised conspiracy to control the world, country or industry. There is jewish joke that Christopher Hitchens retells in Love, Poverty, and War that goes something like \`two old jewish men are sitting on a park bench in Berlin in the early 1930s. One of the two is solemnly reading a Jewish newspaper. The other is scanning a Nazi newspaper, and laughing out loud. Finally the first man stops reading and says, \\"It's bad enough that you read that pro-Hitler rag. But to laugh at it!\\" The second responds with a shrug. \\"What if I read your paper? It tells me about Jewish windows being broken, Jewish shops boycotted, Jewish children beaten up in school. So....if I read the Hitler paper it tells me that we Jews control the Whole world!\\"' Amis touches on this sentiment lightly, however I felt that the book could have made more of this irony and firmed the historical point of the story with reference to The protocols of the Elders of Zion, the old fabrication that accuses the Jews of, amongst other things, a plot for world domination and thickening their matzos with the blood of a non-Jewish child, and was widely distributed and believed in Germany from the 1920's on. Indeed, Hitler's Mein Kampf refers to the Protocols.Time's Arrow is a book that makes one restless in their seat, quarrelled in the mind and at times, hollow. The prose, so piercingly truthfully introspective while at the same time completely messing with the order of things, prickles the nerves and forces something of a parallel story to be maintained at all times. This parallel story, of course, was the author's intended understanding of the story. The horror, shame, self loathing, atrocity and death that came from unquestionably implementing the procedural genocide for the cruellest of leaders is not something that can be easily reinterpreted without seeming to slip somewhat into reactionary denialism of the David Irving ilk, or downright offensive misrepresentation. Amis, witty as ever, has managed a unique interpretation that deserved higher accolades than runner-up at the Booker pageant."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"This is a highly unusual novel, in some ways as unique as Pale Fire by Nabokov. It is a tale told backward in time through the perspective of the soul of the deceased, yet the soul in nave to the life of the body in which it resides. Thus all backward experiences are experienced by the soul as fresh and are often innocently interpreted. It is a moral reckoning also for the reader recognizes horror where the soul misses it. Martin Amis begins with the death of a German Nazi physician who has taken on a new identity in America but the story propels you from his death bed back through his experiences in the United States and then at the crux of the story to his experiences in Auschwitz. The book is often humorous and clever as Amis relates in reverse the experiences of eating, conversations, shopping, and riding in taxi cabs in New York City all experienced in reverse time. Conversations in reverse have a fascinating way of conveying the same messages whether read forward or backward. However it is the particular genius of this novel that first Amis shows the protagonist in New York practicing medicine but since it is all backward in time, well patients come to him and the procedures he gives them (or takes from them as the case may be) make the patients sick and they leave his office sick. Thus healing is seen backward. However it is important that he shows us this reversal so that we fully comprehend the horror of the Nazi physicians at Auschwitz with their terrible procedures. For the experiments they conducted on the Jews were horrific, painful, tortures. Poisons of all kinds were injected into all body parts causing caustic burns and incredible pain. However because time is reversed these physicians seem to heal, for they take a Jew with terrible swollen eyes and suck the poisons out with their syringes and the Jewish victim is left better after the procedure. Amis is making a commentary of the moral corruption of the practice of medicine under the German Nazis. Several passages from this section of the book evoke images of nightmarish horror and cruelty. But the innocent soul experiences everything wide-eyed in reverse. Reading a book backward is actually not easy and the reader may find some passages required a second reading to capture the world in reverse. Prior to his experiences as a Nazi physician the protagonist (of many names) goes through his first sexual experiences with his future wife in reverse. Amis pairs these sexual experiences of a young couple with growing violence against the Jewish people. Experiencing terror and cruelty in reverse has the ability to open up the experience for the reader, which I think was one of Amis' aims. But the most hauntingly beautiful sections of the book had to do with the return of the Jewish people from the ashes and smoke, from the sky and heavens, from the ovens and gas chambers. It is these passages that seems to be the central message or image of the book. It is almost an archetypal series of images, beyond human reason when the acts of unspeakable human cruelty are reversed and the human soul is refreshed. We now understand why the soul is nave and innocent for this backward version of the human soul sees cruelty and murder undone. Amis hits a cord within the human soul that longs for the evil to be reversed, for time to turn around so that all the injustice is taken away. But we are left with the reality that time can not be reversed, that innocence can not be regained once lost, that only atonement and moral action saves us from the fate of Dr. Tod Friendly."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"The main conceit of this novel is that time is moving backward.

The conceit here is that time's arrow runs backwards; the novel begins with the death of its protagonist and goes on, in reverse, from there. This is not an original idea, nor, by the way, was Kurt Vonnegut the first guy to come up with it; C.H. Sisson used much the same gimmick in his novel &quot;Christopher Homme&quot; back in the '60s.Amis just doesn't have the skill to deal with the concept adequately. His characters conduct conversations backwards--but the actual sentences they speak run forward. This is perhaps a necessary compromise--no one would want to read backwards prose--but one wishes that Amis had resolved this problem without violating his premise. A more grievous fault lies in the awkward use of the first-person narrator, which is, I think, another technical compromise. Obviously, this book could not have been written in the first person from the viewpoint of Tod T. Friendly, but Amis' solution to this is unsatisfactory. He introduces a nameless second character's mind, somehow trapped within the body of Mr. Friendly (this is never clearly explained), which reflects, in comically befuddled fashion, upon the various happenings. It feels terribly contrived.Amis is taking on a large subject here, but the end result feels too gimmicky--and it is fatuous to claim that he says anything particularly profound about the Holocaust.

Friendly is an old doctor who has a dark secret in his past (that is, in the narrator's future), and as the reader snoozes through Friendly's life backwards, we find that he was a Nazi doctor during the Holocaust. But that troubling sequence zooms by with little to show for it, except for some predictable comments on cruelty and death and the horror of war from Amis. The backwards time stream device merely becomes an annoying vehicle for Amis to explore how weird stuff looks in reverse, while conversations even more nonsensically flow backwards by the sentence rather than by the sound - showing that Amis can't even make his basic writing method work. The reverse-time-traveling doppelganger eventually reaches Friendly's logical end/beginning with some completely underwhelming big statements on life and creation. Send your own conciousness backwards to the time before you thought about reading this contrived and unsuccessful book.

So, to the observer, Tom's relationships start with screaming and end with flirting glances. The observer's life starts with Tom's death and ends with Tom's birth.In Tom's &quot;forward&quot; (to us) life, he was a &quot;doctor&quot; in a Nazi concentration camp, so the observer sees Tom's dreams of the horrors that he committed before they actually happen. And the observer does not realize that he is living Tom's life backward. Kind of weird, but interesting. Not gory.Unfortunately, Mr. Amos gets a bit lazy at parts. The ending (beginning?), which I had eagerly been looking forward to (what happens when the observer dies and Tom is born), is a bit weak. Somewhere between 16, 3, and birth, years are skipped that I believe would have added greatly to the story.As for the observer...who is he/she? What is it? Where did it come from? The answers elude the reader. Tsk, tsk.In short, this is a wonderful rainy Saturday afternoon read, but only if you keep your expectations to any deep answers low. The twist of observing life backward makes it worth it; the author's laziness will leave you disappointed."},{"Title":"Time's Arrow","review":"The idea, what if we could reverse the ills and atrocities of mankind is a romantic one. Vonnegut's dream sequence in slauterhouse five is inspired. Amis's literary mockery of such a horrific historical event with innumerable people dead is nothing but a disgrace. I cannot believe how many amazon readers have written good reviews about this book...If the holocaust can be treated as lightly, a mere showcase for the talents of this guy, and have just a few people object to it then I am afraid that humanity is in for much worse...When this book was first published, and being an avid reader and admirer of amis's stylistics I went and bought it not very much aware of the subject matter. I was shocked and disgusted to find out that the holocaust had just received a pre-adolescent &quot;I bet ya I can pull it off&quot; make-over. (Amis recently mentioned in an interview that he plans to write a historical study of Stalin's dead at the Siberian ghula, how about that for stubborness, consistency and a hidden agenda?)"},{"Title":"KJV New Strong's Reference Bible","review":"It seems that the concordances that are bound together with study Bibles are never quite thorough enough. In the interest of size, the concordances are abridged to the point that they will find some passages that I'm looking for, but never all of them. So I wondered if anyone printed a KJV Bible that contained a complete concordance.After a year or two of being told that such a Bible didn't exist because it would be too bulky, or being told that such Bibles did exist and then finding them to be inadequate, I stumbled across this one. This is what I was looking for.If I have any complaint with this Bible, it is that the pages are thin (of, course) while the typeface is not. The result is that a bit more print shadow shows through the page than I'm accustomed to in a compact Bible.

I am a chaplain working in three correctional institutions, and I need a compact Bible with a full concordance to carry with me at all times. This is the only Bible I've found with a complete Strong's concordance in it, yet it's compact, not a thick Bible as you might expect. I love the bold, easy to read font in the Bible text, and the beautiful bonded leather cover. The font in the concordance is not as large as I would like (difficult to easily read). A credit card magnifier would be a great help, although it is still useable without one, just not as comfortably so. While I would like for the font in the concordance to be a bit larger, overall this is a great Bible for those who want a full concordance at their fingertips. Nelson markets it as having &#34;the best concordance available in any Bible,&#34; which I believe is a true statement, based on my research. Overall, very pleased with this Bible. In looking, it seems like this Bible is sold most frequently in hardback, which isn't allowed in the correctional institutions in which I serve. The soft-cover bonded leather versions seem to be in very short supply, so if that is important to you and you can find one, my advice is to get it. Also keep in mind that this is a reference Bible, not a study Bible.

Famous Freudian Marxist Erich Fromm uses the \\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\\" as well as \\"The German Ideology\\" to stress the importance of humanist concepts such as alienation, freedom, and creativity for Marx, and in so doing explains what these and similar terms mean in Marx' work. Fromm has clearly paid careful attention to Marx' philosophy, and this part of the book is quite good as a simple overview.The second half of the book covers the English translation of the aforementioned \\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\\" by Tom Bottomore, as well as excerpts from various other works by and about Marx meaning to show his humanism, his good nature, and his sensitivity to culture. Of special interest are the excerpts from the memoirs of those who knew Marx, like his daughter Eleanor as well as Paul Lafargue. These works are often quoted, but rarely does one find a larger part in English, not even in McLellan's biography.Fromm goes a bit overboard here and there in stressing Marx' 'spiritual' nature. Although nothing Fromm writes is of itself incorrect, it may unwittingly reinforce the old canard of Marxism 'really' being a religion, and Marx a millennarian prophet, and so on. Fromm obviously rejects this old refrain, but should have made that clearer. In other aspects this collection is an interesting primer on Marx as thinker on human action and human nature, and sheds good light on this side of Marxist thought for those not familiar with it."},{"Title":"Marx\\"s Concept of Man","review":"Marx? Communism? Please!That's the gut reaction of most of us. Why is this? Why is the man who's ideas stimulated nearly half the world to revolution automatically rejected without even being seriously looked at by most of us the U.S. today? What's that you say? \\"History shows us that communism is an impossible system that leads to the greatest tyranny.\\"The fact is Marx is much more than communism. His most famous work is not called Communism but Capital. (The manifesto was a small pamphlet next to the thousands of pages of the planned four volumes of Capital). He is strongest in his analysis of the very history and machinery of this economic system. In fact, it is in his critique of capitalism (not his proposition of communism) that he is most original.Today, we see yet another crisis in global capitalism. Almost all of us who seek understanding of this crisis do so using the very same conceptual tools of the capitalist doctrine itself. But what if there are incorrect assumptions that the governments, universities and media networks of the world continuously overlook?Marx's Concept of Man serves as an introduction to such an analysis. It is a compilation of various manuscripts of the early Marx and is quite digestible--especially after Fromm's preface. Erich Fromm--a significant 20th century philosopher in his own right--introduces us to some of the most timeless aspects of Marx's concept of man in a way that makes his thought significant to this day."},{"Title":"Marx\\"s Concept of Man","review":"This book is an excellent book for anyone wishing to gain a readable understanding of Marxist thought. The first 92 pages are especially insightful. A must buy for anyone interested in Marxism."},{"Title":"Marx\\"s Concept of Man","review":"Erich Fromm, displays a different profile of Karl Marx. According to Fromm, Marx is very different than the one told by the Russian Communists. Fromm tries to show the humanist ideas of Marx and he describes Marx's philosophy as a synthesis of humanism and naturalism. There are also good descriptions of what socialism means: \\"Socialism, for Marx, is a society which permits the actualization of man's essence, by overcoming his alienation.\\".Fromm describes the Marxist socialism as the heirs of propethic Messianism.This book is really interesting because Fromm tries to explain the humanistic values in socialism.Indeed, all the communist propaganda has claimed that their way is the real Marxist system; however Fromm claims that their system was just a crude communism which neglected human beings and humanistic values."},{"Title":"Marx\\"s Concept of Man","review":"Fromm's analysis of Marx is incredible, finally someone truly understands Marx's writing. This is an excellent edition for someone looking for a side of Marx not often discussed."},{"Title":"Marx\\"s Concept of Man","review":"This is a book that should, but given the existing political culture, won't be made required reading in schools and universities.Eric Fromm was a humanist writer who lived from 1900 to 1980, and exerted a strong influence on Baby Boomers with his popular books. This book about Humanistic Marxism shook the intellectual world when it was first published in 1961. It rattled the conventional wisdom at the time it was first published. The West had, as Fromm readily admits, a glaring misconception of what Marxism meant. They could hardly be blamed for this misunderstanding. The only example the West had to look towards to see Marxism in action was to observe the Soviet Union. The Eastern Block shares responsibility in misconstruing the meaning of Marx. Its monumental government apparatuses, unwieldy bureaucracies, its virulent oppression of human rights, all these characteristics were definitely NOT how Marx envisioned a communistic society.Fromm goes into great detail on the humanistic philosophy of Marxism. If Hobbes' Leviathan emerged to protect man from a state of nature, the true goal of society according to Marx is to provide the conditions by which man may reestablish his relationship with nature, with others, with society at large, and with himself. The impediment to this reestablishment is alienation, a common concept of Marx, which drives a wedge between man and the other elements to his life and to himself. As Fromm repeatedly reminds the reader, alienation does not simply exist in Western societies; it is equally prevalent in those countries under a so-called \\"Communist\\" form of government. Fromm states that the governments of Lenin, Stalin and Khrushchev were simple totalitarian states.There is a decided spiritual aspect to Marx, in that the goal of a person's life is self-realization. This self-realization, however, is one which allows a person to achieve their own personal goals, based on that person's abilities, talents and labor.Fromm was addressing a world in the middle of the Cold War, and published in an America just emerging from the crushing conformity of the 1950's. It has continued relevance today, where the societal pressures are hidden and the urge to conform reemerging.This is a short book and can be read in two or three sittings. It is a well worth read."},{"Title":"Marx\\"s Concept of Man","review":"...someone dusted off Marx and took a good psychological look at the wealth in his writings! One needn't be a Marxist (I am not) to appreciate this fine book. My one concern is that Fromm is to Marx as Kaufmann is to Nietzsche: both men either ignore or euphemize the weaknesses in the visionaries they write about (e.g., Kaufmann's remark that Nietzsche's hateful, cynical, and demeaning remarks about women &quot;do him little credit&quot;). Nevertheless, this book provides a good compensation for the Western tendency to demonize a man very much misunderstood by those who turned his writings to political purposes."},{"Title":"Internal Gold","review":"I think MaCherie shows great promise in her writing - at 16 she has written a wonderful fantasy tale with Internal Gold. The story is fascinating, well paced, easy to read and hard to put down. I will be watching the career of this budding talent. I can't wait to see what she publishes next."},{"Title":"Internal Gold","review":"Once again, MaCherie Doerfler has gone out kidnaping unsuspecting readers, transporting us to far-off lands with little hope for escape.Internal Gold grabs the reader from the first paragraph (which, as far as I'm concerned, is worth the cover price all by itself) and steadfastly refuses to let go. The first few chapters are squarely in the \\"funny fantasy\\" sub-genre, being some of the funniest stuff (regardless of genre) I've read since before MaCherie was born. Then, seamlessly, the mood turns serious, with explicit - but never excessive - horrors, straightforward drama, heartfelt emotion, chair-gripping suspense, and even frequent returns to the humorous side of life as heroine Gleda Goldenchild has her adventures (and misadventures).The book suffers from only two significant weaknesses. First, once Gleda's adventures are under way in earnest we see little of the clumsiness that gives her the nickname of Walking Disaster (or, presently, Uh-oh Here She Comes). This is a relatively minor problem, though.More prominently, the ending is written in a rather unsatisfying manner. The event that brings the adventure to a close is well thought out and entirely logical, but where it could have been covered in two or three chapters of heart-pounding suspense MaCherie devotes only a little over two pages' worth of text to it at the start of the final chapter, with something of a deus ex machina feel to it. The one saving grace to it is that it's written with MaCherie's characteristically beautiful sense of poetry.That said, other than the ending (and a few typos, mostly concentrated in the center of the book, and nowhere near the level that plagued her equally-enjoyable first book, Tabitha: An Improper English Romance) the story is just short of something I'd expect to see receiving a Saturn Award.

This book, written by a professor of psychology and ethnic studies and a professor of sociology, is, predictably, a scholarly study. This is the first scientific, representative study of the American-born generation who lived through the experience. Time was running out, given the advancing age of the Nisei. So a random study was done in 1997 of 183 current residents of King County, Washington (Seattle) who had been what they call \\"incarcerated\\" in the camps. I found this a powerful term to express the injustice of what was done to the Japanese Americans without having to go through diatribes. It got the point across. They chose this location partly because research was already going on, and partly because of the high concentration of Japanese Americans there.The book follows a chronological order, first describing what prewar life was like, for various age groups, then the act of incarceration, what life was like in the camps, resettlement after the war, and present day life. Two formats are used, first, quotations from the open ended responses people made. These tend to be all too brief; I wanted more. The other is charts and statistics. I've taken statistics classes so am not intimidated by this, but it might feel like a bit much to someone who just wants to know what life was like. But the narrative tells you, and you can let your eyes pass right over the numbers and pay attention to the words.Among the interesting findings I'll just pick some. Even before the war, a generation gap was looming. The Issei, the immigrant generation, were terribly discriminated against, and thus clustered in \\"Japantowns.\\" They lived either by farming or in businesses that catered to their own community. Thus, they tended not to learn English. Their children, the Nisei, learned English and American ways in school. They became their parents' interface to the American world. This is probably a universal immigrant experience. But it became even more problematic in the camps, where the structure of life was controlled by the US Army and the parents had little or no control over their children, and the family structure so important to the Japanese started to collapse.Sixty years later, those who had been the youngest when they entered the camps had the least-negative memories, while those who had been young adults had the worst memories. Young adult women's memories were worse than men's. The book didn't talk about this, but I wondered if it wasn't related to the difficulty of raising young children with minimal resources.Women who were not married when they entered the camps married two years later, on average, than their age-mates in the population at large--at a time when women were marrying earlier than they had during the depression years. And they had fewer children, spaced farther apart, again at a time when the general birth rate rose.The Japanese American Issei generation had a low level of education, due to lack of opportunity, and they had high expectations for their children. Their children had high expectations for themselves. Almost half the young men and a quarter of the young women expected to go to college. And they actually exceeded those expectations, though many waited years to fulfill them. The same was true of occupational status. Issei fathers were very limited in the occupations available to them, but their children were ambitious. And as a group, they exceeded their ambitions.One of the most interesting chapters was on resettlement. It clearly surprised the authors that the incarcerees had so much difficulty reestablishing themselves after the war. Part of this was caused by the government's policy of encouraging them to \\"spread themselves thin\\" across the country to be less conspicuous and \\"more American.\\" Their strong community and church ties were thus destroyed and took years to rebuild in new ways. Before 1945, they were still not allowed to return to the Pacific coast, and some of these people who ended up in the Seattle area moved as many as eight or nine times before landing there. Discrimination made finding jobs very difficult, and many had lost all economic assets.If you are interested in knowing more on what happened to the Japanese Americans during and after World War II, I would highly recommend this book. If you need to ignore the statistics, do so, but get the gist of the overview of the story. Then look in the long bibliography, or do a Google search, and find one of the many good autobiographies written by someone who lived through it, for an up close and personal view of what it was like. You'll benefit from both vantage points."},{"Title":"Donde no hay doctor (Spanish Edition)","review":"We just returned from a Hurricane Mitch Medical Relief Team in Honduras.

It provides excellent hands-on exercises that help you to really understand in a functional way how electronics work. The mathematical explanations and exercises may be challenging to folks who haven't used their college calculus/algebra/trig skills in a while (me included) - though they will serve those seeking to understand the underlying fundamental calculations.With all those positives, why a 3 star rating? Well, the book assumes that you have ready access to a ~$1,000 oscilloscope and a ~$500 proto-typing bread board. On top of that, you need all of the bits and pieces to actually do the experiments - those are relatively cheap, but not always readily available (at a local store). All of the required equipment and supplies can be obtained on-line, but it will take a concerted effort, a chunk of cash, and some lead time to get all of this stuff. There are alternatives to the expensive oscilloscope and proto-board, but this path requires some assumed additional knowledge and may prove challenging as it deviates from the proscribed curriculum.My final thought on this book is that it is quite excellent in a classroom / lab setting, but is not very \\"practical\\" for the hobbyist."},{"Title":"Snappy Little Opposites (Snappy Pop-Ups)","review":"As with other Snappy pop-up books, the colorful pages of &quot;Snappy Little Opposites&quot; attract the attention of young children. The pop-ups cleverly incorporate the actions of the opposites (animals move up and down, open and close eyes, etc.). The book is appealing to my 4 month old, my 18 month old, and cousins ranging from 2-5 yrs. As an adult, I find it fun to read with the kids because their reactions are delightful."},{"Title":"Snappy Little Opposites (Snappy Pop-Ups)","review":"My son has 3 Snappy books, and we are eager to collect more. They are bright, colorful, and adorable. They are also some of the most sturdy pop-up books I've ever seen (after teaching preschool for years I am really impressed with the durability of these books). We bought our first Snappy book for my son when he was 9 months old, to try to interest him in books. He's now 2 and we read all three of his books at least once (usually twice nap & bed time)every single day. They are fun to read, even as often as we read them. They are also very educational. We do keep these books seperate from his others, so my son doesn't ruin them, but he's allowed to look at them on his own, as they are certainly sturdy enough, he just has to ask first! They are a fantastic buy. Although they seem a bit expensive for a child's book, they are worth every penny!"},{"Title":"Snappy Little Opposites (Snappy Pop-Ups)","review":"My son received the Snappy Litle books when he was 18 months and loved the pop-up parts.

The word content is free from esoteric and technical entries, but still relatively comprehensive. It is an essential reference for the beginner. The more advanced readers will also find it a convenient ready-reference tool as well, allowing the large bookshelf type dictionary to be reserved for occasional use. Although the dictionary is larger than pocket size, the ease of use and selected word content also makes this a very good selection for use as a travel dictionary.Word entries have a larger font size and are blue, while the dictionary text is black and a smaller font, and spacing between entries is generous. These features make it much easier and faster to find a particular entry. For the beginner, even the basic usage of a dictionary is not necessarily a trivial task when it comes to the Russian language! This dictionary can be used with confidence, because another unique feature is a set of exercises to ensure the reader is using the dictionary effectively and correctly.The only shortcoming of this dictionary is the absence of phonetic interpretations of Russian words. A brief pronunciation guide is included with the description of the Cyrillic alphabet, and the stressed syllable for each word is also indicated. Entire pronunciations for each word entry would be a valuable addition, however, because of the complex rules governing the pronunciation of Russian words.Overall, this is an excellent resource!"},{"Title":"The Oxford Starter Russian Dictionary (Oxford Starter Dictionaries)","review":"This is more than a dictionary. This book contains all of the answers to the common grammatical questions concerning usage, declension, aspect and conjugation for each Russian entry.

I highly recommend this dictionary for the first or second year student."},{"Title":"The Oxford Starter Russian Dictionary (Oxford Starter Dictionaries)","review":"This dictionary has helped me get through the first few semester of Elementary Russian. It's not the usual scaled-down version of a larger dictionary because the editors kept in mind to include useful phrases that any beginning student of Russian would need to look up, and when you look up a word, it just doesn't give a list of ten possible translations, but it makes sure that you pick the one closest to your intended meaning."},{"Title":"The Oxford Starter Russian Dictionary (Oxford Starter Dictionaries)","review":"I might recommend this dictionary to a British middle-school student who is just starting to learn Russian, with the caveat that the student will outgrow it within a few months. Students from any other English-speaking part of the world will be frustrated by the strong British focus. And adult users will simply find it a complete waste of time, as I did.The introduction says that one design goal of this dictionary was to have it \\"refreshingly uncluttered\\". This apparently means \\"lots of white space on the page\\", which, combined with the small number of pages, means they had to severely limit the amount of content and leave out all but the words and meanings that the Oxford editors thought were most important. So they left out words like \\"introduction\\", \\"lack\\" \\"era\\", \\"irony\\", \\"transparent\\", \\"purple\\" (as well as \\"violet\\" and \\"lavender\\"). But they included things like \\"shoe shop\\", \\"badminton\\", \\"Welsh woman\\" and \\"tea towel\\" as separate listings.For words with multiple meanings, we see additional problems. (No, \\"multiple\\" and \\"additional\\" aren't included in the dictionary.) For example, the English word \\"mum\\" is only translated as \\"mother\\". So a Russian user trying to translate the phrase \\"to keep mum\\" will be very confused. For the word \\"shade\\", they only include the meaning as in \\"in the shade\\", and leave out \\"shades of color\\" and \\"lamp shade\\".In designing this dictionary, they tried to improve on traditional dictionary format, which is a laudable goal. (No, \\"improve\\", \\"format\\" and \\"laudable\\" aren't included in the dictionary.) But I find I disagree with almost all of their design decisions. First off, the word being defined is not only boldfaced, it is also a rather bright blue, which my eye finds very distracting. (No, \\"distracting\\" is not included in the dictionary.) They also separate the word and each of its definitions onto separate lines, but I find this causes my eyes to work harder to find the information it needs.These observations come from trying to use this dictionary for one small project, and then perusing for a few minutes looking for a redeeming quality while I wrote this review. (No, \\"observation\\", \\"redeeming\\", and \\"review\\" aren't included in the dictionary, and \\"project\\" is only listed as a noun.) There are so many better Russian/English dictionaries out there, it's a shame to waste time and money with this one."},{"Title":"The Pawns of Null-A (Classic Ace D-187)","review":"Van Vogt's works are legend and Pawns of Null-A does not disappoint.

Gave it a quick look through and it seems to be just what I wanted. I don't want a book that says do this and that to your bike, I need something that give me the theory and lets me plan it myself. I have been building and restoring bikes for 5 years and basic performance is not a problem for me. I am building a CBR600 from the ground up this winter and need to know what to do and what not to do to keep it reliable, but add a good kick.This book seems to have lots of pics and drawings that explain how to tweak the entire bike to your needs.

Looking forward to reading the entire thing this weekend."},{"Title":"Sportbike Performance Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"KC covers every aspect of sportbike performance, why sportbikes are constructed the way they are, and how each component works. If you're mildly interested in how your own bike works (or any bike for that matter) this is a goldmine of information. If you are a rider for whom a bike is an extension of your body, you'll definitely want this. As usual, KC explains everything in plain English without getting too technical. The 10-page section on suspension tuning alone was worth the price of the book. Now that my own suspension is set up properly, I am getting more money's worth from my bike. I've also become a much smarter consumer when it comes to aftermarket mods."},{"Title":"Sportbike Performance Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"What Cameron does best is explaining \\"why?\\", as in \\"why is my bike designed the way it is?\\". If you want a service manual or a quick suspension setup (\\"3 klicks of preload, seven of rebound\\") guide for your make and model, look elsewhere.Cameron explains every facet of sportbike technology (engine, brakes, suspension, tyres, etc. etc.) by showing the general principles that dictate why it has evolved like it has, and how the same principles shaped the racetrack creations of past decades. If there would be an updated edition covering also the most recent developments (EFI mapping, radial brakes, etc.) I'd buy it, but even this edition covers completely 95% of the sportbikes out there, and 95% of this book applies to all sportbikes. Plus Cameron's writing has a delightful dry wit that never lets you forget that the ultimate key to fast lap times is not in tweaking and tuning and spending $$$, but that the biggest lap time improvements come from learning to ride better."},{"Title":"Sportbike Performance Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"Very good book...good explanation of all aspects of motorbikes...I really came to know good deal about carbs and suspension from this book...

While I would not recommend it for someone completely new to the field of motorcycling (unless they had a very mechanically-proficient background), it fills the gap between backyard wrench and engineering student beautifully. Cameron's writing style is concise yet descriptive; all subjects are treated with not only a thorough understanding and focus on the basic points, but Cameron's long experience in design, engineering, and as a race mechanic.

To be honest, I'm still only on the third chapter, but I'm telling you, anyone who loves motorcycles must read this book once. KC takes you by the hand and explains in painstaking, un-boring detail how every little bit inside works. He tells you how the engineers who built the thing reasoned the design of that particular bit, how the physical or chemical or both properties of the elements of that part interact.

The first time through, every paragraph was an epiphany - \\"So THAT's why four valve-per-cylinder engines rev higher!\\" or \\"No wonder those cheap exhaust systems sound so crappy pulling away from a stop!\\"This book:1) has lots of hard-to-find information2) is very substantial yet has a (non-cheesy, non-forced) casual style3) is engagingAsk a mechanic where (s)he learned about \\"mechanic-ing\\", and it will mostly be a combination of hands-on work and talking/working with other mechanics, plus some boring-but-sometimes-necessary reading of how-to type books, parts schematics, and shop manuals.This book won't help you gap your plugs or change a tire for the first time. And it focuses much more on design parameters than maintenance or repair issues. But it represents a huge stock of normally hard-to-come-by information which is relevant to all kinds of purchasing/repair/maintenance/riding decisions. This kind of information is normally locked up in the heads of all those mechanics and engineers out there, few of whom have a gift for accessible, human-to-human technical writing equal to their human-to-machine skills.Lots of things that I already \\"kind of knew\\" by experience, or had a hunch about, I now understand. Examples are the role of turbulence in flame propagation speed (and power, and how to maximize combustion turbulence/power), the path that oil takes to lubricate the main bearings (along with the problems with the traditional approach, and solutions that have been devised), and the true mechanism by which a piston ring seals against both the piston and the cylinder wall (a diagram shows it best).Many other topics with which I was already familiar, like the \\"pressure history of the intake stroke,\\" are presented in such a concise, intuitive, and effective way (with words and diagrams) that now I could actually explain them clearly to someone else.Also, much of the book is certainly relevant beyond motorcycles - especially the chapters on engines, brakes, carburetion, exhausts, valvetrains, and oils.If you've never looked inside an engine/brake caliper/suspension fork/etc, some passages may be hard to visualize, since not quite everything is depicted in diagrams. But the abundant diagrams that are present (around 1 per page, for about 180 - 8\\"x11\\" pages) are all exceptionally clear, and I think overall the book would be excellent for a novice to bike internals.Basically, this book does two remarkable things despite conveying lots of technical information that is hard to find elsewhere: 1) it remains casual and 2) it is interspersed with well-posed opinions that place the technical facts in an engaging context.Kevin Cameron has put in the thinking necessary to translate his accumulated arcane and hands-on knowledge into words and pictures that are easily understood, functional, and efficient. This is very seldom done by people possessing great hands-on knowledge, making this an extraordinary book."},{"Title":"Sportbike Performance Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I found this book a very interesting and informative read.

I was impressed with Cameron's depth of knowledge in regards to motorcycle physics and engineering--he is careful to explain how motorcycles work, and the physics behind performance-enhancing modifications, yet he does so in a fashion that any non-engineer or mechanic can understand. I highly recommend this book for all motorcycle owners contemplating any of the host of aftermarket upgrades for their bike, or for the beginning or experienced racer who wants to know how to obtain maximum engine performance.

This understanding of your bike's systems makes performance choices clearer and easier. Any mechanical modification or upgrade has its tradeoffs which Cameron make clear for every subject. But even without the need for &quot;superbike&quot; performance, understanding the inner workings of what you ride adds greatly to the experience.

Before reading this book I (like most other people) thought that motorcycle tuning was just a question of upgrading say airfilter, jetting and a louder pipe and of you go. What this book teaches is that the world is not that simple. A bike is a system of interrelated parts and you can't just change one of the parts and expect good results. Even if you do the tuning right there is still a price to be paid in performance. You want top end? Be prepared to sacrifice the lower end and the reliability. It's all about what you want from your bike.In the end the book changed my focus from engine tuning to suspension and brakes and I really love the result. The above-mentioned mods was what I originally intended and would have destroyed the trait of my bike that I love the most. A killer torque straight from the bottom and up."},{"Title":"Sportbike Performance Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"To give this book only five stars is an understatement; it deserves ten.

As difficult as it is to read (it made me feel kind of stupid!) I still feel that it was worth reading it. The book tells the story of the effect of apartheid on one black family in South Africa. Will, who is a young man, finds out that his father is having a relationship with a white woman. The father is a &quot;colored&quot; schoolteacher who has become a hero in the struggle against apartheid. Throughout the whole book you get to read about Will's feelings about his father and how horrified he is about him having another woman. Actually, I would say that the book has two plots: The first one deals with the political situation and everything around it, and the second tells about relationships between people and how difficult they can be. The book describes well the complexities of relationships- between the son, Will, and his father, Sonny; between Sonny and his wife Aila; between Sonny and his lover Hannah, between everyone and the political situation at hand. Why did I feel stupid when reading this book? Well, for starters, the writing is very complicated and often filled with metaphor. Plus, Gordimer looks back at things that happened several pages a go and so if you weren't really alert all the time you might be left out on some important and relevant points. Also, Gordimer's style of writing isn't very concise, it's actually rather disorganised which made me often quite confused. Apart from all this, I have to say that this is a very rich book which makes the struggle against apartheid in South Africa real and personal to the reader. And I know that I should have taken much more time to read this book since it's not the kind of book that you can just read in one day and then forget about it. I guess that's a good sign, I mean the fact that the book made me think. Think about the facts of life that aren't that pretty. Maybe, if I take the time to read this book again I might understand it better."},{"Title":"My Son's Story","review":"Gordimer's intricate tale of an educated black family struggling with the evils of apartheid is most noteworthy for its rich characterization. The story is told primarily by Will, the teenage son of anti-apartheid activist Sonny. Will acknowledges the horrors of the political situation around him but is painfully affected by the domestic consequences of social change (first his father's affair with white activist Hannah, and later his mother's imprisonment).The complexity of the writing is necessary for conveying the emotional weight of the story. The chapters alternate (roughly) between the first person narration of Will and a third person account of the unfolding situation. This allows the reader to experience the pain and ambivalence Will feels, while also making the reader aware of the secrets that the family members keep from each other.I disagree with the other reviewers that Gordimer's work is overly cerebral (if you want to see pretentious, dry, and overintellectualized, check out fellow African author J. M. Coetzee... yawn). My Son's Story is brilliantly realized in terms of both form and content. Without its complexity, the book would not be as believable, heartfelt, or utterly tragic... although I probably wouldn't have appreciated it in the ninth grade either."},{"Title":"My Son's Story","review":"Nadine Gordimer deserves her Nobel Prize, her books are wonderful and terrifying and frustrating and enlightening all at once.Gordimer's world is the world of the white anti apartheid activist (at the time of this book). She writes what she knows and it's an unusual and interesting perspective. My Son's Story is a political book no doubt but told from a very personal space, which is the mark of a great story. Thing is, Gordimer doesn't always write in the most accessible of ways, it is often difficult to get to the larger point she's trying to make, you know it's there but you have to work hard to get it and frankly, there were times when I wasn't sure I was seeing what she wanted me to see. Gordimer likes to use literary tools to make these macro points, lots of metaphor and at times, it's tiring to try and keep up, I did quite a bit of going back and re-reading. That said, I believe this to be a great book, it's worth the work I put in but frustrating as well.I encourage others to read Gordimer for her insights into a culture which is thankfully nearly dead by now. Just go into it knowing that this is not a casual beach read, but you know, a good book sometimes takes work."},{"Title":"My Son's Story","review":"The book describes well the complexities of relationships- between the son, Will, and his father, Sonny; between Sonny and his wife Aila; between Sonny and his lover Hannah, between everyone and the political situation at hand. However, the frequency of pronouns can be confusing and the long, impassioned dialogues never directly state anything at all. One must already be familiar with the apartheid and liberation movement to fully comprehend the book."},{"Title":"My Son's Story","review":"A brilliant book -- perhaps her best. As usual Gordimer is all about human relationships -- not just blacks vs. whites, but dark blacks vs. lighter skinned blacks; fathers with their sons and daughters and their wives and their mistresses; old,veteran revolutionaries relationships with young, new revoltionaries and on and on.Her syntax is always complicated, and sometimes frustrating, but well worth the effort."},{"Title":"My Son's Story","review":"_My Son's Story_ is told by Will, the son of a former schoolmaster, a light skinned, &quot;colored,&quot; anti-Apartheid activist in South Africa. Will and his family live in an uneasy peace amongst white Afrikaans. Will's father is known by his sobriquet, Sonny, by the blacks who admire him and depend upon his leadership against the virulent racism endemic in South Africa in those years. The family has to endure Sonny's intermittant jailings related to his political struggles as well as Sonny's love affair with a white woman, named Hannah, who also shares Sonny's anti-Apartheid commitment. Later on, Sonny's beloved daughter, called Baby by everyone, also becomes involved in the anti-Apartheid movement. The most sympathetic person in the book is Aila, Sonny's quiet, dignified wife and mother to Will, who seemingly inadvertently, but inevitably, surplants Sonny as the political activist in the family. Will's particular closeness to Aila and his resentments toward Sonny are the stuff of Greek tragedy.Unfortunately, Ms. Gordimer's overly convoluted and intellectualized style of writing caused me to often feel distanced from her characters. The result is a novel that frequently falls dead in its tracks. Fortunately, Ms. Gordimer does occasionally write forcefully. It is in these places that her message is communicated clearly and effectively."},{"Title":"My Son's Story","review":"Now that I'm finished with My Son's Story I feel that my older review of this book was mostly wrong. This is a very difficult book to read, the writing is very complicated chocked full of allusion, metaphor, allusion, simile, allusion, and, you guessed it, allusion! It is a wonderfully elegant, rich book which makes the struggle against apartheid in South Africa real and personal to the reader.What I love about this book is that the &quot;heroes&quot; of the movement are shown to be multi-dimensional, flawed, people, who are doing their best in their lives, as well as to further the interests of the liberation movement.My Son's Story is an inspiring, moving book.

I found everything very confusing, from the political aspect to the relationships throughout the novel. It made me feel horrifically dumb and I am planning on telling my english teacher that this year. It shouldn't be required for 9th grade students, 11th or 12th maybe but it was very difficult for myself and my classmates to read and understand.

I would really recomend this book and website to anyone above my age."},{"Title":"My Son's Story","review":"I really shouldn't be writing this review yet, I haven't finished the book, I'm about two-thirds through it, I'll write another one when I'm finished but I had to get my frustration out somehow!I love the plot, the deep multi-dimensional characters, and the moral message of this book. It illustrates life in South Africa under Apartheid in a very moving, meaningful, way. In fact, Gordimer's style of writing is quite elegant. However, Gordimer's writing philosophy seems to be: Why say something in a concise sentence or two when you can phrase it and rephrase it in several thousand sentences, showing off what a great writer I am, and what a great memory I have since I bring up points made of off the cuff discussions the characters had 150 pages ago, causing everyone confusion and endless time reading and re-reading the same sentence over and over again before they figure it out! I'm not the type who feels that everything must be clean and concise, but this book's style borders on anarchy of the English language, the confusion, the disorganization, the chaos of the way this book was written illustrates life under apartheid better than the plot, maybe, that was the point. Most author diagram a book to keep the plot online, Gordimer must obviously diagram each and every sentence in her book to keep the thought she tries to express in mind! She certainly can't have that good a memory! Every sentence in this book is a run-on. Each sentence expands like the Blob, taking up space for no particular reason, yet continually growing until you reach the end, which, you feel, must have happened more from a butcher's knife than the actual end of the story. Paragraphs, pages, even chapters are made up of one, maybe two, long run-on sentences, which you must then dicipher for yourself! Don't get me wrong, these ideas are worth deciphering, but who wants to read a book with pen and paper in hand so you can jot down what happened earlier in the sentence? I do! Nadine Gordimer is, in fact, a genius! I love her ideas and its well worth taking half a year of your life to try to read one of her books(if your fast), just remember, most people, if they truly want to understand the writing, will have to read it in five-minute increments, that's all you can take!My Son's Story is well-worth the time and effort it takes to read, it'll change your life and give you a realistic view of what life was like under apartheid. I know this has been a rather schizophrenic review, but hey, My Son's Story is a schizophrenic book! 5+ stars for content 1 star for clarity of thought and writing, overall 3 stars!"},{"Title":"My Son's Story","review":"My Son's Story, by Nadine Gordimer is a novel told by a young boy, who's name is Will. He is the son of Aila and Sonny, two colored South Africans. Sonny is against apartheid and Aila is too. Sonny is put in jail for expressing his views on segregation and apartheid in a school he works in as a teacher. While all this is going on, Sonny is having an affair with a white woman and Will knows about this. Throughout the novel, Will struggles with deciding whether to tell his mother about his father's affair.In my opinion, this is not one of my favorite books. Gordimer talked too much about Sonny having an affair, and too little about the more important things that were going on in South Africa, such as apartheid and segregation. It seemed as if the author was more interested in writing about an affair between a white woman and black man, rather than sharing her views on different racial situations occuring in South Africa. My Son's Story is a better book for someone who wants to read about a love relationship, more than an informing novel about historical things happening in South Africa."},{"Title":"The Two Of Us Mothers And Daughters","review":"I have got to say that this is one of the best books that I have ever received.

It's a great book and I would highly recommend it to those Mother and Daughter's who have a close, special relationship."},{"Title":"A conversation with Jeff Halper: Israeli activist joins rising chorus of those describing Israel as an \\"apartheid state.\\" Bishop Tutu and others are ... An article from: Catholic New Times","review":"This article begins by explaining that there was an international conference in Toronto in October, 2005 called \\"A Call for Morally Responsible Investment in Israel.\\" Well, I'm suspicious about all this. There is fighting in the Levant, but that's not Israel's fault. It's the fault of those who are attacking Israel. I think that putting pressure on Israel will not help solve the problem.That's not the point of view of Ted Schmidt, the author of this article, nor is it how Jeff Halper thinks. They feel that Israel is becoming an \\"apartheid state.\\" And Schmidt says that Desmond Tutu agrees. I think they have it backwards, and that Israel is looking more and more like a Bantustan.Halper is quoted as saying that \\"an anti-Semite used to be somebody who hates Jews; these days an anti-Semite is anybody whom Jews hate.\\" I'm suspicious of this as well. While it is true that all sorts of people are called all sorts of names, I think that some of the more merciless attackers of Israel and of Jewish rights in the Levant have probably earned a few of the names they've been called.Halper has little sympathy for the Jewish residents of Gaza who were removed from their homes. Um, why not? Had Arabs been removed from their homes, Halper's reaction would have been quite different! And Halper continues by saying that \\"we should not have been in Gaza in the first place.\\"We?Does Halper mean \\"we Zionists?\\" Or \\"we Jews?\\" Or \\"we Israelis?\\" Or \\"we humans?\\" Just who shouldn't be in Gaza? And why not? That region has been disputed territory, until Israel unilaterally withdrew from it. And the Israelis withdrew under fire, so as far as I'm concerned, the Arab rights to it are those of any thief. Had Israelis expelled the Arabs from Gaza, that would have been theft as well.Halper then complains that more Arabs have been dying than Jews in the latest violence. But that violence is simply Arab aggression against Jews. There are more Arabs than Jews in the world. If the Arabs want to play a deadly game in which they kill off less numerous enemies, perhaps one day some highly populated countries such as China or India may try their luck. More German non-Jews died than did German Jews in World War Two, but that certainly does not prove that Germany was right to kill its Jews.Israel has a reason for existing, namely to provide a refuge for Jews and to be a nation where Jews will be permitted to have human rights. Some Arabs claim that they ought to have the \\"right\\" to destroy Israel. Now, should these Arabs have an the same claim to Israel as do the Israelis? Not in my opinion. Halper and Schmidt appear to disagree.Halper complains that the Levantine Arabs will not have a viable state. Well, that just might be true. Even if they get all of Israel, they probably won't have a viable state. But so what? If the Levantine Arabs really want a state, they'll get one, even if it means taking some land from other states, including states not named \\"Israel.\\" After all, the Arabs have 5,500,000 square miles of land. That's quite a bit more than the less than 11,000 square miles of Israel, Gaza, the Golan, the West Bank, and Eastern Jerusalem! And if the Levantine Arabs don't want a state, why give them one?Schmidt says that Halper's conclusions are difficult to refute. He's wrong."},{"Title":"Essential Latin","review":"I am currently working on a Master's degree in Classics, and I have been studying Latin formally for over three years. Pedagogy is now my concern. I am interested in tools that will help others to learn Latin in an expedient and enjoyable manner. I now think that THE tool to use in helping students learn Latin is George Sharpley's &quot;Essential Latin.&quot;Sharpley's work contains a plethora of Latin texts from a diverse number of Latin writers. He has an answer key in the back of the book, and plenty of paradigms and pictures to assist the new student of Latin. The cultural sections are also invaluable, as is the pronunciation guide. In short, Sharpley's inductive approach is refreshing and effective. I strongly recommend this book as a pedagogical tool!"},{"Title":"Essential Latin","review":"In trying to please all comers (as per its introduction), it seems to become the proverbial &quot;jack of all trades and master of none&quot;. I do very much like this book, but many adults seem to favor a more analytic approach, so &quot;complete&quot; beginners will probably be confused by its &quot;'natural language'-esque&quot; pedagogy of introducing new material without sufficient in-depth commentary, if any at all, initially. This book is probably better as a review for second-year Latin students...I am a complete beginner, but luckily I am not relying totally on this one book (I find it best to consult a wide variety of sources: currently I am also using &quot;Latin via Ovid&quot;, &quot;Learn Latin&quot; [by Peter Jones], and, of course, Wheelock). I do very much like the fact that it has a complete answer key in the back, and a nice variety of exercises, if still too short for my tastes. It has a lot of mostly original Latin, with translations, to work with, and these original texts are arranged topically, almost always segueing seamlessly into each other: it's really interesting to read of the ancients' own views on their society and its wars and myths and very life. The bottom line is that I whole-heartedly recommend it, but just not as a sole source, or only for those with some prior knowledge of Latin."},{"Title":"Essential Latin","review":"I picked up this book to relearn the Latin I'd forgotten since high school.

It is followed by Earthrise.The Saurons destroy New York, Paris, Moscow, and other major cities in the first few minutes of the attack, killing over 3 billion people. With the destruction of Washington, and the Pentagon, political leadership devolves to the highest ranked remaining cabinet officer, Michael Olmsworthy, Secretary of the Air Force. He is in the TOC below McChord AFB and, when the aliens want to talk, he goes to meet them. Unfortunately, the Saurons are irritated by the insult, kill Olmsworthy, and chastise Alexander Ajani Franklin, governor of the state of Washington, for wasting perfectly good servants on a useless gesture. It seems the Saurons have castes, with the black-skinned Zin at the top, the brown-skinned Kan below them, and the white-skinned Fon at the bottom. Franklin is black and the others were not, hence the insult.The Saurons have a made a list of suitable candidates for leadership of their human slaves, of which Franklin is the leading survivor. After Franklin accepts, hoping to ameliorate slave conditions, he finds that the Saurons are using his simulated image to promote their program. The novel spends the first third of the book introducing the main characters: a UN security man Jack Manning, his sister Marta Manning, ex-ranger George Farley and his buddy Deacon Smith, the white supremacist Jonathan Ivory, the historian Boyer Blue, doctor Seekko Sool, ranger Velo Kell, the StarCom worshipper Sister Andromeda, and USN PO3 Darby Stokes.It also acquaints us with some of the Ra'Na, who have been slaves of the Saurons for two hundred years: Fra Pas Pol, Dro Tog, and P'ere Has. Fra Pol eavesdrops on the Zin and discovers that the Saurons are due to die on Earth. When he reports the conversation to Dro Tog, he is told that Tog will handle it. Nevertheless, Fra Pol autopsies a dead Fon and finds it is pregnant and the nymph is still alive. He spreads the word, even to the Fon, who are not aware of their impending demise.Meanwhile, the Free Taggers, kids with spray cans, start using their graffiti to teach the Fon to read and the Fon also begin to uncover details of the Zin plot. At this point, the reader starts to understand the significance of the chapter headings, i.e., Death Day Minus 155, within the book. A new sense of urgency begins to develop.This novel starts slow, but begins to build momentum in the middle. Franklin acquires a security detail, headed by Manning, Doctor Sool sets up a clinic, Sister Andromeda collaborates with the Saurons, Darby Stokes joins an attack of the Sauron shuttles, and the white supremacists attempt an assassination of Franklin. Thus ends the first volume in the series.While this novel was probably influenced by Independence Day, it is more of a rebuttal than an imitation of that plot; odds are that the invasion will have accomplished its major objectives before anyone on Earth realizes the destruction is coming from space. What are the chances that Washington wouldn't be a prime target and thus zapped in the first few minutes. Bye-bye Pentagon, White House, etc.This isn't Battlefield Earth either; in Hubbard's book, the hero overcomes his enemies single-handedly. Franklin definitely is not alone in his resistance to the Saurons; the humans, the Ra'Na, and even the Fon are required to repel the invaders. Stay tuned for the sequel."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"I confess that I love first contact and alien invasion stories. I thought I would enjoy this. I was wrong.Harry Turtledove seems to be the current master of alien invasion series. Had he written this novel, it would have been at least three times as long. I like brevity, but only if it furthers the story.When one sees paragraphs that read like &quot;He did this and had an adventure there and escaped danger another place,&quot; one assumes that this would be a short, succinct novel. Unfortunately, the author seems to have ellipsed sections because he did not either have the skill to present them or the number of pages that the contract required prohibited such development.What I thought would be a stand-alone novel turned out to be the first of an unknown number of sequels. Part 1 didn't involve me enough to buy parts 2 - nnn.The aliens - all the aliens - could have been replaced by humans. There is simply no difference in their actions in this novel. And, any of the human characters could have been replaced by any of the others. Cardboard is cardboard, and that's what all the characters, human or alien, are here.And much of the novel was not internally consistent. I'm not going to waste your time by enumerating the problems. I'll just say that they make this a waste of your time and dollars.If you read this review and disagree, please post a rebuttal. Fiction is, in the end, in the eye of the beholder. On the other hand, if you feel the author has cheated you our of your time and money, please enter that comment, too.Science Fiction is difficult to write, and all to often I think we affectionados get trapped into accepting the mediocre, when we should be demanding the best.Deathday is certainly not one of the worst novels, but it is not one of the best. It is low-mediocre at best, and not deserving of your time.Rick"},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"This book is deeply disrespectful of SF readers. Even if you can overlook the clumsy moralizing, the clich&eacute;d characters, the myopic focus on a single region of the earth and the thoroughly human aliens, the book only tells half of a story. The book simply ends halfway through the story (practically in mid-sentence: if your plot invoves a countdown and the countdown is only half finished at the end of the book, then it's only half of a book) and you have to resort to the sequel to find out what happens to most of the characters. There is no indication on the book anywhere that it is only half of a story.So, it wasn't enough for Dietz and Ace to disrespect us with a lousy piece of work. They had to go that one further and only give us HALF of a lousy piece of work. Note: I'm not against books with sequels or even books that are part of a series. I just feel tricked when a book is part of a series and I didn't know it going in. To find out that I HAVE to buy the sequel to finish the story is more than disappointing, it's dishonest. I was tricked into buying half of a story.An author who will trick me once will trick me twice, so I'm not planning to buy any more of Mr Dietz's work at all.I bought this book in a bookstore where there were no reviews to look at when making my choice.

This book isn't quite as bad, but that's the only good thing I can say about DEATHDAY. I, for one, am not even going to contemplate buying the sequel. This book has no literary soul, and no resolution of any kind either. What's worse, it lacks any of the qualities I would expect in a Dietz book. His novels had been going uphill since Legion of the Damned, with strong characterizations and intricate portraits of fascinating universes. This book lacks effective character development, and there is NO fascinating universe, just Earth on fire. There are too many good books out there to waste time on this product--using the word literature implies too much that just doesn't apply here."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"Don't buy this book. Don't even think about it. The plot is a direct imitation of Independence Day, War of the Worlds, and any number of other SF titles that were MUCH better done. The book itself is the first in a series. It is not a \\"stand-alone\\" read. If you care to find out what happens, you won't, but if, you must buy at least the next book in the series.We are asked to believe that the Sauron race descends upon Earth, laying waste to everything they see. They conquer all, with no reply from an emasculated military. But wait, while the military can't seem to make the weapons be effective, by God, some good old boys from the back country can get those aliens. But not enough to matter. By the end of the book I was hoping for some kind of finale. It wasn't there. In fact, the book endpapers tell you to look for the next book in the series, \\"Earthrise\\".I'm here to tell you, don't bother. I don't mind series books, in fact Harry Turtledove has turned them into a cottage industry. But Mr. Turtledove's books can be read as a series or individually. You will pick up immediately what is happening. Mr. Dietz however seems to think that he can put some garbage together, publish the book and we will \\"need\\" to see how it comes out.Again, don't bother. I won't go into what is supposed to be a morality tale about race relations, because to be honest, Mr. Dietz doesn't do it very well.It could've been worse.

The author manages to pound the issue into nearly every page regadless of wether it would fit the plot.Those that noted that the aliens seem to share human motivations and actions are in my opinion, correct.I had to give up on this book after about 50 pages. Like others who have reviewed it, I love sci-fi, I thought I was getting a good action packed aliens-vs-human thriller. What I got was a heavy handed morality play that could have been better by a third grader.When I found out from reviews that author actually decided to write this as a first in a \\"series\\" I gave up. I rarley put down a book unfinshed. It bothers me to do so and I probably would have finished this mindnumming tale if it had been a stand alone novel.I cannot recommend anyone read this."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"I am a Sci-fi fanatic, having more than 600 books in my library.I especially enjoy alien invasions/end of world type themes. The entire attack took a few pages (and even this is boring) and we learn that the REAL problem for the few humans left is NOT space invaders but racists whites in America.The three types of aliens - confusing in the extreme - are so utterly unalien as to be laughable. They think and reason the same as humans. The humans were pure cardboard - white racists worshiping Hitler (in 2020!), the unwilling hero, brave women, bad politicians. The repeated references to S Africa, Native Americans, American slavery, Palestinians, MLK were a simplistic recourse to push-button topics and were more clumsily written that my 8th grader could do. Geopolitical aspects are absent. It appears the entire experience occurs on the US West Coast.The action is rushed, plotlines unresolved, internal logic lacking...it is hard to describe how really bad this tale is. The absolute worst part is the sheer ludicrousness of the story -that the remaining humans are worried about skin shade when billions have perished and the rest are enslaved. As I said, just ludicrous. And when you get to the end it is not the end- you have to buy another book to find out how it all ends.Thanks but no thanks."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"I just didn't like this book. I think that the racial overtones were over played. I've always thought that the human race would unite against a common enemy, especially a human killing ET. Dietz did do a good job with the action sequences, but there were not enough of them. The book waffled between an action book and a political book and did a poor job at both.Pro- good action sequences, different plot and take on humanityCon- too many alien names, personally, I just didn't like the plot. Story seemed very sterile with really no emotion.It's a short book if you want to read, but i would take a pass on it."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"I am not sure whether I should feel angry, depressed, or foolish after reading this book. Angry because I am tired of constantly being assaulted by authors who inflate their since of self rightousness by casting whites as the font for all racial evils in the world. When the Earth is invaded leave it the whites to keep racial hatred alive while everybody else has the character to rise above it. As for being depressed, that is simply because I was hoping for an enjoyable story which was nowhere to be found. Cookie cutter characters (none of which I cared about) coasting through improbable and rushed plot lines aren't good combinations. Finally, as you can probably guess, my foolishness came from ever having bought this book in the first place."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"The cover art for this latest sci-fi \\"masterpiece\\" by bestselling author William Dietz takes the cake for the goofiest effin cover art of any sci-fi novel that I have yet to see in all my years...DOESN'T ANYONE NOTICE THAT HALF THE SPACESHIP IS THE SPACE NEEDLE ATTACHED TO WHAT LOOKS TO BE SOMETHING RIPPED OFF OF STAR TREK!Google image 'space needle from the underside'.....and you'll get it.The space needle destroying seattle.....wow, just wow."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"This book is a pitiful excuse for an alien invasion story that hinges heavily on race; that of the humans and the aliens, who are just as stratified,race minded and backwards as 1875 America(reconstruction era).I only have one thing to say: Mr. Dietz lacks any and all knowledge of race issues in America, unless he is dealing with white racist--which was shallow at best. I found the lack of African-American conflict in: 1) becoming slaves (again!!) and 2) becoming overseers, as a profound white-washing (at best) or an intentional oversight (like a lazy student with a forced term paper) into the true effects of slavery on a culture...AND a country.I recommend using this book to hold up the end of a wobbly table because nothing else--the plot, characters, or the pitiful attempt to deal with the race issue--can stand up under the conscious eye of the reader."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"Unfortunately I bought this book before I thoroughly read the reviews. Don't get me wrong I love sci-fi and invasion stories, but I don't like his writing style. There was not enough science, although he sure likes to describe guns. The racial component of the storyline seemed unnecessary and distracting. The characters are undeveloped and much of the plot is predictable. This book ends in a cliffhanger, and I was still tempted to buy Earthrise just so I get the satisfaction of finishing the story. I've decided against it. I'll probably skip this author in the future."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"Great book! Reads faster than most books its size. I would highly recommend anyone teaching a class about race relations or racism consider this for one of their reading assignments. Younger students will enjoy the action but opens great discussions about race, reversed racism, caste systems, and slavery. Only $6-8 new, college students will appreciate that!"},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. How much did we see of the aliens in Independence Day and War of the Worlds? Almost half this book deals with the Saurons which is the best part as far as I am concerned. Looking forward to Earthrise. For those who think this is the worse book in the world, you should get out and read some more."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"It would be all together too easy to dismiss this novel, first in a series, as yet another typical Aliens attack invasion story. And, on one level, that is in fact all this entire novel is about. Aliens, in this case known as the Saurons, have arrived in the year 2020 and using their technologically advanced weaponry, have laid waste to the planet. In the three days since their sudden arrival on what is forever known as \\"Black Friday,\\" the Saurons have destroyed nearly every single manmade structure on the planet. Major cities and small villages are nothing more than smoking rubble, billions have died, and the rest of humanity has been enslaved except for a few pockets here and there. Ironically, the Saurons have now designated our world as \\"Haven.\\"While working on the typical alien invasion, everyone dies, but don't forget the inevitable resistance movement scheming to take back the planet (where is Arnold when you really need him?) level, there is an intriguing deeper level to this novel. The Saurons Empire is made up of subjugated races and there is simmering internal racial strife. \\"Yes, there was little doubt that the great architect understood the nature of his creations, wisely setting Zin over Kan, Kan over Fon, and the Saurons over all the other species.\\" Not only are there strong distinctions between the groups, such as the Kan who are the fighters but seem to have little independent reasoning ability on their own, there are also distinctions between individual members of the same group. In the Sauron culture, the darker one's appearance is becomes the determining factor of importance and as such, regulate the Fon as being the lowest of the low.While the Saurons have the same internal political infighting issues and racial problems that have plagued Mankind for centuries, they also seem to have the inability to see beyond their own biases. In so doing, they place dark skinned persons in power as overseerers in various roles over what is left of humanity. Not only does this encourage white separatist groups to armed organized resistance, it causes factions to develop in the Saurons Empire. Soon, radical elements in the alien and the human communities join forces, united in their opposition.While dealing with the touchy theme of racism, Mr. Dietz also throws in elements in regards to a religious theme. The Saurons are a nomadic empire, going from planet to planet on a quest as outlined in their \\"Book of Life.\\" Following their religious theory, they have come here to build what appear to be temples before moving on to the next planet. But, for reasons initially known only to themselves, the temples have to be constructed using a rigid set of protocols in a specified time frame and time is running out.At 355 pages, this is a very enjoyable read working on different levels and themes. Primarily an action-oriented novel with some limited character development, Mr. Dietz keeps the preaching down to the barest minimum. Readers need to be aware that beyond its twist ending, this novel is a setup novel for the next in the series. As such, the ending is very open and this novel leaves quite a number of story threads hanging. The next novel according to this work is titled EarthRise and was scheduled to be released in the fall of 2002."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"I loved Deathday and the rest of the series. The characters were very well developed. I have read hundreds of Scifi novels and I hope you are not put off by all of the negative reviews! The series is a terrific read!"},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"While searching for a new author, I happend to read the first few pages of this book and it sounded interesting. Dietz starts out with a bang, but it degenerates quickly.The racist characters were so vile and repulsive, but there was no depth to them execpt that they were racist. Evntually, they became little more than an annoyance and contributed little to the story. It is like Dietz tried to include a &quot;racewar,&quot; but since he never pulls it off, the few threads that are left are tattered and tired.The most disappointing thing about the book (and the reason why it gets only one star) is that it is a total cliffhanger--but it doesn't even end on a point of tension. Another problems is that he sets up a three-way love triangle, then kills off the lynchpin before anything happens. Why bother?I will not buy the conclusion; if I run out of stuff to read and get really bored, then I'll rent the next one from the library. I may even have to read the end first to make sure it is not another sorry excuse to sell a THIRD book. Honestly, if Dietz can't finish a simple invasion story in two books, then I will avoid anything else he has or will write. As it is, he's left a pretty sour taste in my mouth with this tripe."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"I forced myself through the first &quot;chapter&quot;, and those were the most painful 46 pages I've read in ages. I enjoy good science fiction, but this book isn't good anything. The technique of introducing multiple characters in differing situations whose paths through the plot will intertwine is poorly executed. The characters were flat, uninteresting, unengaging. The entire first section was rushed and boring, as if even the author didn't really care and just wanted to get the framework in place as quickly as possible. Mr. Dietz needs to read &quot;Footfall&quot; again, to see how this unoriginal approach to alien invasions can be written as an interesting novel."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"Deathday takes place in 2020 where a racist alien race called Saurons come to Earth and destroy about 3 billion people in about 12 hours and enslave the remainder of the human race. Saurons are insect like creatures that have created a caste system based on the color of their chitin. The three groups consist of the Zin, which are the ruling caste with black chitin, the Fon, which are the middle class that oversee the tasks of slaves and have white chitin, and the Kan, which are the warriors of the race and have a chitin that changes colors according to their surroundings. Their leader, a Zin named Hak-Bin, decided to develop a sort of puppet \\"government\\" for the slave population to believe that they had at least some hope to hold onto. The Saurons selected a governor, Governor Alexander Franklin, to be their puppet president. They then forced the slaves to build an enormous citadel in preparation of Deathday. Like most insects on Earth the Saurons produce asexually but when they reproduce the original parent dies and only one nymph comes out of the creature. In other words, on Deathday the entire Sauron race will die and a new group of them will be born and kill all of the humans. The Saurons kept this a secret from the slaves but it was discovered by another race the Saurons had enslaved, the Ra-Na race. The Ra-Na then told Franklin of the plot. Franklin decided to stop being a puppet, escaped the Saurons, and joined the resistance movements into one organized movement. The only problem is that the resistance has just found that there is a second citadel that if not found and destroyed would allow the aliens to produce up to three new nymphs each. Enough to repopulate the race even if they manage to destroy the first citadel the enemy will still grow. Now the clock is ticking and the humans are losing valuable time. Can the humans find the citadel and if they do will they be able to destroy the Saurons for good?I thought that this book was excellent. It showed great details throughout the story. I have read many sci-fi books in the past and this is by far the best I have read. The detail in which the author describes the different characters and their personalities is unbelievable and the way that he captures the strength of the human race and it's will to survive even against unimaginable odds is nothing short of astounding. None of the other stories have even come close to this one in terms of detail. The story line was unique all in it's self. The idea of such creatures and their attitude and culture is remarkable. I would recommend this story to all who enjoy a good science fiction novel with plenty of twists. Though probably unsuitable for some small children, I believe that most everyone will have a blast with this story."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"I was looking for a word to describe this book and nothing other than \\"horrible\\" or synonyms came to my mind.I borrowed this book from someone at work because the little synopsis made it sound interesting, I should have reminded myself to never judge a book from its cover. To make it short, this book is boring, I usually read a book in a couple of days but this time it took me a month just to get done with the first chapter. This book is so full of cliche' that will bore you to death before you even try to understand what's going on. The characters are just so flat, they lack any kind of personaly, and every single military member acts exactly as you would expect them to in a B series movie.I never gave such a negative review to a book, but if you have some spare dollars you can find thousands of great books here on Amazon, starting with Stephen Baxter. Stay away from this one!"},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"From the first sentence, Mr. Dietz books draw the reader into another world which is not so dissimilar to our own. All of the characters have character. Even minor bio bod characters, cyborgs and even computers, become my friends. These characters (both male and female and human and alien) are amazing role models or great villains but never caricatures. Every politician and voter should read the series, Earth Rise and Death Day, to see what it really means to be an American we might have to face aliens!"},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"Deathday by Eugene Bruce would be better?

You may not be able to judge a society by the technology it uses, if that technology is stolen.It is a fast read and to get the end you have to buy the next bookwhich is always a bummer."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"I loved this story. I thought the people had some depth and it was nice to see minorities written as people not as &quot;black people&quot; or &quot;Hispanic people&quot;. It boils down to color is an issue if you allow it and that we aren't the only ones with race issues. I hate so many people panned it. I loved it so much I gave it to a friend to read."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"This was a good sci fic story. His build up leads everyone to believe some great multi-character scandal that will leads to some great multi-scandal ending. He fails horribly! And I mean HORRIBLY! This guy couldn't see a proper ending if it fell on him and kissed his .... Either he got too lazy to write or he didn't stick to his creative guns to make it right. Both consequences, are consequences to himself and his readership. I will not buy one of his books again!!! He has no finishing power.Bob Manni"},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"Alien invasion stories have been done to death since H.G. Wells gave us The War Of The Worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre. Well, William C. Dietz pulls it off with Death Day and the concluding volume Earth Rise. What sets Death Day apart from most of the invasion tradition is, first of all, the invading force being made up of different races. This makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles, in-fighting and fight for freedom (some are slaves to others) make for something new, different and engaging. Also, using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true, and tragic, note. The surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves, close off their borders and horde resources. The aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on Earth. And, sadly, collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans. But the seeds of rebellion have been planted. Humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races. All this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach. I enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. Dietz is the best SF writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"I see a lot of people really didn't like for this book and I don't understand why. It is a little slow in parts but interesting nonetheless. I thought that the aliens were intriguing and the characters are very developed. The story moves at a decent pace for the most part.One only real problem I have with this book is that it doesn't really describe the aliens technology a whole lot. Maybe it is in the sequel. I recommend this book. I think it is a pretty good Alien Invasion story and I look forward to reading Earthrise."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"Interesting enough that I did finish reading it, but confusing (or perhaps just more tiring) trying to keep track of the different species of insect aliens and their &quot;hierarchy&quot;. If it had been a &quot;complete&quot; story, I would have walked away with a review of fair, but it was especially disappointing to get to the end and find out it is the first of a series (which I won't be continuing). 2 stars may be a little generous, but I have to reserve 1 star for those I won't even finish. I'm going to make an effort to read these reviews before buying from now on."},{"Title":"Death Day","review":"In 2020 in what seemed like a blink of an eye, New York City, Moscow, and Beijing were easily destroyed. Not much more than a weekend past and the invaders conquered the earth. More than three billion humans died starting on what became known as Black Friday as the alien Sauron race, using superior weaponry, easily win the war. Any human who survived the weekend of terror has a struggle ahead as slaves of the mighty Sauren race.UN Security Officer Jack Manning ends his vacation once he learns that the nations of the world lost to the brutally efficient Saurons. The leadership Zin faction of the conquerors have no mercy immediately directing their Kon soldiers to kill any opposition no matter how slight. In that environment, a captured Jack labors in the mines of his enemy before being reassigned to a massive temple building construction project. He patiently waits to escape, but the opportunity never seems to surface.DEATHDAY, the first tale of William Deitz's alien invasion series, is an exciting non-stop action thriller though most of the book occurs after the Saurons win. The fast-paced story line is exciting and the insight into the Sauron caste system is cleverly intermingled into the plot so readers begin to understand the conquerors. This is what makes this a must read for sub-genre fans. William C Dietz provides more than just an opening gamut of a military science fiction thriller along the lines of V. He provides a deep social and psychological study of humanity and the Saurons that make the invasion seem devastatingly real and leave breathless readers waiting for EARTHRISE.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Radical renewal: The problem of wineskins today","review":"I read the first edition of this book when it came out in 1975. I got it by accident--the card I returned to my book club evidently went astray in the mail. When I got this book, not having ordered it, I was intrigued enough that I opened it, being careful not to crack the spine as I intended to return it. I ended up reading the whole book that way. Then I couldn't bring myself to return it. I was hooked.I think this book more than any other (except the Bible) has shaped my understanding of the church--and as a church consultant and a writer/editor specializing in church renewal I have read hundreds of books on the church.It was this book (chapter 3) that first told me that my deep inner longing to minister among the poor was not just some sort of personal idiosyncrasy (or highly individualized call), but an expression of an essential dimension of the biblical gospel.It was this book that showed me for the first time that biblically the primary structure of the church is not to be the large group (congregation) but the small group (house church or cell). It was this book that gave me the vision for church as community more than institution, a vision that has guided my life and ministry for 24 years now.It was this book that began my questioning of the traditional clergy and began to point me to a more biblical model of congregational leadership.If you would rather continue to do church the way you've always done it rather than rediscovering the New Testament principles for doing church, don't read this book; it will scare you. But if you are among those who are looking to find new life for the church today, this is a great starting point--or source of continuing encouragement--for your search."},{"Title":"Radical renewal: The problem of wineskins today","review":"In Radical Renewal Howard Snyder endeavors to examine the church from a biblical viewpoint within the context of modern culture. Based on Luke 5:37-39, Snyder sees the wine as the message of the gospel, which is essential and primary. He sees the wine skins as the way in which the church touches the culture with the gospel, which is secondary though necessary and useful. The problem comes when we take the ever-new gospel and try to contain it within the old wineskins of \\"outmoded traditions, obsolete philosophies, creaking institutions, and old habits.\\" When we do, the powerful and life-changing gospel is constricted and must burst free. Snyder believes it is time for the church to update her wineskins. To remedy the problem, Dr. Snyder recommends a cataclysm that explodes the current church structures and creates new wineskins.Some of the concepts investigated by \\"Radical Renewal\\" include the significance of ministry to the poor, the de-emphasizing of church buildings, the dynamic of Christian community, a Biblical church model, and small groups as the church's basic unit. His chapter devoted to \\"The Gospel to the Poor\\" was my favorite and was the most compelling portion of the book. Some of his concepts are presented in a radical and even an absurd way and then they are brought back to a practical and applicable balance. Other \\"radical\\" concepts (such as the acknowledging and releasing of spiritual gifts) have become accepted practice in many churches since the original release of the work. The year of its release, \\"Radical Renewal\\" would have been ahead of its time. It still contains insights and concepts that are of significant value to today's church."},{"Title":"Radical renewal: The problem of wineskins today","review":"Snyder distinguishes between the &quot;wine&quot; of the gospel and the &quot;wineskins&quot; (church structures devised by humans for a particular time and place), as well as between the church, the people of God, and the organizations and structures it uses. He suggests that the institutional church has let structures become hindrances rather than aids to the Gospel, and that Christians need to gather in both small and large groups. This will result, he says, in more personal, less institutional interaction, as well as a more Spirit-led, first century-quality dynamic corporate life. He tackles the do-everything role of the pastor, the wastefulness and rigidity of the church building, the importance of preaching the gospel to the poor, and the role of spiritual gifts in creating an organic, Body-of-Christ type of church. This book is a revision of Snyder's 1975 &quot;The Problem of Wineskins,&quot; from which a bit of technophobic, doomsday, 70's dystopian paranoia is preserved in the last chapter. Even so, this book does a great job of outlining the way the church should biblically seek to function. I highly recommend it if you are suspicious of non-traditional means of church organization and operation, or, on the other hand, if you are looking for something outside the imposing brick walls of traditional church structure."},{"Title":"Radical renewal: The problem of wineskins today","review":"This is an excellent book, and a real ground-breaker when it was first released as \\"The Problem with Wineskins.\\" What's got me so puzzled is why it's $26 bucks!

BTW, the used copies sold by others here are probably not the 2nd edition, but the first edition published by TOUCH Publications in Houston, Texas (out of print and no longer available).

However, her father's death means that, as his heir, she has become a lynchpin in a power struggle in the turbulent years of King John's reign. Sir Rylan Kempe, who is opposed to the King, kidnaps Joanna from the convent with a view to marrying her to one of his allies. Although she is drawn to Sir Rylan, Joanna fights him every step of the way and they are eventually waylaid by the King's men, They take Joanna to London where she becomes the King's ward. How Ryland wins Joanna and triumphs over King John then forms the backbone of this story. Interweaved in this is also a rather sweet secondary romance.When writing of medieval England it is very difficult to ignore the politics of the time, and therefore this book is much concerned with internal power struggles and the church. That said, the dynamics between Joanna and Rylan are well-drawn out and I commend Ms. Becnel for keeping mostly within the conventions of the era. Joanna is nave, young- though at a time when girls were married at 12, not that young at 17 - and at times irritating. Rylan is mature, arrogant and politically very adept. When these two come together it is always explosive. The only negatives I could find is that Joanna seemed to be far too free to come and go in the convent.That said, Ms Becnel clearly knows England, and has a good grasp of medieval customs and politics, as well as being able to write a well-crafted love story. However, be warned, this is not a romance with a gloss of history. Instead the history and the romance intertwine, which for me produces a very satisfying and enjoyable combination."},{"Title":"A Dove at Midnight","review":"There are some very well played out love scenes and seductions in this book, but the story is a little thin.

The heroine, Joanna, throws it in a few times for good measure, too (odd language for a nun-wantabe)Also, I found Joanna's continual insistence that she just wanted to go back to St. Theresa's really irritating. She's like a freakin' broken record. Even after she's pretty sure she's in love with Rylan, and has shared some steamy scenes with him, she remembers that she hates him and still wants to be a nun. Not only did this get old really quick, it was so absolutely unrealistic for the medieval period.

Unfortunately he has failed an a pair of scouts, a father and son, have infiltrated the Spaceport with the goal of learning more about humanity with an eye to determining our strengths and weaknesses.

This rubs Commander Lane the wrong way and puts him at odds both with his wife and daughter and ultimately the outfits.For a futurist Van Vogt missed trends such as women joining the workplace and teen rebellion and created a world that owed more to the 50s than the 70s and he is definitely uncomfortable and uptight when writing about sex and relationships between men and women. Lane is coldly manipulative towards his family and an unsympathetic lead character. Nor does he seem to understand teenage children.Useful if you are intent on reading everything that Van Vogt has written."},{"Title":"A History of Fortification from 3000 B.C.

It very much exists in its beautiful, lonely world. It was a time and place in which human interaction could be few and far between and people (the titular Virginian most of all) did not waste words. But that only makes dialogue all the more satisfying. The debates on literature between the Virginian and Molly are a great treat. In particular they emphasize just how wide a cultural gap exists between the roughhewn cow-puncher from a farming family in southern Appalachia and the refined schoolmarm from a good family in New England. It is just unfortunate that I am not literate enough to fully appreciate all of the allusions.The chapter just before the hanging is one of the best in the book. It wonderfully captures the loneliness of the high plains, the tension of the situation, and the decidedly odd nature of the hanging. The entire final third of the book is about as pitch perfect as a novel gets.The Virginian is without a doubt a product of the 19th Century. The characters often partake in the annoying habit of labeling positive qualities as masculine and negative qualities as feminine. The subtlety regarding matters touching on sex or violence can approach incomprehensibility, even to a careful reader. But it can also be refreshing to the reader used to modern novels (Lord knows subtlety is in short supply these days). The male characters are not bound by our odd, contemporary inability to express beauty and thus avoid the stilted language of today. Themes of gender interaction and good and evil can be dealt with unapologetically. Wister is not shy about the (smoothly integrated) insertion of philosophical musing, either.One more quick, minor gripe: Wister adopts the annoying, all-too-common practice of heavily overusing apostrophes when writing an Appalachian dialect (that of the titular Virginian). The Virginian's diction and enunciation is also at odds with that which I am familiar with as a native of western North Carolina and resident of southwestern Virginia.I read the Kindle version of The Virginian offered free through Amazon. There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion. It only includes the foreword from the author and no afterword. I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968. It omits the foreword, but contains numerous added illustrations and helpful definitions and explanations throughout the text (directly next to the relevant text in the margin so they do not affect readability like a footnote or endnote would). It also contains a \\"backword\\" with helpful information about Wister and the (surprisingly brief) romantic era of the cattle business."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"The western genre isn't one that I'm very familiar with, having read (in my impressionable early teens) some of my uncle's Tabor Evans Longarm series paperbacks. And let me just say for the record that the only thing the main character Longarm wasn't riding was a horse....Consequently, my only reading forays into western literature haven't been along the lines of Zane Grey's: \\"Riders of the Purple Sage\\" so much as Evans' \\"Rider of the Purple-Nippled Wench\\" (my title, not his). As a result, I've been leary in the last 30+ years of picking up another saga of the 'ole west for fear it would be just another excuse for a horny lawman to bed as many busty saloon girls, indian squaws, and lusty train conductor's wives as possible within 200 pages.So when I read a review of \\"The Virginian\\" from a friend, it whetted my interest to give westerns another try, and I'm glad I did.Reading \\"The Virginian\\" reminded me very much of reading Mary Stewart's: \\"Thornyhold\\" - not in content, storyline or even writing style but in the fact that both writers invited their readers to immerse themselves in celebrating a time now vanished, but fondly remembered and richly recreated on the printed page. \\"The Virginian\\" isn't so much about a larger-then-life cowboy/hero as it is a love story about a place and time now enshrined in the American psyche: the wild west.Wister's 110 year old prose was, in the beginning, often difficult for me to decipher and it was hard for me to get through the first 70 pages. However, after I found Wister's cadence, the story took off, and transported me to 1880's Wyoming, and the story of the unnamed Virginian, his rough and ready philosophy of life, and his on-going courtship of the gently-bred, eastern school marm, Molly Stark Wood. Wister presents the Virginian as the archetypal western ideal, and what an ideal this man is. By the book's end, I was more then a little in love with the Virginian myself :DPresented as a series of vignettes, the stories of the Virginian and his exploits are classic western fare, complete with cattle rustlers, poker games, lynchings and the all-important high-noon gunfight. Interspersed between these darker events are chapters of levity, including an over-nurturing hen named Em'ly, a tall-tale to end all tall-tales featuring the booming frog (\\"frawg\\") leg industry and a case of mass baby swapping during a local barn dance.This is a richly described and lovingly rendered story of the American west, and is considered the godfather of the western novel. It also comes highly recommended by one who was hesitant about sampling another western ever again."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"The reader who remembers the 20th Century US infatuation with the Western is likely to enjoy \\"The Virginian\\" with a growing sense that he or she has seen all this before. And that might be true. Owen Wister's 1902 classic cowboy romance managed to combine, in an meandering but sometimes dramatic and always engaging fashion, most of the themes since played out in more recent Western movies and television shows.This story takes place in the rough and ready Wyoming territory of the 1880's, when cattle ranching was just opening up essentially wild country. Towns were primitive, medicine and the law might be a day's ride away, and the ragged edge of civilization depended on the code of the cowboy, which held that the first virtue was courage and the second honor. Much of the story is told by an Eastern visitor, \\"the tenderfoot\\", through whose eyes the unfamiliar country and its customs are explained.At the center of the story is \\"the Virginian\\", a self-made young man of rugged skills, a sense of humor, and a strict code of honor. It is through him that the two narrative threads of the novel play out. One is his long and patient courtship of the eastern school-marm Molly Stark and the other is his thrilling and deadly rivalry with the thief and murderer Trampas.\\"The Virginian\\" is a wonderfully well written and entertaining novel, full of a sense of a time and a place now long gone. Robert Schulman's excellent introductory essay puts some context on where Wister's mythic West departs from a stricter reading of history or a modern sense of political correctness."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"The Virginian, written in 1902 and never out of print was voted in 1977 as the Greatest Western Novel of all time, by the Western American Writers Association.Probably the most famous line ever uttered in a Western book or movie, \\"When you call me that--smile.\\" comes from the lips of the man known as the Virginian in his eponymous novel.Black haired, long limbed, young and bold, the Virginian represents the epitome of a uniquely American prototype, the hard riding, slow spoken, rough and ready cowboy. The code of the West that states you never shoot an unarmed man, never steal a man's horse or rustle his cattle, never back down from a fair fight, never turn down a drink, and never speak disrespectfully to a woman (at least to her face) is followed with unselfconscious grace by the Virginian, making him a man whom most men respect and most women admire.However some men, those who are always hoping to make a quick, dishonest buck or bully a helpless stranger, are less than enamored of the Virginian and curse or avoid him whenever they can. Such a man is Trampas, an invertebrate cattle rustler who having lost to the Virginian in a card game does everything he can to bring about his downfall. The inevitable showdown between these two men looms like piling thunderclouds throughout the book and is finally resolved in a tense and utterly believable show down.But it is not all poker games and shoot outs for the Virginian. When a young and independent-minded school marm named Molly Stark Wood comes from the Green mountains of Vermont to teach the children of ranchers, the Virginian, ever a dab hand with the ladies, comes courting. The fact that Molly holds him at arms' length throughout most of the book only increases his ardor. Her secret affection for this handsome man, who although uneducated by most standards, has something about him that declares him to be one of nature's true gentlemen, only grows stronger with each meeting.Love, hatred, justice, philosophy, irony, slapstick, and a deep veneration for the fierce beauty of the West, are all crammed into 300 pages of The Virginian. It's a great read, no matter what your reading tastes, and maybe a good introduction to a genre rich in story, stereotype, and satisfaction--the American Western."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"A lone man from the eastern parts of the United States is in a strange and unusual land when he arrives in a small town called Medicine Bow, in the Wyoming Territory. In this hostile and lonely place, he meets a shady character, only known as the Virginian throughout the novel, who is there to take him to a friend named Henry, who happens to be a judge. Throughout the novel, the Virginian shows more and more of his behavior and his compassion, especially when he sees something that attracts his eye. A young schoolteacher from Vermont, Mary Wood, is saved by the Virginian when he grabs her from an overturned stagecoach that falls into a creek. The two steadily develop an interest for each other, until they fall completely in love. All things are not perfect in Medicine Bow, however, for it is still a Western town. Along with saloon fights and duels, the Virginian has a nemesis known as Trampas, a local cowhand. As there is no officer or deputy, the now infuriated Virginian takes matters into his own hands, silencing Trampas once and for all and capturing his one true love. The Virginian, written by Owen Wister, is an excting historical-fiction novel because of three main points: its excellent historical descriptions, its shocking action, and also because of its romance.The Virginian is an excellent novel in its description of an old Western town and its people. Medicine Bow, in the Wyoming Territory, is a typical small village that has no authority. Because of that, fights are constantly breaking out in saloons, and people are always being murdered. However, being raised as a southern gentleman before the Civil War, the Virginian remains calm under constant pressure, until he finally snaps, and fights the cowhander, Trampas. This is just to prove that a small town such as Medicine Bow isn't the prime place to go to while on vacation.Also, the action of this novel is another reason why it should be read. When the Virginian enters the Medicine Bow saloon for the first time, there was a point of conflict in the saloon where several people were seriously injured, partly due to the Virgianian. Although this excerpt of the novel was extemely intense, the final showdown between Trampas and the Virgianian is the most shocking with amazing results, in which the suspense will knock the reader off his or her feet.Romance is the third key factor in why the Virginian, written by Owen Wister, should be read. In the beginning of the story, The Virginian is often described as a lonely person, who's seldom seen with anyone. However, after he rescues the damsal in distress from the overturned stagecoach, his luck begins to change. This goes the same way for Mary Wood, who is actually a bit embarrased over the incident in how frightful she was, clinging fiercely onto the Virginian's back. Even with this, they eventually become quite entangled at the end, proving that love triumphs over every obstacle.Overall, the Virginian is a great historical fiction novel because of its accurate and adequate history, its great and stunning thrills, and because it is a great love story for all to read. Speaking of love, that's the most important reason why this book is different from most. It teaches a lesson that if you are compassionate to other people, other people will be compassionate to you. When the Virginian first picks up a visitor from the east, he doesn't know what to do with his life. Afterwards, however, he finds that life is worth living. I rate this novel five stars out of five.A.

However I was quickly taken aback by the fact that they never fully identified the background of the Virginian.Throughout the entire book he remains a mystery, his whole life a mystique aside from what everyone knew which was he came from the eastern part of the country. With a persona that screams Mad Max &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; he is a modest person who goes for the gusto in his ventures during the book. Working in Wyoming his boss Judge Henry, is not very strong as far as standing up for himself is concerned. When a rival rancher hires some bandits to rob a couple of horses from Henry's ranch, it's the Virginian to the rescue. Eventually the book which includes many other swashbuckling adventures, waters down to a duel between the leader of the Bandits and the Virginian. He even has time for a lovelife in the craziness of the west when he hooks up with a school teacher by the name of Molly Stark. The wedding does not go quite as planned though and I suggest you read the novel to eventually find out what happens. A terific story that has been made into two motion pictures, the plot in Owen Wisters story has more twists then a hostess truckload of strudel.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"Owen Wister's \\"The Virginian,\\" first published in 1902, is considered by many to exemplify the American Western novel. Wister certainly established the code of the West, and the stereotypical figures of the tough but genteel and courageous cowboy, (the one wearing the white hat and riding the white horse), the spinster schoolmarm from back East, horse rustlers, and the corrupt villain beyond redemption. In fact, the novel contains a scene constituting the first known \\"shootout\\" in American literature. Our narrator is an easterner, a man who visits Judge Henry, the Virginian's employer, at his ranch on Sunk Creek fairly frequently. I came to think of him as Mr. Wister himself, who did travel to Wyoming and parts West extensively.From my perspective, the Virginian, whose true name is never revealed, is anything but a stereotype, although many heroes have been modeled after him. Yes, he is tall, dark and handsome. This description is not terribly distinctive or unusual. One could definitely call him the strong silent type, and he does have a marked sense of honor, loyalty and justice. However, born and raised in Virginia before the Civil War, it is realistic to assume he was instilled with the values of a southern gentleman. Although he was not to the manor born, his family was decent and hardworking, and one certainly does not need wealth to live by the Good Book. A war veteran and a longtime wanderer throughout the western territories, he had learned survival skills by his mid-twenties. Loose lips was not a desirable trait if one wanted to live a long and healthy life. I found the Virginian to be a credible character, flawed like all men, but with a clear and unwavering sense of right and wrong. He is a man suited to his environment and to his times, and personifies the rugged individual.It is important to note the period in which this novel was written to fully enjoy it, just as it is crucial to understand the times and setting in which such authors as Charles Dickens, Jane Austen and George Eliot wrote. In \\"The Virginian,\\" Wister states: \\"It was through the Declaration of Independence that we Americans acknowledged the eternal equality of man. For by it we abolished a cut-and-dried aristocracy. We had seen little men artificially held up in high places, and great men artificially held down in low places, and our own justice-loving hearts abhorred this violence to human nature. Therefore, we decreed that every man should henceforth have equal liberty to find his own level. By this very decree we acknowledged and gave freedom to true aristocracy, saying, 'Let the best man win, whoever he is.' That is America's word. That is true democracy.\\" Believing this so strongly, is it any wonder that the character of the Virginian was created?As for Miss Mary Stark Wood of Bennington, Vermont, who calls herself spinster at age 20, she is a woman ahead of her time. Many have been created in Mary's image, but she is the original. Intelligent, independent, adventurous, full of pluck and, yes, pretty, she sets off to teach school in Bear Creek, Wyoming, to get away from family pressure to wed an unwanted suitor, and probably to see more of the world. An acquaintance and correspondent of Miss Wood's, Mrs. Balaam, a Bear Creek resident, wrote and told the young woman of the teaching position. Mary accepts, and as it happens, the Virginian is the first to meet her upon her arrival. He actually rescues her, as the primitive stagecoach she has been traveling in is mired-down in a creek - the driver drunk and quite irresponsible. She is later embarrassed, remembering how tightly she clung to the cowboy, in fright, not out of flirtatiousness. He, however, cannot get her out of his mind. This is so much more than a romance novel, although there is romance aplenty, of both the classical nature and the kind between a man courting a woman.The Virginian's bete noir is an evil character named Trampas. The two clash throughout the tale until the final showdown. One of the books classic lines has our hero responding to Trampas after a nasty insult, \\"When you call me that, smile.\\" He is also betrayed by a trusted friend who becomes corrupt out of greed and weakness. Law and order had not arrived in Wyoming Territory and it was up to individuals to maintain a civil society. Mary Wood calls this taking the law into one's own hands, or vigilantism. This issue becomes a bone of contention between herself and the Virginian.Owen Wister imbues his characters, especially the Virginian and Mary, with a remarkable sense of depth. Their relationship, as well as his relationship with his old friend Steve, are depicted with particular poignancy. The initial reserve between Mary and her suitor is normal for the period. However, the sexual tension between them is palpable. Graphic love scenes are not necessary here. The author does more with a kiss and an embrace than many modern writers accomplish with all their erotica. There is some terrific humor also. I found Emily, the hen, to be one of the most original animals in fiction and absolutely hilarious. Wister's vivid passages describing the Wyoming wilderness are extraordinary, making it easy for one to visualize the gorgeous landscapes. The pace is somewhat slow at times. However, I did not find the narrative at all tedious. Time passed more slowly back then and things took longer to accomplish for obvious reasons. This difference is demonstrated in the way the tale is told.\\"The Virginian\\" was voted by the Western American Writers in 1977 as the greatest western novel of all time. Whether it is or isn't is debatable, but I really enjoyed it. In this 100th anniversary edition Max Evans contributes a new and fascinating Afterwards.

The drawings are exquisite. The original version was illustrated by Charles M.

My comments might offend some readers.When reading a novel, do you mentally cast the movie version? In appearance, speech, and manner, Randolph Scott * or a young Sam Elliott are obvious choices for The Virginian. But Cary Grant (!!!) also crossed my mind, and this observation from the 7/31/2009 \\"New York Times\\" offers confirmation: \\"Watching [Grant] is to be reminded of a time when intelligence, grace and self-containment were their own rewards.\\"Intelligence, grace, and self-containment are major consituents of the Virginian's personality and character, and major reasons for the continued popularity of this novel. But they are not the whole story.\\"The Virginian\\" was the first modern \\"Western\\" novel -- the ur-bach (primal stream), in fact -- which set the standard, not only for the plotting of such works, but for the way we view cowboys -- the \\"strong, silent\\" type, the stranger of impeccable character who wanders into town, cleans things up, and then -- depending on the writer's taste -- either wanders off into the sunset (\\"Who /was/ that masked man?\\") or marries the schoolmarm. **This characterization and plot have become so clich&eacute;d that one might expect \\"The Virginian\\" to be not only a bad novel, but a shallow one. It is neither. Unlikely as it might seem, it's about the morality of violence, and the nature of male sexuality.People commonly misread \\"The Virginian\\" as a paean to the \\"fundamental decency\\" of the cowboy, even going so far as to project \\"Christian\\" virtues on their behavior, but this is more a creation of Hollywood and cheap novels, than any reflection of reality. The Virginian is relatively restrained in his behavior, compared to the average cow-boy, but he's no church-goin' Boy Scout, not by a long shot.The unnamed hero appears to be based on a guide, George West, whom Owen Wister was likely infatuated with. There's no question that the narrator is sexually attracted to The Virginian from the first, and bluntly praises his animal good looks: \\"For he now climbed down with the undulations of a tiger, smooth and easy, as if his muscles flowed beneath his skin.\\" And later: \\"[he] looked at [Mollie] with such a smile, that, had I been a woman, it would have made me his to do what he pleased...\\" Though people a century ago might have interpreted Wister's praise of The Virginian's catlike body as amusing asexual hyperbole, it seems hard to believe the author's willingness to -- shall we say -- be mounted by another man went by without notice. But it did.Though The Virginian intends to settle down when the right woman comes along, he has no intention of remaining celibate beforehand. He has a one-night stand with the blond \\"biscuit cutter\\" at the restaurant (which, we are told, she thoroughly enjoyed), and explains to the author (in the deleted \\"Hank's Woman\\" episode) that he (and most men he knows) aren't sexually attracted to \\"good\\" women. And he sings dirty songs (one of which has 79 unprintable verses).Wister says The Virginian talked with him about sex uninhibitedly: \\"...he fell into the elemental talk of sex, such talk as would be an elk's or tiger's; and spoken so by him, simply and naturally, as we speak of the seasons, or of death, of of any actuality, it was without offence. But it would be offence should I repeat it.\\" Perhaps most significantly, The Virginian talks of having \\"sprees\\" with his friend Steve, and that they \\"most always hunted in couples back in them gamesome years\\", implying that they sometimes shared the same women. This can be interpreted as an indirect form of same-sex intercourse.The schoolmarm's (Mollie Wood's) reaction to The Virginian is hardly less physical than the author's. \\"She did not dare to trust herself face to face again with her potent, indomitable lover.\\" And her relatives are least as much attracted to his studly good looks: \\"Is the fellow as handsome as that, my dear?\\" her aunt asks, and later muses \\"She is like us all. She wants a man that is a man.\\" Though she is concerned with his character, sex is not far from her mind.The Virginian's ethics include the principle that \\"a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\\", and its complement, that every man has to work out his own problems. If you don't, you're not a man, and one does not come to the assistance of another man except under extreme circumstances. And a real man is obliged to set a high standard for others to emulate.The Virginian is violent only when there's no other choice. He's quick-witted, with a dry sense of humor, able to resolve (or postpone) most conflicts (including personal insults) with the right choice of words. It takes a novel's worth of Trampas's insults and worse nastiness before The Virginian is finally forced to shoot him down, when Trampas challenges him to a gunfight the quiet Easterner can't back out of.This bothers him, because, though the world is better off without Trampas, *** there should have been no need for him to have killed the man. That it was wholly Trampas's fault is not much justification -- or excuse. But The Virginian's deepest moral dilemma occurs when learns that his best buddy, Steve, has been rustling cattle for some time. ****The Virginian feels that Steve should be hung, pronto, without a trial, especially as Steve betrayed his best friend's trust. But he agonizes over it, wondering, in particular, whether he'd failed to help Steve overcome temptation. And though the school marm says she'll leave him if he does it, he nevertheless strings up Steve. (The hanging of Jake Spoon in \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is obviously inspired by this part of the story.)The Virginian's reaction to what seems the unavoidable need to put a man to death is believable. Up to this point, we've seen that he is a restrained, intelligent, thoughtful person who rarely does anything on impulse (the \\"child-swapping\\" episode being the principal exception), and that he is deeply concerned with what is right and what is wrong. So when he goes into an agony over killing Steve (though a restrained, cowpoke sort of agony), we agonize with him.The Virginian's mixture of the Dyonisian (animal grace, love of sex, intense association with the natural world) and the Apollonian (intellect, self-awareness, rationality) is likely intentional. He is portrayed as an ideal, quasi-godlike human male -- though fundamentally pagan/Classical, not Christian. In one famous episode, he maliciously humiliates a pompous, self-righteous minister.There are other significant characters besides the ones mentioned. Shorty is a kind-hearted but nave cowpoke who also comes to a terrible end. It's worth noting that, though The Virginian vigorously encourages Shorty to \\"do the right thing\\", he does not \\"intervene\\" (as a protective parent might) to physically stop him from associating with bad people. Shorty is left to make his own choices, even though they lead to his destruction.And then there's the rancher Mr. Balaam, a monster in human form. What he does to Shorty's beloved horse goes beyond anything you might read in a horror novel. It's not for the squeamish.If I have any complaint about \\"The Virginian\\", it's that it's sometimes a hard read. Wister was a good writer (no J F Cooper, he), but his prose is occasionally dense or complex. This isn't helped by his (apparently) accurate rendition of the way Western folk spoke circa 1875. Some passages (such as the famous one about \\"moistness\\") verge on the incomprehensible -- Wister is /not/ an omniscient narrator who explains what each character is thinking, or why he acts the way he does. Given the remoteness of the era (in both time and space), there is a loss of context that would help the reader better understand what's going on.Regardless, if you like Westerns, \\"The Virginian\\" is a must-read. Even if you don't, \\"The Virginian\\" is a significant cultural milestone, and is worth reading for that reason alone.* Randolph Scott was of the same \\"Virginia elite\\" as The Virginian. He was born to play the part.** Stan Freberg adroitly skewers the stereotype in \\"Bang Gunnleigh, US Marshal Field\\".*** For those who have seen only the TV series, which bears almost no relation to the novel, Trampas ain't Doug McClure. Not no way, not no how.**** We see almost nothing of Steve. This is mostly because the story is told mostly from Wister's perspective, and The Virginian is rarely with Wister and Steve at the same time. One wonders whether Wister was sexually jealous of their friendship.

Well worth reading for that reason alone even if you did not live on a street named after Wister as I did."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"There can be no doubt of this : All America is divided into two classes,--the qualify and the equality.The latter will always recognize the former when mistaken for it. Both will be with us until our women bear nothing but hangs.It was through the Declaration of Independence that we Americans acknowledged the ETERNAL EQUALITY of man. For by it we abolished a cut-and-dried aristocracy. We had seen little mere artificially held up in high places, and great men artificially held down in low places, and our own justice-loving hearts abhorred this violence to human nature. Therefore, we decreed that every man should thenceforth have equal liberty to find his own level. By this very decree we acknowledged and gave freedom to true aristocracy, saying, &quot;Let the best man win, whoever he is.&quot; Let the best man win! That is America's word. That is true democracy. And true democracy and true aristocracy are one and the same thing. If anybody cannot see this, so much the worse for his eyesight. -Owen Wister, The VirginianA friend of Theodore Roosevelt, to whom he dedicated this novel, Owen Wister is considered the father of the Western. The Virginian has been filmed at least five times and was voted the greatest Western of all time. Even if you've never read the book or seen one of the movies, you're more than likely familiar with the one great line : &quot;When you call me that, smile!&quot;All of that said, it has not worn as well as some other classic novels. It's influence, particularly in establishing the idea of a code of the West, is undeniable, but it just doesn't read all that smoothly. It suffers from several significant flaws : the romance which occupies the center of the novel is both too reserved and too idealized; the author uses a woefully awkward dialect to render the Virginian's speech; and is affected by a too delicate sensibility about the rough justice that is meted out. This last may well be the product of some Eastern embarrassment over the still wild nature of the West, but it is also a wee bit dandified. There's a very amusing review at Amazon which claims that this is an unacknowledged gay classic. I don't know that I'd go that far, but I take the reviewer's point that the true love in the book is between the narrator and the Virginian, and that the schoolmarm is mostly annoying. Likewise, the narrator betrays a certain squeamishness throughout which at least borders on the effete.It's still a book worth reading, if for no other reason than that it spawned one of the most popular genres in all of literature and the movies. There are also several asides in which Wister delineates the rough moral code which would become so familiar in the many Westerns to follow. But the prospective reader should be prepared for a novel which is showing every year of its age.GRADE : B-"},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"The thinly-disguised passion of the anonymous male narrator for the eponymous hero of The Virginian makes this book one of the great underground homosexual love-stories of all time. If Wister's hero had only had the sense to give up his rather unconvincing romance with the frosty, insubstantial little schoolmarm, and turn to the one who loved and understood him as no other, literary history would have been changed utterly....Certain scenes, such as the Virginian's digesting of huge doses of nineteenth-century literature and Shakespeare at the behest of his fiancee, are fraught with unintentional hilarity. One wishes the duel with Trampas hadn't ended the book before the reader could learn what the cowboy critic thought of The Brothers Karamazov (or Mrs. Gaskell's Cranford, for that matter.)"},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"For anyone fascinated by how the myth of the Western hero came into being, this is the book to read. Published in 1902, it became hugely popular for decades and inspired movies (a version with Gary Cooper in 1929) and a long-running TV series (1962-1971). A modern reader could easily guess the storyline without reading a synopsis - the classic elements are all there: tall, dark, handsome cowboy hero; pretty schoolmarm from back East; the villain who must finally face justice at the end of a gun.Few historical novels are dedicated to American presidents, however, and another whole dimension of the novel opens up with the name appearing on the dedication page -- Theodore Roosevelt, a college friend of the author's. What Wister does, besides telling a story of adventure and romance, is portray a particular kind of heroic figure, a natural man whose integrity is untainted by the corrupt (though civilized) values of the East.The book is a deliberate and often worshipful character study for the age of Teddy Roosevelt-style masculinity. The young Virginian charms us (and the narrator) with his courage and modesty and his thoughtful attempts to understand a world in which some men (even good ones) act dishonorably and make cowardly choices. Stoic and cool on the surface, the currents of sentiment run deep in this man. So does the will to self-improvement, as he reads Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott.This book connects with so much of American myth over the last 100 years that you could easily write another book about it. Or you can simply enjoy it for what it is, a historical romance so well conceived, in spite of its sometimes dated views, that you keep on reading through each episode of the story, glad that Wister was in no hurry to cut to the chase. This is a book for any reader of Western literature, fiction or nonfiction. In it the many traditions of the western come together in popularized form for the first time.Readers who enjoy this book will also like Elmer Kelton's novel, \\"The Day the Cowboys Quit.\\" While it's more historically accurate in its portrayal of working cowboys, it captures many of Wister's same narrative elements, in the courage, modesty and thoughtfulness of its hero, its portrayal of the relationship between a top hand and his boss, its fateful pursuit of cattle rustlers, an account of a troubled friendship between two men, and of course the loneliness and yearning at the heart of a man who loves a woman from afar."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"This is the classic story by Wister (1860-1938) of the ranch foreman, known only as the Virginian, his courtship of Molly Starkwood, the &quot;schoolmarm&quot; from Vermont, and his conflicts with Trampas. In 1977, the Western Writers of America voted this novel as the top western novel of all time. It probably started the whole genre (even if one counts the pulp fiction popular in the late 19th century). Historians have always pointed out that there never really was a \\"Code of the West.\\" This was just something thought up by writers, journalists, and film makers. The West was made up of both good and bad men, just as today. But, in my opinion, this book challenges that concept. Wister based his characters on real people he interacted with in the West a few years earlier. There really were men like the Virginian. There really were people who, unknowingly, followed a Code (just as there are today)."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"/VIRGINIAN -by Owen Wister ( first reviewed 30 April 2006)Though \\"The Virginian\\" has a standing as a Western novel, it is philosophically rich, and Owen Wister used this novel to articulate certain fundamental truths. (I always find great clarification from older books, books written before TV, before Computers, and even before Radio. In these, one can still find clarification of values, that is not easily found in modern literature, when those who write books don't know the difference between \\"Come!\\" and \\"Go sic'em!\\" ) Wister's book is not just a \\"shoot'em-up\\". The reader needs to be aware of the depth of the philosophical arguments offered by his characters(1)the definition of a \\"gentleman\\" (in Chapter Two)(2)the conflict between GOOD (the Virginian) & EVIL (Trampas, the cowhand turned rustler and worse, corrupter of men, resulting in their destruction(3)the definition of \\"love\\" ; NOT the romantic love between the school teacher and the cowboy. Rather, it was the love the Virginian showed to his fellow cowhands, who were vulnerable to manipulation and deceit by crooked men, and in trying to shepherd souls along the lines of the soul's deepest strengths. (Example: the Judge's hired hand who loved horses).(4)the definition of \\"spirituality\\"; Wister draws a stark contrast between the traveling preacher, who wears his religious \\"act\\" like a cheap black suit and poorly conceals his contempt of common men in his arrogance and superiority complex.Moreover, Chapter Two demonstrates the essential requirement of HUMILITY that the Virginian manifests (a character trait utterly lacking in the minister).(5)the definition of \\"conflict\\": indeed, the entire book is about the very human fight at the very core of life. The Virginian demonstrates the singular truth, clear to anyone who actually engages life, that you cannot find an answer to life's conflict by simply turning away and riding out of town. There is no answer to life's problems in mere \\"conflict-avoidance\\", nor in folding our hands and practicing some NAMBY-PAMBY sentiment passing under the guise of LOVE.I am not proposing that two-handed fisticuffs are the means for resolving all problems. What I am attempting to show is that at some level, whether physical, emotional, ethical or otherwise mental and spiritual, that problems must be faced on some teleological basis.When The Virginian beats the stuffing out of one of the most despicable of human beings (the abuser of horses) he demonstrates the timelessness of the truth, that good people must stand for something. Even today, deceit and lies have been popularized so that one often hears admonitions, suggesting that we should all practice, \\"NON-JUDGEMENT.\\" That only bears out, if you choose to embrace ideological horse-flop as life's dearest treasure.Some fights must be fought, though we do not enjoy them. The EVIL that Trampas represents, will not back down, in its mindlessness. Riding away simply turns over the reins of power to the embodiment of EVIL.(6)the definition of \\"humor\\": (I cannot spoil the story but...the CHICKEN, the DRUMMERS, the railroad ride after the cattle sale)There are numerous accounts demonstrating how good people find humor at every chance, and who use humor and imagination to fight evil in everyday circumstances.(7) DUTY: As Foreman of the Judge's ranch, the Virginian endures many slights and insults to his authority by a \\"top hand\\" or two. Not once does he inform the Judge of these difficulties. Why? Because performing his duty includes these things. It is his job; and the Virginian performs his duty as a worthy hand.The Virginian was written by Wister to a deep purpose, so deep in fact, that I believe it was largely lost on the world. True, it was made into many movies, but even in these, even the great ones, the TRUTHS Wister elaborates in the book are vastly watered down. You cannot acquire Wister's purpose merely by watching a movie. You can only find them in the book.The book, in the wording of an older era, may seem awkward, perhaps ...slow; but I suggest you think of it as a foray into another place, the Wyoming of a hundred years ago, with vast prairies of open sky, only rarely interrupted by a human dwelling, and more rarely still, by a town. Words then, were a relief from the prairie, which alternates from being vastness of eerie silence, punctuated by violence.In certain ways, Wister eclipses Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\". He was not credited with being the literary giant that Melville enjoys in literary history, but in my opinion, he arrived at a deeper point, and quicker. Melville's characters are melodramatic and driven, often as not, by superstition and wild, incomprehensible urges. Wister's characters are driven by a more familiar greed, a more familiar goodness, a more familiar treachery, an everyday ordinariness, if you will.When Melville gives his characters something to contend with, they must contend with the ultimate superwhale, Moby Dick, or, it is the strange obsessive madness of the captain. These are less often encountered by people generally, in any age. Wister's evil is not, like Melville's, the Arch-Evil of some cartoonish melodrama. Wister's evil is the cattle rustler, driven by personal selfishness, and a contempt for common values. In my opinion, there is more of a lesson for us in Wister's presentation of evil as more of an everyday, and an ordinary thing, in an ordinary humanity.There is a foreshadowing in Wister's novel, of a theme exploited to great success by Louis L'Amour half a century later: the notion of a cowhand, who has vaguely ridden on the wrong side of the law. From the start, we become aware that the Virginian is not a \\"saint\\". He is a man molded by hard living in the American West. Somewhere on Life's road, a choice was made to care for people, and not merely to steal from others to advance self. Wister's rejection of EGO-CENTRISM as a basis for living is clear. Duty to principle is the honorable alternative.****** The ACADEMICS and their perspectives on the Virginian*********There have been some academics who have written prefaces, introductions, and essays about the Virginian, and their natty-brained intellectualizations frequently seem to dominate the public's understanding of the Western, and Wister's tale.Here's where they go wrong. Writing from the concrete castles of academia, these academics are far removed from the realities of life, especially from the world Wister showed us. Academics operate in an abstract realm of ideas, where they assure themselves that human conflict (and even violence) are all a thing of the past, and that their wordy perambulations have encompassed all that is known of man. After all, they tell us with great bluster and probity that the cowboy and his myth have vanished. That may be so; but what has never changed in life is CONFLICT. It was not removed when TV was invented.There are those who afford themselves the privilege of scoffing at defining good and evil. These are people who are not engaged in the struggle. They are the spectators in life, and that is why we must guard carefully to never let such tell us how we ought to think and act. Invariably, they will discourage all action. By this philosophy, a cynical and skeptical view is proper, and paralysis, passivity, and inaction, are the order of the day.Wister's Virginian, shows where a man's duty lies, and how he ought to go about conducting himself in facing conflict. The cowboy may be gone, but human conflict is always with us.Though literary critics advance Mark Twain or Nabokov or Melville or some such as authors of The Great American Novel, for me, it will always be The VIRGINIAN. --Bruce Bain//"},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"Like another reviewer, I picked up my copy at a second-hand bookstall before going on holiday. I do this so that I can jettison the book when read without feeling I've wasted money. I recognised the title as that of a TV show, and was expecting an easy-read non-engaging story. How wrong I was. The story is hard to follow and demands concentration. After reading it &quot;to see what happened in the end&quot; I started at the beginning again to relish the writing and enjoy the situations. The story is about the Virginian, but the person who makes the longest journey is Molly. The man's rival is not another man, but another culture. Molly is in love with the man, but he is a cowboy. Although he is the most wonderful, handsome, wise man she has ever met, he wears chaps, carries a rope and a gun, and rides a horse all day. How can she ever possibly take him home to Bennington, where he will be a figure of fun. He will never fit in back home in Vermont. Although Wyoming is in the same country, it might as well be on the moon. Molly cannot bear the thought of the shame that must follow. It gets worse later when she finds out that the man has killed, and intends to kill again. Well, as you all know, love does eventually conquer all, and Molly gives in. The Virginian DOES fit in back East (a bit unbelievably I think) and all is well. Finally, the quality of writing is superb. Every sentence is worthy of that second read to get the best out of it. My favourite quote is &quot;Has any botanist set down what the seed of love is? Has it anywhere been set down in how many ways this seed may be sown? In what various vessels of gossamer it can fall, and live unknown, and bide its time for blooming?&quot; How true. I think the mark of good writing is how often the reader murmers &quot;Yes, that's true.&quot; Well, this book is about cross-cultural relationships and marriage, and I think a lot of it strikes pretty true."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I just finished reading it for the second time. The Virginian is a man's man, a man of honor and integrity, a man of resolute character loved by all.

Definitely the archetypal hero and epitome of the American cowboy."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"This one's the tale of a tall, silent and supremely competent cowboy in old Wyoming, who hails from the South, a young fellow who ran away from his kin at 14 and made his life in a variety of places out on the Great Plains of the American West. A little bit simple and not much on plot, it chronicles this cowboy's growth, from rootless 25 year old cowhand to ranch foreman and, ultimately, success in his own right via the uplifting influence of his passion for a New England school marm, come west to change her own life. Somewhat episodic, it reflects events reported to us by an eastern companion of our hero who, for reasons never described, makes numerous visits to the western ranch of Judge Henry, the Virginian's employer, going from mistrusted tenderfoot to confidant of the new foreman. In the mix is an ongoing feud with the no-good cowhand, Trampas, which culminates in a battle with rustlers and a final showdown that happens so swiftly, and internally within the Virginian's own perceptions, that we almost miss it! Rife with cliches that we may assume were somewhat fresher at the beginning of the twentieth century when this book was written, the tale rises above the noble hero and conflicted school marm at its core to give us a look at how the West really was just as it was losing its frontier flavor. I found the first-person narrative which seemed to drift, repeatedly, into unexplained third-person (since the narrator kept reporting on things and events he could not possibly have known) somewhat clumsy and distracting, but, on balance, this was a most enjoyable read, a Western that transcends its genre to give us a real sense and flavor of another time and place, one that lives on in our American mythology. The characters were not strongly drawn and most were mere shadows in the background, but the Virginian, himself, came through quite clearly and we grow to appreciate this lonely paradigm of the American frontier type who became a staple in the Western mythos.

It is not about Virginia at all, but about Wyoming during the infamous period of the range wars.

Some of the original sites, such as the \\"Goose Egg\\" ranch (the dance and switching of the babies) are actual historical spots - parts of the the old stone ranch house were still standing in the 1960's and perhaps some remnants of it remain today, although it is all on private property now along Bessemer Bend along the Platte River. The Occidental Hotel, in Buffalo, a well-made ancient brick building, is still standing in remarkable condition and still in use today, and was the scene of the shoot-out between the Virginian and Trampas. The little town of Medicine Bow still holds physical remnants of the Virginian's story in historical significance to be seen and felt. As is the song \\"High Noon\\", sung by Tex Ritter, a reminder of this unforgettable story that crosses from literature into song and legend.\\"The Virginian\\", like the legendary movie \\"Shane\\" has much of it's subtle nuances revolving around the nefarious Johnson County Cattle War. (Buffalo, Wyoming) This was during a wild, untamed era when the range was unfenced, big cattle empires, some of whom were English Lords rather than Americans (Frewen's Castle is a prime example of another historical Wyoming ruin near Buffalo - owned by an Englishman and now also on private property) ran huge herds of cattle on free grass and fattened their wallets as much as they fattened the cattle; somehow, these big cattlemen decided they owned the entire state without benefit of deed or law. When the Homestead Act brought in settlers to this vast land, the end of the free grass became quite apparent to these individuals, who had laid claim to the land without benefit of deed. They decided that the fastest way to deal with the problem was to \\"eliminate it\\" and hired guns from Texas and Oklahoma were brought in with the blessing of the governor of the state of Wyoming at that time, Gov. Barber.There was, indeed, as there always is, two sides to the story, and the settlers did rustle some cattle, no doubt. The subtle references to this problem appear during Judge Henry's dialogue in the Virginian. The Virginian's dearest friend, Steve, comrade of his youth, was caught up in it; and was caught with stolen horses. The chapter that dealt with this is especially poignant and emotional; the hanging and the scene of the Virginian's torment of the night before; the grim foreboding sight of \\"the cottonwood\\" looming in the shadows, where vigilante justice is to be served up in the morning; and Steve's stilted, cowhand's way of sending the Virginian his farewell - is very moving.It is also a tale of lost individuals attaching themselves to predators because they need someone to guide them and there is no one else in their fragmented lives; the character of \\"Shorty\\" is one of these - the boy/man who is ill-equipped to make his way in the world of men, hence is an easy mark for Trampas - yet is always good to his horse.There is much to this book, both as a novel based in fact and history, and as a literary accomplishment. Wister dresses up his narration a bit, of course, but essentially, the picture of life out here is fairly close to being accurate at that time. Unlike \\"Shane\\", whose splendid film treatment will go down in it's own history as being one of a kind, \\"The Virginian\\" has never had a worthy movie made of it, in my view.I recommend this to anyone wishing to read an old book that is still vastly worthwhile, even though it's subjects are long gone and only their shadows remain. Look deep into it's pages because there's a lot stirring there that takes a second look."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"I was in the used book store and I saw this book. The Virginian. &quot;Hm,&quot; I thought. &quot;I used to watch that show on television when I was a kid.&quot; By Owen Wister. &quot;So, it's a book!&quot; And I though that was pretty cute. Oh, and I liked the cover. The edition that I bought was in the Pulp Fiction section of the book store, that real old book smellin', yellowing pages, origional cover price anywhere between 15 and 99 cents section. So I bought it, read a couple of pages expecting to find out that it was the cheesest thing I'd picked up in a hundred years. And before I even knew what was happening The Virginian, black curly hair in desperate need of a cut, quick draw, lonesome maverick, the new teacher for the one room schoolhouse-yes, even the one room schoolhouse!-all were in my purse, going with me everywhere...Never mind that it's a western, get over yourselves and read this book! It's so much fun. Mr. Wister gives a good story, well told."},{"Title":"The Virginian.","review":"The Virginian is a classic because of the superb characters who fill its pages. The protagonist, known only as the Virginian, embodies a code of manly virtue. He is unique. Without Mary's civilized purity or the Virginian's wild perfection, the book would be a dry, uninteresting Western, full of stereotypical cowboys swaggering around with their pistols on their hips. Instead of a Buffalo Bill, Wister gives us a young man who loves Shakespeare and Dostoevsky and who does unpleasant things because he must, not because he enjoys them. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Bible Footlights for the Pilgrim's Path (1907)","review":"Excellent book -- very instructive Bible lessons.

Along come Taladas, a new continent not yet explored - or even knew about in the world of Krynn.It took me a little while to get used to some of the nuances of the continent such as the different names for the gods and the 'altered' races. Once you come to grips with the changes the novel moves on at a brisk pace. I was surprised the book was over 400 pages, typical Dragonlance books average 300-350. Good to see they are allowing a little more in terms of word count.I hesitate to give this book a perfect 5, as that would mean it was perfect and there was nothing to improve on. I think Pierson, is one of the up and coming Dragonlance authors. Yet, I think some of his dialog in this book seemed forced - at times it felt like the same character was talking when in fact it was a completely different character.I think this series has great promise and one that I will follow for sure."},{"Title":"Blades of the Tiger (Dragonlance: Taladas Trilogy, Vol. 1)","review":"The continent of Ansolon may belong to Weis and Hickman but Chris Pierson has staked his claim to Taladas in a big way!Blades of the Tiger is one of the absolute best books ever and the crowning jewel in the crown that will adorn Pierson's brow for years to come. A book filled with sharp edged betrayal, loyalty unto death and tragic heroes, this book sets the precedence by which all future novels based in Taladas should be measured. After the oft overlooked yet phenomenal Kingpriest trilogy, Chris Pierson has been rewarded with the opportunity of a lifetime in establishing Taladas as an unforgiving and cut throat continent that Ansalon was supposed to be before it was watered down with weak storylines.If the remainder of the series is even half as good as Blades, prepare to have your world rocked!"},{"Title":"Blades of the Tiger (Dragonlance: Taladas Trilogy, Vol. 1)","review":"One of the best Dragonlance novels I've read in a long time. As the before reviewer stated, maybe this is what Krynn needed. Something new and unexplored, yet not drastically different from Ansalon.Pierson weaves a good tale I must say. He often switches from one of the three main characters and their own perspective outlook, which makes the read utterly absorbing. Even though this book runs over 400 pages, not once did I feel like it was dragging on. If anything I wanted it to go longer! Good start to what should be an even better series.I'm ashamed to admit I didn't give much thought to his Kingpriest Trilogy when it came out but now I can't wait to get my hands on it after finishing this book."},{"Title":"Blades of the Tiger (Dragonlance: Taladas Trilogy, Vol. 1)","review":"I've never read a Chris Pierson novel - and this definately won't be the last!This first novel of a trilogy was totally gripping and vastly entertaining. Pierson's storyline and writing style reminded me strongly of David Gemmel - but better. Where Gemmel lacks in utilizing mythic fantasy creatures, such as goblins, dragons, elves and such - Chris Pierson does all this and much more.I like my fantasy heroic, with tons of rich and differing characters - both good and evil. Pierson delivered all of this in large quantities. And much more.The 3 storylines here converge very well, all resplendant with cool characters. Magic abounds, along with cultures of peoples and beasts such as minotaurs, different types of elves, mages and wizards, shapeshifters, and the list goes on. All blending well with the epic storyline.I just purchased the 2nd in the trilogy - Trail of the Black Wyrm, with another excellent cover art by Stan Stawicki. It seems each cover shows two differrent characters in each volume.This 1st one, shows the shapeshifter tiger-man, Chovuk, with his bodyguard, Hult. Hult is a very interesting and tough character in this story. As is Shedara, the elven thief who wields magic and looks and acts like a ninja.If you like your fantasy larger-than-life, with excellent pacing and heroic acts of derring-do - then Volume one of the Taladas Trilogy - Blades of the Tiger - is for you."},{"Title":"Blades of the Tiger (Dragonlance: Taladas Trilogy, Vol. 1)","review":"I really like the way that Pierson is stretching his wings with each successive piece of work in the Dragonlance universe. His earlier work started out as a very rigidly structured set of tales where most of the interesting decisions had been made. The Sacred Hammer trilogy was an exploration of a dimly covered legend, but with a clearly defined ending.With the Taladas Chronicles, Pierson finally gets to almost full extension -- working in a part of the world which is not encumbered by a history outside of his own fertile muse. And he makes use of it! Working up entire races and histories and backstories which enrichen the tale.I like most of Pierson's work, it is definitely some of the best Dragonlance available."},{"Title":"Blades of the Tiger (Dragonlance: Taladas Trilogy, Vol. 1)","review":"I picked this book up not knowing what to expect. Could I really tolerate another drastic change to the world of Dragonlance? Then again, maybe a totally new setting would breathe much needed life into Krynn. (After all, this is Chris Pierson, how can you not read it?)What we get is an isolated continent, peopled with familiar races, influenced by familiar gods, but with a different twist on the events of Krynn.Pierson fills his new canvas with a good story: 3 separate and very different lives uniting in a bid to contain an ancient evil within the confines of its elusive relic. While the Taladas Trilogy may not turn out to be the powerhouse that the Kingpriest Trilogy was, it certainly appears to be worthy reading and proof of Pierson's potential to be the new voice of Krynn."},{"Title":"Blades of the Tiger (Dragonlance: Taladas Trilogy, Vol. 1)","review":"as an avid reader of all the dragonlance books, going to other side of krynn was a trip indeed. both the books at this time are well written and very sustaining throught the entire story i reccomend it to any dragonlance reader."},{"Title":"Blades of the Tiger (Dragonlance: Taladas Trilogy, Vol. 1)","review":"I found this book to be amazing in every regard. The storyline was smooth and in no way predictable. I read this and what rushed to mind was, \\"Finally, a Dragonlance storyline where wars are not won by an idiot Kender's magical rainbow dust.The story is brutal, it essentially follows three main characters. One of them a thief, another a general, and the last a bodyguard for a tribal chief. Their stories are completely different and at many times, at cross purposes, but the history and intrigue of the while epic keeps you going. I sat down to read this, and finished it in nearly one sitting. It is really just that good. I honestly wanted to hear about each character and how they dealt with every situation. None of the usual, \\"Great, lets finish up with this loser so I can read what happens to the guy I like.\\"Pierson has truly come a long way since I read him last, and I can't wait for the last part of this trilogy to be released. The cliffhangers are everything that they should be. A self contained plot that just hints at what is truly just beyond the next cover.Really, if you are debating whether or not to shell out the few bucks for this book, then stop. Buy this book and buy the next one too. And if the last one is out by the time you see this, then buy that one too.

I really didn't know much going into this book about the continent of Taladas. After reading it, I must say that he painted a great picture of this continent on Krynn. Krynn needed a new world to explore and I am glad they came here. Human and Minotaur interactions are totally different, along with the elves and barbarians. They even have a nation that worships the dead, and raises them for their armies.

In the end, the biography fails.The \\"biography\\" has a feeling of a poorly edited diary (not a journal); one can almost tell which lines are Florence's. It's as if \\"they\\" took his diary composed of dates and events, and then added some explanatory material. The better the added material, the more likely it was his, but often it seems second-rate, a \\"cut and paste\\" feel to it. The facts are there; it's just not pleasurable reading per se.Having said that, to have added verbatim his first wife's recollections [written in 1911, the year before she died] of their first meeting in 1870 is worth the price of the book. This really is very, very precious: her description of riding her horse Fanny, her first impressions of Thomas (age 30 at the time), and her faith in Christ. It is said that Thomas, initially not terribly emotional upon the death of his first wife, later became nostalgic and more melancholy when thinking about Emma. Reading her recollections, one can almost see Thomas -- in late age -- wanting to ensure Emma's recollections were not lost to antiquity, not so much for him, but for her. Emma must have been a very attractive woman in her youth; after all, Thomas had just spent six years in London and passed on all the women there. Emma herself said upon seeing Thomas for the first time she had visions of having seen him in dreams.Thomas Hardy states his purpose was to put down in writing the facts about his life if it ever became necessary to publish to refute what others had said about him, that is, \\"to set the record straight.\\"At times the biography is a bit confusing. Sometimes you forget whether a particular anecdote refers to Hardy or to his second wife, Florence. It is hard to forget that she did not write the book - the original myth - and remember that it is his autobiography. [Note: Amazon.com shows the author as Florence Emily Hardy when the cover of the book shows the authors as Thomas and Florence. It would be more accurate to say: Thomas wrote it; Florence ensured that it was printed and published.]I would recommend reading Michael Milgate's or Martin Seymour-Smith's biography of Thomas Hardy, and then two or three of Hardy's most famous novels (e.g., \\"Tess,\\" \\"Far From the Madding Crowd,\\" \\"Jude the Obscure,\\" and maybe even one of his early ones such as \\"The Laodicean\\" to see his writing evolve) before reading this autobiography.If you first read the other biographies and a few of his novels, you will then have a myth of your own. You can then read the novelist's own words, and adjust your myth accordingly.If you read this as your first biography of Hardy you are likely to be disappointed. He is dry, taciturn, and quite unemotional, although his feelings about critics, society, and science do come through every now and then. He is very aloof and often you wish he would have written more about his personal thoughts, especially those on love. But then again, I get the feeling Hardy would have been the first to say that his thoughts on those subjects did not matter; he saw himself no more than \\"the infinitesimal insignificance of any one human life.\\"The biography is preceded by four pages of \\"selective biographic notes\\" with a short biographical description of the many writers, government officials, and socialites he either associated with or commented upon. To some extent one gets an idea of Hardy's \\"six degrees of separation\\" by perusing this list. He obviously felt at ease among socialites and seemed to have an innate ability to attract the women, perhaps much like Benjamin Franklin.The index is substandard and the three appendices are not all that rewarding. The fact that he included these particular letters suggests that he was responding to some particular issue regarding his epic poem, \\"The Dynasts.\\"This is the kind of biography that is most enjoyable by simply exploring a certain period in Hardy's life without reading the book from beginning to end. Skip around. Gradually you will find yourself having read the entire story.But, all in all, this biography fails. This is the entirety of remarks regarding Hardy's second marriage: \\"In February of the year following (1914) the subject of this memoir married the present writer.\\""},{"Title":"Thomas Hardy","review":"The first thing to know about this book, since the title is confusing, is that it is the life of Thomas Hardy, written almost entirely by him and published in two volumes under his wife's name after his death. This was his wish, and the reasons for it are complex and not fully understood, though his wife's preface and the scholarly introduction give some useful information. Hardy began writing it over a decade before his death, updating periodically; his wife finished it and, after consulting with friends and literary advisors, deleted some material and made a few additions. The former consisted mostly of frequent railing against critics; such outbursts were very understandable from a writer who had been often, harshly, and unfairly eviscerated but now seem moot since time has proven him right. Few will miss them or the other major deleted material, which mostly recounted social visitors to Hardy late in life. Hardy went from a humble background to world fame and acclaim, and it would be hard to begrudge him listing prominent callers, but he had a lifelong disdain for such accolades and probably just included this because he thought most would be interested. His close friends understandably wanted it removed, especially as they did not want him to come off as a social climber. Additions were mostly second- or third-hand anecdotes. All told, changes were significant in number but altered the book in only a very minor way. Several editions now exist, the most prominent being that edited by Michael Millgate, which tries to restore Hardy's intent, has extensive editorial material detailing changes, and includes added text as an appendix. The present edition has the work as published and, being a budget edition, lacks extensive bonus material, but is quite generous considering the price. There is an extensive Introduction detailing the complicated history as well as other background material that does a good job of setting the book up for the uninitiated; a Hardy chronology; a short bibliography; notes on many of the people mentioned; and an invaluable index. It is perfect for anyone wanting the original publication or an affordable and generally comprehensive version.As Hardy was modest, avoided the limelight, and had an extremely dim view of human significance generally, it might be surprising that he wrote an autobiography. His wife's preface indeed says he refused for years, saying he lacked \\"sufficient admiration for himself\\" but eventually yielded to her strong request to clear up widespread errors. The book's great unconventionality belies a lack of enthusiasm, but one would hardly expect Hardy to write a conventional autobiography, and it is arguably the better for it. It begins conventionally enough with family history and early incidents, proceeding year by year until death. However, it soon becomes very atypical. Hardy clearly had little use for typical rites of passage. For example, though going into significant detail about the courtship of his first wife and their marriage, he has only one sentence about his second - to the supposed author! He also writes shockingly little about his works; several novels get only a sentence or two, and none are discussed at length. This may be because Hardy had stopped writing fiction twenty years before and never cared much for it. Poetry, his then-current and preferred area, is indeed discussed far more often both in regard to his works and generally. His epic poem The Dynasts is mentioned far more than any other work, which made sense considering it was then probably his most acclaimed piece. However, it is now almost his least read, and the apparently inexplicable discrepancy will disappoint many. Hardy also says remarkably little about writing in general - inspiration, methods, etc.It need hardly be said that no one should read this to get a conventional overview of Hardy's life, as he is reticent or silent about many usual topics. Much has been made of the fact that he does not address his first marriage's unhappy and bitter later years; Hardy and his wife grew increasingly apart, eventually living separately in the same house. This was an important part of his life and inspired much of his work, but he never addresses or even admits it - though those on the lookout can easily see it implied; he never even criticizes his wife. The class difficulties he encountered in courting her are also muted, though implied. Others allege that he deliberately withholds other information, such as the full extent of the pain he felt in losing his faith. Anything expecting such things will be disappointed.However, I think this aspect has been greatly exaggerated. The book may be low on the tabloid-esque revelations many seem to want, but I strongly disagree that is unusually reticent on the whole. Hardy is remarkably forthright about very personal issues like early loves, lack of religious faith, the depth of his despair, and the hurt he felt from attacks on his work. Serious fans will of course want to read at least one biography to get a fuller picture, but it is erroneous and presumptuous to assume that people born after Hardy died can somehow give a more complete or accurate picture. Biographers love to rave about how much he leaves out, but the truth is that he lived a very private life and had nearly all his private papers burned. Many biographical claims are thus little, if anything, more than suppositions, and the entire picture of Hardy presented by some is really nothing more than an educated guess. That a new biography seems to come every few years, many with very contrasting - even contradictory - depictions, shows this.The book's unorthodoxy still means that casuals will probably be better served by a biography, but this has much that is fascinating and invaluable for fans and scholars. Not least important is that it is written in Hardy's inimitable style; its admirers will want everything he wrote, and the book is on par with much of his best work here. That anyone ever thought it was written by anyone else is truly astonishing. Far more important, though, are the numerous insights into Hardy's life and work. As is surely clear by now, they do not necessarily come in the usual way, but they certainly come. That Hardy was reluctant to write an autobiography and wrote it the way he did reveals far more about him than a conventional work ever could have. He left several collections' poems in miscellaneous order, saying that this reveals more about the writer and work than any kind of deliberate arrangement by showing the effects of chance and change. Much the same can be said of this. Though chronological, it is organized fairly loosely; many journal and notebook entries are used seemingly almost arbitrarily. They are in many ways the most interesting part of the book, giving dated and immediate impressions on a wide variety of topics. Many are not biographical so much as reflective, showing Hardy's views on art, life, philosophy, theology, love, and many other things. The book goes to considerable pains to point out that they are merely momentary impressions, but this again shows more than final conclusions could. The more biographical entries focus mostly on social interactions. Hardy never liked these but kept a record to help with writing society scenes. This is probably the book's most conventional feature, and Hardy's observations are at least as interesting as anyone's, not least in being atypical. It is also mesmerizing to see notes that eventually turned into stories or poems. Additionally, the notes are of great interest even to non-fans because of his many interactions with writers and other celebrities. Robert Browning and Leslie Stephen probably appear most often, but there are also fascinating first-hand anecdotes about people like Alfred Tennyson, Robert Louis Stevenson, George Bernard Shaw, and many others, as well as second-hand ones about the likes of Mark Twain and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Perhaps most amusingly, Hardy seems to have been one of very few Victorians unimpressed by Oscar Wilde; he is probably the only person to dismissively mention him in passing: \\"Met and talked to Browning at Mrs Procter's again...where was also Oscar Wilde, etc.\\"! H. G. Wells and Joseph Conrad are mentioned almost as parenthetically. Credentials clearly did not impress Hardy; he judged people from his own perspective, as he did everything else.Despite what so many say, this book reveals much about Hardy, including the inner man. His tastes in literature and other arts are particularly well represented; like many writers who hate critics, he was an excellent critic. We also learn much about the dark views of humanity, fate, chance, etc. that came out so forcefully in his writings; momentary jottings are again often most revealing. He holds back significantly on touchier issues - politics, class, gender, etc. - and indeed claimed lifelong political apathy. However, his advanced views and liberal sympathies are clear enough. As for straight biography, Hardy writes interestingly about pre-fame topics like his humble country upbringing and early sickness, his extraordinary self-education, his friendship with mentor Horace Moule and others, and his architectural training and career. I wish he had gone into more detail about this last, especially technical aspects, but we still learn much about his pre-writing career as well as how a greatly changed profession then worked in the mid-Victorian era. Hardy is then remarkably open about early struggles with publication, and his sensitivity to the many negative attacks on his work is astonishing. One might wonder that such a great artist would even notice, much less care about, what critics thought, but a true poet's sensitivity and a remarkable lack of self-confidence made Hardy particularly susceptible. He later became one of the world's most famous and revered writers, but this bitterness never left, and he continued railing against critics until death - so much so, indeed, that he was almost unaware of his status until a few years before he died, incredible as it seems. These are possibly the book's most revealing parts even with deletions. Similarly notable are the many defenses and justifications of his work, which clearly prove the seemingly paradoxical fact that his strong belief in the importance of individuality in art led him to stay remarkably steadfast to his vision in spite of sales, reviews, or public taste.Many facets of Hardy's personality arise clearly from the text: his great closeness with and love for family, his love for and sympathy with animals, his love of nature, etc. These are important in showing his humanity, because his lack of enthusiasm for the book plus his refusal and/or inability to sell himself in the conventional autobiographical way can easily present an oddly unappealing - if not exactly negative - personage. He comes off as cold, distant, and taciturn, especially if the book is read superficially and/or without other Hardy knowledge. This is another reason that it is hard to believe anyone thought his wife wrote the book; there is very little to love, or even feel sympathy with, in the portrayal. Interestingly, those who have compared the manuscript with the published book all agree that Hardy comes off better in the former, implying that his truly loving and loyal wife inadvertently misrepresented him. Yet even with all this, there is much to admire. Hardy was very far ahead of his time but also had many conventionally admirable qualities, not least intellect and perseverance. His determination to educate himself despite a lack of formal opportunities is particularly impressive, and though his is not quite a rags to riches story, it is one of England's few pre-twentieth century upward mobility examples. Some even find that, for all its unconventionality, the Hardy shown here has a formidable austere quality that is almost larger-than-life - that he is a sort of guru, profoundly original and almost superhumanly steady through all his life's immense changes. A few recent biographers even claim that this image is carefully contrived, a picture more of how Hardy wanted to be and/or wished to be seen than the considerably more humanly fragile being he was. Maybe; but the book reveals much about his thought and personality either way.The greatest insights unsurprisingly often seem to come incidentally and are more important for what they suggest than what they say - for example, his ironic observation about the Moulin Rouge's proximity to a cemetery. The most obvious and profound aspect, though, is his great reverence for and near-elementary connection with his native Southwest England. He made it world famous in his work as Wessex, and it was even more important in reality. Hardy lived the vast majority of his long life there and was intimately connected with its history, people, dialect, culture, topography, and more. The area suffuses virtually everything he did and thought; it would truly be impossible to exaggerate its influence on his life and work. Anyone serious about Hardy's work needs some background in this area to appreciate it fully and study it meaningfully, and this has some of the best material. Hardy's love for it is clear in the number of related anecdotes he includes despite their having little or no traditional autobiographical bearing. Aside from what they show about him, they are also of considerable historical value, as the way of life they depict - which stretches back to the Early Middle Ages - was already long gone when the book was written. Indeed, the whole book has considerable historical value when we consider that Hardy - born in 1840 - grew up in an era before railroads, electricity, telegraphs, automobiles, etc. but lived until 1928. His life stretched from more than a generation before the American Civil War to more than a decade after World War I - an era with more technological, scientific, theological, political, and social changes than any other of comparable length. His initial impressions of these and other events are invaluable.Hardy's native area had an almost sacred importance for him, but he understandably resented being stereotyped as a country writer and goes to great pains in order to prove that he was cosmopolitan. He is indeed sold short here, as he spent many years in London from his early twenties through his fifties and several months there each year afterward until age prevented it, and also traveled to Italy, France several times, Scandanivia, etc. The great breadth of his reading and interests also raised him above the parochial image so often unthinkingly thrown on him. One can learn this and many other little-known Hardy facts from the book.As I have surely made clear, this is not always easy reading. Casuals will likely skip much, and even hard-cores will probably be occasionally bored. Many of the journal entries are quite asinine, and their insertion is almost always jerky. It is also clear at times that Hardy simply did not know what to include, and he often seemed to fall back on what he thought might interest others. We thus get a disproportionate amount of social interaction, much of it uninteresting. Some years have little more than excerpts from his London season, an event always detailed though it varied little. However, all this will interest hard-cores and scholars, and it is not a major drag on what is overall an excellent, if highly unorthodox, autobiography. One should certainly read all or nearly all of Hardy's fiction and poetry before, but anyone who loves them will want this."},{"Title":"The Promise of Private Pensions: The First Hundred Years (A Pension Research Council book)","review":"Sass writes engagingly about the history of pensions, which goes back only about 100 years in the United States. He discusses the family handicraft economy of the mid-1800s, how it was displaced by large industrial firms, why pensions began, how they evolved, the impact of ERISA and the creation of defined contribution plans in the late 20th century. If you want to understand the policy issues of public (Social Security) and private pension reform and how they will affect you personally in the future, I suggest you turn back to the past for starters."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"This helped my Wife and I read the Bible together.

You also need to like the NKJV translation, which falls short in translation at points due to the diverse source of manuscripts and resources used in translation. MacArthur is anti-Pentecostal-charismatic, which is his right, but he is tough on charismatic interpretative approach to Scripture, while claiming literalist interpretative position. The notes are factual [some are personal interpretations] but for me not earthshaking or as informative as some other study Bibles. NKJV translation leaves a lot to be desired, despite it's promotion as a successor to the KJV. Bottom line is for fans of MacArthur this edition will be easy to read from the top of the page to the bottom as well as Introductory notes and concordance, but I would not base my theology exclusively on this Study Bible."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I own five Bibles, but when I am doing serious study, this is the one I reach for.

We are in the process of updating the Kindle (KF8) navigation and adding a How To Use Guide to assist our users in finding all of the MacArthur Supplementary Materials. We hope to have the updated version in the next few weeks. In the current version, all of the MacArthur verse notes can be accessed by clicking a hyperlinked verse number in the main Bible text. That will take you to the verse note or notes. From the note, click the hyperlinked chapter/verse number ie 9:1 and you will be returned to the main Bible text. Currently, the translator notes and footnotes identified in the main Bible text as a hyperlinked small letter of the alphabet \\"a\\" appear at the very end of the file. Click the hyperlinked letter in the Bible text to access the note, then click the hyperlinked letter to the left of the note back to the main Bible text. In the updated version, they along with the verse notes will be located at the end of each book of the Bible.

Very frustating. Live and learn."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"First, let me be clear. My complaint, which is really a warning, is against the Kindle edition and not the Bible itself. The McArthur Study Bible may very well be one of the best; that is precisely why the Kindle edition is such a disappointment.I am an avid Bible student, having several paper copies of the Bible in all interpretations-KJV, NRSV, NKJV, etc. Most of these Bibles are heavy but worth every ounce. I thought it would be nice to have a study Bible on my Kindle just so I wouldn't have the weight when carrying it around. Sorry to say, its not going to work as a study Bible--just a straight forward Bible reader which I could have gotten for free and not $19.99.Most of the charts and tables are too small to be read--I have the 7\\" Kindle Touch--I don't believe they would be any bigger on a larger screen--you can make the font for the actual bible text larger but font changes are not applicable to the charts and tables. The maps are even smaller and totally useless. Also, many of the screens have so many cross references and related footnotes, that it leaves you no place to \\"tap\\" for the next screen/or previous screen. Where ever you tap sends you to the footnote or cross reference--then you have to use the table of contents to get back to your original location--a royal pain. Also,with such a small screen you do not get a feel of what study material is associated with what verse/passage.I could go on but it truly will not serve a purpose--just be warned. I am so disappointed, I wish I could return it--I don't believe Amazon has a procedure for this. If you want to do serious Bible study, this is just not the correct media. If you want to do just straight bible reading--then get a free download or certainly a much less expensive one."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"If you purchase one study Bible, let this one be it!

In order to go to an initial passage, you go to the table of contents, then you still have to go to the next page, scroll down, to get to \\"Old Testament\\" or \\"New Testament\\", and then go to the particular book you want to get to. Also once you get to the chapter selection, there is no option to go to a particular verse.When you get to the book and chapter of the Bible that you are searching for, you cannot use the 5-way control to skip to the next chapter, you just have to keep changing to the next page, which is time consuming.This is not what you want to take with you to church, especially if there is a lot of scripture searching----it is just too time consuming to keep up.Other than the tech issues, it is the MacArthur commentary that is helpful for a study Bible.

The only draw back I have is while you are in the bible, it does not give you a header of where you are on chapter & verse. There is a header at beginning of chapters and verse #'s within the verses, But I mean a header to keep track of the chapter you are in. Also when you bookmark or highlight a verse or section, it gives you the location description, not the actual chapter & verse that the bookmark or highlight was saved from. Can this be added to the book? I sincerly hope so."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"Does this personal size Bible have smaller print then a normal Bible? Yes.

It is 6\\" x 8 1/2\\" x 1 7/8\\". The imitation leather cover has a nice feel.I've watched John MacArthur on TV and he is an excellent teacher like none I've ever heard or seen and his study notes are great. I liked this bible so much we just purchased another one for a new believer at our church.This is my first New American Standard Bible translation and I like it. If you like Josh McDowell he has said \\"the NASB is an excellent study tool for the serious student of Scripture. Although it is not as readable as some translations, its accuracy is second to none.\\" He said the translators took painstaking efforts to bring out the distinction between Greek tenses."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"The MacArthur Study Bible is the fourth study Bible I have bought. As others have pointed out, you can see the print on the other side through the page, but I did not find this to be a big problem for me. The one I bought is ISBN 978-0-7180-2508-3, the smaller hardcover edition. Amazon calls it the personal size. The font is small, but there is a large print edition. For me, the thin paper and smaller font also means the book is not so large, and for a Bible that contains so many annotations, I am pleased with the relatively small size and light weight. It is not exactly pocket sized, but it is also not so large that I cannot hold it comfortably. I saw the leather edition at a bookstore and thought it looked quite handsome.With this Bible I am switching from NRSV (New Revised Standard Version) to NKJV (New King James Version). The NRSV seeks to be gender-neutral even when the original text was not. For example, it changes \\"the husband of one wife\\" to \\"married only once\\", which, as I have learned, is a throw-back to the 1946 RSV wording which was fixed in the 1962 edition.I like the fact that the NKJV is an accurate word-for-word translation, not a dumbed-down paraphrase. Note that there is no English translation that is exactly word-for-word, and NKJV is a little less so than the original KJV. It is designed to be more readable than the old 1611 KJV, but is much more than just the 1611 KJV without the thee's and thou's. The translators had access to all the best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts, including the dead sea scrolls, and they indicate in the center column when other Greek manuscripts disagree with the one they used.Regarding MacArthur's notes, they are excellent. I don't always agree with his theology, but his commentary is obviously well researched and often much more in-depth than any other study Bible I have used. Also, he did not come up with the notes all on his own, but had a large staff of seminarians helping him. Every bible commentator has biases, but usually they do not state them up front. The included Overview of Theology gives MacArthur's views on several key topics, so you know exactly where he's coming from.The stated intention of the MacArthur Study Bible is to let \\"the Word of God speak for itself\\". Therefore, there are no \\"life application\\" essays. The notes give you everything you need to understand the text. However, it is left up to you to read the Scriptures and apply them to your life as the Spirit leads. This may not be to the liking of people who want easy answers handed to them without any effort on their part."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I'm not sure it gets any better than this: The Holy Bible rendered in the readable yet reverent New King James Version ... with study notes provided by the inimitable John MacArthur.

However, I have reached a point where I wanted more depth in the commentary. I&#65533;ve been hearing a great deal of good things about the MacArther Bible so I bought one and started reading it.I freely admit that I was impressed, however, there are some problems. As previous reviewers have stated the most grievous problem is the monolithic nature of the commentary. Passages that are hotly debated are settled as a matter of fact. If the reader didn&#65533;t know beforehand they wouldn&#65533;t even be aware that there are other possible explanations on problematic passages.Case in point, in Genesis 6 the &#65533;Sons of God&#65533; are stated that they &#65533;are&#65533; fallen angels who sexually knew mortals. He doesn&#65533;t even acknowledge the other possible answers. In Colossians he &#65533;states&#65533; that Jesus went to Hell and preached or bore witness to his deity to the fallen angels/demons.MacArther is just as single-minded when it comes to his historical facts. I just happened to be Ancient History Instructor so I easily picked up on one very debatable statement. MacArther states that the Pharaoh of the oppression was Thutmose III and that Pharaoh&#65533;s daughter was Hatshepsut. This is not possible Thutmose was the stepson of Hatshepsut and thus the lineage is inverted. Furthermore, most Egyptologist now believe that all the evidence points to Ramses II as the Pharaoh of the Exodus; there is nearly 200 years separating Hatshepsut and Ramses II. Moses was only 80 when he faced Pharaoh.All in all, I think this is a very fine Bible . . . BUT keep in mind all the comments are one man&#65533;s opinion.Pertaining to my own theological bent, I am a Conservative Evangelical."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"Being a Charismatic, Amillinialist, and an Anglican I disagree with John MacArthur about many issues. But here is what I do agree with him on- Man is totally depraved and unable to save himself outside of the grace of God. Jesus Christ is the only way to salvation, and that salvation was purchased on the Cross. The truth of Christ and the Cross can only be understand by faith, which itself is a gift of God's Grace, and faith comes by hearing, and hearing comes by the preaching of the Gospel, which is contained in the God-breathed, infalliable, inerrant Holy Scripture. This study bible is a treasure. All Christians, no matter what your communion or denomination, can learn from a great Spirit filled teacher. Dr. MacArthur has given us a verse-by-verse exposition of the Bible that is filled with theological truth and the love of Jesus. When you disagree with him you respect his opinion, and know there is One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism, One God and Father of us all.There is not a better tool to learn about your Lord, and love him with all your heart, soul, mind and strength. Soli Deo Gloria!"},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"This Bible is a true blessing because of its incredible amount of study notes. The notes are extensive, scholarly, and clarify passages which previously were confusing.

I have this Bible in hard copy so I was excited to learn that it was available for my Kindle but disappointed when it downloaded. I look forward to taking my Kindle out of town. I think the Bible should not be listed as a Study Bible but just a Bible."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"This Bible has been an excellent resource. First, it uses my favorite translation, the New King James Version (NKJV). The NKJV is one of the most accurate translation and at the same time keeps much of the peotic beauty of the KJV. It also notes where different manuscripts are in disagreement.As far as the commentary, it is excellent. Each Book has an excellent introduction which discusses among other things authorship, historical background and theological themes of each book. Throughout the text there are also several timelines and charts which are helpful. The best part though is the commentary on each page which is tipically more than the biblical text, especially in the New Testament. It is true that MacArthur only gives his point of view in the commentary. But, to me that is a plus. I would personally have an author passionately argue their point of view than have an author water down a variety of points of view. The commentary is not inspired as the Biblical text is and should always be looked at critically, no matter who or howmany authors. That said, MacArthur does a masterful job in the commentary and while I do not always agree with him I can always count on him for additional insight."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"This study Bible is by far the best I have ever used. It has an uncommonly large quantity of notes that do not merely interpret verses, but give excellent historical, linguistic, and necessary background that provide a more thorough understanding of the Bible. In addition to its valuable notes, it contains everything a study Bible should have (maps, concordance, etc.), and the New King James version is an excellent translation to study with."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I own many Study bibles and thousands of dollars worth of commentaries by many authors. John MacArthur has neatly and efficiently provided the information you need to know concerning scripture. No other bible that I have seen can compare to this exhaustive work and has to be at the top of the ladder, perhaps stated more accurately, in a class by itself. The scholarship is outstanding, yet easy to understand. No serious bible student would miss out on owning this gem."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I write in reply to all who criticise MacArthur's work as being one-sided in his commentaries. Well, they are right; but so is MacArthur.He is, after all, one man, a very enlightened one though, giving his point of view. That's why it's called the MacArthur Study Bible and not \\"Bruce/Henry/Sproul/Hodge/Wesley/Prince/Wycliffe and so forth\\" Study Bible. This is a one-man's effort study Bible, understand and accept that, if you will, and you will find this quite a good Bible overall.There exist other study Bibles that are written by a panel of scholars, which give all or many viewpoints without taking or advocating a standpoint. A very good example would be the NIV or NASB Study Bible, which is one of the most neutral. The NKJV or formally Nelson Study Bible comes in a close second. The Interpreter's and HarperCollins are liberal... a study Bible for all tastes and sizes.Why only 4 stars despite it being a very fine study Bible? Well, like everyone else, there are times that I do not always agree with everything that is within and that is just my point of view. That's why I have quite a few study Bibles. But I admire MacArthur for doing exactly what many criticise of him; taking a stand for his convictions. At the same time, I don't expect MacArthur to have a perfect knowledge of the Bible, that would be asking too much, which is beyond the scope and ability of Man."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"The MacArthur Study Bible is one of the best study bibles I have used. I have used a lot of study bibles and this one is far superior if you are looking for one with lots of theological type commentary notes. The only other study bible that comes close as far as commentary notes is the Life Application Bible whose notes are not as in depth into doctrine and theology as MacArthur's notes. I really like the New King James Version that it's is printed in also. I think it a very accurate word for word translation compared to the NIV which is a thought for thought translation. The New King James Version also notes the textual variants between the different original manuscripts better than the NASB. I do feel that the MacArthur's study bible 2 weaknesses are the lack of more detailed maps and the subject index instead of a concordance in the back."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"John MacArthur is so awesome!He is real and he is easy to understand.He says it like it is and he answers all of the deeper questions you have inside."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I really enjoy John MacArthurs teaching and when finding this Bible it captures very good notes of the bible!

The footnotes seem to take up more space than the bible verses themselves so it is very 'weighty', hence the bible is rather thick and heavy, but what would you expect. I like to listen to J MacArthur on the radio. He is an excellent teacher/preacher and I feel his comments are right on with my beliefs. The only other study bible I have looked at, that looks pretty good is the new ESV study bible by crossway (I think). A friend of mine has one and it is similar to the JM study bible but probably has more maps and illustrations. If you like the ESV you might want to consider it."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I thought this was similar to a bible I saw in a book store.

A monumental work at best, this hefty study bible at 2201 pages packs quite a punch and relief from all other unecessary works that give a shallow description and interpretation of the scriptures. I have been enjoying this work for the past 3 years and hopefully for a lifetime. Recently John stated that another edition will be released in the future, hopefully in another translation like the NASB update which i personally prefer."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"This is without question my bible/study bible of choice. One measure by which I guage any study bible is the extent to which it gets one through the really difficult material.Recently, I taught a series of lessons on the book of Daniel. It didn't take me long to realize that the visions and their interpretation were completely over my head. I opened my Macarthur's Study Bible and found the material still difficult. But I was helped much by John Macarthur's notes.This is not the only study bible I own: I own the NIV Study Bible the Nelson Study Bible, the Disciples Study Bible, The Life Application Study Bible, the Ryrie Study Bible (NASB), and finally the Thompson Chain Reference Bible (NKJV).Again, for sheer scope of scholarship and clarity of format, the Macarthur Study Bible is unsurpassed in my experience."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"For those of you who cant decide between NIV and Macarthur study Bibles, I'll give you sufficient reasons as to why you should buy the Macarthur Study instead of the NIV Study Bible.1. The notes are much more explanatory than that of the NIV study.2. There are more useful essays than the NIV study. Plus, theres even a section on the Intertestamental Period in which the NIV study does not include.3. Uses a more word for word translation, that is the NKJV.Drawbacks:Christ's sayings are not in red-letter, but don't get discouraged, the superiority of the notes alone should persuade you to buy a Macarthur instead of the NIV Study."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"Dr. John MacArthur, known as one of America's greatest current expository preachers, has taking great lengths in making a study Bible easy to use and still full of detialed information. The running commentary (notes at the bottom of the pages) is some of the best you will find.The commentaries pick up strength in the New Testament which has much to do with the Christian's soterialogy. The Topical Index section is simply one of the best on the market.Why four stars instead of five? Well, often in his running commentaries he provides only one view. This is especially true in regards to prophecy. His overview on Theology is quite good, but not excellent. Again he provides only one view in regards to eschatology, which is a highly debatable topic. I would have preferred him to present his view,even emphasize it then, add other views that are in the scope of orthodox teaching.All in all, a great study Bible and well worth having."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"For those having trouble accessing the Bible's study features.You can access the study notes by placing the cursor under any underlined verse or underlined letter note. The cursor will automatically switch to the finger pointer icon. When you press the 5-way controller button, the Kindle will take you to the corresponding note or verse link. After you have read the notation press the \\"back\\" button to return to the point where you were originally reading. All of the notes and cross references are there, you simply need to access them by positioning the cursor underneath the highlighted verse and pressing the 5-way button.Here is another hint for accessing the notes and cross references sequentially. After you access the notes for the particular verse you are interested in, you can continue to access commentary for any subsequent verses by simply paging forward (or back). This will allow you to access the notes in the order they appear instead of having to constantly revert back and forth between the actual text and any related notes. Once you have perused the commentary, you can go back to reading the original passage (by pressing the back button to take you where you last were in the text) without the constant interruption flipping back and forth for every highlighted verse note.This NKJV on the Kindle is very readable and has replaced my leather bound Wesley Study Bible as my main edition. I own four or five Kindle Bibles and this is the most comprehensive and easiest to read.Another Kindle feature that I find quite helpful with this \\"study\\" Bible is the ability to highlight and save passages. This allows you to select those scriptural passages that are especially inspiring to you and to have them handy in one place. The Kindle organizes your highlighted text in the same order as the text appears in the Bible itself. So after a period of time, you will find that you have amassed quite a collection of inspirational quotes from your reading. These quotes can serve as a very effective and convenient daily devotional, easy to access in one place so as to avoid first finding and then flipping to and between actual pages in the Biblical text."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"Pastor John has truely made what seems to be the best Study Bible available on the planet. No wonder it is the number one best-selling Study Bible in the USA. His notes are practical and reliable interpretations of the Scriptures because they are not based upon some pre-conceived notions or rigid traditional beliefs. They are based upon logical interpretation within the Scripture's context. Pastor John makes exegesis on a passage only after he has gone through ALL the rest of the Bible to make sure he is right - and even after that, he repeats the process to make sure he did not miss anything the first time. His interpretations are reliable because they are based upon other passages of Scripture which agree. Cross-references are throughout the Study Notes- and tables, charts, graphs, maps, and even an explanation of the character of genuine saving faith are all included. There is a guide to studying the Bible and it is not some denominationally dogmatic confession - but a simple, reasonable approach to studying God's inspired, inerrant, eternal Word. It is not a question of whether or not this book should be read and used by a Christ-loving Protestant, but whether he should buy it bound in black or burgundy leather."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I am very pleased with my Macarthur study bible, it was given to me as a birthday present from my wife and daughter. I find the content in the study notes to be very accurate. It is the bible of choice for me, I carry it everywhere, and refer anyone who is interested in a great bible to buy this one.

Even so, it's a glaring lack that MacArthur's does not have a concordance (something even mere reference Bibles often include), and his not-so-user-friendly mini-Topical Index doesn't compensate for it--if I want to do a topical study, I use crossreferences or pull out a topical Bible, either Naves's or MacArthur's own that expands on this Bible's index."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"Honestly, if you can, buy the print version.I've had it for years, and it is absolutely fabulous. In fact, I loved the MacArthur Study Bible so much that I wanted an edition that I could carry around with me, since my original MacArthur Study Bible is HUGE and heavy (not exactly something that would fit inside a stylish purse!).So, I thought a Kindle version would be the perfect solution. Unfortunately, I've found the digital format to be horrible. The beauty and value of the MacArthur Study Bible is in the footnotes that give interpretations, information, etc. I felt the Kindle version makes these footnotes more difficult to access, and breaks up the flow of study when you try to access them.Plus, this is sold as an updated version, and as several reviewers have pointed out, it isn't really.I guess if the Kindle version was priced differently, I might be more inclined to be forgiving. However, at $21.99 for the Kindle version, and $26.39 for the hardcover print edition, I would definitely say the Kindle edition is not worth the investment."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"As a minister, overall, I've enjoyed studying the MacArthur NKJV Study Bible. There are those times that the commentary has nothing to do with the verse in question. I've learned to overlook this. I do not like the Topical Index at all. It is difficult to find specific Bible references. I would much prefer a Concordance.I have had my MacArthur NKJV Study Bible since it came on market. I must say that the publisher could have done a better job in putting the book together. The glue on the book's binding is not that good. The book cover has been working loose for years and is coming apart at the edges. Be ready to use a good glue to make repairs. Otherwise, expect pages to start falling out if you give the Bible much use. Also, this book is not intended to be held by those whose muscles are failing. It could be quite heavy for them. In spite of these shortcomings, I would recommend this book for serious Bible students."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"This is the second MacArthur study bible I've ordered from this seller.

After reading the study notes I have a much deeper and richer understanding of Scripture and with all the distractions of the world today I need to constantly seek after those who do not distort Gods Word with false doctrine. I now use the NKJV MacArthur Study Bible along with the Matthew Henry commentary and the Thru the Bible commentary by J Vernon McGee. All 3 complement one another and each in their own unique way give a clear and vivid picture of Gods will for our lives.The only negative is that the ink isn't as dark as I would like it, but after the first few weeks I now hardly even notice."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"The MacArthur Study Bible: Revised & Updated Edition, is my first, ever, study bible. So since it's my first, I have nothing to compare it to. One thing I noticed on the description of this study bible before I purchased it, was that it stated that there are notes on virtually every verse. I don't know if this is uncommon with other study bibles but, with this one, it is as advertised! And, for the most part, they are very helpful, informative and even sometimes, interesting. The main point, to me anyway, is that it's not watered down. MacArthur isn't shy about teaching doctrinal truth and making a point that if you don't have a relationship with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, then you're probably not going to get much out of reading the Bible, much less, studying it. So, for this being my first study bible (I have my eye on The Apologetics Study Bible)The Apologetics Study Bible: Understand Why You Believeit has answered any question that I've had so far, and I've just to begin exploring the Bible in this new light.

As well, there are no considerations that to understand the message of the Bible we should understand the culture in which the Bible has been written, the aims of its being written, etc. These considerations would undermine several interpretative claim.

Other than that the explanation of certain passages is good."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"Maybe I'm crazy but I can't quite agree with the rest of the comments about the quality of this study Bible. MacArthur misreads the Bible in quite a few areas that and as a result some of his study notes are horribly misguided. For example, in Isiah Chap. 19 he ignores history to make the outrageous claim that not only will Israel be &quot;saved&quot; at the Second Coming, but so will Egypt and Assyria!!! This was certainly news to me which I quickly discarded in the trash can where this misfounded idea belongs. Also, the &quot;many&quot; maps in this Bible are almost completely useless. Instead of MacArthur's study notes, stick to the classics like Matthew Henry's Commentary or Halley's Bible Handbook."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"The review below is how I feel about this product, and I apologize to those who may feel offended by any of my views. All this is is my opinion, nothing more.This study Bible exemplifies very poor exegesis, and in my opinion almost entirely driven by one person's desire to validate a lot of his own personal beliefs. The examples are too many to discuss, just look over some of the pages here on Amazon. I am very surprised that this has got that many positive reviews. There's a phenomenon when the audience buys a literary / art / film product if it reinforces their already existing beliefs. The product is bought mostly because people find deep satisfaction in having their existing beliefs revalidated from yet another source. Passion of the Christ's box office stands as a great example of this phenomenon.Anyway, moving on. The notes for the Gospels and the Acts are marked with an unbelief in God's power for today. I don't belong to any denomination, yet to me believing that God's power ended 2000 years ago borders on REAL heresy. So now God is powerless except for soul salvation which will materialize upon one's physical death, is that it? What about this life? Sounds a lot like the communists telling people that they have to work their tails off for the glory of the Communist Party and live like animals in this life, so that their children's children live to see the real communism. I thought God's kingdom starts right now, in one's heart, and not only when one's physical body dies.It's almost like the author tries to validate their own powerless Christianity with this, just like I see other dispensationalists do. Albeit this author is much more militant about his beliefs, as compared to others in his camp.When I looked deeper into Mr. MacArthur's ministry, I can't believe that Mr. MacArthur spends that much time battling fellow Christians that don't believe the same way he does, when instead Jesus called for unity of all who believe in Him. And I thought that if we battle something, we are to battle not flesh and blood, but spiritual powers of wickedness.I am just pondering, How can I trust someone who professes Jesus as the Christ, yet spends so much time attacking his brothers in Christ so viciously? Why destroy, why not spend that time building instead? Another MacArthur, another witchhunt, so sad ...\\"Let not many of you be teachers ...\\" comes to mind. I don't doubt the authors sincerity. But however much talent a teacher has, what good is it if their attitude toward brothers and sisters in Christ is imbued with venom, and a large portion of their teaching is plain flawed?! You can't adopt the author's mindset if you want to ask God \\"God, what are you really like? I put my preconceived ideas about you at your feet. Reveal yourself to me. If I have to change my beliefs as your revelation comes - I will do that.\\" What I feel to be Mr MacArthur's motto is \\"God, I believe this and this about you. Now, am I right or am I right?\\""},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"Macarthur seems to expect us to follow his interpretation of the Word simply because he... says so!

Slavation comes through calling on the name of the Lord...not from being baptized.\\" Owen Olbricht, in his book \\"Baptism: A Response of Faith,\\" has this response for MacArthur: \\"If the phrase is incorrectly placed, then almost every Bible that has been printed is grammatically incorrect for all of them place 'calling on the name of the Lord' after baptism, not before, as also does the Greek text in all manuscripts.\\" MacArthur, if you are reading this, let your embarrassment not be turned into anger, rather let this moment make you turn unto God with repentance and then be baptized in order to have your sins be forgiven (washed away). For the reader, it is best to have on hand the 2000 edition of Bauer's lexicon as well as Friberg's 2000 edition lexicon - that way you may see through the smokescreen of the likes of MacArthur and others of the same guild."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"This bible couldve been a wonderful study tool if Macarthur hadn't have been a calvinist.

Why? The title Son refers to Jesus Christ in His incarnation. Christ did not become the Son until He was begotten into time.\\"http://www.atruechurch.info/macarthur.htmlThe Nicene CreedI believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by whom all things were made; who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified; who spake by the Prophets. And I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.The Athanasian CreedWritten against the Arians.Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith. Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.And the catholic faith is this, that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; Neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one: the glory equal, the majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet they are not three Eternals, but one Eternal. As there are not three Uncreated nor three Incomprehensibles, but one Uncreated and one Incomprehensible. So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Ghost almighty. And yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not three Gods, but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not three Lords, but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by Himself to be God and Lord, So are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say, There be three Gods, or three Lords.The Father is made of none: neither created nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son: neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is before or after other; none is greater or less than another; But the whole three Persons are coeternal together, and coequal: so that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshiped. He, therefore, that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also believe faithfully the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right faith is, that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man; God of the Substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and Man of the substance of His mother, born in the world; Perfect God and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching His manhood; Who, although He be God and Man, yet He is not two, but one Christ: One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking the manhood into God; One altogether; not by confusion of Substance, but by unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and Man is one Christ; Who suffered for our salvation; descended into hell, rose again the third day from the dead; He ascended into heaven; He sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty; from whence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead. At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies, and shall give an account of their own works. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"Great Bible.

I am consistently blown away by his depth and attention to detail when it comes to Scripture. I have a huge amount of respect for what he has to say as he has done his research quite thoroughly. This is one of the best additions to my husband's and my theology library.While my husband and I have been deployed in Iraq this has been an incredible addition to our few personal belongings that we can have with us. We are both avid Bible readers, and during any break at work it's the one thing that calms me down. Granted, I can't take this with me to work as it's too awkward and big, but during my regular Bible reading (of my little Gideons NKJV pocket sized NT Bible) I usually come up with some questions or a particular passage I'd like a deeper understanding of. Once I come home this study Bible is the first thing I open to find the answers to any question I might have.Sometimes there isn't a statement around it and sometimes you have to go searching, but Christians are supposed to labor in the word so it's a joyful puzzle for me to figure out. This Bible reads very well and has the Scripture up top with the information to study below similar to foot notes, but just a LOT of foot notes. There's a short introduction to each book that includes the author, the history, the time period, etc. There are also several chapters that John MacArthur wrote in the beginning and at the end that go into several of the basic questions that he was faced with when writing this. Each of these are well written and thought out with every angle of the question answered. There is also a \\"Read the Bible in a Year\\" schedule which is quite useful.The only complaint I have is that sometimes there is a passage where I can't find much information about it or I'd like more information and it's just a case of there's only so much he could put into a study Bible. It can get very distracting just sitting down and reading this because there is so much information so I've found the best way for me to use this Bible is to read a plain text Bible first, write down questions or a certain passage that I want a better understanding of and then go to JM's study Bible. It's very easy to get distracted with everything he's written that you lose the momentum of just sitting down and reading the Bible.John MacArthur isn't for the light of heart as his depth of understanding creates a very dense amount of information to absorb and meditate on.

His passion for the Biblical truth still burns in him. His Study Bible is far better than all the other Study Bibles to date (including NIV Zondervan Study Bible and New Geneva Study Bible). Here are few reasons:1. It has extensive study notes. This Study Bible has wealth of spiritual and Biblical information. It is practically a verse by verse expostional Study Bible. This alone merits high praise.2. It has practical and devotional challenges. The study notes seem to have a goal in mind: holiness through knowledge of God. This particular element is clearly emphasized throughout the study notes.3. It has useful addtional materials. Aside from maps, introduction and outline to each book of the Bible, it also contains very useful materials, such as: Topical Index, The Character of Genuine Saving Faith, etc.. They are very useful for both personal edification and teaching.NOTE: This Study Bible teaches premillennialism, pre-tribulational rapture, cessasionism and Reformed (in Soteriology). I am Pre-mill, post-trib, non-cessasionist, and Reformed. Despite these differences, I have found this Study Bible better than all others. I liked it so much, I bought it two more and gave them to my friends!"},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"This is a great study Bible. MacArthur presents a great deal of intelligent insights and background information, as well as outlining every chapter in the Bible. The outlines alone are worth the price of the Bible. His beginning-of-book summaries are the best I've seen, covering each book's author and date of writing, historical context, and even exegetical problems and theological issues.About the New King James Version of the Bible: I started off as an NIV user (since that's the first Bible I ever really used). I had always felt the NKJV was sort of a crutch for people who couldn't understand the KJV but couldn't give up their King James forms. When I saw that MacArthur's study Bible was only available in the NKJV, that made me think again. Now I love this translation: it's both accurate and easy to read. I've read the evidence presented by King James Only advocates and, while I respect their sincerity, I am unconvinced that the NKJV is the Enemy's work.For the reviewers who said that MacArthur only presents one point of view: isn't this what's expected? The whole purpose of a study Bible is that the author of that Bible's notes presents his understanding of Biblical passages, which you are then free to accept or reject (obviously, under wise council of other godly people and the control of the Holy Spirit). I have looked at many study Bibles, and they all do exactly that - Ryrie, Scofield, LaHaye, whoever. Does one expect LaHaye to provide evidence for preterism, or Ryrie for so-called \\"Lordship Salvation\\"? I am afraid that when other reviews say \\"he only presents one point of view\\" they really mean \\"he doesn't present MY point of view.\\" Besides, in the beginning-of-book \\"theological issues\\" sections MacArthur at least deals with other points of view, something that most others don't do.A perfect example is the reviewer who mentioned 1 Corinthians 14. Obviously this fellow doesn't agree with MacArthur. Might I hazard a guess that the reviewer is charismatic? MacArthur appears to be a cessationist. But the point is that a study Bible is not the place to cover the issues in detail: if the commentary is not to overwhelm the Biblical text in quantity, probably the best that can be accomplished is to give one point of view. My advice would be to get a good book that covers those types of issues in detail: Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology does a good job of that (while also taking a particular point of view, somewhat different from MacArthur's).I should note that I am not a cessationist nor a dispensationalist myself. I believe Spiritual Gifts are for today and all history. But, unlike another reviewer, to say cessationism \\"borders on REAL heresy\\" is far beyond what can reasonably be concluded from Scripture. \\"Christianity\\" as taught by people such as Charles Capps and Frederick Price, yes: cessationalism, no.In sum, if you're looking for a new Bible that you'll love for years to come, get the MacArthur Study Bible. Whether you agree with everything you read or not (I don't), you will find the notes well thought out and helpful."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"There are two main differences between the old and new NKJV MacArthur Bibles, and both are in the appendices:(1) a CONCORDANCE (125 pages) is added, a glaring lack of the original MacArthur. So now the person who remembers a name or word but not the verse that includes it can look it up in the concordance and get the corresponding verse citation.(2) the TOPICAL INDEX is rearranged for easy look-up. This is a huge improvement, because the previous MacArthur index was not at all user friendly, due to the hard-to-find way the topics were listed. Now the subtopics are classified under 10 clear theological concepts: The Holy Scriptures, God the Father, God the Son, and so on. To illustrate the improvement, previously there was a topic \\"Excellency and Glory of Christ,\\" something I never would have thought to have looked for in those exact terms searching under \\"E,\\" but now if I know I want to look up some attribute of Christ, I can just go to the \\"God the Son\\" section and search the subtopics there.The Topical Index is now called Index to Key Bible Doctrines and is a bit shorter in length than before, and the order of appendix articles is changed, but other than that the Bible notes are the same as far as I can tell, which is mostly good, but in one way bad. My favorite of the retained features are three opening articles that are fantastic for new believers:- Introduction to the Bible- How We Got the Bible- How to Study the BibleWhat's not good is that MacArthur has not changed his explanatory notes to reflect his publicly announced change in position on the Eternal Sonship of Jesus, but with knowledge continues to misrepresent Jesus in that particular area. So though this Bible is \\"revised,\\" if it's \\"updated\\" I'm not seeing it.Of the various NKJV Study Bibles, this one's notes, book intros and outlines, and special features seem most doctrinally helpful. Other NKJV Study Bibles either are more applicationaly than doctrinally focused, skimpy in their notes, or indecisive, offering different interpretations even when the scripture is clear on a matter. Since John MacArthur and his team of Master's Seminary research scholars take well-supported doctrinal stances, the reader is protected from confusion and veering off into erroneous theology.For those who know they want the MacArthur notes but are unsure of which of the two available translation options to get, consider both the pros and cons of the NASB vs NKJV and also visual appearance--that stylistically this revised NKJV has darker print and is without the annoying ornate touches of the NASB (no large shadowy letter \\"M\\"'s for ex). Regarding the translation, both choices are respected word-for-word (\\"literal equivalence\\") type translations, rather than thought-for-thought. Many would say the NASB is more accurate, particularly in Revelation, due to its reliance on older but more recently discovered original language manuscripts. But even if this is so, for some people this slight benefit does not outweigh the beauty of the NKJV, which still sounds much like the KJV minus the archaic language (though there are some more significant changes as well, such as \\"You shall not murder\\" instead of \\"Thou shalt not kill\\"). The NKJV does note when underlying translation manuscripts differ. The MacArthur Study Bible has the notes for serious students and has helpful introductory sections for the new believer. It also makes for a helpful reference tool."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I am a long-time user of the original MacArthur Study Bible and rushed out to get this \\"revised and updated edition\\". Much to my surprise, I found that the only updating and revising is in the back of the bible--the addition of a condcordance (a much needed feature) with some changes in the other appendices in the back. I looked all through the bible itself and could not find any additional notes. (I am not sure how one would improve on the excellent notes, anyway!) The pagination and page layout of the old and new study bible are identical from what I could see. Moral of the story: If you want a MSB, buy the older version (which is discounted at most stores right now) unless getting a concordance is worth the extra $20 bucks or so. Otherwise, the bibles are identical. Oh, and the construction of the binding and pages of the new one are just as bad if not worse than the old bible. Shame on Nelson!If this were a review of the original, I would give it a five for the notes. Since calling this a \\"revision\\" is a little deceptive, I gave it a three."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I have in my personal library about 30 Bibles, many of which are study Bibles. The MacArthur Study Bible stands out as the one that has everything I want in a study Bible. It is based on the New King James Version. I have studied Bible translations for a long time and I find the NKJV to be the most accurate and readable English translation. The NKJV also has the best textual notes of any English version. MacArthur's study notes are very substantial. There are typically more notes on each page than Bible text. This gives the reader serious verse by verse commentary that one can take wherever one goes with this Bible in hand. The notes themselves provide the needed information and research that aid interpretation and application. This Bible also features book introductions, in-text maps and charts, and an outline of theology. The only weakness is that the topical index, though a good idea for a study Bible, fails to use an outline format and just lists all the entries under one heading making it difficult to locate a specific entry. But if you are looking for a study Bible that uses a reliable translation and has sound conservative Evangelical commentary then this is the Bible for you."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"The MacArthur Study Bible is by far the best study Bible on the market. I own several study Bibles (NIV Study Bible, Life Application Study Bible, Old Scofield Study Bible, Thompson Chain Reference Study Bible, Nelson's King James Study Bible, Praise and Worship Study Bible, The Comparative Study Bible, etc.). I can say, without a doubt, that the notes in the MacArthur Study Bible are the finest to be found anywhere. When studying a particular passage of scripture in various commentaries (e.g. The NIV Bible Commentary [i.e., the condensation of the Expositor's Bible Commentary], Tyndale NT Commentaries, Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible, and the Believer's Bible Commentary), I often find that MacArthur's treatment (in his study Bible) is more detailed!! In all cases, MacArthur reaches a sound conclusion. I have yet to find any theologically unsound teaching in this Bible. MacArthur expounds the Word the way it was meant to be expounded - with clarity, with scholarship, and with a belief in the infallibility of God's inspired Word. Everything in this Bible is top notch. In addition to the abundance of commentary, many other helps are found, e.g. a section on &quot;How We Got The Bible,&quot; a section on &quot;How to Study The Bible,&quot; wonderful chronological charts, a section entitled &quot;Overview of Theology,&quot; etc., etc.. In short, the MacArthur Study Bible has everything other study Bibles (i.e., the ones mentioned above) have, plus more! Additionally, the actual page layout is quite appealing to the eye -- unlike some study Bibles. Also, the book introductions are among the best I have seen.The New King James Version is an excellent translation. Serious students of the Bible will find the marginal manuscript variation notes invaluable!I would give the MacArthur Study Bible an unconditionable recommendation to anyone looking for a study Bible giving a detailed treatment of the Word."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"Using the word for word accuracy of the NKJV Version of the Bible, this scholarly work of popular Bible expositor and pastor, John MacArthur, is destined to be a classic in its genre.As a study Bible, it aids the reader to understand the biblical text better with its unique feature that sets it apart from most Study Bibles - the over 20,000 study notes along side the text that explains and expound on almost every verse of the Bible! This is the diligent work of over 28 years of faithful expository preaching of the Bible at Grace Community Church - the home church of John MacArthur.This reveals the passionate devotion of the author in faithful exposition of the Word, verse by verse. Though unashamedly biased towards the Reformed tradition, (as compared to more objectively-oriented Bibles like the NIV Study Bible and Nelson Study Bible), this work is among the best in its ability to aid people in understanding God's Word better.Its cross-references are useful in supporting the interpretation of passages, using Scripture to interpret Scripture. It has thorough outlines of each book of the Bible (each outline is very thorough in its treatment of the authorship, date and setting, background and interpretative challenges)which are indefinitely more elaborate than most study Bibles like Ryrie, Scofield, Thompson Chain Reference, Spirit Filled Life, New Geneva, etc.It also includes an introduction to the Bible, an article on how to study the Bible, harmony of the Gospels as well as the books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles, chronological outline of the progression of Scripture, 12-page outline of systematic theology, a 200-page topical index, and over 20 bible maps, etc..all organized into a huge 2150 ++ over pages!Truly an outstanding work that will set standards for ages to come. One of the most comprehensive Study Bibles so far in my collection!If you are a zealous student of the Word, this Bible is for you!"},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I purchased this Kindle edition because I wanted a NKJV to go with my new K3.I downloaded sample versions of both the MacArthur version and Thomas Nielson's \\"The NKJV Study Bible\\" version. The thing I didn't like about the Nielson Kindle edition is it included word studies and articles in the middle of the Biblical text (e.g, in between verses 2 and 3 of Genesis 1, the passage broke and you had to read the article or page forward through it).In the MacArthur version, it appears all the commentary and cross-references are handled via clicks where it opens a different location. Unfortunately, the sample versions of both Bibles don't support this feature, but the full-version does.The missing thing for the Kindle edition is a way to jump directly to a book, chapter, verse. You can get their by going to the Table of Contents each time, but it is a bit laborious to click through all that.If I counted correctly, it takes nine buttons/clicks to get to the Old Testament using the ToC approach. If you use the Location approach and just remember the OT Index is at location 85, you can get there in six clicks. Either way it is a little slow."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"The MacArthur Study Bible is an extremely thorough and researched study Bible. His many study notes brake down individual verses and words of the Bible to the most minute detail. For me, this has been a blessing and a curse. Also, be advised that are many words in his study notes that are difficult for the average reader to decipher. Such as simile, volitional, seminally, efficacy, inviolable, corollary, familial, cacophony, penitent, libertinism, recalcitrant, licentiousness, libation, soteriologically, and militates to name a few. Keep a dictionary nearby! This is definitely not a study Bible for beginners. But for those more learned, it is an immense and impressive work. Remember also that his many thousands of interpretative notes are his and his alone. I have the genuine leather edition and it is by far the most beautiful study Bible I own."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"John MacArthur has provided outstanding study helps, with: 1. the New King James Version (NKJV) text, one of the most &quot;accurate, beautiful, and complete&quot; bible translations; 2. 20,000 study notes! 3. comprehensive bible introduction; 4. thorough book introductions and outlines; 5. outline of basic theology; 6. 200-pg topical index; 7. bible archaeology; 8. maps; 9. comprehensive timelines; 10. book harmonies; and, many other impressive helps!The only detraction from this otherwise outstanding study bible is the lack of a concordance. Including a concise concordance would be of immense help, and that may be something the publishers would want to include in the next edition. In any case, a truly excellent and outstanding work, and I very highly recommend it for every Christian!"},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"Love this Bible!

I like my study bibles and commentaries separate."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"The McArthur Topical Study Bible is an excellent tool for students of the Bible who are preparing for sermons or who are plainly looking for passages on the Bible regarding certain topics. John F. McArthur, a well-known Bible enthusiast, presents an innovation on Topical Concordances by including the direct passages themselves on the text (which merits its title, Topical Study Bible, rather than Topical Concordance). This feature saves a lot of time and makes immediately accessible the particular verse that a serious student of the Bible needs. Ideal for Bible studies and for Pastors preparing sermons."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I will not fault this Bible's notes and study helps.

Would you want your name and work sullied by these profit mongers who charge these prices for a substandard product? Money..money money..is the god of this world.

No two people can be expected to agree on every interpretive question in the Bible, but this Study Bible provides a faithful exposition of the entire text of the Bible by one of Evangelicalism's finest scholars and pastors.

He clearly knows his stuff within his tradition (Reformed / Conservative), but doctrines and viewpoints which Christians can (and do) reasonably disagree on get little or no coverage; deliberately I think.So I would call this study Bible &quot;infuriatingly excellent&quot;. Excellent in what it *does* cover, but woefully lacking in what it does not. Readers with no previous knowledge or experience could easily come away thinking (as MacArthur does) that certain difficult passages are perfectly clear, when in fact, believers continue to wrestle with alternate meanings.I think a study Bible should point out passages that have generated disagreement... perhaps defending one viewpoint, but at least giving other views a hearing. I suspect that John MacArthur believes that there are enough even-handed study Bibles on the market already. But since MacArthur rarely seems to mention alternate interpretations, I would recommend other Study Bibles ahead of this one: my personal favorites are The Nelson Study Bible (NKJV) for a conservative viewpoint, and the New Interpreter's Study Bible (NRSV) for a more liberal point of view. Both are excellent and fairly even-handed... the Nelson being often overlooked, and perhaps the best single Study Bible around... i.e. if you can only have ONE, I think the Nelson Study Bible may be the best choice overall."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"This author is extraordinary with an extraordinary knowledge and talent for putting it in writting."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"The product description says \\"Dr. John MacArthur has compiled more than 20,000 study notes\\" however, they are not available in the Kindle version, so that's a false statement.

I've been studying it for about a month now and I find the chapter previews very helpful.I've been reading a chapter, then reading the notes for the chapter while the text is still fresh in my mind. This has greatly increased my understanding of scripture and I find I can hardly put the bible down. I look forward to the next time I get to read/study.John summarizes the theology that he holds to in an end section so you know where he's coming from and can compare notes.Most importantly, the bible is a picture of Jesus Christ, God's redemptive plan for man, and how to ultimately glorify God. John has included a section on what the bible says about how to have genuine saving faith. For those that don't have it, you can get it. For those in doubt, you can erase those doubts.If you don't have this bible, at the least you are not making the most use of you time and at the most, you're missing Gods message to you.John's has spent approx 30 years, 30 hours per week studying scripture so he can preach/teach at the church he pastors in CA. You can benefit from this investment he has made.I have no connection with John MacArthur's ministry of &quot;Grace To You&quot; other than I've been greatly benefited by it and have grown spiritually since I began supporting his ministry. I strongly recommend this bible as well as his other literary works."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"The MacArthur Study Bible comes in 2 different translations: New King James Version (NKJV) and New American Standard/New American Standard Bible (NAS/NASB). Either translation is good- it is just a matter of preference as these 2 translations are generally recognized by Bible Scholars both to be highly accurate and thus suitable for serious Bible study. Of these 2 translations, I chose the NAS/NASB version of this Study Bible.Of all of the Study Bibles I have used, this is the best one. The verse footnote commentary by John MacArthur is very useful and insightful, while studying the Word. It has helped me to understand many verses and passages, especially the difficult to understand ones, such as Revelation 7:9-17. This Bible contains a very good and comprehensive concordance, which many Bibles lack. In addition, it has very good color maps of the Holy Land and the Land of Israel from ancient times to present, giving the reader a good understanding of the geography of the places mentioned in the Bible.Overall, I would highly recommend this Study Bible for anyone who would like to study The Word and grow with their Relationship with Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I usually use study Bibles that were put together by a team of scholars so that you are not getting just one man's opinion. But of all the study Bibles that were prepared by one person, MacArthur's is probably the best. It's not because of his dispensational premillenial viewpoint, it's because his comments are right to the point of what the verse actually means. Even the shorter comments usually provide something to chew on.You will also love MacArthur's maps and his charts. I usually find myself agreeing with the notes, although I took issue with his interpretation of Daniel 9:24-27 and of one or two of the beatitudes (a passage of scripture I am currently preaching through).I used to regret that this study Bible was only available with the New King James Bible, but now you can get it on CD-Rom or in a new incarnation (The Macarthur Bible Commentary).This is one of the better study Bibles available and it contains the fruit of John Macarthur's 30 years of studying the Bible for more than 30 hours a week."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"No doubt, an excellent Bible and commentary.

This study Bible answers most of the questions of the serious Bible student. It is loaded with charts, graphs, maps, as well an a detailed introduction to each of the 66 books of the Bible. Each page has the Biblical text as well as many (almost 25,000 in all) useful footnotes. It also contains a &quot;Harmony of the Gospels&quot; as well as an extensive &quot;Topical Index&quot; This is a must for anyone truly interested in learning what the Bible says and what it means by what it says. The MacArthur Study Bible is Scholarly,yet very readable. It is very &quot;user Friendly.&quot; This is a wealth of information in a single volume.

For one thing the font is too light and too small. There are way too many unnecessary Study notes explaining every word over and over.. I wont be negative on MacArthurs notes themselve because good or bad one should dig deaper for answers if he is unsure.. It is good to compare different study notes from one point of view to the next but as far as reading this Bible I got a headache after reading 2 pages. maybe I should blame the publisher.

I have read many of his books and listened to many of his sermons. Naturally, I am going to love his study bible. He is as solid as a rock, truth bound teacher. I have no complaints with the content. We purchased this bible approx. 1 1/2 to 2 years ago and it is literally falling apart. The text block has come loose from the binding, the first few pages have separated, and the corners have come untucked and frayed. I am extremely disappointed. I have had a number of bibles for years and they have withstood many, many more years. I have not abused this bible at all. I carry it to church and I use it daily in my personal study. I have taken it to our local bookstore and was advised that this should not be happening to a genuine leather bible and to have it restored would cost more than the bible itself. I would hate to steer you away from the teachings of Dr. MacArthur so I would advise you to not buy the leather bound from Thomas Nelson but spend less and buy the hardback, perhaps it will last longer."},{"Title":"The Macarthur Study Bible ~ New King James Version (NKJV)","review":"I have used this study Bible for years and I love it!

We wanted to provide American readers with a comprehensive introduction to Green political thought, both in West Germany and in its global manifestations, as we hoped that the book would inspire American activists to form a Green movement in this country.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"'Visionary/holistic Greens' have as their central concern and guiding principle the evolution of a new society based on ways of thinking and being that reflect the interconnectedness of all phenomena... Eco-Greens ... focus their efforts primarily on protecting the natural world from toxic wastes, radiation, pollution, and other hazards...

Even a single star emits light; with this work, O'Neil De Noux bends time, space and reality as we know it such that the reader is left groping in the dark praying for a quick end. Specific Intent is an attempt to tell the tragic but true story of a young girl's murder and the subsequent arrest and prosecution of a couple from Louisiana. Newspapers and television, in and around New Orleans, covered this story extensively during the Summer and Fall of 1985 and it is infamous in that area. Unfortunately, the book does nothing to examine the many conflicting reports that swirled around the suspects at the time but instead weaves a tangled web of lurid details and bizarre theories such that the reader is left ensnared and depleated. De Noux makes much of his inside sources and police connections. He attempts to shore up his rickety construction but, by the end of the book, one is painfully aware that the author is but a shill for the broken system which he celebrates."},{"Title":"Specific Intent: The Chilling True Story of a Sex-Fuled Orgy of Multiple Murder in the Swamps Outside New Orleans!","review":"I can not believe the things people do in this world.How dare the author of this book write about a little girl and what happen to her.I am that little girl's big sister (Jodee) and have alot more than 1000 words to say about this.I feel that it is no one's business on what happen to Nichole.

When this baby hippo was found, he was alone on a coral reef. Although he was only 2 feet tall, he already weighed over 600lbs, which made rescuing him extremely difficult. A brave visitor names Owen Sobien was instrumental in saving Owen, and because of that is how Owen got his name.Unable to survive on his own, and since he would be seen as an intruder if he were to be placed in pods with other hippo families, it was decided that Owen should be transferred to an animal sanctuary in Mombasa. Owen was exhausted from the long trip, however when placed at the sanctuary, he was immediately drawn to Mzee, a 130 year old tortoise. The two soon began to eat together, swim together and sleep together as well. Wildlife experts still remain puzzled by this unlikely friendship.Owen and Mzee is an inspiring true story about finding a lasting friendship, when and where one least expects it. The story is a true testament to the fact that when tragedy strikes, the best friend just might be one we'd least expect. This is such a sweet story, and the photography by Peter Greste is also excellent.

The villagers, originally dismayed by the hippo clan, now work with courage and persistence to save the baby's life.After being rescued Owen is transported to Haller Park, an animal sanctuary outside of Mombasa. Here he meets Mzee (Swahili for \\"wise old man\\") a 130 year old Aldabra tortoise.They become friends, snuggle together, and soon are found to be inseparable.While this is all quite heart warming, the eclectic pairing left me with an odd sense of dissonance.

This is a lovely story that will warm the hearts of children and adults and can be used to illustrate resiliency, the strength of friendship, and how creatures that don't look alike can get along. This book is worth buying for the pictures alone."},{"Title":"Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship","review":"I have to admit I was drawn into this story when I saw it on CNN. This captivating book - aimed toward children but also quite amenable toward any animal lover - describes the true story of a baby hippo named Owen, an inadvertent victim of the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami who was left stranded on a coral reef forever separated from his mother. Taken to a nature reserve to live, Owen meets Mzee, a 130-year old Aldabra tortoise. After some initial resistance from Mzee, the two start to bond, and Mzee becomes the young hippo's protector.This simple friendship story is told by Manhattan-based children's book author Craig Hatkoff and his six-year old daughter Isabella (who drew the adorable pictures at the end of the book), both so entranced by the photo of the two animals lying peacefully next to each other, that they contacted Dr. Paula Kahumbu, the general manager of the reserve, and Kenya-based photojournalist Peter Greste, who had been meticulously chronicling Owen's rescue and resettlement. The subsequent collaboration among the four has produced an intoxicating chronicle of the unlikely friendship that developed between animals with nothing in common but their dependence on each other. The text is not at all cloying but straightforward and factual.Having had the good fortune to see the giant tortoises in the Galapagos Islands and the hippopotamuses along the Masai River in Kenya, I can tell you that such bonding is extraordinary to see in Greste's wonderful photographs. The authors obviously provide life lessons in strength and resilience and ignoring surface differences toward a greater good. Luckily, sentimentality is kept to a minimum, and the result is a charmer. For those interested in keeping up with Owen and Mzee, caretaker Stephen Tuei keeps an online journal of their daily activities on the Lafarge Eco Systems Web site."},{"Title":"Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship","review":"I am simply blown away by everything about this book and story. I have shared this heartwarming story with everyone who will listen. I congratulate Isabella (6 yoa) who had the vision and her father who had the know-how to make this book happen. Regardless of age or gender, you will be astounded by this book; the relationship between the main characters normally just does not happen in nature. But the photos made me a believer. Life is mysterious!"},{"Title":"Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship","review":"This is a wonderful book full of beautiful, adorable photos of Owen the hippo, Mzee the tortoise and the loving people who have helped them. It's ostensibly a children's book, though I myself, age 27, saw it and practically started crying in the bookstore. A truly beautiful story of love and success in the face of dire adversity (the 2004 tsunami) and a pairing you thought you could only find in a Disney movie. This is a great story to read to your kids, students or even just give a glance yourself."},{"Title":"Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship","review":"because Owen, a baby hippo, and Mzee, a 130 year old Aldabra tortoise, who formed a remarkably close bond with each other, have been forever separated by their caretakers at Haller Park ouside Mombasa. This was announced on the LaForge Ecosystems website which was following their progress. The reason for this is that they were moved into quarters with another hippo and another Aldabra turtle. The second hippo got aggressive with the second turtle. Instead of removing her, Owen was taken away from his precious Mzee.I am sure the Park will have far less visitors now. I myself was planning to travel there just to see our two heroes. Now I will no longer visit the caretaker's website. Although I loved the book, the ultimate result has made me very sad. I even cried when I learned about it.The book itself is a joy to read if you can forget the final outcome. Photographs are astonishing and beautiful (taken by BBC photo-journalist Peter Greste). The text by Craig Hatkoff and Dr. Paula Kahumbu is perfect, and several precious drawings are included by six year old Isabella Hatkoff on the endpapers. Even a sweet, brief testimony about the wonder of this book by Caroline Kennedy is included on the back book jacket cover, underneath a photograph of Owen and Mzee dining on leaves. None of us knew how short a time they had left together."},{"Title":"Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship","review":"This story of unconditional love is the perfect book ot have in your house or read to a class. Children are always more open to learning lessons of humanity when it is presented by less initmidating characters such as, a tortoise and a hippo. The book is engaging and chock full of facts, making it fun and educational. If your child loves tortoises, I also recommend A Boy And A Turtle. The colorful and adorable characters in this book will introduce your child to relaxation. What a concept, children being exposed to compassion, unconditional love for self and others and relaxation."},{"Title":"Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship","review":"This book was soooo sweet.

I bought it for my husband and he loved it as much as our 7 year old!"},{"Title":"Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship","review":"Owen and Mzee is a story about a giant tortoise and a baby hippopotamus who found each other after the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia. The book tells about how Owen lived before the tsunami, then mentions the devastating waves -- but not in a way that would be frightening to small children. It goes on to mention how Owen found Mzee and attached to him as if the tortoise was his own mother. Older children will appreciate the deeper meaning of the tale: that even though they are very different, Owen and Mzee became friends. Younger children will be fascinated with the photographs of the tortoise and baby hippo as well as their rescuers. One picture, taken from directly in front of both animals, shows them as if they are smiling! It is a truly sweet -- but not sappy -- story that people of all ages will enjoy. My five year old son loves it and I'm sure we will keep this book to pass down to his children someday."},{"Title":"Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship","review":"This is a great picture book of children and adults of any age.

(Thanks to CNN)."},{"Title":"Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship","review":"The beautiful story of tortoise and hippo is, honestly, rather botched here by inconsistent and infrequent photos, and poor writing. The writing meanders back and forth over the fine line of engaging and educational necessary for elementray school level books. The writing is rather poor, the story focuses on inconsequential details, and an opportunity to discuss captivating aspects of the tortoise/hippo relationship are misssed. We should probably fault the editing, because it seems that a decent, if a bit schmaltzy and dreamy, tale was forced, ham-fisted, into educational prose. It's almost painful to read.The story itself is great, and the book is worth having to engage children in a discussion of the pictures. But the photos, too, are not great. The quality is inconsistent, there are too few pictures, and several are repetitive.Get the book, tell your child your own version of the story, and celebrate the friendship of these creatures, which humans have maligned with this mediocre book."},{"Title":"Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship","review":"German friends have an English class and they love to read interesting books - but not fat, small print ones.

They LOVED the book and we then discussed how you can have friends of all ages, colors, nationalities and both male and female friends. Good example of friendship.

My concerns were unfounded. While some of the more complex vocabulary words required explanation, students were captivated by the pictures and story. Each page offers the opportunity for discussion and learning. They were disappointed when time ran out and we were unable to finish the book in one reading.

A unique, awe-inspiring bond of friendship!It is just after the tremendous tsumani of December 2004, near a Kenyan village. There is little hope for the baby hippo who gets separated from his group, and washed ashore--his pod-mates are gone, and he is stuck ashore in a morass of sea grass. In the wake of devastation the villagers turn out to save the animal. It really does take a village to raise the uncooperative 400 pound baby from the shore and into a pick up truck, so he can be transported to a safe place. Dr.Paula Kahumbu and the good folks at the Haller Park Animal Refuge take Owen to his new home, a large enclosure he will share with some small antelopes and a few monkeys, as well as a solitary huge tortoise by the name of Mzee. Immediately the newcomer rushes to the old turtle where he seeks refuge. Mzee get up and walks away. Owen follows. This continues until Mzee finally grows friendlier, and the two become inseparable. They eat together, swim together, and sleep next to each other. Owen snuggles with him and nuzzles his neck, while Mzee stretches it out for more.This is one beautiful book, and I would recommend it to anyone. The photographs are superb and they really tell the story well, along with the nicely written text. I am amazed that a big mammal--a hippo--and a big reptile--a turtle--could actually transend the huge difference in class (not just species) and form such a bond. It sounds like a nice fluffy little children's tale--too good to be true. But, to our delight and inspiration, it is true.

Locals found him the next morning stranded a short distance out in the Indian Ocean. They captured him (despite his fear and resistance) using a strong net and towed him into shore. Since he was too young to have learned to survive on his own and would be attacked as an outsider by other hippo pods, it was decided to take him to a sanctuary within Kenya.There he tried to hide behind Mzee - an estimated 130-year old tortoise believed to have escaped from fishermen who had captured him for food - possibly in a shipwreck. Mzee at first tried to get away from Owen, but gradually accepted him and they began following each other around and eating together.Owen has since been placed into a larger area with other hippos, but the two still are close.

The author, an American journalist, shows how varied the Jewish response to and experience of fascism was in Italy. At one extreme there were Jews who joined the fascist party (and were welcomed into it) at the other extreme there were Jews fighting with the partisans. By describing what happened to five different families, this beautifully written book grips you like a novel and leaves you gasping at man's inhumanity and humanity to his fellow man."},{"Title":"Benevolence and Betrayal: Five Italian Jewish Families Under Fascism","review":"Several readers have suggested that the prose in this book reminds them of Primo Levi, the great humanist scientist who has written poignantly of his own war time experiences. Like his other works, Stille makes the non-fiction read like a novel. He knows just what to stress and what to downplay - in other words, he emphasizes the most important aspects of the &quot;story&quot;.What is so compelling is his &quot;umbrella&quot; approach wherein all components and shades of Italian fascism and Judaism are reviewed. There was a huge difference between the fascism of Italy and Germany despite their apparent political solidarity. The outstanding difference was that German fascism, unlike that of Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy and Croatia was based on not only adoration of the race but specificially subjugation of the Jews. It is difficult to understand some of the decisions made but most of us have never had to face the start life and death choices these families encountered.Stille is also an eminently fair man, one who does not condemn fascism while excusing or praising dictatorships of the Left. He views all forms of state collectivism as inherently evil and this message only increases the force of the narrative. This is yet another work that should be required reading for high school students."},{"Title":"Benevolence and Betrayal: Five Italian Jewish Families Under Fascism","review":"Here's an historical curiosity; apparently Jewish Fascism was a common phenomenon in Italy. Before Nazi influence caused racial laws to be passed in 1938, 1/3 of the ~50,000 Jewish folk in Italy were members of the fascist party. Jewish families often had as much as a 2000 year history in Italy (there was mention of the Jews wanting permission to cry over the tomb of Julius Caesar after his death), and the Italian Jewish experience (at least in the North, in the areas of progressive city-states, rather than Papal states) was one more or less of recent integration with the rest of the Italian people. So they tended to have political views pretty closely following the rest of the populace; or even perhaps more conservative views, such as latin-americans in the U.S. The book follows the lives of five jewish families under fascism. Some were fascist, some antifascist. Some in shades of grey. The stories were quite powerful when they strayed from the nonstandard; most of the Italian Jewish experience of WW-2 was much different from that of other European jews.Americans have a fairly unsophisticated view of WW-2; we mostly think of German and Japanese enemies, and Russian and English allies, and the terrible things which happened to the Jews in Germany, Poland and the Ukraine. There were entire theaters of war which never enter into our consciousness. Most of what happened in Italy and the Balkans is poorly understood.

Ignoring the unsettle-able issue of what Pope Pius XII did or didn't do to help Italian Jews, he instead concentrates on the experiences and fates of five very different Jewish families in various parts of Italy during the 20 years of Fascism, including the last, terrible period of the German occupation.Stille chose his title with care; instances of benevolence and betrayal are woven throughout the stories. There are Christians who risk their lives to save Jewish friends and neighbors; priests and nuns, bishops and cardinals who offer support and sanctuary; stories of Jewish ingenuity and bravery. There are also stories of betrayals on both sides: Christians who betrayed Jews out of greed or anti-Semitism, or in pathetic efforts to save their own or their families' lives. Stille doesn't hesitate to expose Jews who betrayed their own people--a touchy subject many writers would avoid. The result is a book that reveals the complexity of an issue too often over-simplified into Jewish heroes and Italian villains, or heroic Italians and helpless Jews.What makes Stille's book so memorable, however, isn't the author's unusual objectivity; it's the fascinating stories his subjects tell. Stille interviewed many of them, as well as using diaries, letters, published writings and personal papers provided by the families of those no longer living. The book is divided into five sections, one for each family.This is a moving, at times horrifying, but enlightening and engrossing book, full of vivid details of Italian life during a tragic but deeply significant period of Italy's history."},{"Title":"Spiritual Parenting","review":"As a parent, YOU have the amazing opportunity to awaken children to their spiritual potential and help them to blend their sacred life with the material world.Would you like to raise your child in a spiritual way and teach kindness, love, and reverence for all living things?

Everyone's so worked up about the hamster saving its family from a fire. I thought it sounded pretty cool too until I actually read the story. Frankly if I were trapped in a cage and the room was on fire I'd freak out and make a lot of noise too. Especially if there was someone nearby capable of getting me out. It's a pretty big stretch to say the hamster was trying to wake the girl up out of concern for the family's safety.

Cahan describes how Mr. L becomes a successful maker of men's coats, and how L's ex-partner's wife become a very successful real estate entrepreneur. Actual description of how business success has been achieved is rarely shown in novels: it's available here."},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"Jewish bildungsroman has little to recommend it besides its ethnic angle. Unremarkable prose (that has the feel of Dickens, two generations later). Some interesting homoerotic undertones, and the narrator's lack of of self-consciousness may give critics something to consider. But I am not certain that there is any authorial control behind these hiccups. Too long. Probably best left forgotten."},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"I first read this book in the mid-70s when it was assigned as part of an undergrad history course. I devoured it then, rediscovered it ten years later and found I enjoyed it even more on a second reading. Subsequent readings have not diminished my admiration for the novel.&quot;Levinsky&quot; is a rare example of the novel that works both as history and as literature. Cahan's firsthand observations of late 19th century industrial America and of the immigrants' struggles to adapt to life in a new land are compelling in their own right. But this is no mere slice of life realism. Cahan created complex characters who face conflicts beyond the struggle to survive.Cahan's main character, Levinsky, spends the first part of the book struggling to master the Talmud in his village in Russia. Here Cahan introduces us to Levinsky's incisive mind, one that will serve him well when he goes to America and begins to serve a new master: business. In the opening section, Cahan also develops one of several beautifully drawn supporting characters: Levinsky's mother.By novel's end, we realize the irony of the novel's title. On one level, Levinsky's story is a classic tale of rags-to-riches, American-style success. On the other, his story is one of failure to achieve the rich, personal, intellectually stimulating connection with others that he has craved since childhood.This great novel deserves to be on the short list of indispensable American fiction. One seeking to understand the roots of our country would be hard pressed to do better than to read it."},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"I was prompted to buy and read this book by a bookclub-type event, and I am very glad to recommend this novel. Written in 1917 about an era even earlier than that, it is a classic tale of the immigrant experience, the American experience, and the Jewish experience, in the USA. The various pulls of culture, assimilation, poverty, wealth, sex, solitude, religion, secularism, education, and commerce are each subtly examined, so subtly that one doesn't realize until afterwards how much has been packed into a relatively simple story.This Penguin version is the one to buy, it is compact, in readable type, and with a useful preface. Amazon is selling another version in an oversized paperback format--skip that one, it is awkward in size, and with many typos in the text. I actually disposed of that one and repurchased it in the Penguin paperback version."},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"The realism in this novel is astounding. In a true-to-life rags-to-riches story, young David Levinsky grows up poor, yet motivated, in the heart of a small Russian town. A Hasidic Jew with visions beyond the Torah, Talmud, and a studious life, he takes a ship to America to seek his fortune. His rise in corporate America has the power to inspire, to invoke fear, reminiscence, tears. Do not be surprised to find yourself looking within after a particularly well-written, astute paragraph by Cahan, and feeling as if he has written about your own emotions or state of mind -- decades before you were even born! Some of his metaphors, I have found, even describe the way I have thought about the world, and the feeling that you could be there alongside David in his search for wealth, power, women, and ultimately himself (Who am I?) add to the fantasitic realism with which Cahan weaves his story. It is a masterpiece, a novel that deserves to be read worldwide. I am twenty years old, but read the novel when I was 16. I have not read it since, yet recall vivid details and even entire paragraphs which struck me then even as they do now; reconciling parts of the novel to my life comes easily as I experience new things and understand and appreciate even better what the fictional David Levinsky went through. It is classic, a novel for all time. I recommend, in the strongest possible terms, to read it, love it, and enjoy it. I did... and I am a science person."},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"I read this novel the first time in college and am re-reading it now. The social realism dazzled me then, but it's the incisive characterization that strikes me more now. You get a sense of objective social conditions, but a deeper and deeper sense of the main characters' souls as you read further along. Some of the sketches of human emotion sound familiar as something that happened to me yesterday.I believe this helps Cahan make his point, of Levinsky's material accomplishment and spiritual impoverishment. He gradually becomes emptied out, so to speak. He has lost his traditional religion and rejected the socialist substitute for religion. At the beginning, he has little but knows who he is - at the end, he has much but seems a stranger to himself."},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is interested in the history of the Jewish Lower East Side in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is written by an author with intimate knowledge of the time and place. Written in 1917, it is a very captivating and compelling story of an Eastern European Jewish immigrant's plight on The Lower East Side. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"This book gives a solid sense of what it must have felt like to be a Jewish immigrant to New York around the turn of the century. I enjoyed the fact that the book was not only a very interesting adventure, but also a fascinating account of changing class consciousness and socialization to a new society. Kahan's account of what is gained and what is given up in this process allowed me to understand my own ancestors at a deeper level. He writes well in a journalistic style and is constantly providing details about his present that help me to understand the meaning of what was going on."},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"There is an irony in the title. Cahan has a hero rise in wealth and position in the society only to be empty inside. There is a price to his Americanization in the loss in some deep sense of his past source of meaning in life.This is a pioneering tale of American- Jewish Literature. It gives a picture of a world no longer with us.It is clearly and well - written, and if it is not in the category of great Literature, still it is a valuable social document. It is well worth reading especially for those interested in ' immigrant literature'."},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"This is a review meant solely for the audio version of the book. the book itself is very good and i was looking forward to hearing a reading of it as i am a big fan of audio books. i was disappointed to hear that it was just a simple text to speech made by a computer. this was not worth the money and i feel as though i have been taken advantage of. it sounds like a robot reading it and for the price if someone was going to be lazy and use a program they could have spent what i paid for one copy and gotten a realistic sounding program. WARNING LOW QUALITY READING"},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"That basically summarizes this book. Success, in the eyes of the world, can result in personal tragedy.The author, Ab. Cahan, was a fervent socialist and ardent trade-unionist. He wrote this novel in English for a major American magazine, McClure's. At the same time he was the editor of the world's largest Yiddish newspaper, The Jewish Daily Forward. The collected stories were published in book form in 1917.David Levinsky, who is orphaned when his mother is killed by anti-Semitic peasants in his hometown in Russia, makes his way to America. This book is his story, the tale of a man who by hook and crook, makes his way in the world, alone.He learns English, he becomes an American and he also becomes a very wealthy businessman, a factory-owner and big shot. However, he cannot shake his loneliness and desire for a wife and family.Actually, what he really needed was a good psychotherapist but, unfortunately, he was at least thirty years too early for that.I found the book fascinating with its vivid descriptions of life among the Eastern European Jewish New York immigrant population. It reminded me of the work of Horatio Alger, the great American juvenile author who described the trip from rags to riches.Unlike Alger's heroes, however, David Levinsky is hopelessly neurotic.He finds the opportunity for misery in the most fruitful situations. This is a man who, while being a talented businessman, really screws up interpersonal relationships, especially with women to whom he is attracted.If you read the book, which I do recommend, get the Penguin paperback edition as another reviewer suggests. You will be glad that you did. I got mine used since it doesn't seem to be offered new at this time.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Rise of David Levinsky, The","review":"I know this is something of a \\"classic,\\" but readers should be forwarned that in this book, the hero frequents prostitutes and seduces a married woman (actually he tries to seduce three of them). The affair takes up about 50-100 pages with references to it later in the book as well.There are good parts to this book. The very beginning is interesting, and one can find interesting material throughout the book. But at a certain point, the main character starts visiting women of ill repute and starts seducing married women. It was at this point that I started wondering, \\"What kind of person was Abe Cahan if he could write about such matters in such detail? And what kind of morals did Cahan have if he makes this affair seem somewhat wonderful, rather than dastardly?\\"Be forewarned!"},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"My review is intended to refer to both parts of Peter Hofschroer's two-decker history of the events of June-July 1815. Indeed, it is a shame in way that they were published separately, for the events (and Hofschroer's narrative of them) are a seamless unit.Hofschroer has performed an inestimable service by making available, in magnificent detail and fluent English, the story of the Prussian side of the events of June-July 1815. That story has for far too long been glossed over, minimised, almost ignored in English-language histories. Hofschroer has removed for ever the (always slight) excuse given by lack of a good English narrative of the Prussians' deeds. Nothing can take away his achievement in doing that, no matter how flawed his books are (IMHO) by chauvinism, misrepresentation and downright silliness.Hofschroer reveals the new Prussian army's enormous strength of organisation and morale, which enabled it to resume a decisive offensive within 36 hours of its defeat at Ligny, and the formidable tactical grasp of its commanders in the final crisis. Rather than simply falling into line with Wellington's tattered left flank, leaving the French the possibility of withdrawal, the Prussians detached the minimum forces needed to prevent a collapse there, and maintained their drive on the French right rear round Plancenoit. That ground once gained (at terrible cost, for Napoleon knew equally how vital it was) there was no escape for the French as a formed army; their dissolution in rout was the fruit of a brilliant tactical insight ruthlessly executed. But, above all, Hofschroer gives us, for the first time in English, the human voice of the Prussian combatants. We have long been accustomed to the voices of Harris and Kincaid, Marbot and Marcel; now we hear their German contemporaries.With all this wealth of scholarship at his command, Hofschroer had the opportunity to write the first genuinely balanced history of the Waterloo-Paris campaign, recognising the vital contributions of all the Allies. For an Allied victory (not German, not British) it certainly was. Wellington's decision to stand at Waterloo was based on his agreements with Blucher and Gneisenau for Prussian intervention, and the Prussian advance was predicated on Napoleon being pinned in front by the Anglo-Dutch forces. Neither Allied army could have won, and either or both might have been annihilated, without that basic trust and cooperation. Unfortunately, Hofschroer has sunk to the occasion. He seems to be of that mind-set which believes that balance consists of equal and opposing biases; this works fine for crankshafts, less well for history. In his efforts to redress the pro-British bias of Anglophone histories, he veers to an equal extreme of pro-Prussian bias. His industry and judgement in assembling and selecting data are magnificent; his interpretations are all too often openly, sometimes farcically, partisan. It will probably be another generation before someone achieves a genuine synthesis.It seems to me Hofschroer's problem (my categorisation, not his) stems basically from a view, widespread in Germany, of the events of 1813-15 as the spiritual birthplace of modern (i.e. Prussian-led) Germany and the precursor of national unification. This is the German equivalent of Manifest Destiny, and Germans of even mildly nationalist tendencies bristle at any perception that it is being downplayed or marginalised - as it certainly has been in Anglophone histories. This leads him not to follow through on his genuine insight that Prussia and Britain were pursuing quite different war aims in 1815. The Prussians were seeking revenge for defeat and occupation, and the opportunity to resume Frederick the Great's programme of expansion. The British, on the other hand, wanted to restore France as an orderly member of the European family of nations, powerful enough to act as a check to Austrian, Russian - or Prussian - expansionism if necessary. A similar contrast marked the aims of Russia and the western allies regarding Germany in 1945. It also leads him to downplay the shameless behaviour of the Prussians towards their Saxon allies, 20,000 of whom were sent back from the theatre of war, almost on the eve of battle, after Prussian mistreatment drove them to mutiny. Presumably Saxons don't count as Germans in the context of 'German Victory'.The urge to magnify Prussia's glory years also leads Hofschroer into some very silly positions. He snipes persistently at the disbursement of 'British gold' which he seems to believe unfairly attracted Germans who would otherwise have fought for Prussia. One might point out that the British had retained the old-fashioned habit of paying for goods and services received, in contrast to the Prussians who had discovered the attractions of Napoleon's methods of extortion. More to the point, however, without the 'British gold' the non-Prussian German contingents in Belgium would have been another bankrupt farce like the German Corps on the Rhine (eloquently described by Hofschroer himself). Without them the Allied line on Mont St Jean would have been 30% shorter, and Napoleon would have broken through before the Prussians arrived. The silliest assertions of all, however, are those around the alleged 'race to Paris' which Hofschroer dwells on almost obsessively in the second volume. It takes a minimum of two to have a race and there is nothing in Hofschroer's account that indicates the British were competing. I for one decline to believe that the Prussian command, so perceptive in its operational planning, was foolish enough to engage in the sort of steeple-chase Hofschroer describes. A far more plausible interpretation is that the Prussians pressed forward in the hope of taking Paris on the fly, and being brought up short before the northern defences had to wait for the British, who had all the siege guns. Probably Wellington, who (Hofschroer concedes) had far better intelligence sources in Paris, knew all along that would happen, and saw no point in wearing out men and horses to no avail."},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"I suppose any new book on the Waterloo campaign needs an angle. For Hamilton-Williams, of course, it was the (now discredited) accusation against the Sibornes of a &quot;crime against history&quot;. For Hofschroer it is the perceived slighting of the German (Prussian, really) contribution in the campaign by English-speaking authors, and of course various charges against the Duke of Wellington, primarily that that he intentionally misled the Prussians regarding his ability to support them at Ligny; that this contributed to their defeat there; and that he and his admirers subsequently tried to cover this deceit by doctoring the official record. I am all for correcting misconceptions, and I hardly see the Duke as &quot;an infallible, totally virtuous near-deity&quot;, but I just didn't find these claims that compelling.Hofschroer's strategy is basically to interpret every ambiguous piece of evidence in such a way that it supports his case against the Duke. Thus the book reads like a courtroom transcript with the case for the defense deleted. To take one example, consider Hofschroer's treatment of the allied wrangling over how the various minor German contingents would be divided between Wellington and Bluecher. The Prussians try to claim all of these troops for themselves (except the Hanoverians, who have long been part of the British army and are never at issue), but in the end they are outmaneuvered by the wily Wellington with the result that the minor Germans are split roughly 50-50. Hofschroer inflates this to a 2-1 edge for the Brits by including the Hanoverians in the final calculation, and then portrays Wellington's motive in fighting for these German troops at all as merely an effort to gain some future (postwar) advantage. Of course, any decent defense lawyer would note the disingenuousness of the arithmetic, and point out that while postwar advantage may indeed have been a secondary consideration, Wellington's primary concern was most likely simply to field a viable army. Indeed, before this was resolved he was so short of troops that he actually considered importing Portuguese. Hofschroer mentions this, and later notes in passing that Wellington's army would have been painfully small without the Germans, but he doesn't state the obvious conclusion: that the Duke actually needed these troops. Instead, this is just the first in a series of tricks and swindles perpetrated by Wellington on the simple, trusting Prussians. Perfidious Albion!Overall the one-sidedness of the discussion and the author's wounded tone did a lot to spoil this book for me. It's a shame, too, because it does contains a lot of very useful information on the various German armies and contingents, much of which was not previously available in English. I can recommend this book as a very valuable resource on these grounds."},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"This book is a detailed investigation into the events leading up to the great confrontation at Waterloo; specifically the lesser known battles of Quatre Bras and Ligny. In this aspect, the book excels and gives a remarkably clear history of how it all came together.The other aspect of this book, which dominates the last few chapters, is Mr. Hofschroer's assertation that the Duke of Wellington deceived Prince Blucher and the Prussian Command about his intentions to assist the Prussians in the defense of Ligny. Mr. Hofschroer has received much flak for this attack on the beloved Duke, a hero in British history.As a new amateur scholar to this historical period, I think that my mind is a little less inclined to lean one way or another and this too despite my British heritage. Mr. Hofschroer lays out his evidence in convincing and painstaking detail using much German archival material that was not available or was ignored by Anglo-historians.While he makes convincing arguments towards the Duke's deceptions, one can't help feel that the author has an axe to grind with the Anglo supporters. This is reasonable to a degree as it certainly balances the point of view from the Prussian side. At times however, I grew a little weary of his attacks. It is human nature to take sides and Hofschroer is as guilty as anyone.However, all that aside, the evidence he presents in his book is convincing enough to raise questions, if not of the Duke's guilt than certainly of his integrity. Though I am not convinced that the Duke of Wellington deliberately left his allies hanging in the wind, there is something rotten in the state of Belgium. Even to my amateur eyes it is plain that the Duke could not make good on his promises with the actions that he took. No one really knows what his motives were, but it is plain to see, when the evidence is examined through this book, that the Duke of Wellington was not playing with all his cards on the table.I enjoyed the book thoroughly. The evidence was laid out carefully and even the most jaded of readers has to ask themselves questions of the Duke of Wellington and his machinations.I wished the author had provided a bit more detail and insight from the French perspective as well as from others of the Allied cause. This book is not the bible of Quatre Bras/Ligny but in expounding the point of view of the Prussian Army it excels and at the very least raises many intriguing questions as to the Duke of Wellington's motives and intentions. Did he deliberately leave the Prussians to their fate, or did he cover up his strategic mistakes and follies? Read the book, it's a remarkable story."},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"This book along with the second volume &quot; The German Victory&quot; seems to have touched a nerve ending among many readers.The book covers the overall situation in Europe before Waterloo, the fragile coalition between the Allies, the fighting around Carleroi, Franses and of course the dual batlles of Ligny and Quatre Bras. Peter Hofschroer writes almost entirely from a Prussian perspective which is refreshing but at times a little frustrating (as I would have liked a bit more French input). He tries to convince the reader that the Waterloo Campaign was more of a German/Prussian victory than a British one based on the make up and numbers of the Allied forces that actually fought in the campaign. He also pulls no punches on the Duke of Wellington's performance in the opening rounds of the campaign and concludes from the evidence of his research that the Duke deceived his Prussian Allies into fighting at Ligny when he knew he could not offer any support.I enjoyed reading this book which I found to be thoroughly researched and thought provoking and also made good use of maps. Peter Hofschroer has certainly come up with an interesting alternative view point which may polarize the way many people view how the Waterloo Campaign was won."},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"Peter Hofschroer is by no means alone in his effort to set the historical record straight about Waterloo. Alessandro Barbero, professor at Piedmont University, makes it very clear in his book \\"The Battle, a New History of Waterloo,\\" that Wellington was at the brink of being trounced by Napoleon when Bluecher came to his rescue and defeated the French. The British version of this historical battle misrepresents these facts. It celebrates Wellington as the great field marshal who saved Europe, when in fact it was Bluecher's forces that put an end to Napoleon's ambitions of a French dominated continent."},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"My point was that the situation regarding the Hanoverians was qualitatively different than that of the other German states. Hanover had been for 100 years under British rule, and Hanoverians had served with the British army since 1803. Their fate was not at issue during the dispute over who would get the minor German contingents. In Hofschroer's own words: &quot;Prussia clearly wished to bring the armies of the small north German states under her control, excluding Hanover of course,...&quot; (p. 43).I should also have mentioned that in addition to including the Hanoverians in evaluating who &quot;won the battle&quot; for German manpower, he *excludes* from the Prussian side of the ledger some 12,000 Hessians who were in the process of being absorbed by them (p. 55ff). By slipping in a few extras for the Brits and leaving out some for the Prussians, he creates the impression that the outcome was much &quot;worse&quot; for the Prussians than it actually was. You may disagree, but I call this disingenuous.I mentioned this example to illustrate the general style of analysis in the book. Even leaving aside outright distortions (as above), events which are subject to uncertainty are invariably interpreted by Hofschroer so as to show Wellington in the worst possible light. Thus does he build his case.And what about Ligny, anyway? The bottom line is that Wellington did give significant support to Bluecher on the 16th. The Anglo-Allies tied down over 40,000 French troops and prevented Napoleon's planned enveloping attack on the Prussian right, an attack which likely would have resulted in the destruction of the Prussian army and the loss of the entire campaign. Sure Wellington was lucky, but so what? The end result was that the Prussians outnumbered the French by at least 16,000 men at Ligny -- a fact you will have to strain to learn from this book. There, despite this strength advantage and fighting on the defensive, they lost.Now, one might assume that Prussians would have as much inclination as anybody to want to find scapegoats and/or fine tune the official record to cover their own failures. According to Hofschroer, however, it is only the British who were ignoble enough to play this sort of game.Well, I guess it's one solution to the problem of biased historical writing: just write biased, one-sided accounts from all sides. This book is a nice contribution toward achieving this lame sort of &quot;balance.&quot;"},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"This book is strong in its detailing of Prussian action, strong in investigating any mistakes that the British may have made but like most axe-grinders weak in describing anything that upsets his theory.I can name countless examples of minor 'attitude' mistakes which include such delights as Prussia mistaken for Germany ( it is not a foregone conclusion that a greater Germany would form at this point and a lot of the Germans appear to hate Prussia anyhow but of course if the forces were split by country then the author would not be able to produce his tabloid headline to sell his book tsk tsk )A complete refusal to view Prussian attitudes for what they were - example Prussia starts mobilising for war AGAINST Britain,Autstria and France ( because Britain still invlolved against america) 2 days AFTER these 3 make a secret defensive alliance and the author states how horrified Prussia was at this terrible action????? bizarre attitude.French aggression is frequently mentioned yet Napoleon only actually started 2 wars ( however many he 'helped' ) and Prussian eagerness to avenge the 'Sufferings' on their nation are even more frequently mentioned yet its fairly clear that revenge for the embarrasment of losing was more of a motivating factor.The most obvious and regretable part of the book lies in his ignoring of any evidence that counters his claim. A major example lies in his statement that Bourmonts defection made no difference to the campaign as the Prussians knew all Napoleons plans anyway. No mention is made of the fact ( bar a sentance later commenting on Gerards late arrival ) that he commanded the advance division of Gerards corps and his disappearance delayed Gerard almost half a day and that had this defection not occured the early engagement at Gilly would have been lost and Ligny would have started earlier and hence the campaign would probably have been lost. I know Historians should avoid what ifs but this statement is obviously ignored because it removes glory from the magnificent Prussian rear guard action.On a positive note his description of the battles themselves are superb and well written and his destruction of Wellingtons attempts to cover his early mistakes in the campaign that caused the Prussian defeat are well documented and eye-opening ( Wellington shows himself to be almost a good a propagandist as Napoleon ) it is just a shame that his lack of accuracy whenever anything might tarnish the glory of Prussian arms and to quote his own book (replace de Ros with the author ;) )\\"if de Ros's account is inaccurate regarding this final comment, can it be trusted at all\\""},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"This book is controversial and the people who blindly follow that Wellington is a hero who saved Europe from the Corsican ogre will be upset, offended, and write scathing reviews, like some of those above.First, let me say that Mr. Hofschroer has done the research that some accuse him of not doing. As a personal friend of Mr. Hofschroer's and a contributor (finding him materials) towards his efforts in writing this work I have seen copies and comments of those researches for the five years prior to the publication of this book. I cannot say if previous authors looked at those materials, but they surely did not publish what was found in them. In addition, the work is not written from the English perspective, but from the very neglected Prussian perspective of the battle of Ligny. The English army is almost never mentioned and though it was engaged at Quatre-Bras at the time of this battle, that battle is NOT the focus of this book, like every other book on this campaign ever written in English.Hofschroer begins his book with the story of the political struggle between England and the rest of its European allies for the domination of the Dutch-Belgian coast (control of the mouth of the Rhine). He explores the Saxon mutiny, another obscure, yet important event prior to Waterloo.The bulk of the work is a detailed account of the battle of Ligny, which frequenlty describes actions on the company level. It is supported with a complete listing of sources, footnotes, maps, and some illustrations/photographs.Unlike other works published in the last five or so years, it is a legitimate piece of research unfettered by an overindulgence in conspiracy theory, though it does demonstrate that Wellington was less than a gentleman when dealing with the Prussians. Oh, this is not an original theory produced by Mr. Hofschroer, but one that arose about 100 years ago. Hofschroer has, however, dug into mounds of British documents and records to support the contention that Wellington allowed the Prussians to take the first blow so as to soften the next French blow, which fell on the British at Waterloo.George F. Nafziger"},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"Let me state up front that I know Peter, via correspondance, and admire his work. This book will offend many who see the questioning of Wellington's integrity as near-heretical. However, a reader with an open mind will find a lot of new information here to spark his interest. There is much evidence to suggest Peter's work is at least partially correct in its premise, if not wholly so. The controversy and unreasoned attacks on this book (and the author) should be put aside and the thesis that the author presents should be studied on its own merits.Much of the information presented is new to the English-speaking reader. The role of the Prussians in the &quot;100 Days&quot; has often been portrayed in popular histories as being an incidental (at times nearly comical) sideshow to the Wellington-Napoleon clash. This book will show that reality was very much a different matter . The political background, the dispositions of the various armies and the movement of the Anglo-Allied, Prussian and French forces up to and including 16 June 1815 are examined in detail.Unfortunately the main feature of the book has been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Wellington's motivesThe controversy, in reality a minor part of the work, surrounds Wellington's motives in dealing with his Prussian allies. Wellington's famous disparaging remarks about the Prussian deployment at Ligny are shown to be erroneous at best (shown by a careful study of the terrain at Ligny and the dispositions noted by other members of his staff) and the reason behind his remarks are carefully examined. This alone casts doubt on Wellington's veracity, leading one to find the rest of the author's theory compelling.Definitely a must-have for anyone interested in the &quot;100 Days&quot; and the serious student of the Napoleonic Wars. Be warned- you must have an open mind. Those who see Wellington as an infallible, totally virtuous near-deity will be offended."},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"I find some of the comments here laughable. How many books on the Waterloo Campaign have there been in which previously unpublished archive material from Britain, France and the Netherlands has been used? How many have compared the private papers of Wellington with those of Gneisenau and Constant Rebeque? How can anybody who has not done this original research talk about 'misinterpretation of the facts'? It is most unlikely that they know where these archives even are, let alone what is in them.Incidentally, Wellington's private papers have only recently come into the public domain. Until then, the family has ensured that only family friends and relatives have had access so that what is published is favourable to the image of the first Duke that the family want to present. Lady Longford is a relative of the current duke. Any surprise that her biography presents a favourable view?There are those, of course, who think that Wellington was a saint and an honest politician. They should try reading some of his unpublished papers to see how he manipulated the record of Waterloo in his favour.About the funniest comment was that on the one-sided nature of the book.

High recommended"},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"This book has been lauded in some circles for its use of archival material. The author has made numerous public comments extolling the virtues of using material located in archives and in Official Militay Histories of the era.In his introduction the author states that he has made great use of the work of the historian Pflukg-Harttung and that &quot;there are no serious grounds for accusing Harttung of national bias&quot; as his work was written prior to World War One.This of course couldn't be further from the truth and would, if presented at any modern confrences on the nature of &quot;German&quot; historiography get the author laughed out of the hall.There is no doubt that the author has consulted arhival material and this reader has little doubt that the author has reported acuratly what he found in those archives.Alas, that is precisely the problem with this unintentionaly funny book.As numerous historians have pointed out in scholarly works, the Prussian and later German official histories, (as well as those of England, France, Austria and America)all suffered from being used as agit-prop in the service of nationalistic polices and a &quot;blood and iron&quot; glorification of the past.In Prussia and Germany there are numerous cases of historical works on the so-called &quot;wars of liberation&quot; being less than truthful and in some cases being fabricated. In the case of the noted histroian Droysen, his intention to write a work critical of Scharnhorst was censored and blocked by the Prussian miltary establishment.Secrecy laws promulgated by Moltke (the younger)served to weed out anyone and everyone who was not &quot;correct&quot; or who didn't advocate the &quot;proper&quot; views on the prussian army, the German Empire and its history.Pflukg-Harttung wrote for many of the publications used by the German government to advocate its propogandistic and nationalistic views.As one historian recently described official Prussian/German histories that:&quot;amounted to a romantic-heroic history centered on an intuited understanding and vicarious experience of the past.&quot; In other words, German official historians flat-out invented what they didn't know and called it &quot;intution&quot; and &quot;precise method&quot; based on the alleged superiority of their race, nation and systems of study.While usualy excellent when listing topography or orders of battle the official Military Histories and the people who made them are abosultely the last place anyone interested in something aproximating the truth should go.In a nation (Germany)in which the army was a &quot;state within a state&quot; in which strict censorship laws were enforced, in which only those who expressed the &quot;correct&quot; political views were given voice and advancement, both in the military and without, unbiased history was impossible, and Pflukg-Harttung is no exception. The German General Staff, wrote, as another historian said,&quot; History not as it might have been, but as it should have been...&quot;Did Wellington lie to the Prussians? It is a possibility. But, no one reading a book making use of material produced in the nutcracker of nationalism and censorship that was 19th and early 20th centruy Germany will get at the truth behind the accusation.A book that trumpets its sources without checking to see if the sources are completely valid or to what, IF ANY, extent those sources were corrupted by the context in which the were produced, is better used as a doorstop than taking up space on a bookshelf.Self-professed businessmen should stop confusing close proximity to CEOs as an analogous means of understanding the so-called &quot;man management skills&quot; of generals.As they say in the law, &quot;evidence&quot; from the &quot;fruit of the poisoned tree&quot; is invalid. Pflukg-Harttung may or may not have known what he was talking about, but an author who uses Harttung without checking to see why he was allowed to publish his work while others, like Droysen (and still countless others) were censored can't be taken seriously.Sincerely,Charles TalkoffPSSources:Gordan Craig, The Politics of the Prussian Army 1640-1945The persistence of the Old Regime, Arno MayerAnd, esp. for details on the less than honest methods of Official Histories, Antulio J.

It seems we are now being told that he is an amateur historian. That was never my impression, so I did some checking out. I started with a search on this site, amazon.com. Seems he has written a lot of books. Then I looked at an editorial on him in the \\"First Empire\\" magazine that was written in response to similar claims as to his qualifications made by a certain person whose own works have now been shown to be questionable to say the least. Here, it was demonstrated that Hofschr&ouml;er has a BA (Hons) in History from King's, London. Seems he is a qualified historian. Those of us that know King's are aware that it has Britain's leading War Studies Dept. Seems that Hofschroer is a qualified military historian. Looking further in information available in the public domain, I find that Hofschroer has been awarded a medal from the League of Bismarck. That society's object is to further historical understanding, so it seems that certain leading historians think highly of his work. Then I understand Hofschroer has also been awarded a Fellowship of the International Napoleonic Society. More recognition of his work. I also see that articles by him have appeared in \\"War in History\\", a highly respected academic journal whose contributions are refereed. That puts Hofschroer among the leading military historians in the world. Then he has also contributed to the \\"Journal of Society of Army Historical Research\\", another journal that is refereed by leading academics. I also note that he was invited and indeed gave a paper at the Wellington Congress at the University of Southampton in 1998. I have read comments here that question his achievements in his business career, so I ran his name through a search engine to check that up. Yes, he is there. He appears in the press releases of certain companies. Seems he is telling us the truth there are well. As all this information is in the public domain and easy to locate, one questions the motives of his detractors. Their comments are clearly very questionable indeed. A shame their criticisms are so unfounded.As for his book, I am unaware of anything so well researched on the Waterloo Campaign since the general staff histories written before the First World War.

The attention paid to tedious and unenlightening detail is astonishing, particularly in the battle narratives. These are packed with useless trivia which does little to illuminate events. The main items of interest are the more lengthy quotations from after-action reports, but these are sadly few, and there is no attempt at a synthesis that would shed real light on the battles.I did find the bits dealing with the organization of the German contingents and the dispositions and plans of the Allied armies in Belgium to be interesting. However, the treatment of the pre-war situation, and in particular the Congress of Vienna, is far too superficial to be of much value. I realize that it is not the author's intention to cover this exhaustively - indeed, he mainly wants to establish a precedent for Prusso-British antagonism. But even for this limited purpose the discussion is much too brief, particularly as it contains a number of overly-simplistic (if not downright questionable) assertions.I won't comment in detail on the &quot;case&quot; against Wellington, though I will say my general reaction was one of suspicion, due to the rather obvious biases under which the author labors. There is plenty of pro-Prussian and anti-British spin-doctoring, examples of which have been noted by some other reviewers here.

And the person making this claim accuses Hofschr&ouml;er of being disingenuous!We are also being told Wellington did support Bl&uuml;cher at Ligny. Is that really a tenable argument? In fact, was it not the case that when Wellington promised Bl&uuml;cher to support him with 20,000 men at Ligny, he demonstrably knew this not to be possible?

Namely, the idea that works by Harttung, that appear to be about the Middle Ages cannot be subject to the rules of censorship, and the overwhelming system of propoganda in place in official and unofficial historiography of the era, is, absurd.Harttung's work on the Middle Ages was an extension of Ranke's and, like the master, was seriously flawed by censorship and prejudice, as anything else sanctioned (or not) by the those in positions of power.&quot;Right thinking&quot; was rewarded, and &quot;wrong thiking&quot; was punished.Harttung thought &quot;correctly&quot; wrote &quot;correctly&quot; and was rewarded.The facts however, reamin the same: A Prussian &quot;hisatorian&quot; of that era should be handled with thick gloves.A book that uses such work as source material, without taking into account, the social reality of the era, is not to be taken seriously.The validity of Wellington's documents becomes irrelavent outside of the context of the central issue; the validity (or lack of validity)in the author's stated primary source, Harttung.While it is obvious, even to some readers, that Harttung's time outside of Germany meant he was not subject to the strictures in place IN Germany, two points (as previously mentioned - though, apparently ignored)remain viatl. One, the same system of censorship was in place elsewhere (in the US and in Switzerland, etc) and secondly, that Harttung was not educated on Mars, but in the Europe of the 19th century. He worked in that context, lived in that context, and was a man of that context, no matter how unpleasant a reality that may be.A biased &quot;historian&quot; by any other name reads just as poorly.Sincerely,&quot;Another reader&quot;"},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"I suppose it was inevitable that this book would cause some considerable controversy. However, judging by certain of the comments made below, it is a shame that the standard of criticism is so low.Let us start by examining a couple of points made by the &quot;reader from San Francisco&quot;. A shame that he cannot spell Pflugk-Harttung properly, but never mind. Apparently, Pflugk-Harttung wrote for &quot;publications used by the German government to advocate its propagandistic and nationalistic views.&quot; He wrote for many publications, including the Cambridge Modern History. Hmm. Was that used by the German government for its propaganda? He taught at Zurich, in Switzerland. Was that part of Germany? His speciality was medieval history. How much propaganda value was there in that? So we have a man born in Germany, who lived for a time in the US, taught in Switzerland and who wrote for British publications. How much nationalist propaganda was there in his writings? Incidentally, he dismissed the allegations made against Wellington by the likes of Delbr&uuml;ck and Lettow-Vorbeck, so was he following the &quot;official line&quot;?Also, the &quot;reader from California&quot; leads us to believe that somehow the archive material used was somehow &quot;agit-prop&quot; used &quot;in the service of nationalistic policies&quot;, etc. The archive material quoted in this book includes excerpts from Wellington's unpublished papers, Constant Rebecque's journal and previously unpublished letters from M&uuml;ffling. Forgive me for wondering how a sworn enemy of Prussia like Wellington supported German nationalism.Then we have another reviewer who did not find the &quot;claims&quot; made of Wellington's alleged deception of the Prussians &quot;compelling&quot;. Previously unpublished material from various archives not &quot;compelling&quot;? Letters that were &quot;ambiguous&quot;? So when Wellington told Pfuel, he would be able to concentrate his army with 22 hours of receiving the news of the outbreak of hostilities, Hofschr&ouml;er interpreted this ambiguously? Or when Wellington told M&uuml;ffling that his army was marching on the night of 15 June, having just issued orders that would not be received until the next morning, he was not deceiving the Prussians? I see.As for claims that Wellington was some sort of saintly character, an honest politician and a man that never abused his power, those claiming so should take the trouble of reading some of his unpublished papers in the University of Southampton. Until these entered public domain in 1983, the only people that had been allowed access were family friends. No wonder the image given until then was one that was very favourable.To sum up, Hofschr&ouml;er's critics are making unfounded comments and lack the knowledge to make any valid criticisms of this work. Maybe they should go away and do some real research themselves before making such comments.This book is exemplary in the research techniques used, as are all the many books and articles from this author."},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"Pflugk-Harttung's censors must have been busy people. As well as numerous works on other periods, he wrote several substantial books on aspects of the Waterloo Campaign and many articles for various journals. But at least the censors got to travel a lot, which must have made up for having to go through hundreds of thousands of rather boring words.There is an interesting article in the current issue of \\"War in History\\", which mentions Delbr&uuml;ck, one of Pflugk-Harttung's contemporaries - no doubt some would see him as another of those \\"biased \`historians'\\". Delbr&uuml;ck wrote articles in the First World War critical of General Staff policy. I assume his censors were on vacation that day. And what was his reward? He is regarded as one of the leading historians of his period and was an influential person. But wasn't \\"wrong thinking\\" supposed to be punished? Hmm, seems the givers of punishments and rewards missed that one.But to be a little more serious. The \`reader from San Francisco' seems to think that Pflugk-Harttung was a \`primary' source. It is unlikely he has ever read anything written by him. Pflugk-Harttung is a secondary source. His great strength was his frequent reference to primary sources, particularly to archive material. Much of that archive material went missing in the Second World War, so Pflugk-Harttung's quotes from these documents is often all that is left of them. Let me guess - the censors got to the material first and struck out bits from these documents with their little blue pencils. Sorry, slipped back into humour mode there.When is there going to be some sensible criticism of this book? We are now getting into the realms of cloud cuckoo land."},{"Title":"1815 The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras","review":"Finally somebody wrote a book from the extremely neglected non-British point of view on this war. A well-researched work, as is everything from this author. Hopefully French and Dutch authors will write something in English on this war to get the whole picture. There is much damage done to history by the so-called anglophone &quot;experts&quot;, quoting each other over and over. I was not surprised about Wellington. Neither was I impressed with him despite so many books (but only British books). Now I know he was the man not to be trusted. When two armies must cooperate tightly, he failed. He was unable even to beat Ney at Quatre Brass. He lost more men than the French. Just Bluecher stood up and fought, receiving the first and freshest blows from Napoleon himself. Wellington destroyed his reputation himself, so his steps were not surprising: All the tall stories, exaggerating his own role, downplaying the role of Bluecher, hiding some facts., etc. Reader from Texas P.S. One of the readers commenting asked why the Prussians were beaten at Ligny if they were really such heroes according to the author of this book. Dear reader, I have some questions for you. If the British were such heroes, why did they lose more standards than the French at Quatre Brass? Why did Wellington lose more men than Ney? If the British were such heroes, why would they have not stood at Waterloo without very firm assurances from the &quot;cowardly&quot; Prussians that they would arrive with very sufficient force to decide the battle?? I'll help with the answers: none of them alone could even dream to eat Napoleon and they knew this, and agreed to cooperate and to support each other. They made assurances and promises to each other. One of them kept them, the other, well . . . we know now. One thing more. Heroes do not play down the role of friends, allies. Only braggards do that!

To criticize her work because her definition is loosely based on a term which refers to an often nebulous group or phenomenon that is historically impossible to nail down is cheap. As to any criticism of her methodological sloppiness (here in using modern films to exemplify points she makes in her book and draw the reader into the story in an engaging fashion or to show the longevity of historical memory), you ought first to be clear in your examples and then to justify your criticisms for the reader. Your \\"critical\\" review is much sloppier and gives little information besides your negative opinion.One of the purpose of this book is to explore the power of rhetoric and the (lack of) influence women were able to exert in pre-Revolutionary and Revolutionary France. Landes has been criticized for a weak sense of coherency in the way she deals with her text and a lack of hard evidence to back up her claim that the dominant ideology of \\"equality, liberty and fraternity\\" developed and instituted by the \\"bourgeois\\" Republic necessarily limited women. Her evidence is in the weight of rhetoric to influence politics, an important debate in French Revolution historiography, from scholars like Furet and Chartier to historians like Joan Landes. Her methodology is not exactly sloppy and there is little evidence to suggest that she doesn't understand the methodological models she uses. The confusion here must come from that fact that she is combining Habermas' sociological theory with a postmodernist emphasis on the importance of an even more abstract and difficult to document force, the power of language. The result is engaging, but perhaps not always what a casual reader would want. But the problem is not her grasp of these concepts, but her ability to use them together in a convincing manner.Landes book is one of many recent books on women and their role in 18th century French intellectual life and the causes of the radical shift in their involvement. The variety of topics under discussion should make this book interesting for a number of audiences. It should be criticized with more skill and understanding than shown by the previous entry, and history students who read this book should be taught to understand the good points as well as the bad. Certainly the previous criticisms should not \\"invalidate the book as a whole\\" or even keep curious or interested readers from checking out this book. Particularly for people interested in the Enlightenment and influential writings of Old Regime France, this book offers an interesting perspective on the how French people were thinking about political involvement and the role of women even before the Revolution and the change in legal status for male and female subjects."},{"Title":"Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution","review":"I am only including a review because it is clear that this book deserves more than 2 or 3 stars. It is a scholarly work which has been respected and documented in many other historical works in this field, and if it's good enough for professors of history it is sure as hell good enough for the plebeian readers of Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution","review":"Joan Landes' &quot;Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution&quot; consists of several essays loosely united by the theme of women and their place in the &quot;public sphere&quot; of activity during the late 18th century-- and specifically during the French Revolution. This is an important and exciting topic-- and it's one that has not yet been researched to exhaustion.Sadly, Landes' book is flawed in several ways. Some of these flaws are forgiveable, but a few are fatal. One of the most obvious faults of this book has to do with one of its central concept-- the idea of the &quot;public sphere&quot;. Landes specifically states that she is using this term as the philospher Habermas used it in his famous &quot;Public Transformations of the Public Sphere&quot;. However, that is not what she does. Habermas's conception of the public sphere is that the idea of the &quot;public&quot; emerged as a term for referring to the collective sets of feelings arising from private individuals engaged in private activities-- and *NOT* as something that exists in opposition to private interests and activities (which is how Landes uses it). Now, the truth be told-- I don't think it's really a *problem* that Landes uses a different model of the public sphere than Habermas... after all, there's no reason to say that Habermas definition of it is any better than hers. However, the fact of the matter is that Landes claims she really IS using Habermas' model of the public sphere. In other words, it's not that she prefers another model-- it's that she misunderstands the model she's trying to use!While this fact does not necessarily invalidate the whole book, it is, nontheless, a bit troubling. One would think that a scholarly writer should have a good understanding of the theoretical models she is herself using.... and one might start become skeptical of more specific things that writer has to say as a result. In the case of Landes, such skepticism would be well-placed, for there are many more serious, specific problems with this book. I'll not go into them all here, but I'll only cite the most damning, namely that it one of the essays, Landes analyzes two contemporary movies that are set in Revolutionary France-- and she does so in order to bolster her general claims about how politics and gender operated in Revolutionary France. Yes, that's right-- she uses two 20th century movies as if they were primary sources for writing the history of the 18th century. And no, there's no recognition on her part that she's doing anything unusual-- or any attempt to say she's actually writing about the way we today represent the 18th century. She really is trying to use these contemporary films as historical sources, as if they were actual 18th century documents. What's next, using &quot;Braveheart&quot; as a historical source for information on medieval Scotland? That's a kind of error that not even the most amateurish of historians should commit!When alls said and done, the many flaws of this book outweight its merits. Although Landes does have a few insightful things to say about women, the public sphere, and the French revolution, the fact of the matter is that her claims are undermined by her methodological sloppiness. She doesn't fully understand the theoretical models she is using, and she doesn't even seem to know what constitutes a legitimate source of historical information on the eighteenth century and what does not. Still, this book has its merits-- especially as a model to be given to history students as to what *NOT* to do when writing a book."},{"Title":"Flower Power!","review":"Although there isn't an index entry for Jerry's various tonics and sprays, they're almost all there.

The book is organized into sections that enable the reader to have a successful garden if they only take the time to read the book all the way through. But one can also jump around and find solutions to specific problems facing them in their own gardens.Baker's writing style is down home common sense. He advocates using basic materials instread of mass produced herbicides or fertilizers to get gardens growing lushly. He doesn't say if his ways are more economical than using store bought materials (it's hard to justify the price of a 24 pack of beer only to put it all on your flowers), but he does offer up alternative to those who may not want to buy the potentially dangerous fertilizers and weed control chemicals."},{"Title":"FLIGHT OF THE SWAN","review":"Since \\"13 Days of Luck\\" preceded \\"Flight of the Swan\\" it should have its own review. Alas, Amazon screwed up the page for \\"13 Days,\\" which has NO \\"review here\\" to click on. So the \\"13 Days\\" review is below this one for \\"Flight of the Swan.\\"As only Lacey Dancer can, she introduces this couple to one another in a mysterious, sexy way: the heroine is practicing her diving in a swimming pool and the hero happens to see her. And cannot take his eyes off her. Whew! This is not a stalker scene and avoids the \\"eeeewwwww\\" factor some authors might generate.Turns out the gentleman is a friend and business associate of Joshua Luck (see review below) and Luck, as a mega-rich businessman, must hire a bodyguard/nanny for his twins, so that's where our lovely diver comes in. Since she's voluptuous and/or stacked, she's learned to wear baggy clothing and tone down her sexuality since too many husbands/fathers in her nanny business try to come on to the hired help.When she and her future squeeze meet they do not know one another, since she never saw the man that she could sense was watching her dive that day. Later in the story, as luck :) would have it, he comes upon her doing her diving in the Lucks' pool and it all clicks into place for him.They begin going out with one another to jerk Pippa's chain, pretending that they're an item, and the chemistry makes their play-acting a reality. Some villains want to derail Joshua Luck's business plans, so two thugs accost our dating couple, who are more than equal to the task of fighting back. After that attempt fails, the bad guys strike again, but I won't ruin it for you by giving it away.With strong storytelling and interesting characters whose chemistry fairly leaps off the page, \\"Flight of the Swan\\" is a book I've read several times. Just about all of Lacey Dancer's books are keepers.2ND REVIEW: In \\"13 Days of Luck,\\" Pippa is a successful author in her late 30s who fancies herself as a matchmaker since she's set up several couples. A true romantic, she believes she is too self-absorbed with her own interests and particularly her writing to devote to a mate.She meets Joshua Luck on an airplane and is immediately captivated by his sheer physical presence and animal magnetism. Pippa trades seats with someone else in order to get close to him and then tells him she's a novelist and she'd like to get to know him, simply for research purposes. Wink, wink :) Josh is kind of put off by this brazen woman at first but, like everyone else in her orbit, cannot resist the magnetic pull of Pippa.They begin a hot love affair on board the cruise ship. Pippa meets Josh's brother Joe, who's a psychic. And there she goes matchmaking again, this time setting Joe up with a troubled fellow passenger on board the ship.This is another steamy Lacey Dancer book. There are others which interconnect that precede and follow this book. \\"Flight of the Swan\\" follows Pippa's and Joshua's marriage and she helps set up this couple. \\"Diamond on Ice,\\" which includes Pippa's nephew and his love interest, precedes \\"13 Days of Luck.\\" Either \\"Silent Enchantment\\" or \\"Sunlight on Shadows\\" also preceded \\"13 Days.\\" Those two titles are too similar for me to remember which is which. There may be more books with Pippa in them, but I can't think of 'em if there are."},{"Title":"Goodbye Ole Miss","review":"Review by Shelby Foote from the back cover:&quot;Remembrance of events both recent and remote, along with the emotions they invoked, provides the substance of Carroll Leatherman's memoir of a half-century spent in Memphis and the adjoining upper Mississippi Delta, sometimes as an urban belle, sometimes as a plantation housewife - &quot;Ole Miss&quot; in the jargon of the region - and sometimes both at once. In this contrapuntal narrative, part ups, part downs, yet always perceptive and alive, she takes us through this vale of tears, and laughter with an abiding sense of wonder. She declares at the outset that her hope was &quot;to find my true voice as a narrator,&quot; and we can be thankful that she found it. The result is not just a slice of life but nearly the whole loaf, enjoyable from end to end&quot;Ms. Leatherman has spent her life in Memphis and on northernDelta cotton farms in Mississippi where she watched the old feudal sharecropping system progress to modern mechanical farming. Readers will truly feel like they are living there with her."},{"Title":"Goodbye Ole Miss","review":"Here is a well-written, carefully outlined time capsule and record of a bygone era, truly gone with the wind with an interesting look at today. Leatherman was born in 1928 with a pedigree about as pure Southern as you can get. So she recalls the remnants of the Old South socio-economic system, having grown up in the affluent vestiges of the plantantion system as well as in the midst of the cream of Memphis society. Her memories form a bridge between the remnants of the old ways and those of today's New South, which is getting more and more un-Southern as the \`real world' get smaller.Leatherman also saw the tremendous economic and political upheaval that began with the Great Depression right down through the Civil Rights era, and never a shrinking violent, she's candid and speaks her mind. A self-proclaimed \`daughter of the land' with \`muddy water for her blood', she actually takes us on an epic journey, not just of the region, but of the soul. There's also a lot of fire in her, despite her recent health problems and that gentle Southern upbringing. When you read her book, you'll see what I mean.She's a skilled writer and has brought us all a great gift here - a book of importance. It's painstaking and detailed, not a quick read by any means, and may be the best first-person record of this region's changing economic, social and political landscape I have ever read. The author also had the wisdom to include many pictures, always a crucial element in any biography or autobiography and you'd be surprised at how many author just don't do that."},{"Title":"Goodbye Ole Miss","review":"Please remove the review above that I wrote in a tormented state.

But this is enough draw the killer's attention to him, involving him in the first of the three adventures related here. The mainspring of the story is a scientific invention that was implausible even by the standards of 1933; but if those with a knowledge of atomic physics can put it temporarily aside, they will still find an enjoyable yarn.The next story finds Simon helping Chief Inspector Teal for once, combatting an outbreak of gangsterism in London, and in the final one he deals in a fairly drastic way with two purveyors of something possibly even more unpleasant.All of these novelettes, especially the last two, are rather grimmer and more serious than the general run of Saint stories, despite several comic interludes. But then, who wants a non-stop diet of froth?P.S. For a list of &mdash; and discussion of &mdash; all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To...

Wish I could ask him."},{"Title":"The Mouse and His Child","review":"When our daughter was only 5, a college professor friend strongly recommended this book. Now that we've just re-read it after 16 years, I'm shocked that our daughter enjoyed it so much. It's intensely funny, heart-warming, and almost recklessly violent. In the space of two pages, a couple of weasels manage to wipe out a whole army of little furry critters, then get eaten themselves by an owl. It has the violence of a Roald Dahl book, but with no relishing of the violence--Hoban is more realistic.It's the story of a mechanical wind-up mouse and his child, bound together so that they always face each other, as they become fugitives and face terrors, courage, and redemption. There's death, treachery, and even a most touching about-face from a wicked character any other author would consign to permanent villainhood.Although sometimes billed as a children's book because it deals with toys and animals, it takes an adult--especially someone well-read in philosophy and literature--to fully appreciate this highly unsual book. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Mouse and His Child","review":"i saw this movie as a child and have been thinking about it scince. the beutiful story of the father mouse and his son is extreamly memorable. one particular phrase stayed with me,whats beyond the last visible dog. i wish that i could once again experiance this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Mouse and His Child","review":"Mechanical toys can not move by themselves--much less think, or have feelings and dreams, yet Hoban's father-son performing team prove more than mere wind-up toys. Seeking definition, direction and three-dimensional existence, the mouse child asks his father what they are. The patient father replies that he does not know either, but advises him to wait and see. Not a satisfactory answer for an eager youth, who first notices the world (a doll house and a plush elephant) in a toyshop.Stoic advice for two wind-ups who are very close--indeed they are permamently joined at arms' length, so that they can perform an amusing, circular dance, until they run down. But when they break the Rules of Clockwork, they themselves are broken by careless children and trashed. That is really just the beginning of their sylvan and aquatic odyssey in the callous world outside the protective toyshop and Christmas home.The mouse child has a dream: a real home and family, while his gentle father just wants to protect his beloved son. They will be victimized by various animal riffraff. They will encounter actors, con artists, militia, philosophers and brilliant engineers. Oh yes, there is a ubiquitous tramp who restarts the inertia of Motion, like a parenthesis at the beginning, and considers causing the Inertia of Rest at the end.There is humor, pathos, surprise twists of fate, noble dreams, and crushing defeats as the mouse duo labors in slow motion through their inexorable destiny. But do they have the right to choose that Destiny or must they accept whatyoung the world decides? Are they meant to cower in terror all their lives, to depend on others to keep them activiated, or to slave for Manny rat, the king of the dump? How will these long-suffering beings (for they ceased to be toys long ago) achieve the dual freedoms of perpetual movement AND self-determination? Do toys (or whatever they have become)deserve the right to pursue happiness? Not really meant for teenagers, this thoughtful yet amus! ing book will both charm and entertain its readers."},{"Title":"The Mouse and His Child","review":"This book is kind of like The Odyssey for children. A clockwork mouse and his child are opened in a toy store and have no idea what to expect from the world. Soon enough, they are beset upon by a series of events that lead them on a quest to find their place in the world. This book is sad at times as it does deal with the death of some characters. It also has some big vocabulary in it, but that's not a bad thing. Your kids will learn some words. I found it an enjoyable read and handed it off to my son."},{"Title":"The Mouse and His Child","review":"This was an intelligent book, but it might not be best for small children"},{"Title":"The Mouse and His Child","review":"I first became acquainted with this story when my husband and I saw it transformed into a movie in 1980. As a book, it is rare jewel of humanity expressed through the philosophies of the animal and toy characters--something much deeper than Barney the Dinosaur or Captain Kangaroo. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Mouse and His Child","review":"I found this book by chance in the library of a public school for grades K-5. I'm not sure what kids would read it, but it is wonderful."},{"Title":"Traditional Recipes of Old England (Hippocrene International Cookbook Series)","review":"I thought that many of the recipes were very interesting, including the Scots, Irish and Welsh recipes also included. I would like to try many of them out but find that the book needs some sort of an update. This book was evidently first printed in Britain about 1920, many of the terms would probably be obscure even to a present day British cook, let alone an American. I would also like more specific cooking information, no temperatures are given for anything, bake or boil until done is too vague for me."},{"Title":"Sweet life","review":"This book never fails to impress and inspire me each time I time I flip through it. It's so rare now to see a book this large of gel prints- the book and the photographs give me the same feelings that LPs do. It's the feeling that the art contained within was constructed in a very physical, primitive way, and that that somehow endows it with hundreds of times the detail and character that a contemporary work would.I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys art thats a little bit strange, a little bit surreal, and a little bit pop."},{"Title":"Strange Encounters","review":"Books of John Macklin are easy to read. They contain events, mysteriesand other phenomena considered to be out of this world. However, theproblem with his works, they contain alot of errors and do not agreewith historical facts."},{"Title":"Softquad Hotmetal Pro 6.0 for Microsoft Windows","review":"Honestly, I have to admit, the first page I ever published was with an older version of HotMetal Pro (4.0) and I had no trouble at all using it. Then I switched to FrontPage (Microsoft) and found it a lot easier to use. HOWEVER, FrontPage can be a bit quirky with Microsoft's proprietary tags and some features only with its proprietary server extensions. But SoftQuad hasn't exactly had a great track record with HotMetal Pro either (many service packs--service pack is a euphemism for a PATCH.)HoTMetaL is not for people who want to create Web pages without learning HTML. Actually, you won't find an HTML web page publisher that lets you get away with that. Due to the very nature of HTML (you are writing code that can be displayed on anyone's computer with ANY browser) you must understand the basics of HTML, annoying though it is. Many people swear by the HotMetal Pro product, because of the relatively trouble-free publishing. I guess to sum it up, it's easier to get started with FrontPage, but easier to finish up with HotMetal Pro because debugging is a bit easier. This does NOT apply to HotMetal Pro's CSS or DHTML. You still have to load to an external browser to preview these features, kind of a nuisance. And I can't say I love the WYSIWYG interface. I like FrontPage's WYSIWYG interface a lot more BUT...HotMetal Pro writes very good, clean, functional HTML code and that's worth a lot.Software bundled with HotMetal Pro includes WS_FTP PRO 6.0, a good FTP client, and Ulead stuff, including PhotoImpact SE. These tools are nowhere near as nice as Adobe Photoshop and ImageReady, but then again they are free and not the bux that Adobe commands for their topnotch products. For basic graphic design for the Web, these tools are adequate. I don't like Ulead much, but it works, and the GIF animator is good.In summary, this is a popular choice as a web authoring software and will probably write cleaner code than (whisper it) FrontPage. So it's a good software to learn to use. Would I use it over FrontPage? You know, much as I like FrontPage, I just may switch."},{"Title":"The Samuel Johnson Encyclopedia","review":"This work gathers in one convenient volume a wealth of information from many sources. Anyone reading the works of Samuel Johnson or James Boswell, or reading about Samuel Johnson or James Boswell, will find it immensely useful and endlessly browseable. It is expensive; but I cannot recommend it too highly for anyone who loves the study of Samuel Johnson and his world. I believe there is no other comparable reference work on this subject."},{"Title":"Signing at School (Beginning Sign Language Series) (Signed English)","review":"I purchased this book to use as a text for my daughter to learn sign as her foreign language. The illustrations are very easily understood, and as the title suggests, pertains to the average school day.

It was written in the 60's, so you go into this book knowing there's no way you can live on $250 in today's money. It's whole premise is that you live in a trailer park and pocket the savings over a conventional house. He gives trailer parks that Bing Crosby founded as examples. Great, but everyone knows about those parks in CA. and FL. and they are now for multi-millionaires and priced out of sight. There is no way you can live in one for anything remotely affordable. Of course, you can live in other trailer parks, but it's not going to be like living like a retired millionaire. This was probably a really good book in it's time, but it's too out of date to be of much use today."},{"Title":"Essential Skills for Management Research","review":"Chapter 3 stands out for Whetten's insight into how to make and how to use theory. Chapter 4 is a fine if succinct summary of Huff's ideas on writing as a skill and as a discipline.The rest of the book is humdrum. The book as a whole misses the big picture about the range of skills and methods in management research. There is insufficient attention to research question choice and framing, and to literature reviewing (other than briefly in Whetten's chapter); and a glaring lack of material on quantitative methods and applications.Add this to the - alas long - list of books that confuse qualitative research with management research. This particular book does not even stand out for what it has to say about qualitative research."},{"Title":"Hummingbirds","review":"From the abysmal accuracy level of many popular books on hummingbirds, it seems that book editors figure they don't need quality text by a knowledgeable author as long as they've got a bunch of spectacular photos to seduce people into buying the book. Unfortunately, \\"Hummingbirds: Jewels on Air\\" follows this disappointing pattern: Gorgeous to look at and even readable, but painfully short on substance. Neither the author's professed enthusiasm for the subject nor her previous writing experience seems to have prepared her for the challenge of writing a credible book on hummingbirds.I'd love to see a list of resources the author used in her research, because I suspect that she just repeated inaccurate and outdated information from other popular books without bothering to correspond with bona fide hummingbird experts or consult scientific references for verification. There are too many examples to list, but here are a few:* The author states, \\"You would have to eat 20,000 calories daily or 50 pounds of sugar to keep pace with just one hummingbird.\\" Actually, in the case of a hypothetical 150-pound person eating like a Ruby-throated-sized hummingbird, it's more like 130,000 calories or 70 pounds of sugar.* The author repeats the myth that bats have poor eyesight, when in fact the bats to which she's referring are nectar specialists with large, sensitive eyes that help them locate their flowers. A later statement about bats feeding at hummingbird feeders suggests that the author is unaware that not all bats feed on nectar and that in the U.S. those that do are found only along the Mexican border.* The statement that bats and insects cannot feed from long tubular flowers is incorrect. Many bat-pollinated flowers are tubular, including some tropical species of Datura or angel's trumpets, and nectar-drinking bats have extremely long tongues that allow them to reach the sweet stuff inside. Hawk moths also have very long tongues for feeding from tubular flowers (remember the one in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"?).* Likewise the claim that insects can't hover to feed on flowers; this will come as a huge surprise to the bee flies and hawk moths, which feed at flowers like hummingbirds do (and have probably been doing so for millions of years longer). The book later contradicts itself with a reference to the hummingbird-like flight of \\"hummingbird moths,\\" a name applied to several smallish species of hawk moths, also claiming that these moths are larger than some hummingbirds (some hawk moths are larger than some hummingbirds, but not the ones that are commonly confused with hummingbirds).* The statement late in Part One that hummingbirds \\"are the smallest birds in the world, equivalent in size to a human thumb and weighing no more than a penny\\" leaves the reader with the mistaken impression that all hummingbirds are that small and contradicts a size comparison between the smallest and largest species that appeared 11 pages earlier.I gave this book two stars because it's not the worst book on hummingbirds (\\"Hummingbirds of North America\\" by Dan True is the top contender for that title, IMO), but it's still a long way from the best book on the subject. I was tempted to give it a third star just for the photos, but that wouldn't be fair since the author didn't do her own photography and photographers don't receive royalties on books like this.Since \\"Hummingbirds: Beauty in Flight,\\" with text by Arizona hummingbird researcher Karen Krebbs, is apparently out of print, \\"The World of the Hummingbird\\" by Robert Burton might be the best alternative for a general-interest book on hummingbirds. Burton's British and so can't claim anything close to Krebbs's in-depth familiarity with hummingbirds, but he's a well-known naturalist with several other bird books to his credit."},{"Title":"Hummingbirds","review":"This is a wonderful coffee-table book! I've read it twice and still find myself picking it up at odd moments, paging through it, lost in the beautiful pictures. I can't qualify as an expert on birds, or even a more-than-casual bird watcher, but even so, I used to spend hours of my vacations in New Mexico on my relative's deck, mesmerized by \\"hummers.\\" This book has reawakened my fascination with them! The spritely writing compresses a vast amount of potentially soporific information into a lively account of hummingbirds' peculiar aerodynamics and physiology, of habitat and appetite, of \\"livin, lovin and fightin.\\" (Did you know hummingbird intimacies last from 2-5 seconds? That should make all of us feel better. But since they live only 3-5 years, and have to eat every ten minutes, it doesn't.) It also includes a section on the care and set-up of your own hummingbird feeder, and the hummingbird in myth and folklore. Oddly enough, this book didn't come to me through a love of hummingbirds but of poetry -- I'd read the author in a back issue of a poetry journal, looked her up in a bookstore, and found this. No wonder the prose is so enjoyable! But it is the photos that keep me coming back -- in life you tend to get a glimpse of hummers in your peripheral vision. This book brings them to a full stop, in glowing color."},{"Title":"Hummingbirds","review":"This is a great introduction to hummingbirds. The text is delightful for all ages, and the photographs are stunning. These creatures are amazing, and I was surprised by so many things about them. I was also surprised that I didn't lose interest reading about them. From a birdwatching relative, I understand that the book has a lot of useful information for the novice as well as the veteran, and I've also been told that some of the species pictured are very rare to see in a book. I had no idea that hummingbirds come in so many different varieties with head crests and odd tails, not to mention their fascinating feeding, nesting and migrating habits. We all know they can fly like no other bird, but they sleep in an almost dead state? Truly amazing! My kids and I have really enjoyed having this book, and I have to say that my birdwatching relative prefers it to most other comparable hummingbird books on the market."},{"Title":"Hummingbirds","review":"From the abysmal accuracy level of many popular books on hummingbirds, it seems that book editors figure they don't need quality text by a knowledgeable author as long as they've got a bunch of spectacular photos to seduce people into buying the book.

This is a reprint from the 1960s, it puts to shame most histories written now, which tend to be either condescending or chillingly post-modern (often both). It's refreshing to read a historian who loves his subject and isn't afraid to enthusiastically share his love with his readers. There's a good look at what is know today about the events Herodotus wrote about; also chapters on philosophy, the cultures of the islands, the position of women, etc. There's also some first-rate translations of poetry, including a passage from the 'Iliad' which is best version I've ever read, it's a real shame the author never attempted the whole thing.I picked up a copy last year in the UK and it's great to see it issued here.

Three of today's most prominent actors bring vital poignancy to the unforgettable words of Lorraine Hansberry.&quot;A Raisin In The Sun,&quot; the first drama penned by a black woman to reach Broadway, electrified audiences when it opened in 1959. Loosely basing her play on an Illinois antisegregation case which her father won, Ms. Hansberry sets her story in south Chicago. In it, Walter Lee, a black chauffeur, dreams of improving his life. He hopes to use his father's money to open a liquor store.However, his mother is against the liquor business, and uses the money to buy a family home. Conflicts arise when someone from this all-white neighborhood attempts to buy them out.&quot;To Be Young Gifted and Black,&quot; a compilation of Ms. Hansberry's writings appeared not only in book form but in 1969 was produced off-Broadway.Also included on this keepsake audio are seven of Ms. Hansberry's speeches and interviews recorded between 1959 and 1964.

It is beautifully written and interestingly constructed. Chapters are written alternately from the perspective of each main character and yet flow together nicely, providing an intimate portrait of the inner feelings of each character. The book is as painful as it is compelling. Each adult character is very human and flawed in some tragic way and events play out accordingly. Everyone wishes that everyone else were different, and then everything would be all right. Wishing doesn't make it so, however, and the plot continues relentlessly to its tragic conclusion. Dunsmore is a wizard with language. She has an incredible talent for making you feel that you've lived inside the heads of her characters. She can paint pcitures with words so vivid, they are almost cinematic. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"With Your Crooked Heart","review":"WITH YOUR CROOKED HEART is a journey into the feeling and lives of three exrtremely different people whose insides are torn and compelling. The book should be read and then the reader can go backwards and read TALKING TO THE DEAD.

Sounds like the makings for a perfect romance, doesn't it? Beloved romance author Judy Christenberry sets hearts aflutter again with her new \\"Lucky Charm Sisters\\" series by Silhouette. In her vivacious style, Christenberry acquaints her readers with the plucky O'Connor sisters and the tiny converted-trolley car/diner, called The Lucky Charm, that binds their lives together. \\"A Ring For Cinderella&quot;,is the third and final chapter in the series. Baby sister Susan is still getting used to the fact that she has two sisters she never knew about. Now, wealthy rancher Zach Lowery is offering her a life of comfort and security in exchange for being his wife. Only one thing's wrong here: he doesn't even pretend he's marrying her for love, he just needs a companion for his elderly grandfather. Susan's kind, generous nature leads her into taking him up on this offer. She never realized she would soon find her heart in jeopardy. The \\"Lucky Charm Sisters\\" are a charmingly delightful series from a delightfully charming author, and one of my favorite people. Judy Christenberry's romances are sure-fire, guaranteed heart-pleasers."},{"Title":"Ring For Cinderella (Lucky Charm Sisters) (Silhouette Romance, 1356 )","review":"They say you never forget your first love, I say I'll never forget the book that hooked me on this genre. Judy Christenberry is an excellent author, who really knows how to suck the reader in and make them feel like they are a part of the charater's family. This book was the last installment for the \\"Lucky Charm Sisters\\" series and Judy ended the series in the perfect way.The youngest of the sisters, Susan, is still dealing with the fact that she had two older sisters she never knew and one night while working in the family's diner Zach Lowery pops the question, letting her know she'll get the security and comfort she longs for as long as she understands they are not marrying for love, but so that his sickly grandfather could see that Zach is settling down. With Susan being a generous person and wanting to provide for her younger siblings she takes him up on his offer. Soon they both find themselves falling in love for real and not knowing how to tell the other.If you love seeing others getting their happily ever after this is the story for you."},{"Title":"Ring For Cinderella (Lucky Charm Sisters) (Silhouette Romance, 1356 )","review":"This story is the last in a triology about three sisters and is excellent just like the previous two. Judy really knows what her readers like. All the the characters are great and as I have read all of these books I feel like I have become a member of their family. It is a lovely tender romantic story which should please all Ms Christenberry fans."},{"Title":"Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis for Epidemiology: A Practical Guide","review":"This book is really useful and handy. It is very well written and easy to read. As the name stated, it provides very practical guides for those who don't have strong background in Statistics but are dealing with longitudinal data. It is written in an example guided format. The outputs from the analysis and guidelines on how to interpret them step by step are included. There is no heavy Statistical notation and you don't need to translate Statistics into English. At the end of the book, there are chapters of how to handle missing data and softwares used in longitudinal data analysis. This book is probably too boring if you are a hardcore Statistician."},{"Title":"Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis for Epidemiology: A Practical Guide","review":"The discussion of sphericity alone is worth the price of the book. I particularly appreciated throughout the book the use of computer output along with discussion of interpretation of the results. It really delivers on the promise of being an \\"applied\\" discussion. The one thing I wish the author had included was the programs that produced the output, or at least had those available on a companion website"},{"Title":"Cruel Tales","review":"Every now and then one stumbles across a relatively obscure authorwhose work is nevertheless enrossing and highly relevant. &quot;Cruel Tales&quot; is such a work. It's unlikely that even many well-read people have heard of De L'Isle-Adam. And yet, his collection of short storie disturbs and enterains.De L'Isle-Adam wrote in the mid-19th century, yet many of the idols he lampoons--commericialism, materialism, excessive patriotism, scientific objectivity--are all the more pervasive in today's society. De L'Isle-Adam writes witty, thought-provking satire without coming off embittered; this is no easy featSome of the tales have a shocking climax, such as &quot;Sentimentality&quot; or &quot;The Eleventh-Hour Guest&quot; &quot;Two Augurs&quot; is extremely funny; although it deliberately exaggerates society's trend towards conformity, it makes one ponder how much of an exaggeration it really is.De L'Isle-Adam was a radical individualist and subjectivist. And these stories offer a metaphorical journey into human unconsciousness. One is tempted to call them poetical Freudianism; before Freud. In some ways, De L'Isle-Adam is similiar to Poe; though not as darkly offputting. I see a positive Enlightenment Humanistic impulse in De L'Isle-Adam as well, even as he lampoons much of the Enlightenment tradition.Finally, I should note that although De L'Isle-Adam attacks science and reason and advocates a personal mysticism, he is not a religious apologist. If anything, the mysticism he has in mind is more of an idealism (perhaps even a solipism as the previous writter suggests); a probing of one's own mind and the very personal, often very weird world it has the potential to create."},{"Title":"Cruel Tales","review":"The Contes Cruels (Cruel Tales), comprising 27 stories, are sure to delight any reader with an interest in French literature, particularly the so-called 'Symbolist' school of the 19th century. Villiers' works, however, unlike much Symbolist prose fiction, have a great deal of irony and biting wit which the author uses to mock and satirize bourgeois affectations and popular taste, as in 'Two Augurs' and 'The Glory Machine'. Also, unlike many Symbolist works, Villiers' stories are not merely art for art's sake, exercises in mood or impression; they almost always have a provocative point, reflecting Villiers' opinions or attitudes on a particular issue (attitudes which are almost always opposed to the prevailing feelings of the time). He also applies his genius to the depiction of tragic, self-involved artists and libertines as in 'Sentimentality' and 'Vera'. The closest comparison that one can make in literature to Villiers is that of Poe, although Villiers, in my opinion, is more pleasurable to read. Without the excessive, dreary morbidity of Poe, he fires the imagination in much the same way; compare, for example, Villiers' Vera and Poe's Ligeia, both masterpieces in their own right and similar in some ways, but at the same time strikingly different in tone and mood.The Contes Cruels are wonderful, consistently surprising works which give us a glimpse into the thought and workings of a great literary mind."},{"Title":"Cruel Tales","review":"In all truth, I think this book deserves three stars, but what the hell, I enjoyed it and I think other people might enjoy it too. It is definitely not a masterpiece of literature, but somehow it forms part of the Western literary tradition and its style has, directly or not, inspired much of current popular culture. Villiers de l'Isle was a member of that strange group, the French decadents, active in the last part of the XIX century, like Huysmans, Lautreamont and Mallarm&eacute; (the latter being much superior in strictly literary quality). The whole idea of decadentism is to reject the vulgar, noisy, superflous life of modernity, the disappearance of the nobility, the predominance of the cheap. Decadentists nostalgically praise the life of the soul, the reclusiveness enjoyed by old nobles living in gloomy castles. It is like Romanticism disillusioned, taken to the extreme. Hence comes the idealization of the Middle Ages, as opposed to the most optimistic century in history, the XIX. But decadentism also has a darker face: the fascination with death, sickness, twisted sex, darkness and retreat from society.In these tales, Villiers treats these themes with varying success, but somehow they are attractive, so different from what we live, think and feel today. Two of the tales were, in my opinion, the best crafted: \\"The impatience of multitudes\\", about a warrior returning to an Ancient Greek city from a battle with the Persians. It is very vivid and indeed cruel, as the title of the collection suggests. It could even be said that it belongs in anthologies of this period. The other one is \\"The desire to be a man\\", a very sick story. The rest are very original (though it doesn't seem so, for the style has been appropriated by cheap entertainment and a few masterpieces) and they create the right mood, with pale full moons, crows, owls, night horse-rides and all which is now a cliche of ghosts stories. It is an easy and quick read, rather eccentric."},{"Title":"Cruel Tales","review":"to some, adams is not even significant and wrote nothing of enduring or lasting value. to those of us who can recognize true decadence and solipsism when we see it, however, his work is indispensable to our dementia and creative depravity. how else could we justify our bizarre, reclusive lifestyles, our anti social bitterness, our out and out misanthropy, without recourse to adam's philosophy of pure ideation and subjectivity? sure, not all his material has necessarily dated well, but the exact same thing can be said of huysmans or any of the other decadents. the constant emphasis on religious faith and it's importance (it sometimes seems that adams is trying to convince himself of the reality of his beliefs and not the reader)may seem obsolete now, but it gives a real sense of mystery and wonder to his novels and short stories. adams is the defender of the aesthete and the introvert par excellance, and this collection of really intriguing and poetic tales is a treasure to the connoisseur of the imaginative, the purely mental, the mystical. for anyone who lives 'against the grain', this is an absolute necessity.

Distances are often expressed in terms of time and landmarks are at times vague.Even so I have used the book on several trips and found it better than my usual &quot;inquire locally&quot; approach. At least I don't feel that I'm going in totally ignorant of a location. The book is particularly valuable in picking a destination to your liking.If you are at all a naturalist you will appreciate the detailed lists of flora and fauna. The general travel information was also quite detailed."},{"Title":"Backpacking in Mexico","review":"I think this book tries to be too many things. It aims at giving backpackers all they need. All they need won't fit into 240 or so pages. Most of it covers the same ground as do other, better, guidebooks: bus connections, hotels, restaurants, background and history, sightseeing descriptions, etc. Also, note that the book was printed in 1997 so the details are hopelessly outdated anyway.Where it's different from the usual guidebooks (Lonely Planet, Moon, etc.) is in giving some information on hikes. Unfortunately, narrative directions like these are notoriously hard to follow. Trail maps are too much to hope for, but GPS coordinates would be a huge help, as another reviewer has already noted. In any case, there aren't enough trails included to justify calling it a hiking book.There are some good things in it. The authors clearly know their flora and fauna and it shows up in the text. They're not afraid of expressing opinions as so many guidebook writers are. The essays give a personal feel to subjects travelers will want to know about.My recommendation is that backpack travelers to Mexico should invest the low price and read the book through. That would enable them to plan a much better trip and the savings in money and time would easily repay the investment. I wouldn't carry it along on the trip because I'd want to reserve that space in the backpack for better guidebooks, but I'd tear out the few pages that didn't duplicate the same material and carry them along."},{"Title":"Mastiff and Bullmastiff Handbook","review":"As a breeder of both Mastiffs &amp; Bullmastiffs, I believe the author has a good knowledge of the breeds, but has different opinions on some issues that show his bias toward the Bullmastiff.A good book with alot of good information and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Mastiff and Bullmastiff Handbook","review":"This book was well-written and quite intriguing with a great deal of history of the breed(s). I found the pictures interesting, yet would have preferred to see more pictures of mastiffs &amp; bullmastiffs from the United States. The AKC breed standard in the U.S. is slightly different from the International Standard, so when showing a dog in the U.S., it would be more helpful to see champions from this country. The author went to a great deal of trouble in ascertaining these breed's histories, and sometimes the reader gets lost in &quot;who is who&quot; because the author throws in so many different names of breeders and kennels. However, the author's candor in giving his opinion about certain things is refreshing and entertaining."},{"Title":"Mastiff and Bullmastiff Handbook","review":"This is a great book with lots of wonderful pictures and research writing detailing so much about the Mastiff and Bullmastiff breeds. It is very helpful to see some of the ways the breeds have evolved over the years. An ideal resource if you are interested in studying the breeds and the lines that have been instrumental in making them what they are today."},{"Title":"The Family Contract: A Blueprint for Successful Parenting","review":"This is an excellent book for parents struggling to do what's right. The author provides the tools to accomplish what you know your kids need to be as happy as kids can be in this world. The techniques will make discipline much more matter-of-fact and much more effective. If the parents aren't yelling, the kids will discover that yelling is useless and, in fact, hurtful. And, in the long run, children will learn how to communicate in a mature way which, I would hope, would translate to happier marriages in the future. Why this book is out of print is quite bothersome to me...I was about to order 50 for some parenting classes. If you can get a copy--do so. It's a great gift, too!"},{"Title":"The Family Contract: A Blueprint for Successful Parenting","review":"Of all the parenting books I've recommended in my 20 years of counseling parents &amp; families, this is the one from which my clients have benefitted the most. The Family Contract really works! Even with the toughest kids, eventually these techniques do work. It is very parent friendly and Dr. Leftin gently guides the troubled parent with humor and personal experience."},{"Title":"The Family Contract: A Blueprint for Successful Parenting","review":"I read this book after meeting the author's wife. It made lots of sense and I used a modified version with my students at school. I only have one child. He is well behaved and knows we very seldomly just &quot;give&quot; him money. I have used the ideas from this book to keep communications open between us as he enters his teen years. It has been great and we are still very close because of Dr. Leftin's ideas."},{"Title":"The Family Contract: A Blueprint for Successful Parenting","review":"My husband and I are foster parents and for several years fostered teenagers re-entering family life after living in dysfunctional families and/or spending time in group homes or facilities. The contract worked great. It is easily adjusted to regulate and monitor whatever your particular childs needs are. They are put in control of making choices that allow them to earn the privledges they want. It is, in a way, a point system, but it is so much more than that. I had kids rushing to be the first to take out the garbage or do the dishes. We had kids that argued, talked back, refused to do chores or participate in family activities and for the most part this contract changed that. You have to put some time into creating and adjusting it but it's worth it. There are always going to be kids that still refuse go with the plan, but honestly this usually worked for us and we use it with our birth children as well. I'd say it could be adjusted for any age or child provided they understand the relationship of choice and consequence."},{"Title":"Fight for Justice by Luke Skywalker (Star Wars Journal)","review":"I read this book one day when I was grounded and it was so sitting-on-the-edge-of-my-seat, rivetingly good that I didn't want to come out! It is written in journal form about what Luke was thinking and feeling during A New Hope, though this book spans a little before it too. This was especially interesting for me, since Luke has always been my favorite character. Part of why I loved it is that it was not simply yet another retelling of the original story, but breathed new life into it, and made it even more interesting, and considering that I have seen this movie so many times I practicly have it memerized, that is quite a feat. My one complaint of this book was that, though the character of Luke was explored deeply and in ways that few other books have, all the other characters were pretty much left out with the exception of Leia, since Luke was thinking quite a lot about her at this time. But then again, when I write in my journal I usually don't focus on other people either, and since this is supposed to be Luke's journal, that does make sense. In short, this was a wonderfull book that I would reccamend to any Star Wars fan, especially those who love Luke."},{"Title":"Fight for Justice by Luke Skywalker (Star Wars Journal)","review":"This is a GREAT journal that has LOTS of of info you didn't know about Luke Skywalker. You'll really enjoy this book and/or learn something new. I bought a copy a while ago, and I have read this more than 10 times I think. You really get into the book after reading atleast the first chapter. You can also find out more about the friendship with mysterious Biggs. Strap on for one of the best journals."},{"Title":"Fight for Justice by Luke Skywalker (Star Wars Journal)","review":"In most of the Star Wars books, Luke is a trained Jedi Knight, so it's fun to read about what is essentially a kid ready to leave home, with no idea what the worlds about. Learning about death really catipults him into the realm of adulthood. He goes from being a clueless innocent imagining going on some whirlwind adventure to save a fairy princess. To becoming a young man whoose lost the parents who raised him, a mentor, and a childhood friend. It approaches that age old question, once you get what your looking for, do you really want it. And though we all know it will work out for the best in the end, you can see his emotional journey, history, and lost youth."},{"Title":"Fight for Justice by Luke Skywalker (Star Wars Journal)","review":"I think this a great account of what happens to Luke up to the time he gets his metal in the Massassi Temple. I would reccomend this book to any Star Wars fan no matter what their age is. A must have for any Star Wars fan."},{"Title":"Fight for Justice by Luke Skywalker (Star Wars Journal)","review":"This book takes an alternative approach to telling the Star Wars story. It is a journal written by Luke Skywalker that describes his feelings during the events of Episode IV: A New Hope. It is not an event-by-event recapitulation of the scenes of the movie, rather it is a summation of the events and Luke adds explanations of his feelings at the time.For example:*) His feelings of boredom and striving for adventure while being isolated as a farm boy on Tatooine.*) His reluctance to engage in the adventure when Ben Kenobi rescues him and they see the message from Leia.*) His feelings of anger and sadness when he sees that the Jawas and his Aunt and Uncle have been slaughtered by Imperial Storm Troopers.*) His thoughts after they had their incident at Mos Eisley space port. His growing respect for Ben Kenobi.*) His feelings as he begins to learn about the force.*) His innermost thoughts as the team of Han Solo, Chewbacca, Ben and Luke rescue Leia and flee the Death Star. His deep sadness and yet puzzlement when Ben is killed by Darth Vader.*) His feelings of despair and then exultation when he fired the shots that destroyed the Death Star.Star Wars is a cultural phenomenon that it is difficult to get enough off.

Imagine A New Hope told in the form of \\"personal logs\\" from Star Trek and you'll have the idea. John Peel draws on such diverse materials as the radio show and the old Marvel comics to flesh out Luke's story, and takes some minor liberties with the movie itself. When all is said and done, we are presented with a Luke who must all at once deal with painful loss and grow up more quickly than anyone should have to. While this one is not as good as Princess Leia's journal, it is nevertheless worth the hour it will take to read."},{"Title":"Fight for Justice by Luke Skywalker (Star Wars Journal)","review":"it's all about Luke and about what he thinks and see's it's really a great book."},{"Title":"Contemporary Women's Poetry","review":"For anyone interested in contemporary women's writing, this collection of essays is a must! In moving across the usual publishing categories that are based around nation, race, and poetic school or grouping (such as Language writing), this volume does not sacrifice an awareness of the cultural specificity of poetic production when exploring the various formal and thematic crosscurrents occurring between poetries being written today. Essays broach a range of issues, including the relationship of gender to authorship, community, and the process of reading.

Very informative and very disturbing at times, it will leave you demanding justice and wanting to know more. By itself, this book is slighlty incomplete. However, along with the absolutely necessary &quot;In the Spirit of Crazy Horse&quot; and along with the Anna Mae Aquash sites at Dickshovel.com, you will begin to truly appreciate the direness of the situation, even 25 years after Anna Mae's death. Peace be with you."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Anna Mae Aquash","review":"The book was thoughtfully written and was a very easy read. I was hoping it was going to be a biographical sketch of Anna Mae Aquash's life, but much of it read like a summary of The American Indian Movement, The Wounded Knee Occupation, FBI corruption in the 1960s and 1970s, and violence on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Although Anna Mae was involved in all of these themes of the time, very little was written about her work and involvement. The beginning and end of the book was a detailed description about Anna Mae and her life and death which was extremely sad. If you have never read about The American Indian Movement or the events that define much of it you will really like this book. If you are knowledgeable about those times, this book will leave you with empty questions and wanting to read more about Anna Mae herself. I feel another book needs to be written about her life that develops from where this book started."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Anna Mae Aquash","review":"i think that its about time the true story of anna is told. i think this book is a real eye opener. i recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Anna Mae Aquash","review":"1971 and 1972, AIM set itself up perfectly to accomplish great for all American Indian people.

Here's why. During the first two years, I tried to read a lot of textbooks and not those silly notes handed out by the instructors... because they were poorly presented and often contained weak, 1:1 relationships. Reading textbooks really exposed me to a lot of highly varied material, and consequently, I was exposed to more knowledge than the other students. But when Step I came around, I decided not to do the Kaplan thing: I mean, this isn't \\"occult\\" knowledge, is it? No, so I relied on this and the other review books in this \\"white book\\" series... Fantastic results!!! And for pictures, pay *close*attention* to the pictures in First Aid.

The problem with the material is that the CD has too many problems, as it was designed quite unthoughtfully. After purchasing the cd and book, the chances of going through all 1400 Qs is an impossibility without redoing other questions again and again. It is an inefficient way to study, and big set back to the materials. I highly recommend buying this material but they really need to fix the CD."},{"Title":"Rapid Review USMLE Step 1, 1e","review":"I thought this was far and away the best USMLE Step 1 Question book out there.

Second of all, the cd-rom doesn't have a save option so you'll be repeting questions each time you use it and you'll never do them all because of that. Third, the questions are either way to easy or impresively hard to find in your regular study reviews. And finally,to DAVE BROWN in Tempe AZ, the guy who wrote the first review on this book here: next time try and check everything about a item (book in this case) before you give it 5 stars, cause most people read these reviews and follow advise, and in this case yours sucked big time."},{"Title":"Rapid Review USMLE Step 1, 1e","review":"I agree with other reviewers, the questions are very nice, good explanations and fair difficulty level.

The historical setting of Czarist Russia in the late 1800's comes alive in this episodic tale of the Von Glasman family. The issues of the status of Jews in Russia gives the tale significance and depth. During the rumblings of the coming communist revolution, there was political intrigue with Rasputin and an anti-Semetic mood in Russia. The Christian Church and the struggle of the rabbis during this period come alive in the supporting characters. Ronya Von Glassman is the heir of a wealthy Jewish family with cultivated political influence. She marries Boris Pirov, the blond strapping Tartar who swashbuckles through the novel. Their passionate married life results a family of two sons with Boris' illegitimate son called \\"The Blond One\\" from a fling with the Tamara, the Queen of the Gypsies. Son Igor goes to Manchuria for several chapters; and the Russian role in that Chinese province is the backdrop for more of the story. This long epic tale moves well and has you constantly reaching to find out what happens next. The characters come alive and stay with you, long after they've headed for San Francisco.

I would've guessed that many a learned architectural scholar would've long since sung the praises of this wonderful book. I, however, am just a layman with a lifelong passion for Gothic cathedral architecture, which started in the Washington National Cathedral and became educated, at least partiallly, in this book.I consider Wilson's \\"The Gothic Cathedral\\", a 'must own' for anyone who has ever felt a yearning to know more about the soaring arches, brilliant glasswork, and impossibly high, vaulted ceilings of these magnificent medieval structures. This book, details the development of this unique form of architectural artistry; beginning with it's modest antecedents in Romanesque architecture and the groin-vaulted churches of Normandy and England and continuing through even the most elaborate and extravagant versions of late-Gothic throughout Europe. Mr. Wilson moves the reader, comfortably and comprehensibly through the chronological development of Gothic architecture, while neatly detailing the differences in coincidental development in several diverse geographic regions. Even I, with no formal architectural education, can now explain most of the finer points of Norman Romanesque, French High Gothic, and the Rayonnant styles of architecture, as well as explaining the odd metamorphisis of the English Decorated style into the very uniquely English, Perpendicular style.The text is brilliantly cross-referenced with the illustrations, diagrams and photographs, which are both descriptive and beautiful, despite being all black and white. Finally, the glossary, index, and bibliography are complete and very helpful. If you think you MIGHT like this book... you will.

It is true that the photos are only black-and-white so the reader cannot wholly grasp the glory of stained glass windows, but the photographs nonetheless render the Gothic architectural features and details with great clarity. This combination of excellent text and superb illustrations makes Wilson's book ideal for either close, intensive study or simple joyful browsing.

This book perfectly captures the personality of Napoleon, constantly conveying a sense of restlessness - each time Napoleon achieves something he rejoices only briefly before he turns his gaze to the next task, never content, always driven to go to new heights. Gallo's writing style is unique, talking in present rather than past tense, as is the convention for novels. Nonetheless this is actually quite a bonus - it gives everything a sense of urgency and draws the reader in so one can feel that they are actually living the life of the emperor. A must read, whether a fan of Napoleonic history or not."},{"Title":"The Song of Departure: A Novel (Napoleon series) (No. 1)","review":"The review is for all I-IV of the Quartet:If Napoleon could write his own memoirs in real time, this is what they would sound like... one really gets into the head of Napoleon. That is the gift of Max Gallo. Pulling this off in a quartet is something next to impossible -- and in translation?? -- well Gallo has done it! If you are interested in knowing how great people think, this is as close as one can come. The Napolean we meet is one of both human and mythic in equal proportion. His overriding sense of justice and the new age that he brings sometimes gives rist to excesses, but at other times one is amazed at his ability to apportion justice, forgive and see himself in humble terms.The book offers a look at the life of the man, so we spend about as much time thinking about things as Napoleon did: there are no long treatises on Austerlitz, Wagram, Leipzig or Moscow. These were pivotal events in the life of the world and influences Napoleon, but one must realise that the amount of book space allocated to Austerlitz is about 15 pages of about 1500 in the total quartet -- probably about the same amount of time that Austerlitz occupied in Napoleon's life.So if you are looking for an over-emphasis on the military events this is not so much the book to read. The real strenght is in the ability to marvel at the thought processes of this great historical leader -- how he reaches conclusions, right or wrong on important issues.I have read 3 of the 4 so far. They have not dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Song of Departure: A Novel (Napoleon series) (No. 1)","review":"The news stands and bookstores of France have featured a display of one or more of Max Gallo's psychological fictions from the internal perspective of Napoleon for most of the last ten years. There is no question this extensive psychological narrative takes a high rank in the genre of Napoleonic fiction. The work is a must for any Francophile or Napoleonic history enthusist.I rate this work as four stars and that means I have a strong positive opinion that the work is a significant original contribution to our knowledge and enjoyment of the Napoleonic Age. I reserve my five star ratings for only the greatest novels such as \\"War and Peace\\" and the \\"Charterhouse of Parma\\" which not only advance our appreciation of the Napoleonic Age, but also rank among the greatest works of all time regardless of genre or topic.\\"The Song of Departure\\" begins with the birth and childhood of Napoleon and concludes after his return from Egypt and on the eve of the coupe d'tat of 18-19 Brumaire (November 11, 1799) at St. Cloud. Over half of the book is consumed by events leading up to, and including, the siege of Toulon. Since each of the four books consists of approximately 400 pages, the coverage allotted to the formative years of Napoleon takes up as much as 12% of the entire work. This is important because it reveals how much emphasis Gallo places on showing the reader the inner life of Napoleon the individual.Most other authors would gloss over the early life of Napoleon and develop more details of Rivoli, Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau or Friedland. But, in fact, Gallo gives no more detail of these momentous battles in total than it takes to fill one chapter of his accounts of Napoleon's stay at the Briene Military Academy.Nevertheless, I think this is purposeful and extremely useful. The telling and retelling of the great events of the Napoleonic Age has been done in many places. What we need, and perhaps the only thing truly additive, from the works of fiction in this genre is a personal perspective on events that allows us to comprehend events as if we ourselves were present to partake of that small fragment of great events each person holds title to.Another reason to read Gallo with enthusiasm is to bring the man Napoleon out of the shadows of history and into perspective among the people and events of his age. In almost all historical and fictional accounts, Napoleon is a stage prop. He is bigger than, or at least as big as, the events himself and he is only a shadow in or over the story.Obviously, this was never really the case in real times. What Gallo does for us and for Napoleon is to show a plausible portrayal of how it may have truly been, just as Napoleon claimed himself, that he was made by \\"the course of things\\" rather than the other way around.There is no doubt Napoleon was a talented and intelligent human being, but Gallo shows us how Napoleon's choices and preparations became aligned with the course of events in such a way that he was uniquely swept along by them. Then, as is now, there is no doubt than many thousands of young men were similarly inspired in their schooling and exposed to opportunity in the events of the day; but, only he was chosen. Only he stood in the one available spot to be swept by random forces into the updraft of history. He was wise enough to know this and careful enough to repeat it often.It would be one thing if Gallo was merely making up the story from his imagination, but he is not. Gallo's perspective is only imaginary in the way he weaves his interior perspective of Napoleon into the fabric of the external events. Otherwise, however, he is repeating back to us the fragments of the many thousands of pieces of personal correspondence and public statements that Napoleon authored.A comprehensive understanding of the Napoleonic Age can be developed from four interacting levels of study: First, through the study of systematic historical analysis; second, though the first hand observation of the places that provided the stage for the historical events; third by examining the first hand accounts of the events handed down by those who were present; and finally, by considering the imaginative portrayal of the times by the writers of fiction.Gallo has contributed greatly to advancement of our knowledge and appreciation of the Age of Napoleon by contributing directly to the last category of study. The fact remains, however, that he has added greatly to the totality of our knowledge because he has woven all of the levels of study into a form that is exciting to read for the experience -- as much as for any other reason.My advice is to read the Gallo books in order and to read them syntopically with other related works. If you are already steeped in the factual record of the Napoleonic Age you do not need this approach and you can breeze though the books recognizing all the familiar people and sign posts of the epoch. But, if you are new to the subject, I recommend you acquire David Chandler's \\"Campaigns of Napoleon\\" and Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace\\" and read them all serially and in parallel. First, stake out the Napolenic timeline from 1769 to 1840 and read Chandler up to a critical breakpoint, then read Gallo to the same point, then work in Tolstoy as you go before repeating successive cycles to the next milestone.While this will be an ambitious undertaking, it will also be a rewarding one. I would say this will take about six months of very active reading. If you make it, you will be as conversant and insightful about the Napoleonic Age as all but a few of the most devoted students and readers of the genre.For futher orientation and direction please enjoy browsing my reading lists and complementary reviews."},{"Title":"The Song of Departure: A Novel (Napoleon series) (No. 1)","review":"Well, this is another rare 5-star novel which I HIGHLY recommend for everybody who enjoys reading history or historical fiction books. Actually, it is a MUST-READ book.In this novel, Napoleon is alive and well. He became of what he became because of partly circumstances and his own nature. It started with Napoleon at 9, and already France's army general at his early 20s. His fondness (or craziness) of Josephine is also blossoming.His early campaigns on France's neighbors are excellent. If Gallo had detailed those campaigns, I would think the book's pages will certainly double. Gallo is a story teller like Bernard Cornwell and Simon Scarrow. He did a bit of strategic warfare telling in this novel, but not close to Steven Pressfield's detailed war strategies. However, Max Gallo's style is actually preferrable, rather than going into too much detail on an issue.A highly recommended novel for everyone. I will get the remaining 3 novels on this Napoleon quartet by Gallo at all costs!"},{"Title":"The Song of Departure: A Novel (Napoleon series) (No. 1)","review":"One of my college history professors told me about Max Gallo's work when I mentioned my passion for Napoleon Bonaparte. Max Gallo combines details with carefully researched facts to create a compelling and rich story of the Corsican who rose in politics to be one of the greatest military masterminds. Gallo covers nearly every aspect of Napoleon's life, from his siblings and relatives to his childhood in France, when he knew hardly any French.Not a light read, however, but if you're looking for a great book on the life of Napoleon, pick this one up. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Philadelphia Murals and the Stories They Tell","review":"What a surprise I had in learning that Philadelphia, a city I've lived in for over ten years, has over 2,000 murals.

Busy, overwhelmed and stressed working mothers are still blindly believing the spiels that these savvy center directors are delivering. These child center directors may be visionary managers who strive to provide the best care possible, but there are plenty of center directors out there who don't seem to have the children's best interests at heart. These misguided directors seem to be overwhelmed adn they are pushed by the owners to keep costs way down so that they can maximize their profits. Since the youngest children in their care don't have voices of their own, it is so easy to exploit their vulnerability. If you have a child in day care who is under the age of three, you must educate yourself about how to recognize poor to mediocre quality child care. Children over the age of three will probably tell you if they are unhappy at their day care. They'll say, \\"Teacher mean!\\", or (God forbid), \\"Teacher hit me!\\" Preschool age children will probably tell you if there's something amiss in their classroom. Unfortunately, the younger children may not be able to articulate or demonstrate that they're not happy with the care they are receiving at their center. They may not be able to tell you about the overcrowding, the intimidation they feel when they are bullied by bigger and older students, and about how few opportunities they given to get a drink of water. Lots of times, the problems with poor quality child care are not easy to detect even by adults. Even savvy business people can't easily detect when a child is afraid of their day care teacher. They may think that the child is just showing respect by being very well-behaved. The parent may think that the child is sitting still and being quiet because he's learned to be very well behaved. The parent may not know that the child is actually afraid of this very \\"strict\\" and controlling day care teacher.Here is an important clue to look for in a quality child care center: It involves the methods in place where a parent can remotely monitor her childs classroom from the directors office without being detected by the day care teacher and her students.1. Does your center have state-of-the-art intercoms in the classrooms? These are the intercoms where the director can listen in from her office while on mute. They're usually small white plastic wall-mounted devices with several capabilities for announcements and two-way conversation. These intercoms are used for monitoring teacher-child interactions without the classroom occupants knowing they're being monitored. If your center only has the old-fashioned big brown boxes mounted high on the wall where the principal can make crackly announcements, then you should be very wary. If your child's classroom does not have a way for you to monitor your child via audio without being detected by the day care teacher, then you should be worried. In this day and age of tiny video cameras, Video Barbies, Nanny Cams, and more; shouldn't your child care center be equipt with technology where you can listen-in on what your child's day care teacher is saying to her class? Wouldn't you want to know what your child's day care teacher is saying to him when they don't think you're listening in? What if your child's day care teacher is controlling him with threats? Wouldn't you want to know about it? What if she's saying, \\"If you don't sit down in your chair right now, I'm going to give you a spanking.\\" What if the day care worker is \\"spanking hands\\" when the kids touch things in the room that she doesn't want them to touch? Children under the age of three may not report this to the parent. They may be too scared to say anything to you about it. They may not know that there is anything wrong with an adult saying this to them since they believe they're supposed to \\"listen to the teacher\\". My point is this: If there isn't an intercom in the room for undetectable remote audio monitoring from the director's office, then you should be asking some questions or you should wonder why they don't want you to hear what the day care teacher is saying to these children.Here's another clue about quality day care centers. Did you know that most day care centers have a policy that prohibits cell phone use by the day care staff? Many center directors just ignore this policy since it seems to be so difficult to enforce.2. Does your child's day care center allow the day care workers to keep their cell phones on their person? Have you noticed the day care workers texting or calling on their phones when they're supposed to be watching the kids? Day care workers should not be allowed to have their cell phones on their person at all. The phones stay in the purses which should be kept in a locked closet or in their locker. These day care teachers are pretty savvy. If a parent and the director are standing out in the hall listening-in to your class, then it's really easy to know they're out there. Usually another day care teacher will see them coming down the hall and the teacher will send a text message or will call the teacher next door. The next day care teacher will pass the message along down to the next day care teacher. Everyone knows if the director and a concerned parent are on the hall since they use their personal cell phones to pass along important news. If your day care center tells you that they have made arrangements for parents to be able to observe their child's classroom without the day care teacher knowing about it, then you need to ask some additional questions. If these observation opportunities involve you standing outside the classroom door in the shadows, then the center director is either lying to you or she's absolutely wrong. The day care workers spread the news to each other like wild fire by text message. Everyone knows you're out there observing and I promise that they'll put on a really good show for you.I won't spill the beans about all the advice and tips that the author has included in this book. I would recommend that concerned parents should read as many books as they can about how to choose quality child care."},{"Title":"Wine Country Quilts: A Bounty of Flavorful Projects for Any Palette","review":"This book is BEAUTIFUL!

There are stories from the masters of the genre - Clarke and Bradbury - the authors I obsessed over in college - Dick and Zelazny - and new writers I've never heard of before, but am deeply glad I've now found.The tone ranges from almost whimsical to deeply serious. There is romance, science, social commentary... and most of all, there's deeply believable characters, whose adventures reflect on our own lives.Let me summarize with the two highest bits of praise I can give to any writing:Every one of these stories makes me want to read more by these authors.All of these stories make me want to write more myself."},{"Title":"Fourth Planet from the Sun: Tales of Mars from The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction","review":"This is definitely a good collection, as it averages 3.67.

During midlife there are so many questions; one being, where are my friends today when I need them most. Dr. Pamela Reeve defined for me three types of relationships, and the impact each relationship has in one's life. For the first time I understood why I was feeling abandoned. Through her writing I was able to evaluate my relationships by putting them into proper perspective no longer grouping them into one whole but recognizing them as separate unique relationships with each responding in totally different ways; consequently, I was not abandoned. Ultimately in the end, she instilled that no one can meet my deepest longings but God. Now that I better understand how to categorize my &quot;relationships,&quot; I no longer expect something from a relationship that was never there. Solace in relationships is the fact that God's relationship with me never changes and is perfectly defined."},{"Title":"Relationships: What It Takes to Be a Friend","review":"Dr. Pamela Reeve is a true schollar of Jesus, she uses her experiences and wisdom to write books.

This book simply show the effects of porno on malebehavior. Is a South African female being murdered for pleasure the same as Pamela Anderson Lee posing nude for playboy, no, of course not. BUT the fact that women like Lee pose nude to gratify their own greed for money, and men's selfish lusts creates an environment where women can be objectified to the point where a female servant can be murdered for pleasure. This book very nicely presents the research that suggests that pornography has a profound effect on how women are viewed and treated, and that there is a connection between women who willingly participate and those that do not. For example perverts that are steeped in the garbage of pornography use women like Pamela Anderson Lee and other porn stars as an excuse for victimizing women, they say, &quot;well if Lee likes it then this girl must&quot;. The above reviewer in New York takes a very liberal view towards porno. The book was well written and well researched. Did some of the connections seem strained (i.e. those that are willing participants and those that aren't? Maybe to the liberal mind who is afraid of offending anyone by taking a stand on a moral issue. Should feminists marginalize those in the porn industry? No, they should speak for all women and should work for the betterment of all women. Yet, the research clearly shows that women are harmed by pornography as well as men, that is why feminists fight so hard against the porn industry. This book is a VERY zealous effort in that direction."},{"Title":"Pornography: Women, Violence and Civil Liberties: A Radical New View","review":"My rating of this book as one of &quot;the worst&quot; does not refer to its academic prowess. The footnotes are all there, and the style is passionate and intense, typical of most anti-pornographers' heady intellectual indictments of one genre of media for all our gender woes. It is the worst, to me, because it is the ultimate gathering of the forces of illogic which drive the anti-pornography forces. The most extreme example of how far these people will go to attempt to prove their points comes in Itzin's own contribution, in which she relates the story of a South-African farm worker who was murdered for the amusement of the farm owner's dinner guests. Because pictures of the gruesome undertaking were shot and passed around, Itzin compares these pictures to pornography such as centerfolds. Surely this would enrage the family of the murdered man to hear his death trivialized in this way. Itzin goes on to claim that the &quot;free speech&quot; defenses of pornography imply that such photos (of Kasire's death and of naked women, who supposedly could not willingly choose to pose so graphically) are not only comparable, but that the distribution of both are similar crimes. Never mind that Marcia Pally has pointed out that if photos and descriptions of a rape are destroyed, the rape remains while the evidence does not. Never mind that the horrific descriptions of graphic pornography included in this book would be illegal themselves under such laws as the Proposed Minneapolis Pornography Ordinance, written by MacKinnon, who seems to be Itzin's mentor and contributed to this collection of essays. Never mind that Nadine Strossen has pointed out that women do not experience any particular freedom from rape or domination in cultures in which the production of pornography is a punishable offense. Never mind logic when we can tell by looking at pornography that it's nasty. Why not stigmatize women even more by pointing out that they're too helpless and deluded to make their own choices about whether to read or participate in pornography--good God, do these creatures even have enough sense to VOTE? I think that at least some of these anti-pornography crusaders are more obsessed with porn than any of the porn &quot;addicts&quot; they describe. True feminists would be out helping sex workers to get better working conditions rather than marginalizing them in the way to an even greater extent. This anti-pornography view is not &quot;radical;&quot; it conforms to the traditional perception of women as requiring virtue in order to lead meaningful lives. It seems to me that they ought to be attacking the concept of female virtue (oh, fate worse than death!) rather than the existence of male sexuality!"},{"Title":"You Too Can Be Delivered: Keys to Walking in Personal Deliverance","review":"This is an excellent book to read about how other's were delivered from a situation.

WHY?!This is the first Brad Steiger book I have ever picked up, and I don't think I ever want to put it down again. He takes stories collected from the &quot;Steiger Questionnaire of Mystical, Paranormal, and UFO Experiences&quot; and bundles the most fabulous stories up into this book.Here's an idea of what Brad Steiger dives into the depths upon:Ghosts, burial grounds, ghostly echoes, apparitions, poltergeists, phantoms, bigfoot, sasquatch, the Patterson-Gimlin Film of Bigfoot, a bigfoot body cast, Florida's skunk ape, winged manimals (mothman, etc.), Nessie, a number of other lake and sea monsters, vampires, psychic vampires, Chupacabra, werewolves, werecats, wee people (fairies, sprites, elves, little vanishing people and trolls), Incubus, Succubus, human sacrificers, subterranean superhumans living in &quot;abandoned&quot; mines, Tommyknockers, aliens and Men in Black; and Steiger swears that they are all really here and really real! There is a photograph section that includes a couple of pictures of rods, but I did not see anything written up on them.I have to say, overall, I think that the troll story was the worst; and makes it the #1 creature on my list to NOT run into! But, I did figure out that this book isn't all about \\"bad\\" entities, that some of them only are bad when you make them be. For example, give the elves a little portion of you lunch and dinner every day, and your house won't be infested by rats.Deciding to be stupid, I finished this book at 3 o'clock in the morning while on my lunch break sitting in my car in the middle of a deserted parking lot. Don't do this! I was pretty okay with myself until I read the very last page, and that was enough for me. However, I know for a fact that this will not be the only time I read this book. It'll make a good reference for those scary stories on Halloween night 2002!Well, to sum it up, you need this book if you're even *slightly* interested in weird stuff. It made a believer out of me, and I'm sure it will do it for you, as well."},{"Title":"Out Of The Dark: The Complete Guide to Beings from Beyond","review":"A vicious Bigfoot creature who decapitates intruders in the mysterious Nahanni Valley!

The author brings a combination of a strong, dramatic writing style and a lifetime of personal experience to the book. Unfortunately, this journey into the unknown is hampered by a sometimes peculiar selection of material, a lack of good scientific method, and an occasional excess of literary color.The book starts out with a chapter on the phenomena of ghosts, and at the outset things look quite promising. The author has clear literary flair, and has no problem creating imagery and drama when recounting historical events. Unlike the dry statistical prose so many a scientist has laid to paper, Steiger keeps the reader involved with a lively combination of storytelling and commentary. I can safely say that, despite occasional grievances with the content, the production values kept me reading on.Sadly, after the first few chapters, the author's tendency to take a fireside ghost-story approach to his presentation began to feel problematic. In other words, for a work that is intended to be a presentation of fact regarding our world, there was a distinct lack of scientific method or reporting in many cases. For one thing, the book contains a stark lack of works cited... I only recall a couple references to external sources in the whole text. In most cases, the origin of the information is just plain a mystery. In cases where it is either assumed or given that Steiger has investigated himself, there is generally just another colorful story in place of the hard facts you will often find in a serious report of the paranormal. The bottom line is that, although it remains entertaining, much of the book's content loses its ties to reality when details and references are glossed over.My other main point of discontent with Out of the Dark is the rather odd balance and selection of material found within. I approached this book having read several previous works that I would consider to be \\"tours of the paranormal,\\" and expected much of the same variety of content here. I was only half correct. There were, of course, the requisite chapters on sasquatches, lake monsters, and ghosts, and these were largely addressed very well. Other chapters were more unexpected and often less fulfilling. The chapter on vampires goes off several times on movie monsters and real life vampire cults, none of which are particularly mysterious or interesting in the realm of the paranormal, and yet the Chupacabra was only mentioned briefly. When discussing satanic possession, Steiger gets distracted with the topic of serial killers, many of which don't even seem to have any claim to being possessed. In the chapter on UFOs, one of the broadest and most heavily reported of the world's paranormal topics, there were very few actual cases cited. Instead, the author goes off on a tangent regarding his theories on aliens and UFOs.Ultimately I find Out of the Dark to be a middle-of-the-road experience in paranormal literature. On one hand we have an author who relates personal experiences with above average literary skill. Unfortunately, the sometimes questionable selection of material, the tendency to lose focus, and the lack of a decent scientific method really hampers the finished product. I would not recommend this book to the introductory paranormal reader... I think you can find a more balanced tour of the paranormal elsewhere. I would also not recommend this book to anyone wanting a scientific and factual presentation of the subject matter; there is a bit too much drama here. For the rest of us, Out of the Dark is a decent way to explore some of the less conventional topics in the paranormal realm, and the author's skill with presentation should keep you entertained."},{"Title":"Out Of The Dark: The Complete Guide to Beings from Beyond","review":"This book is pretty good if I do say so myself. I have been looking for a book about supernatural beings and paranormal entities for a while now, so I had to get this book when I so it. I'm glad to say that it didn't dissapoint me. Everything from ghosts, bigfoot, werewolf and sea-type creatures to the creatures of fairy, demons and alien type figures. And this book didn't overly sensationalize things either. For instance, the section on vampires makes it fairly clear that MOST vampire cases are simply people who thrive off of warm blood.... not necessarily the sexy, super-powerful undead beings shown in hollywood. It also talks about the reality of demons and how they do indeed manifest themselves and sometimes harass people in physical ways but that there are many \\"human\\" monsters who are simply possessed by these ill beings. All in all, this book is excellent for those who take any sort of interest in the world beyond."},{"Title":"Out Of The Dark: The Complete Guide to Beings from Beyond","review":"A vicious Bigfoot creature who decapitates intruders in the mysterious Nahanni Valley!

He's been researching the paranormal for a very long time, and, as such, lives in a slightly different reality than our own. All of the things he covers in this book, from lake monsters to Bigfoot to aliens, are all very real to him. Their exact nature, however remains in doubt. And therein lies the value in this book.It's really not much of a 'guide.' What he does is collect first-person accounts of phenomena, collate them by category, and offer up some speculative tissue here and there. I won't deny that, although I'm sure his witnesses believe what they say, I often found my eyebrow arching in skepticism or, alternatively, thinking of a plausible explanation for what's occurred. However, there are more than enough experiences here that make me genuinely wonder about the existence of these entities.While he covers a lot of the 'classic' paranormal cases, the vast majority of instances related here by Steiger have taken place since 1980, which brings the book closer to our era, and therefore more relatable. It's not as easy to scoff at an event that occurred in the 90s and was reported by upstanding citizens.Steiger makes a factual error here and there (the Lawton he writes about is in Oklahoma, not Texas), and his speculations tend to be presented as facts. He doesn't seem interested in providing more than one explanation for an occurrence, and when he does, he won't choose the 'more likely' scenario. Steiger seems less interested in analyzing the paranormal and more interested in throwing as many different cases at us as possible, and often ending speculative sections with open-ended questions. While this writing style isn't without it's charms, I'd rather read a discussion that covers these questions, whether it draws a hard conclusion or not.However, it's to his credit that I remain open-minded about the vast majority of phenomena Steiger presents in this book. To the Hardcore Skeptic, I ask if all the people who report these things can be mistaken or delusional? Statistics say no. To the True Believer, I say 'try to remember to examine all the possibilities before jumping to conclusions.'The True Believer will find a lot to love in this book. The Hardcore Skeptic will find a lot to hate. To the open-minded among us, though, it's a fun, albeit occasionally eyebrow-raising, read."},{"Title":"Out Of The Dark: The Complete Guide to Beings from Beyond","review":"It kept me on the edge of my seat with each reading.

They meet and dream of their former lives and of course fall in love again.All great romances are unrealistic, in that they are so rare, but they are wonderful to read about.This book doesn't have the amount of pre-life flashbacks I would have enjoyed reading about and the depth is simplistic on both characters and descriptions of the world around them. I wish there was more concentration on that, especially of their lives before; but the book was a nice read and a certain escape from the world around most readers."},{"Title":"Time After Time","review":"This is a very quick read.

Most of these stores will sell you the plant but will not give you any information about it. This is the reason why I needed a book that would help me identify my cacti and give me care instructions specific to each species. Well, that is exactly what this book will do for you.The author of the book makes no assumptions about your background (you don't need to be a biologist or anything to benefit from it).The very first section provides a guide that helps you narrow down the possible genera of your cacti by simply looking at its basic shape and other visible characteristics (like type of spines, number of ribs, type of clustering, etc.). Once you've chosen a set of possible genera, you go to the main section and look inside the chapter corresponding to each of the genera you chose. Inside each chapter you will find an item for each species that belongs to that genus. Each of these items contains a color photograph which will make it very easy to make a final decision about what species your cactus belongs to.Each item will give you additional information like a list of synonyms for the species, a brief paragraph describing the plant, its country of origin, cultivation details, the shape of the plant (when fully grown), it tells you whether it is day or night flowering, the length of the flowering period, how much light it needs, the type of compost it needs, and the minimum temperature required.As a bonus, the book contains a brief section about cultivation techniques (only four pages long)."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cacti: Over 1200 Species Illustrated and Identified","review":"This book is an excellent work for identification of cactus. It describes the proper growing conditions separately for each species, including sun vs. shade, kind of soil and hardiness to cold.Nearly every variety of nearly every genera is listed and shown, with more than one picture of the cactus, if necessary, to facilitate identification (generally, one of the whole plant, one of the flower). Very complete descriptions of the cacti are provided, including the number and color of the thorns and other minutae.The book has a handy finding-guide in the front, arranged by gross features (columnar vs. barrel vs. sprawling, etc.) to make it as easy as possible to identify an unknown plant.Cactus from all environments are covered, including tropical, epiphytic and desert varieties.Note that cacti, like all plants, are ultimately identified by their flowers; in particular, two cacti from much different native climates - and requiring much different cultivation environments - often look very similar; it is the flowers that distinguish them. This book cannot erase that reality - many cacti (again, like any other plant) cannot be fully identified unless they are in bloom.This book is also not a tutorial for growing cacti. ...This Illustrated Encyclopedia is a reference work, though the beautiful pictures make it an excellent coffee-table book as well. Indeed, opening the book randomly to nearly any page reveals breathtaking photography of cacti at their finest.If you want to have no more that _two_ books on growing cacti, I recommend this Illustrated Encyclopedia ...."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cacti: Over 1200 Species Illustrated and Identified","review":"While the cover to this book was a bit more distressed than was described in the seller's review overall I'm very, very happy with my purchase.

That's why, when I discovered that the actual content exceeded my expectations; I was a delighted.I would recommend this book as well as the seller to anyone who wants solid content, wonderful pictures that truly help identify the many variety of cacti described within, and a bit of good information regarding caring for these types of plants."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cacti: Over 1200 Species Illustrated and Identified","review":"I purchased this book to help me identify the specimens in my growing cacti collection and while this book is very thorough in covering the subject matter, I found that it made no effort to note which of the many many cacti represented in the various chapters were likely to be the one I'd just purchased from my local retail sources. The photos are wonderful, with very good detail, although I would have preferred a picture showing both overall cactus shape as well as the closeup details of ribs, spines and flowers. Some specimens are only shown as flowers, which does not help with the identification process. And while I understand that there are many common names for the various cacti listed, it would have been helpful to have a few of them listed for each cactus (with a disclaimer of course) and included in the index."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cacti: Over 1200 Species Illustrated and Identified","review":"This author has been very prolific over the years and I would rate this the best book of the bunch.

Armantrout has attempted to standardize the terms and definitions used in inventorying and analyzing aquatic habitats. This is a difficult task due to the variety of disciplines involved. Hydrology, climatology, geomorphology, meteorology, and ecology are just a few of the fields contributing terms to this glossary. In many instances, terms associated with aquatic habitats have different meanings within different disciplines and organizations.In every field of science, the ability to exchange and compare data is critical. This can not be done if researchers and scientists do not share a common language. Armantrout's glossary is an effort to facilitate scientific exchange and prevent misunderstanding. Over 2,200 aquatic habitat terms are defined. Where appropriate, more than one definition is provided. Definitions are brief: usually no more than one to three sentences. Occasionally, a definition will be accompanied by an illustration, though this is infrequent. A typical page contains twenty-five to thirty terms with plenty of space between terms. The result is a glossary that is easy to access and read. Many of the entries contain &quot;see&quot; references to other terms. These terms appear in italicized print and are quite numerous.This glossary is recommended to academic libraries, large public libraries, and those special libraries devoted to the biological and physical sciences. The book's approach is wide ranging. Consequently, researchers from diverse scientific fields will find it useful. Input from the members of several scientific societies was received by the compiler of this glossary; yet, it is not overly technical and will appeal to amateur naturalists as well as students writing research papers."},{"Title":"God's Joyful Runner","review":"Russell Ramsay has done a magnificent job in bringing to print the life of this truly outstanding human being. His athletic prowess was unmatched, but it was his devotion to God and his fellow man which made him so exceptional. The son of a missionary, he spent his formative years in China before returning to school in Britain. Whilst an undergraduate at Edinburgh University, he represented Scotland in Rugby Union. However, under the careful eye of the college athletics coach, he was transformed into a world class sprint champion. By 1924, Liddell and his great rival Harold Abrahams had established themselves as automatic choices for the Paris Olympics.When the schedules were announced, the 100m heats and relay heats were on a sunday. Liddell declined to run on the sabbath and received much criticism in the national press. Finally, a solution was found and he was entered in the 400m, a race in which he had little experience. He made it through to the final and was given no chance against two world record holders. Running in the outside lane, he ran the race of his life to win the most popular gold medal of the games in a new world record time. He also won bronze in the 200m. The following year he retired from athletics to pursue his calling as a missionary in China, where he devoted the rest of his life to the Lord's work. Eric Liddell was a shining example of humanitarian spirit coupled with grace and humility. His legacy can only inspire us to follow our dreams and bring comfort to those who are in need."},{"Title":"God's Joyful Runner","review":"This is heartwarming work of the famous Scot made infamous by &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; fame.This is the Liddell families' authorized bio, especially from family info from his daughter, Patricia, and sister Jenny.What this work provides in addition and correction to the movie and Sally Magnusson's book, is more into his Christian character and what made him what he was, not a movie hero, but a Christian who ran for God and country.What was especially encouraging for me to learn is that what previously had been debunked as myth, that of an American sprinter giving Eric a note prior to an Olympics race, was in fact given to him by an American team trainer. The note quoted from the Bible said: &quot;He that honors Me, I will honor.&quot; This could be the epiphetat for Liddell's life and this great book.Born of Scottish Missionaries to China, Liddell learns to live away from family at an early age. He survives and thrives on athletics, humility, and his faith in Christ. These all continue to grow and develop. While most would claim his Olympic fame of resisting competition on the Sabbath, certainly Eric would always hold to his service as missionary to China, where his earthly life is taken. As the confessional church body I am proud to serve within takes great interest in education of the young, so did Liddell, who said: &quot;It is very hard to build up a church for people who have no literature, where 80% are illiterate. The educationalist must follow on with the evangelist.&quot;One of Eric's university profs said it well of him: &quot;Eric never made you feel he was being holy or superior. He just showed you the better thing to do, and everyone wanted to do it.&quot;Super read of one of the churches and athletics great heroes.

He was equally at home in anthropology, sociology, and philosophy. He was a fiercely independent thinker, full of original ideas and a healthy scepticism for the prevailing orthodoxies in all of these fields. His prose style was refreshingly free of cant, and he eschewed the desiccated prose style of the typical academic. Gellner was witty, irreverent, and more likely to use an apt colloquialism than technical jargon. The intellectual world suffered a great loss with his passing in 1995.Gellner's \\"Conditions of Liberty\\" first attempts to define the essential features of civil society -- that is, Western-style liberal democracies -- and then attempts to explain its origins. (Gellner's use of the term \\"civil society\\" may have been inspired by Michael Oakeshott's use of the term in his book, \\"On Human Conduct,\\" but the analytical approaches of these two thinkers could not be more different.) Gellner contrasts civil society with the Islamic system, and with the system that was in place in the former Soviet Union.This short book is rich in insights too numerous to mention here. Among other things, Gellner explains the relationship between the emergence of nationalism and the development of civil society. He draws on Max Weber's ideas to show how changing conceptions of religion affected the evolution of civil society. And he offers some fascinating observations about why the Soviet system collapsed with so little resistance.This short book is so packed with fascinating ideas that I am willing to rate it as outstanding despite some uncharacteristic lapses in Gellner's writing. The usual wit and irreverence are there, but the editing and organization could have been better."},{"Title":"Heart Lessons: A Novel about the Spiritual Journey","review":"I* love a good story with characters that come to life for me. My other interest is for books that inspire and have spiritual significance. Never did I find one book that told an interesting story and also created a spiritual aura. Megan became so real to me that I found myself talking to her. The spiritual messages appeared throughout the story and were emphasized in the quotes at the beginning of each chapter.I found myself going back and rereading the quotes again and again.I bought a number of copies for friends and family as I will not part from my copy.

We appreciate the help and inspiration of our co-travelers - family, friends, co-workers and some \\"Professionals\\". The methods the professionals, teachers, writers, medical experts and others, use to help us are often at least somewhat obvious - but what about psychotherapists? We may have no experience with these people who work with our minds and no idea about how they proceed. For those who may be curious, Joanne Tatham's book \\"Heart Lessons\\" is a sharing of the brick by brick process of her companionship tool, psychotherapy. She describes how she accompanied one courageous client in a journey beyond a life limited by personal psychosocial chains brought from childhood. We see obsolete coping methods gradually being discarded as new choices evolve into freedom of character and resolution of conflict."},{"Title":"Heart Lessons: A Novel about the Spiritual Journey","review":"A delightful and well-written novel.

The movie was a success with even a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the Oscars. The novel doesn't disappoint either. It goes off with a slow start with a commonplace investigation of cheating at cards at M's favourite club known as Blades. Then on the intrgue and unanswered questions pile up and before long you are submerged in a thrilling game of deception and discovery.Interestingly, in this novel, James Bond doesn't leave United Kingdom, the entire adventure unfolding on homeground. 007 starts off dreading Monday office blues but by the end of the week he will be striving for his life and put all his skill and determination in saving England from a disaster of unimaginable proportions. There are guns, fast cars, gambling and a lovely lady to keep you hooked till the very end. The villain is unique, a national hero who is actually working against the nation that celebrates him. After the initial chapters depicting Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, you are caught into a climbing rocket of thrills and suspense. Its a \\"nail-biting\\" (haha, read the book and you will know) dash to save England and Bond will persevere through incredible hardships and danger (including gigantic rolls of newsprint) to save the day (or his weekend, eh?). A week in the life of 007 but only a few days for you as an addicted reader of this small novel.A great follow-up to the second novel and surprising twists of fate."},{"Title":"MOONRAKER - A James Bond 007 Adventure","review":"James Bond sets out to save his country and perhaps the world from the power hungry Hugo Drax in Fleming's third thriller in the 007 series."},{"Title":"Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using SAS, Second Edition","review":"This book is a good overview of how to implement in SAS some of the statistical methods you've probably already read about. I had done a lot of reading on factor analysis and clustering for my dissertation and needed a way to implement these methods in SAS. This book explains each method, then shows how to implement it using SAS. The data sets are from &quot;The Handbook of Small Data Sets&quot;, which I got from my local university library. As I am a computer scientist and not a statistician, I found this book very helpful in putting together **the idea** of a particular statistical technique with the actual **implementation** of that technique. I have the first edition of this book also, and the second edition is much improved (especially the chapters on clustering and factor analysis)."},{"Title":"Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using SAS, Second Edition","review":"Brian Everitt is the author of several very well-written statistical texts. Among them he has written a number that show how to implement statistical analyses usimg statistical software packages. This second edition of \\"A Handbook of Statistical Analyses using SAS\\" he has coauthored with Geoff Der.As a SAS user, I find this book very handy along with other similar texts that I have on the use of SAS. What is particularly good about this book is that it serves as a guide to the use of various SAS procedures and also as an illustration of appropriate statistical approaches to real applications using SAS.It starts out with a nice introduction to the SAS prrogramming language and its syntax and progresses through simple descriptive statistics to categorical data analysis to regression and analysis of variance and then on to more advanced topics, including survival analysis, logistic regression, generalized linear models,longitudinal data analysis, principle components, factor analysis and cluster analysis. Appendices provide SAS MACROs and SAS solutions to exercises in the text.What is particularly good about this book, that may set it apart from some of the others, is the expert statistical advice about the implementation and interpretation of results in SAS. They provide excellent scholarly references to the statistical literature to support their advice. As an example, I particularly liked their discussion of Type I and Type III sum of squares in the analysis of variance. They give a clear explanation of what each means and when they are equivalent and when they are different. In addition, they present their own view as to which is the appropriate one to use in given situations and support their view with quotes from other researchers. Opposing positions are also mentioned and referenced."},{"Title":"Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using SAS, Second Edition","review":"This book is very well written. Each topic is presented with an interesting example, including discussion. None of the topics are presented in great depth, so for example, this is not the book to use for learning factor analysis, or cluster analysis, etc. The real strength of the book is that it shows how to do the analysis using SAS in a clear and concise way. I would recommend this book highly for anyone who would like to get started using SAS."},{"Title":"Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using SAS, Second Edition","review":"The authors covered many topics in applied statistics, but they didn't mention anything about time series analysis. I am disappointed after reading this book. The biggest problem with this book is that it's overly simplistic - typically only one technique is illustrated for each topic - for example, in cluster analysis, only hierarchical clustering was mentioned and there was nothing about partitional algorithm. The authors only used very small datasets, which ignored the biggest power of SAS, the ability to handle large datasets. The authors also printed all raw datasets in the book, which took quite a bit of space.The authors should read Venables and Ripley's Modern Applied Statistics with SPlus first. Venables/Ripley made a great example on how to write an applied statistics book using a specific software."},{"Title":"Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using SAS, Second Edition","review":"I'm currently in a class that uses this book as a teaching text. It is a very handy instructive text- it's readable and informative. It's not for the beginner in statistics - you should have had some other formal training in statistical methods before this book becomes truly useful. I'm not new to statistics but I am definitely new to SAS and this has served as a fairly clear, informative approach to navigating the rather tetchy syntax of SAS coding. This is very much an introductory work however and only provides a very basic overview of the topic for the beginner.The only thing keeping this book from getting a full five stars is the index. The index is completely worthless with major gaps in topic listings - if I want to look up the syntax to print a box plot there is no way to do so using the index. If a command is listed, then it is often listed under the example heading - i.e. certain procedures were demonstrated using the example data set \\"Sandflies\\" and those procedures would be in the index under \\"Sandflies\\" instead of under their own name. There are also no chapter headings at the top of the page but that is a minor nuisance compared to the index.

Contrived, superficial and hopelessly lacking intellectual merit, it's main purpose is to promote not enlighten - promote Jeanine Pirro. Westchester County is one of those notoriously corrupt suburban areas that surround New York City. Politics is based on deal-making, influence peddling and back-scratching. Ms. Pirro - who narrowly escaped tax evasion charges several years ago - plays the game as well as anyone. She has pursued indictments against innocent people - mostly men - based on politics and publicity rather than justice. She has teamed with several prominent judges who have effectively become her personal judicial lap dogs.

Elected public officials would be well advised to heed the information set forth by DA Pirro. If they did so, stronger legislation would be enacted enabling the prosecution and punishment of offenders rather than wasting taxpayers dollars on coddling them.

In this book, Dr. Shalts may very well break through any lingering prejudice by providing an informed and expert introduction into the principles and practice of homeopathy in the context of modern medicine. At every point, Dr. Shalts emphasizes the safest ways in which homeopathy and traditional medicine can be responsible partners in the management of acute and chronic childhood health concerns. Dr. Shalts, as a faculty member of Beth Israel Medical Center certified in both family medicine and psychiatry and a homeopathic practitioner for over 20 years, is well positioned to describe and reconcile the differences between allopathic and integrative medical approaches, and to offer reasonable and sympathetic suggestions for families to discuss options with their healthcare team.Dr. Shalts discusses an astonishing range in these nine chapters, in an engaging manner with easy to read language. The important concepts are illustrated with case studies that describe treatment, management, and communication. The first four chapters serve as a valuable introduction to homeopathy for almost anyone, not just parents or families, and describe when to choose homeopathic or allopathic medicine. The second section describes what is needed for home treatment, with specifics for the most common acute conditions, such as colds or influenza, and when a patient should see a doctor.

For anyone with serious illiness, especially chronic sufferers of pain and acute disease, I highly recommend that one should always work with a trusted professional, and I strongly recommend browsing this book prior to selecting a homeopathic professional, and keeping it handy throughout any conversations and use of prescribed remedies.After reading the book and answering a few customer questions today, I am so pleased that I am ordering additional copies from Amazon.com to make the book immediately available to my own customers who request it."},{"Title":"The American Institute of Homeopathy Handbook for Parents: A Guide to Healthy Treatment for Everything from Colds and Allergies to ADHD, Obesity, and Depression","review":"I was looking (still haven't found) a book about homeopathic remedies, strengths and dosages.

Fiftyish former bartender Maggie Hawk recently won a sweepstakes that guarantees her 500K per year for twenty years. She wants Tony, who frequented her bar with exaggerated tales of his work, to look into the death of her husband George W. Hawk in 1966. Tony looks at the detailed information she provides him and agrees with the official ruling of suicide until she begins to make a case that her spouse did not kill himself; he was murdered to steal his invention, a safe lawnmower blade.Needing the money but feeling guilty as the clues will be cold and he has no experience with this type of inquiry Tony begins his investigation. He soon becomes convinced that people were paid off by the legendary lawnmower king Jason Woods to hide a homicide and a stolen invention, but how to prove it proves difficult especially when the target of his case offers him a job he cannot afford to refuse.Tony makes the case fun to follow as he fumbles and bumbles the investigation, but perhaps it is in the DNA because he keeps moving forward one clue at a time. The hero is apt to fail not only due to his lack of experience, but also he is going up against a highly regarded superheavyweight who has much more power than when he seemingly bribed the world three decades ago.

It's questionable at first if Tony has the, uh, aptitude to investigate this long-dead case-- thus far his forays into solving crimes and misdemeanors have earned him only an apartment full of shabby furniture, a refrigerator full of low-end domestic beer, and an ancient auto. But off goes Tony through a labyrinth of crossing paths-- from esteemed professors at Rice University to gay bars and their sometimes surprising patrons, from a high schoo! l football star turned big-bellied baseball fanatic to the richest of Houston's rich to the pinnacles of political power. And, in the midst of it all-- the seemingly clear-cut autopsy photos, the clear-eyed newly rich widow who KNOWS who killed her husband and why-- stands the forlorn and baffling lawnmower...Lawnmower Blues captures your attention like rapid gunfire-- and I promise you will not stop reading this book until Anderson's done with you.

The cloud sneaks him into the cloud factory assigned for his sector of the planet, and some funny adventures ensue. Some of Wiesner's dreamlike fantasy stories are surreal in an Alice-in-Wonderland way - depending on the reader, it could be wonderful or disorienting. This one is mostly fun, and is very funny. The only potentially concerning element is that the boy sneaks onto the cloud factory property, and gets in trouble for it while the grownups running the show are shown to be a little silly. For a child with authority issues this book might help to feed a rebellious heart. Aside from this, the wonderful artwork, the masterful use of images to tell the story without words, and the strikingly original story concept makes this worth having."},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"I loved the art in this book.

Just the notion that clouds arrive, depart, and accept shape assignments from matter-of-fact bureaucrats is charming, but the pictures of all this are wonderful. The only drawback to this book is that is is hard to determine which sectors all the rest of us live in. A bigger, clearer look at the grid on the globe would have been nice."},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"Sector SevenSector Seven, by David Wiesner, is a story of how a little boy learns to use his creativity to give back to the world his own dreams and fantasies. On one cloudy day, a little boy goes on a school field trip to the Empire State Building. There he meets a fantastic cloud creature who takes him on a wild adventure to a cloud factory in the sky called Sector Seven. While on his adventure, he uses his talent for drawing to inspire the clouds in the sky to make their own perceptions and realities. What the author has done is to tell in a children's story how in our lives we have the power, if we choose, to make an impact on others. He encourages readers take their different talents and ideas and share them with the world to make a change; to learn from the perspectives of others and allow them to learn from ours. Overall, Sector Seven is done very well. Since this book is a wordless picture book, the illustrations have to carry the narrative of the story, which it does nicely. I thought that the illustrations could have used a little more color; the illustrator used mostly shades of gray and blue. However, I would guess that the author wants to give the impression of a &quot;cloudy day,&quot; and from this perspective, the colors fit the plot of the story. The illustrations of the factory scenes are a bit confusing because the illustrator places the pictures of the main characters on top of other scenes within the factory. Since the effect produces the sensation of several actions happening simultaneously, the story is sometimes hard to follow. I understood the author's intention of this book much better after reading the introduction within the jacket cover. I would suggest to any person who is reading this book, to look at this introduction before going on to the rest of the story. You will have much clearer perception of the direction in which David Wiesner is trying to take Sector Seven."},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This is a georgous picture book that takes you on an imaginative cloud journey.

The boy uses his talents to give the unhappy clouds an eye-opening makeover. Wiesner's illustrations create an expressive story. His detailed pictures work together to make the story understandable and interesting. To enhance the mood and atmosphere of the story, Wiesner uses the choice of bold, friendly watercolors and unique frames throughout the book. The frames are presented in chronological order either top to bottom, left to right, or back to front. Sector 7 gives the reader's mind a chance to unwind and expand beyond its imaginable limits.

I just didn't have the same enthusiasm the other readers had for these illustrations, and neither did my children. They are interesting to look through once, but I am not thrilled with how they are sized and layed out on a page, in addition to the manner in which they are drawn.

David Wiesner amazes readers once again with another wordless book that tells the incredible adventure of a young boy who goes on a field trip to the Empire State Building. The imaginative and creative young boy yearns to express his creativity meanwhile he is approached by a friendly cloud that takes for a tour of Sector 7 where clouds are created for this portion New York City. Sector 7 resembles an old train station with departure and arrival times posted which provide clouds with their assigned locations. The boy encounters clouds that are bored with their usual shapes. With a wild imagination and skilled artistry, he designs inspiring shapes that excite the clouds. When the staff discovers the changes, they are perturbed by the clouds that stray from their usual and regimented routines. The boy is sent back to his class field trip. However there is no undoing the chaos he has created which begins to spread out across Sector 7.Evaluation: David Wiesner's Caldecott Honor award winning book allows readers to create the text and interpretations within their minds. Wiesner's wordless tale captures your mind with its full page watercolor illustrations and story board formatted frames. The vivid, yet soft watercolor illustrations provide humor combined with elegance. Readers can create their own individual stories based on their personal experiences.

The theme of flying is present here, as in all of Wiesner's books, and the fanciful creative nature of Wiesner's story and illustrations (paintings?) are not to be missed.

Don't hesitate!"},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"A young boy rides with his class field trip to the Empire State Building on a cold, winter's day. Along the way, he draws elaborate pictures of animals on the fog on the windows. It's foggy on the observation platform, too; so foggy and cloudy in fact that he can't see anything. Imagine his surprise when a passing cloud takes off his scarf and hat! The boy is then invited on a journey with the cloud, and is swept off through the sky towards a large, submarine-like flying machine. It looks like something out of Jules Verne hovering there, with large funnels like curved smokestacks on it. There is a large clock showing the seasons of the year and a huge sign reading SECTOR 7. Going through one of the funnels, the boy and the cloud find themselves in a large room not unlike Grand Central Station, with people announcing arrivals and departures of different types of clouds. There are people in an office wearing sleeve garters and old style eye visors passing out blueprints to the clouds, showing their new formations. Well, the boy is a fine artist, after all, and he whips up a few blueprints of his own!! The clouds transform into fantastical geometric and detailed animal shapes. Needless to say, the engineers in charge are not pleased to see this, and though they press their own blueprints on the clouds, what happens outside of the flying sub is really up to the clouds themselves. &quot;Sector 7&quot; is by the same author who brought us the award winning book, &quot;Tuesday.&quot; Similar to that work, &quot;Sector 7&quot; is a story told entirely without words. The artwork is detailed and lush, and one could easily pour over the drawings time and time again and notice something new that you had never noticed before. Indeed, &quot;Sector 7&quot; makes more and more sense the more you read it, mostly because each time you open the book you DO notice something else. Since the story is told without words and is a just a tad surreal, very young readers may not get as much out of it as their older peers. Children who have active imaginations, however, could easily get behind this story, and I can imagine them looking at the illustrations for hours, imagining their own flying submarines in the sky. I've used this book in writing classes before, encouraging students to compose their own text to this story, and have usually gotten very creative, good results!! Art teachers could use this book as well as an example of realistic detail in their work. I personally love &quot;Sector 7&quot; and press it on as many readers as I possibly can. Adults generally seem to love it as much as children, which is perhaps one of the highest compliments that can be paid for any book: universal interest and appreciation. If you know and love &quot;Tuesday&quot; or have never even heard of Mr. Wiesner, I strongly urge you to get your hands on this wonderful book!!"},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"I had the wonderful opportunity to see David Wiesner's incredibly lush and gorgeous art at an invitational showing at the Art Institute here in Chicago (an exhibit of Caldecott Medal Winnners) and I was impressed. Wiesner's talent for fantasy and unreality are so thrown upon the viewer, and each picture of his tells a thousand stories. Wiesner's books (by no means not only for children) are each telling a story entirely subjective to the viewer. In a way, they access our subconscious and unconscious, imitating a Rorshach test or an interpretation of random scenes presented from a psychologist."},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"When David Wiesner's imagination is fleshed out on paper, the results are to be celebrated. In a era when Pokemon and unimaginative and violent television cartoons have become national obsessions for our children, it is a joy to see works such as this published for all to consume. His zest for storytelling and feel for what it is to be a kid are so vibrantly evident in Sector 7. Only someone as talented as Wiesner would have dared to take on the challenge of visualizing clouds and fog in such dramatic fashion. My son was enraptured with the story as he was with Tuesday, Wiesner's earlier book about flying frogs. I would encourage everyone to read this book and others like it to their children and drag them away from their television sets. We owe it to our children to stir up their imaginations. Three cheers to David Wiesner and Sector 7 for providing the spoon!"},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"David Wiesner has produced another delightful book! No text, but a picture is worth a thousand words - his charming illustrations tell the story in a way that will make you grin from ear to ear. Great for pre-readers, but they might have to wrestle it away from the grown-ups first. This book should be under alot of Christmas trees this year!"},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This is yet another great book by author/illustrator David Wiesner. This is a story about a boy who goes on a field trip to the Empire State Building. As a result of complete cloud cover the boy makes friends with a unique character, a cloud. The cloud takes the boy to &quot;Sector 7&quot; where all clouds are made by boring, uninspired beings. The boys spices things up by creating factastic shapes for the clouds. The boy is kicked out of Sector 7 by those beings who do not appreciate his artistic ability. After the boy is gone the clouds revolt and what follows is a delight for the eyes! This almost wordless picture book stretches the imagination and keeps you guessing page after page about what you will see next."},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This is a wildly inventive and complex story, well served by Wiesner's artistic skill and coherence. From the textured, &quot;cloudy&quot; endpapers, through the carefully framed drawings celebrating the design of the Empire State Building, to the glorious burst of unframed beauty in the clouds, every detail carries part of this exciting adventure. (It is my own belief, by the way, that the clouds, having seen the boy's drawings on the bus window, come get him , in particular, to draw new designs for them. His visit to Sector 7 is no accident!) The repeated and varied use of frames, the intense architectural sensibility, and the freshness of the boy's bright red cap, scarf and gloves pull the reader into the story at a dizzying pace that feels like flying. Feel free to share it with children if you're in a generous frame of mind -- but keep it for yourself!"},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"David Wiesner is best described as a light-hearted Chris Van Allsburg. In his books there tends to be a very real and deep fascination with both the sky and breaking away from convention. For example, his book \\"Tuesday\\" examines the repercussions of frogs flying at night. \\"The Three Pigs\\", by contrast, takes a familiar story and loosens it up considerably. With \\"Sector 7\\", a wordless tale of a boy and his cloud, Wiesner tells a tale of changing the status quo. It's sometimes very difficult to find noteworthy wordless picture books out there but Wiesner appears to have an excellent grasp on this rarely appreciated genre.When a boy goes on a school field trip to the Empire State Building, he little suspects what a thrilling adventure he's about to have. Initially, he's disappointed. At the top of the tower the world is engulfed in a thick fog. Yet out of this fog, an unlikely friend appears. A little cloud, nicking the boy's hat and scarf for fun, quickly befriends the awed child and invites him up up up into the sky. Riding on the cloud's back, the boy nears the processing station for Sector 7 (a sector that covers the general New York area with some space given to the Atlantic Ocean as well). Boy and cloud pass through Receiving and enter the Assignment Station. While there, they hear the complaints of other clouds. The assignments are fine, but they're so dull. Just the usual puffy fluffiness we see all the time in the sky. With a little imagination, the boy convinces the clouds to try out new forms. It seems they're particularly adept at the shapes of tropical fish. Of course, the people in charge of the Sector 7 plant aren't pleased with the clouds' new shapes. Yet after the boy has gone home, it's clear that his influence is being carried on by people who like the idea of doing things a little differently.Mr. Wiesner's the master of the clever little detail. As parents and children go through this book (its wordless quality makes it an ideal gift for anyone, regardless of age or nationality) they find themselves discovering new little details with every read. Did you catch the reason why the boy draws fish from the last shot in the book? How about the ways in which the clouds wordlessly describe their boredom with previous assignments? When I think of watercolors, I don't tend to think of highly accentuated details. Just the same, Wiesner has tamed this highly adaptable medium to his own particular wants and needs. He cleverly lets the boy's personal cloud continue to wear the kid's bright red cap throughout the book so that the reader can tell it apart from other cloudlings. And there is no doubt left in the reader's mind that the Sector 7 processing plant is truly New Yorkian. Resembling a kind of cross between a train station and an immaculate subway stop, this is a cosmopolitan factory if ever there was one.If you've never read a Wiesner to your child and aren't entirely certain where to start, it's hard to go wrong with \\"Sector 7\\". Understandably, many see this as their favorite Wiesner book. And while on paper I state that \\"The Three Pigs\\" is his magnum opus, I confess that \\"Sector 7\\" may be the one I love the most. A sweet and ultimately satisfying little book."},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"David Weisner is an absolute treasure. We bought Sector 7 and enjoyed &quot;reading&quot; this outstanding picture book. The artwork is beautiful, and incredibly rich. I've read it to my son several times and am still finding more details.It's nice to discuss each picture with my son. I believe that we're developing some valuable communication skills.We also enjoy Free Falling and June 29th 1999 from David Weisner. Don't let your children grow up without introducing them to these treasures!"},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"I really loved this book as an adult, and what makes it even better is that my son is nuts about it as well.Because there are no words, he can tell the story to me. I think books like this teach children to look at the details and to study facial expressions.This book is Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This is an absolutely beautiful book, with a wonderful message about non-conformity and the power of imagination. The illustrations are wonderful, too. The whole book has a very dreamy, magical quality, but at the same time, also a very clear and interesting story line. I pick up new details in the characters' expressions every time I read it. I think I will be buying this book as a gift for children and adults for many years to come. I recently went away to visit relatives in a foreign country, and this book, with a magnificent story but no words (no need for words), was an excellent gift idea for the kids. I've taken out a few of Wiesner's other books from the library and so far, this is my favourite by far. I have already bought three copies to give as gifts. I never manage to keep one for myself, because I always find someone I want to give one to. Within a few years, I think everyone I know will have a copy! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"Of all the children's books I have read, this one stands out as my all time favorite. I love to write, and treasure the words in good stories, but Sector 7 needs no words to be understood. All you have to do is read the pictures, and let your imagination do the rest.A little boy with artistic talent draws in the fog on the window of the schoolbus that is taking his class on a field trip to the Empire State Building. When the children arrive, they rush to the top only to find that it is completely cloudy. There is zero visibility, nothing but clouds. This makes it easy for one friendly cloud to make friends with the boy, and whisk him away to Sector 7, a cloud factory in the sky. The clouds are bored with their round and blobby shapes, so the boy puts his talent to work to draw plans for new cloud shapes. The clouds begin to reinvent themselves into interesting new forms. It doesn't take long before the powers that be take notice, and search for the culprit. The boy is immediately caught and sent back to join his class. You'd think it would end there, but his precocious little cloud friends has other plans. The ending of this book is delightful, as the boy begins to see the difference he made take hold in the sky. My favorite illustration is the boy asleep at the end. Even I , as an adult, think that sleeping on a cloud would be heavenly.This book is magical for children and adults alike. If you are familiar with David Wiesner's work or not, Sector 7 is a special treat."},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This book is wordless and so shall you be when you finish it. I'm an EQ coach and help people develop their right-brains - so starved in today's world.

Pretend you bought it for your child or grandchild, and dive in -- or rather float away. It's marvelous!"},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"My 5 year old loves this book and wants to read it a couple of times a week. He always asks new questions as he points out things he hadn't discovered last time. Even telling this story (since there are no words) changes each time as you(as the reader) will surely discover more things as well."},{"Title":"Sector 7 (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"I love how this book can be used by a large variety of ages. the story is so creative and fun, but can be made complicated for older kids. Because it's a picture book, it can be as simple or elaborate as you want it to be. Kids really have fun helping tell the story without feeling like the have to read."},{"Title":"Semiparametric Regression (Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics)","review":"David Ruppert and Ray Carroll have been a research team for over 25 years. They have published many articles and books on regression analysis. These articles are always very clearly written and are great at showing the big picture and not just the nitty gritty details of the theorems that they prove. Two of my favorite books that they published are \\"Transformations and Weighting in Regression\\" published by Chapman & Hall in 1988 and \\"Measurement Error in Nonlinear Models \\" with Stefanski in 1995 and also published by Chapman & Hall.This book is no exception. It is lucid in expostion and paints a general picture summarizing the area of nonparametric regression models and incorporating them with parametric regression both linear and nonlinear.Their work has also been motivated by the desire to extend the theory of regression models to practical problems where the standard theory with assumptions such as linearity, normality, and homogeneity of variance don't hold.In the first chapter, they motivate their methods through a number of examples in the areas of health science and environmental pollution problems. Chapter two goes through the standard linear regression models and the diagnostic checks for those models. They also cover other practical issues including model selection, use of transformations and extensions to nonlinear models. The special case of polynomial regression (a particular example of linear regression) is presented in detail.Chapter 3 on scatterplot smoothing introduces many of the key ideas to their approach to semiparametric regression. Their approach in its most general form is based on mixed models which are introduced in chapter 4. Chapter 5 deals with automated methods for implementing the scatterplot smoothing techniques. The remaining chapters cover for example, simple semiparametric models, additive models, semiparametric mixed models, and generalized parametric models which include the very useful generalized linear models that they have extended to cover mixed effects.The generalized additive models of Tibshirani and Hastie are covered in chapter 11, Other important issues including variance function estimation, accounting for measurement error, Bayesian approaches and more are covered in the latter chapters (12-17), Finally in chapter 18 seven examples are introduced to illustrate applications of the various methods. An epilogue, chapter 19, was written to motivate further research.Many of these chapter are the subjects of whole monographs including some that Ruppert and Carroll have co-authored. In the preface they say that the book is intended for three potential audiences. The first audience is the students and scientists with interest in applying the techniques or learning about them but possess at most a moderate background in regression. The second audience (the group I would put myself in)are the biostatisticians ,econometricians and scientists in other disciplines who have a good working knowledge of regression and want to add the flexibility of semiparametric methods to their arsenal of techniques. The third group is the researchers in nonparametric regression who may not yet know about some of the new advances of Carroll, Ruppert and Wand that are included in this text.I find in general that their books are masterpieces. As a statistician who has done both applied and theoretical work, I know what it takes to write books that summarize a body of theory or connect the theory and applications, or incorporate new results. These authors do both of these things in this book. They have the rare talent to find a way to unify and simplify existing theory and that is another great feature you will find in this book.I haven't been able to do that and only a few others that I know can. One example that comes to my mind is the book on extremes by Leadbetter, Lindgren and Rootzen. At the time if of publication in 1978, they provided a unified theory for extremes combining the theory for independent and dependent cases. They also provide some examples in the bppk. But even that landmark book is heavily theoretical. Ruppert, Carroll and Wand emphasize applications and provide a number of examples throughout."},{"Title":"The Choice","review":"Widowed Deputy Jessica McGuire chooses a small town as a new start for herself and her son. Deputy McGuire deals with a teenage son going through ch-changes and tries to convince the Dukes of Hazzard male law enforcement colleagues that a missing goat, a cow drained of its blood, a stolen redwood cross, and a desecrated infant grave with a missing baby skeleton add up to \\"Something wicked this way comes.\\"This classic tale of good and evil takes on the good old boys' small town network, single motherhood, the eternal struggle to raise children with good values, and our tendency to become immune to damaging messages. A determined single mom with a shotgun works wonders."},{"Title":"The Choice","review":"Like most mystery books should this one is definitely scary. It is about finding who you really are, and about taking the right path. But if you are into frightening stories, like me, this is definitely a great one."},{"Title":"The Choice","review":"Though the town is her deceased husband's home and he died eight years ago, Jessica McGuire raises her fourteen year old son Jonathan in Lawrenceville, California, at the foothills of the Sierra. Jessica serves as the town's resident deputy reporting to the Lupine County sheriff. Most of her work involves speeding and lesser offenses so that her superior never takes anything she does seriously even if she solved a murder last year.While jogging Jessica notices that someone desecrated the grave of an infant taking the remains with them. Later widower Pastor David Tanner informs her that an individual stole a valueless small cross from the church. Finally, Letty Burns tells Jessica that one of her beloved kids (goat that is) was abducted. Although her boss scoffs at her, Jessica and David believe firmly that a Satanist cult is doing the petty crimes. When a teen commits suicide and her son acts strange beyond raging hormones, Jessica wonders if the devil worshippers are hooked by what David describes as seemingly nice friendly people by day.This is an exhilarating police procedural that feels somewhat like an amateur sleuth cozy because the heroine, though she follows the book, lacks experience in investigations and her partner is a pastor. The trouble in Lawrenceville is cleverly constructed at a leisurely pace so that like Sheriff Boone, the audience thinks it is teen pranks. The fully developed characters bring to life Lupine County with the maxim that even small isolated rural areas have some of the problems that confront big cities. Sub-genre readers will find this is a fine choice as Marilyn Meredith furbishes a solid investigative tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Choice","review":"If you feel like getting a little &quot;spooked&quot; and you don't have much time, this is a great book.

However, speaking as someone who is performance-minded, I gotta think this one goes a bit overboard. It's not the controversy -- heck, I'm Catholic myself and the jokes don't bother me -- but some of the bits included require a bit more skill than your average person has. What if no one in your production can play the accordion? Or the piano? Or balance a ladder on his chin? And while I enjoyed learning to make balloon animals for &quot;The Complete History of America,&quot; who the heck do you call to teach you how to juggle flaming torches?

I saw a couple of the last beach races from WAY too close, just before the track opened too.I worked that track many a time later, in the infield, on the apron, doing whatever..This book has it about right.Oh there are a few things glossed over, France fanaticism and 'tax free status', and such but over all it's a decent retelling of a odd time in American history that when the cars finally go, will never come again.This whole series, Images in America is a wonderful frozen moment in time, usually written by some crotchety old local type or matron. The prose is sometimes a little uneven, the pacing often slow, but the WEALTH of data in there is so rich that it's worth enduring..(btw, later I used to be on a first name basis with female serial killer Eileen Wournos, pick her up thumbing and lived to tell about it!... Makes me the only man alive to ride with Fireball and Eileen.. and they wonder why I moved to the panhandle!)L.McD."},{"Title":"Arthur and the Lost Kingdoms","review":"&quot;Arthur and the Lost Kingdoms&quot; is an interesting work, going into the history of the north of Britain in the Iron Age, Roman period, and post-Roman centuries. Moffat makes a good case for a historical Arthur, who was based out of the ancient Welsh-speaking north, which is now the Scottish borderlands. It's good to get to know something about this Arthur, or at least the times in which the historical war-leader Arthur would have lived, in a genuine historical context, rather than a mythological or semi-legendary context only. For anyone who's a fan of the stories of Arthur, or fascinated by the history of the so-called &quot;Dark Ages&quot; in Britain, this will be an informative book. Be prepared for a lot of references to the P-Celtic and Q-Celtic language subgroups, British tribal names, and some other references which might be obscure to the novice. Some of Moffat's evidence is largely supposition, but he really does dig up some nice history, and he's not overbearing. It's worth reading."},{"Title":"Arthur and the Lost Kingdoms","review":"I wanted to like this book more than I did. There is some very interesting historical information here that is obscured by weak organization and distanced by annoying writing.Give Moffat his due. He covers the historical sources but also goes beyond them, using place names and traditional narrative to ferret out Arthur's historical roots, much like a folklorist would. He is also a wary critic of his material and good at pointing out the improbable elements in received explanations. You have to appreciate anyone who refers to the ecclesiastical chronicles of Bede, et. al., as \\"propaganda.\\"Moffat's background is in television production, and it shows in two ways. First, it his organization of the book. There is no overview or thesis that clearly sets out the direction he intends to follow or the argument he means to support. Rather, much like a History Channel or Discovery documentary, he teases the story along with interesting sidelights and elaborations, then promises to get to the point -- but only after a series of more bunny trails. There is a real sense of using all the research just because he dug it up or of writing to fit some predetermined length. Interesting stuff, but a loosely wrapped ball of yarn.Secondly, Moffat's writing style is straight TV-speak. Fractured sentences, stand-alone dependent clause, indefinite references, and awkward phrasing are standard features. Perhaps the book was actually dictated, not written out. The text has a TV narration feel to it that might work if it were nuanced by a speaker's delivery, but is difficult to accommodate off the page.The lack of language facility is particularly notable since Moffat puts so much emphasis on linguistic reconstructions and etymological interpretations. A guy with his respect for ancient languages should show a little more for the one we're using now.In all, this book is pretty much worth the effort to read it because it separates Arthur from the fictional accretions built around him and provides a probable historical origin for him. The evidence for Arthur is somewhat vague, but Moffat makes a determined effort to find the reliable elements and piece them into a plausible picture of the man, his times, and the long stretch of history that preceded him. There is value in even the last of those accomplishments."},{"Title":"Arthur and the Lost Kingdoms","review":"Alistair Moffat is an entertaining author and has a very good grasp on Scottish history, and especially Borders Scotland history. I enjoyed his hunt for an Arthur in the Borders. His premises are well researched, well explained and quite possibly the answer. Or at least one answer!"},{"Title":"Arthur and the Lost Kingdoms","review":"Wow. This isn't an easy read - especially compared to Moffat's \\"Before Scotland\\" which I read last year. Brilliant book by the way. \\"Arthur and the Lost Kingdom\\" is full of information about the local area in lowland Scotland where the author grew up. Especially his explanations about changing place names in history are interesting - but also a bit dry. I'd say that one really has to love the subject to enjoy the book. I did and enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"Arthur and the Lost Kingdoms","review":"If I was born and lived in Scotland, this is the book I would have written. Brings together a lot of hard-to-conjure history, especially about 400-600 A.D. Anyone who has tried to read about the ancient kingdom of Strathclyde will find most of what he has searched for and gleaned from various sources, placed neatly into the context of Moffat's \\"Arthur\\". Local traditions and place-names are used as much for his sources as the archealogical and historic records, which are scant for this period; so, Arthur is revealed to the reader not all at once, but in morsels. Moffat allows us to experience the tickle of anticipation, as we are enthralled by the story of the Britons."},{"Title":"Exile Armies","review":"In the Second World War the Allies, especially the British, attempted to make use of forces from various contries conquered by the Germans. Perhaps the most successful of these were the Free French under de Gaulle, which fought along side American and British forces during the invasion of France. Another famous group was the Polish pilots in the RAF during the Battle of Britain.In the Cold War one notable exile army was the Cuban Exiles and the infamous Bay of Pigs operation. Other exile armies abounded in Africa during the numerous wars that have occurred since colonial departures.This book is a series of articles, each by an expert in their particular area, on the history of these Exile Armies. Some, like the French mentioned earlier were quite successful. Others like the Independent Czechoslovak Brigade were neither very successful in battle or in returning to their homeland.This is a most interesting area of history that has been largely ignored. This book is a welcome addition to a World War II or Cold War library."},{"Title":"Tithing in the Age of Grace","review":"The author really hit on some of the ideas and viewpoints that I came to some time ago about the subject of tithing.The book demonstrates that there are several passages in scripture that are seldom, if ever, dealt with in the modern church. For instance, scriptures dealing with \\"redeeming\\" the tithe, eating the tithe and having a party with the tithe (never hear that taught today), where the tithes were brought, for whom, and for what reason the tithes were collected.The author discusses the scriptures which deal with the tithing ritual and command and shows how using them and applying them to a New Testament believer presents all kinds of problems because it is a misapplication to do so.The author appears to be a former \\"Word of faith\\" individual and although he has friends and knows pastors that are still devoted to word/faith teachings, he takes a strident tone with word/faith teachers accusing them of \\"begging\\" for money and tithes.I would not go so far as to say that the ministers whom he mentions \\"beg\\" for money per se, but he does make his point about the emphasis on tithing which is prevelant in the church--both brick and mortar and electronic.A good solid book on a major issue in the body of Christ today and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tithing in the Age of Grace","review":"Some of the best arguments I've read on the subject matter. The author presents clear, easily readable exegesis of the biblical passages that relate to tithing. Parker has a bone to pick with \\"word of faith\\" teachers, but makes very valid points with regard to their pleas for money. This book helped me prioritize my giving and did the same for people I've passed my copy onto.

The orphan and the widow is listed along with the Jewish Levites, read Deut. It's great. It tells you how to eat the tithe. (I know, this is a foreign concept to most Christians, who've never read the old testament.) Eat the tithe with your sons and your daughters, your men servants and your maid servants, the widow, and the orphan. You are to eat the tithe before the LORD. Oh, you mean it's a party. Ding. It's a party, enjoy. Not a burden now, it's party time. Of course if you go to the First Church they will want to know why you don't tithe anymore.

I asked 2 pastors about it because I needed more understanding and was told to keep tithing. I started searching for books on tithing and decided on this one because he goes through the Scriptures with you and also talks about them so that you'll understand what you read.

Perhaps this is a good exercise for improvisational reading.Some of the tales are downright puzzling as well. If the moral of the story is saying \\"Huh?!?\\" then many tales accomplish that objective.I would prefer a book that's edited for 21st Century taste and with appropriate fables for kids. I'm sure the book is faithful to the original literature but that's not what I was looking for here."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"It is rather sad that someone who sets herself up as being scholarly cannot accurately interpret the meaning of those simple fables. For example, the tale of 'Zeus and the Tortoise' #508 has no connection whatsoever to 'home is best' but, more accurately, that 'there is no God but there is Mammon' or alternatively, 'he who weilds the sword never wears the crown'! There is a profound social message to learn from all Aesop's fables but regretfully many do not originate from his pen but accreted around his tales with the passing of time."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"This translation of Aesop's fables (600 of them!) contains detailed references for people interested in finding out more about the Greek and Latin originals. And contrary to the comments of jennal24, the gender of the animals in this translation follows the gender of the animal names in Latin and Greek - since the fox (alopeks) is feminine in Greek, that's why monkey is a \\"she\\". there's nothing feminist about this: it's just grammar. too bad jenna124 has no idea what s/he is talking about. anyway, if you want to find out about the hundreds of Greek and Latin fables and need an English translation, this is a great place to begin. none of the other books of Aesop's fables in English contains as complete a selection of fables as this Oxford World's Classics version."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"Perhaps there are versions of Aesop that readers would enjoy more, and there are plenty of editions that come with engaging illustrations, but if a reader wants to get as close as possible to Aesop's Greek, this is the edition to buy. All of the prior great translators of Aesop have been British--Caxton, L'Estrange, Ogilby, Croxall, Clarke, James, Townsend, Jacobs, and Jones--and of these only Jacobs was a serious Aesop scholar. Laura Gibbs is a scholar as well as a translator; she bases her translations on the best editions; she includes more fables (to show historical variation, some fables appear twice); she provides a better introduction and much better notes than competing editions. Gibbs's volume also has the best index of any Aesop in English. This is an edition worthy of the Oxford imprint, and the first thorough translation of Aesop by an American since Lloyd Daly's AESOP WITHOUT MORALS (1961, now out of print). To experience the immensity and complexity of Aesop, try this."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"Excellent reference for for the novice story teller. This book is cheat sheet for the complete Aesop's fables and also gives you the take home message. I grew up hearing Aesop and wanted my kids to have the same experience. This is definitely not for reading to the kids verbatim. I highly recommend it for the storyteller parent."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"I have loved Aesop's Fables for many years. This edition (Kindle) is the best I've read. Not only did the editor/author cross-reference and arrange the fables in easy form, reading them on the Kindle makes the reference experience excellent.Some other reviews disagree with the analysis the book gives to many of the fables. The purpose of the Fables has for thousands of years been for the reader to decide what lessons to take from them. That has not changed. That this edition includes summaries and conclusions that were added and debated over millennia ADDS to its value. I don't think audiences have forgotten to think for themselves as other reviewers claim.Aesop's Fables have provided intellectual fodder for generations and still does not disappoint. It is a great way to introduce kids to critical thinking and debate.My only slight critique is it needs a detailed table of contents, but the Kindle's search capabilities makes up for it."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"Although, I haven't finish reading all of the fables, however, the ones that I have read are enobling for educators and any serious literature reader. I reccomend the Oxford classic of Asop's Fables for anyone who love reading great literature."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"We may never really know the true identity of Aesop the Man. But his legacy lives on in these fables,the morals of which can still find relevance in today's society.For those of you, whom are easily offended some of the fables bring up racial differences that may upset you.In particular fable 361:~ The Black man in the river, but then you would be merely taking things out of context of the time in which it was written.I found fable 136:~ The man and his daughter particularly sad and unpleasant, but it does remind you of the bad side of Human Nature.These fables express what being Human is all about, the bad and the good.I never tire of re-reading this book, and I think you won't either."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"The major advantage of this translation is it is a large collection. Other unexpurgated translations only have about half. I also appreciate Gibbs' readable style and her arrangement of the fables into subject matter. I knocked off one star mainly because these are not the best stories I've read, but they are interesting in a certain way."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"I was given a similar book over 55 years ago. The book was a gift from my grandfather when I was 7 years old. It was lost many years ago, and now I relive both those days and the moralistic views of Aesop that had such a profound effect on that young boy's outlook on life. This is a book for the children of all generations, for it is timeless in its everlasting tales. But as an adult, it also functions to remind us that sometimes we need to refresh our outlook on life."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"\\"The Fox and the Crane\\" is one of my favorite Aesop's fables. I am surprised it is not better known. Glad it's used as the cover for this edition.Whenever I see Westerners trying to use chopsticks to pick up food from a plate, it reminds me of this delightful fable. I of course act like the fox and laugh at the silly attempts. It seems funny to me when people borrow ideas halfway, only based on hows and whats without any understanding of the whys.Chopsticks is designed to shove food from the bowl into the mouth and plates work best when food is delivered to the mouth by forks or fingers. Different tools are designed for different purposes to accommondate different arrangements.Strange enough, crane is revered by the Chinese and the Japanese and is the embodiment of elegance and other lofty spiritual concepts. Fox on the other hand embodies different meanings.I bet this is news even to Aesop."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"Aesop's fables short tales in which animals act almost as if they were human , rounded off with a good 'moral' are the first instance of , and perhaps the most memorable of the fable form in literature. Only Orwell it seems to me in ' Animal Farm' does something far surpassing the original.But Aesop is a classic , and one often used as first literature for children. I have never found the morals very deep or profound or the stories the most moving in the world, but this does not change the fact that they are part of Western mankind's fundamental vocabulary in literature and story."},{"Title":"The Art of Mathematics","review":"This is really a wonderful book. It's one of the reasons I went to grad school.Dr. King really does a great job of explaining what math is really all about. His analogy to sculpture is perfect: If you want to appreciate a statue, you can't stand too close or too far away. Those in liberal arts are standing too far away from math to see it. Those in engineering and the sciences are standing too close -- they use pieces of math as tools but never see the beauty of mathematics.And I must respectfully disagree with Dr. Greenberg -- the Appel-Haken proof of the four color theorem really is a travesty. It's not a question of being ugly: it's invisible. It's not a proof at all -- it's an &quot;argument from authority&quot; and hence is inductive, not deductive."},{"Title":"The Art of Mathematics","review":"I must be on a hot streak. Almost every book I've read lately is completely mistitled--a ploy by the pubishers that I find beyond annoying. This book has nothing to do with the 'art' of mathematics. The author tried in the beginning to alert the reader that this book was possibly anathema to mathematicians since it wasn't 'math' as they understand it; rather a book allegedly 'about math.' Whatever it is and whatever King set out to accomplish with it, he lost his way. The first third of the book seemed to be a roundabout description of the abstraction of numbers. That much was well-written and not terribly complicated. But then the trouble started. The last two-thirds of the book meander all over the place in an exceedingly poorly crafted and unfocused effort to explain....WHAT? King went from a vaguely technical book for the layman to a muddled concoction of memoir, diatribe, philosophical thesis, critique and on and on and on. It's a patchwork of opinion, criticism, and at times chronicle. A 'behind the scenes' account of academic immaturity and petty politics. And the 100 or so pages on aesthetics? Oh my god. What is this guy doing? He might have had an idea in his mind of what he wanted to say. Unfortunately whatever it was got lost....really LOST between his mind and mouth (or keyboard). The book really is a reflection on a couple of topics that obviously have been part and parcel of the author's career. He seems eager to distance himself from the 'riff-raff' of mathematicians, yet proves he is nothing but lost in the academic world he wants so much to scorn and rise above. King's style as a writer really isn't all that bad, but the book was simply entirely too unfocused and pieced together. In a way, you get a lot for your money here, with 2 separate books in one. Why this was published is a mystery because it sheds no light aesthetics or the politics of being a mathematics professor. And it sure as hell says nothing about art."},{"Title":"The Art of Mathematics","review":"I happend to pick this book up by chance and enjoyed every page. I agreed with everything the author had to say. I suggest this book to anyone with ANY interest in Math. It is best suited for those trying to understand why other people enjoy/understand Mathematics so much"},{"Title":"The Art of Mathematics","review":"I requested the latest edition of this book from my local library but I got the 1992 edition; so my review is based on the 1992 edition.I am very disappointed with this book and I could not go beyond page 62. And here is why.The first 40+ pages are devoted to abstraction about the beauty of Mathematics with no solid examples. I read through the pages patiently, without gaining any insights into the beauty of Mathematics.Having described that 'precision' is the hallmark of Pure Mathematics, the author goes on to state Peano's Axioms in Chapter 3. What an Axiom is is never explained before using that term.Then the book states: \\"We also know by Axiom C that the successor of 1 is not 1.\\" Axiom C, according to the book, states \\"There exists no natural number whose successor is 1.\\"How the statement of Axiom C leads to the statement that the successor of 1 is not 1 is not clear. The entire premise of Pure Mathematics, which according to the author is, p => q fails.The reference should actually have been to Axiom B.Then comes the climax of 'precision': The author says that we do not know that the successor of 2 is not 2 and goes on to state a Theorem which says \\"the successor of any natural number is different from the number.\\" [Which 'number'?]And the author says \\"the proof of this theorem is not difficult but when you try it you see you need a preliminary result. Namely, you need\\" and then states yet another theorem: \\"Different natural numbers have different successors\\"Are these two 'Theorems' saying the same thing?Let us pause here and consider what Axiom B is according to the author: \\"For each natural number there is exactly one other natural number called its successor.\\"The key words in this Axiom are: 'each', 'exactly', 'other', and 'successor'.The Axiom states that for 'every' natural number, there is exactly one [meaning one and only one] successor which is 'other' than itself.What are those two Theorems the author is talking about saying that is not said by this Axiom B? The author does not explain.So much for 'precision'!I stopped reading further.Having read a lot of books by Bertrand Russell, I must say Russell must be turning in his grave at references to him in this book.Dr. King may be a great mathematician, but that does not make him a great meta-mathematician, that is, one who knows what mathematics is about.Beauty of Mathematics is realized in those mathematical instances that have elegance, that is, simple and appealing. When you see an elegant proof or an elegant statement, you must get the same feeling that you get when you take a cool drink on a hot day! It should be invigorating and should create the 'aha' feeling in you."},{"Title":"The Art of Mathematics","review":"Granted that this book is intended for non-mathematicians and is, according to the author, descriptive rather than precise, it still should not purvey misleading information.E.g., on p.43, he calls spherical geometry &quot;Riemannian geometry&quot; and then claims on p.44 that &quot;actual space is not Euclidean but rather more nearly Riemannian.&quot; That is incorrect if we adopt his notion of &quot;Riemannian.&quot; It becomes correct when one provides the correct definition of &quot;Riemannian&quot; found in any advanced text on the subject.On p.73 he misstates the Gelfond-Schneider Theorem, writing ab when it should be a to the power b that is transcendental. And on p.72 he misspells Mahler as Maher.I doubt that most laymen will be enlightened by his discussion of the law of signs on p.73ff. He does show that it follows easily from other algebraic laws, and if the layman finds those laws acceptable, then the law of signs must be accepted, unintuitive as it may be.His discussion of Fermat's Last Theorem on p.89 was unfortunately written before Wiles corrected the initial error in his proof. He needs a second edition to update this.On p.88ff he argues that Appel and Haken's solution to the Four Color Problem was ugly because they used a lengthy computer calculation that cannot be surveyed. I and other mathematicians thought it was quite beautiful the way they reduced the problem to a finite computation.That's as far as I've been willing to read in this book."},{"Title":"The Problem of God: Yesterday and Today","review":"The Problem of God is a deceptive book. Slight in pages, it presents as a modest group of lectures on Biblical experiences of God. In fact, the book may well represent one of the most profound meditations on God and man's reaction to God produced by the modern church. I first read this book while in seminary. I find that I return to its insights again and again."},{"Title":"The Problem of God: Yesterday and Today","review":"The problem of God can be briefly stated as the difficulty in knowing God's existence and man's relationship to God. This book examines the development of this problem through the biblical period and into modernity. It is a short book, so it paints with broad strokes through several human periods, but overall I think it provides an adequate depiction of man's quest, in particular of modern atheism and it's relationship to God."},{"Title":"The Problem of God: Yesterday and Today","review":"Dense and unapproachable, almost indecipherable at times, it nonetheless remains the touchstone. Taken in the bits by which it was originally presented, tolerably readable. The Goat Rodeo Trilogy, of whichGod Bless The Deadis the first in the series, pays appropriate homage to this classic work."},{"Title":"Carly Patterson (Amazing Athletes)","review":"Carly Patterson is arguably one of the strongest and most confident young gymnasts that the United States has ever seen. She is an image of a classic American teenage gymnast, and her confidence in what she does is clearly one of her most distinctive traits. Is is this that helped her win that Olympic title at the 2004 Summer Games in Athens at age 16. Now almost 18 years old, Ms. Patterson seems to be looking toward different goals (i.e. studying dentistry in college, getting a record deal and singing), but her amazing success as a gymnast will always serve as a strong identity for her.This book has a few pages of photos and broad information about Carly that young readers might enjoy. It talks briefly about how she began gymnastics, what it was like when she first entered longtime coach Evgeny Marchenko's gym, and how she gradually evolved from an awkward beginner who couldn't keep her knees straight in her routines to one of the top gymnasts in the world. It isn't really the book to get if you're looking for something with new and developed information about this athlete; it talks a little about that classic birthday party that lured Carly toward gymnastics, as well as her 2003 elbow injury and her ups and downs in some of her major competitions, but again not much depth is provided to satisfy a reader looking for something more.Hopefully a more detailed account on Carly's life and experiences will be published in the near future. It would be interesting to see her write an autobiography about her career. It looks like a new book just came out about her on April 1 (it's called Carly Patterson: Be Strong) but I'm not sure what is in it. In any case, Carly Patterson really made it big two years ago in Greece, and it will be interesting to see what she does in the future."},{"Title":"Four Seminars (Studies in Continental Thought)","review":"This book presents accounts of four seminars that Heidegger gave from 1966 to 1973, the first three notably in France, in Le Thor. Heidegger's thoughts in these seminars combine a look back over his own work, especially Being and Time, with the context of his later thought about technology, the history of philosophy, and the contrast between traditional metaphysics and the Greek world.The seminars are not presented directly in Heidegger's words. They consist of \\"protocols\\", a kind of official set of notes or minutes kept by the seminar participants. Although the protocols re-tell Heidegger's thinking, they still remain firmly within it. That makes the accounts more \\"true\\" to Heidegger's thought than they otherwise might be, but no more easily penetrable either. This book is definitely not an easy way into Heidegger's thought -- it begins in the middle of his thinking, and it does not retreat to the distance another writer might take in order to re-characterize it for easier understanding.That said, I do think these seminars offer a valuable perspective on Heidegger's account of technology. Many of the concepts from The Question Concerning Technology are discussed here, and, for my own part, I always find repeat discussions of these topics by Heidegger very helpful in trying to understand just what he was getting at. Here he adds new examples and expressions of the technological world, especially the modern computer. The great culmination of the computer's development would not be that it mimic or reproduce the human, as some strains of artificial intelligence strive towards, but that the human disastrously come to mimic the computer, that thinking becomes calculation and nothing more, as we come to understand ourselves in its distorted mirror. Understanding Heidegger's warnings about technology in this way provide a direct tie to the \\"greatest danger\\" that he refers to in The Question Concerning Technology, that thinking as calculation would permanently exclude the possibility of \\"originary thinking\\" or \\"thinking Being\\".There are other discussions here not commonly found in Heidegger's published work -- notably, extended remarks on Marx and Marx's place within metaphysics and technology, and on the virtues and shortcomings of Being and Time. Of Being and Time, the seminar account says, \\". . . the language of Being and Time, Heidegger says, lacks assurance. For the most part, it still speaks in expressions borrowed from metaphysics and seeks to present what it wants to say with the help of new comings, creating new words. . . . Heidegger now says, more precisely, that through H\\u000folderlin he came to understand how useless it is to coin new words; only after Being and Time was the necessity of a return to the essential simplicity of language clear to him.\\" Thus the change in style from the structured, more traditional philosophical writing of Being and Time to the simpler, if no more readily understood, later writings.All in all, I think, for readers who want to spend the time needed to understand Heidegger, these seminars add a valuable additional perspective, another angle from which to keep building that understanding."},{"Title":"Four Seminars (Studies in Continental Thought)","review":"FOUR SEMINARS seems rather fragmentary to me. The text was created by a few people who got together on a number of occasions. Things that are numbered have a lot of firsts on a single page, particularly on page 47, where the topology of being is imagined with three aspects:Three terms which succeed one another and at the same time indicate three steps along the way of thinking: MEANING -- TRUTH -- PLACE . . .First, truth. . . .First, what does \\"meaning\\" signify? Meaning in BEING AND TIME is defined in terms of a project region, and projection is the accomplishment of Dasein, which means the ek-static instancy in the openness of being. By ek-sisting, Dasein includes meaning. The thinking that proceeds from BEING AND TIME, in that it gives up the word \\"meaning of being\\" in favor of \\"truth of being,\\" henceforth emphasizes the openness of being itself, rather than the openness of Dasein in regard to this openness of being.This signifies \\"the turn,\\" in which thinking always more decisively turns to being as being.The statements above are taken from 23 lines of text. I have omitted a Greek word for place and a German word for instancy. The ek- form of words pops up so frequently that I noticed a Greek instance on page 54:What for Aristotle was a development [Auseinanderfolge] (the result of an emerging out of; ek-eis), becomes a succession [Aufeinanderfolge] (through the determination of the result as sequential) -- this due to the fact that the first idea is only an \\"occult quality,\\" brought into disrepute by the Cartesians, though nevertheless rehabilitated in a certain sense by Leibniz.This book does not have an index or translation of most Greek terms, but glossaries (pp. 113-118) of German-English and English-German correspondence allow those who are sure of a meaning in one language to check for which word this corresponds to in the other translation. The seminars in 1966, 1968, 1969, and 1973 took place in French, and the German translator, Curd Ochwadt, provides an Afterword with a poem by Martin Heidegger in German which is translated in a note on page 112. There is also an Afterword which appeared in COLLECTED EDITION, VOLUME 15 on Heidegger quoting Hegel's \\"A torn sock is better than a mended one\\" (p. 98). If this book did have an index, I'm sure it should contain:Parmenides, Heraclitus, Aristotle, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Marx, Pindar, and Descartes for pages 1-9.Hegel, Holderlin, Reinhold, Fichte, Schelling, Aristotle, Descartes, Luther, Galileo, William of Ockham, Husserl, Jean Beaufret, Kant, Heraclitus, Newton, Plato, Marx, Kant, Freud and Meister Eckhart for pages 10-34.I spent a lot of time contemplating page 32, which contains such gems as:This lived-body is something like the reach of the human body (last night, the moon was closer than the Louvre).What \\"seeing\\" here means is in question, if one admits, despite a well-established French tradition, that cows never see trains pass by.When Marx says, \\"Man produces himself, etc. . . . ,\\" it means: \\"Man is a factory. Man produces himself as he produces his shoes.\\" But what does \\"Production\\" mean for Hegel? By no means that man produces the Absolute. Production is the figure of reflection's accomplishment.Truly complicated matters on September 6, 1969, include a list of seven questions by Roger Munier concerning technology that had been raised on September 11, 1966, a mere 35 years before a famous catastrophe in New York and at the Pentagon. Fifth question: \\"Will the rapid spreading of technological things not finally bring about an essential poverty, from which a turning around of the human to the truth of its essence becomes possible, even if by a detour of errancy?\\" (p. 45).

Most of his books were published postumously and they reveal the depth and extent of his knowledge of Christian thought. And this book is no exception. The present volume was originally written in French and then translated to English. Almost all the fundmental principles of Christian doctrine are dealt with in this book. The book contains a Prologue, a Postscript and four chapters dealing with different dogmas of the Church. His theological arguments are solidly based on Scriptures and the Fathers of the Church. Since the emphasis is on correctness, the language has become cumbersome and understanding sometimes difficult. He has some familiarity with the Indian understanding of God which he occasionally brings in.This will remain a valuable book of all time. For a student of Eastern Orthodox Theology this is a must read."},{"Title":"Orthodox Theology: An Introduction","review":"\\"For freedom from death and the introduction of human nature into God's Kingdom realize the only true Exodus. This sacrifice, ... represents a sacrament, sacrament par excellence, the free gift to God, by Christ in His humanity, of the first fruits of creation, the fulfillment of that immense sacramental action, devolving first upon Adam, which the new humanity must complete, the offering of the cosmos as receptacle of grace.\\" Vladimir Lossky, (Orthodox Theology: An Introduction)Theognosis, Clement to Evagrius:The mystical theology of the Church was started by Clement as Theognosis or knowing God, John 17:3, Christ own definition of eternal life. Christian Theology, in the Cataphatic sense, was founded by Origen, being expressed in Neoplatonic terms, but completed by his student Dionysius the pseudo-Areopagite, an associate of Severus, patriarch of Antioch.\\"Authentic gnosis is inseparable from a charisma, an illumination by grace which transforms our intelligence. And since the object of contemplation is a personal existence and presence, true gnosis implies encounter, reciprocity, faith as a personal adherence to the personal presence of God Who reveals Himself. In the strict sense, among the ascetics of the Christian East gnosis constitutes the peak of the life of prayer--a peak where gnosis is given by God to man \`who knows himself fallible,' says Evagrius, and transforms his indigence in an unfolding of faith. We know Evagrius's formula, which has become an adage: \`The one who has purity in prayer is true theologian, and the one who is true theologian has purity in prayer.\\" Prologue:Faith and Theology,Russian Orthodoxy:\\"Hellenism has placed its eternal character upon the Church.

For a course in Orthodox doctrinal theology, written half a century ago, to survey the basic doctrines of the Church; Knowledge of God, Nature of creation and meaning of the Fall, Human nature of and Cosmic salvation. Vladimir Lossky, far from being a typical dogmatic theologian in the Western sense; treats dogma as an applicable Church teaching (doctrine), vividly relating to the richness of Eastern Church, whose Orthodoxy was defended by Alexandria, which Lossky repeatedly quotes her own heroes Athanasius and Cyril.Orthodox Theology:As it is frequently repeated by Orthodox theologians, a one-volume introduction to Eastern Orthodox theology, and teachings of its Fathers is an ambitious task. The best that one can usually expect from such projects is the condensed reviews found in the many well known introductory books on Orthodoxy, yet, offers a valuable summary of the teachings of the Greek speaking Church fathers, From Origen to Dionysius the p-Areopagite, a good synopsis of a number of profound theological issues. His book gives a clear summary of the Patristic footing of Eastern Orthodox doctrine.This Introduction, was originally intended as a course in dogmatic theology of Eastern Orthodoxy. It investigates the fundamental questions Church theologian should ask in Cosmology, Christology, Sotereology, and Ecclesiology: can we know God? What is the relation of the creation to the Creator? How did man fall, and how is he saved? Lossky shows that such doctrinal issues are not merely abstract propositions for theological debate but are at the base of Christian living. Lossky expounds, the Orthodox doctrine of the Trinity as intimately related to the understanding of how the human person and his spiritual life, and salvation through Kenosis to Theosis could be defended theologically.CONTENTSForewordPrologue FAITH AND THEOLOGY1.THE TWO MONOTHEISMSi.

Still, I recommend this book to those who are serious about making money by investing/dealing/speculating in coins. This is not because I believe the author has discovered a road to riches. Actually, some of his information, thus his money making systems based on it, has little relevance to the coin market of today, particularly as it relates to speculation in coin rolls and using a mail bid system to sell coins. This book was published in 1969, afterall. What the author does bring to the table is a way of looking at the coin market as an investment vehicle, a very cogent take on the ups and downs (booms and busts) of the coin market cycle and, most tellingly, contemporary pricing. Yes, that's correct, one of the most sobering elements of this book is the lists of 1969 coin prices (often compared to earlier year prices) as they compare to today's prices. I think that you will be quite shocked in some cases even if pleasantly so at times, and perhaps even frightened. I need not say more but that if you get this or a similar book you will immediately understand what I am saying. Also important is the author's discussion of certain manias concerning such things as the 1960 Lincoln small date in which some fortunate people made thousands of 1960's dollars in the beginning and others lost similar amounts when the bubble blew up. Fast forward 30 years and think about the brouhaha surrounding the very first Delaware Quarters. In other words, speculative coin bubbles are likely to happen at any time and the fast and adroit amongst us will end up making a lot of money. Appropos of this, consider the author's discussion of Mint Set investing. I'll say no more but if you are serious about speculating in coins, this book and others like it are an excellent means for getting cheap, quick market savvy that may help you to avoid losing significant amounts of money."},{"Title":"Teach Your Baby German [With Teaching Guide]","review":"I am getting German lessons from a friend who is from Austria.

After earning money as a farm laborer in Illinois, a general laborer in northeast Oregon and working on a railroad tunnel in Washington's Cascade Mountains he homesteaded a cattle ranch in Okanogan County, WA in 1887, one year after the region officially opened to non-Indian settlement.After establishing his ranch he first had a sister come to be his housekeeper and then in 1891 convinced a cousin from Denmark, who he had met only once shortly before emigrating, to come to marry him and live in that remote location. One of his brothers came from Denmark and established his own ranch but returned to the old country in 1898.Over the years Fries did a lot of different things to finance his ranch and support his family: cutting wood to fuel river boats, seasonal labor, ranching, dairy farming, wagon freighting and working as a contract Post Office mail carrier covering a 2-3 day weekly route over a mountain range by horseback. He regularly interacted with local Indians, some of whom also raised horses and cattle in the vicinity, participated in local civic affairs and was peripherally involved in an incident where local cattle ranchers violently drove sheep ranchers off public range land.The text is well written in a straightforward, fast moving manner; apparently Fries son, Emil, was a ghostwriter. Since many chapters are centered on topics (e.g., Schools, Freighting, Indians) sometimes the chronology of events is a bit confusing in places as characters who leave the region or pass away at one point reappear when a different topic is covered. Virtually nothing is written about post-1920 events, probably because the author didn't consider them \\"historic\\" when the text was initially written. And it would be fascinating to learn more about what happened to this pioneer ranch and Fries' children down to the current time.There are numerous fascinating black and white photographs of many of the people and locations described in the book and the endpapers have an excellent sketch map showing the locations of towns and landmarks.It's hard to imagine how hard most people worked in those days to make a living and how truly primitive, by our standards, their living conditions were in a time that's hardly two generations before the Baby Boomers. The Fries family is to be commended for having the foresight and perseverance to have Mr. Fries document his experiences - which are probably typical of his time and location - before they were lost. Unfortunately Mrs. Fries passed away in 1932 so we don't have her version of events.I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the American West in general and North Central Washington in particular as well as anyone looking for a good example to emulate of a family biography. It's thought provoking and the large number of photographs help readers relate to the people and events."},{"Title":"From Copenhagen to Okanogan; The Autobiography of a Pioneer","review":"This book was written by my great great grandfather so I'm a little biased, but I found the book to be a facinating read, a real window into a firsthand pioneer experience in the late 1800s. It also allowed me to \\"know\\" my grandfather since I never met him in person."},{"Title":"From Copenhagen to Okanogan; The Autobiography of a Pioneer","review":"My family is from the Okanogan region, so I was particularly taken by the author's detailed descriptions of pioneer life in the early days of settling the great Northwest. The book is written in a manner that draws the reader in, because it's mainly about daily life punctuated with more dramatic events. The reader gets real tuned in on what hardy, tough, and tenacious people these were. Life was simpler, and life was much more difficult -- but I guess everything is relative.I read the book over the Christmas week, and I couldn't put it down. If you like non-fiction, if you like reading memoirs style writing, if you like history, if you like reading about people and their interactions with their environment, then you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Angular momentum, (Oxford library of the physical sciences)","review":"This is a very useful book for those engaged in research in atomic, molecular and optical physics. It is one of three books on angular momentum theory that came out at around the same time (the others are by Rose and Edmonds), each has a different approach to the subject, and serious students usually have a copy of all three; this is generally considered to be the most readable.This volume is somewhat less theory biased than the book of Edmonds, and has two chapters on applications of the theory. So while chapters I- IV give the basic theory of angular momentum in quantum mechanics, chapter V covers matrix elements of tensor operators, and Chapter VI considers applications to physical systems. The final chapter gives an introduction to graphical methods in angular momentum theory.Six appendices give properties of 3-J, 6-J, 9-J symbols, spherical harmonics, rotation matrix elements, and finally tensors and their matrix elements.This is an excellent book. It has stood the test of time extremely well, and has been often reprinted. If you use angular momentum theory in your work, you should own this book."},{"Title":"Angular momentum, (Oxford library of the physical sciences)","review":"If you have reason to perform calculations involving angular momentum - particularly in quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, particle physics, etc. then this book is for you.

I was lucky enough to begin my sea travels at the tail end of the glory days so I remember that onboard ocean liner experience which was so different from today's cruises. As an American I was not so familiar with the ships and service on the old empire routes from Britain. Immigrant ships disappeared from these waters long before my birth. I was also happy to learn about the rivalries between Orient Lines and P&O which I have only known as a combined company.

Best of all is the fact that the book is free from moralising sermons or two dimensional characters."},{"Title":"Dragon Strike: The Millennium War","review":"As a work of fiction, this novel I think had surpassed its initial intention as book of fiction. Both writers, based on their previous professions as reporters, had suffused politics, war machines (airplanes, warships, etc.), economy, history and geography into this novel. Actually I learned more about stock market, mutual funds and other monetary stuffs from this fiction novel compared to my modest knowledge in money markets.Should this book is placed into the non-fiction section, I doubt it will make a significant difference. Most of the materials presented in this novel is very convincing, it's hard to differentiate between facts and fiction. The authors had some weaknesses in this writing though. Some pronounced names in Chinese and Japanese are incorrect. But those are small issues.The plot went around the Red Chinese attacking it Vietnamese neighbor. The story evolves around this issue. Crichton, Grisham, Clancy and Dale Brown's fans take note. Future World War 3 scheme may have similarities with this plot.For a fiction novel, this book is quite \\"heavy\\".

The thought that China would ignite a global confrontation as that described in the book throws another log onto the flame of fear that China is rising as a hegemonic power with less than appealing aims for its neighbors.The book addresses well the political culture that exists today in the Asian region as well as globally. Despite the books label as a fictional thriller, its use of facts and trends in the region verges on nothing less than an actual prediction of the future.The authors' style is that which one might find in a more formal publication of military strategy. At times it becomes techniqual, and those who tend to glaze over economic and politcal reports might not find this any more interesting than Cspan's coverage of congressional sessions. As a student of international relations I found the book to be most enjoyable and thought provoking, asking the proverbial question &quot;what if?&quot;Of course, the book was not without flaw. The many typos underminded the seriousness of its content. Also, many scenarios created in the novel can not be easily taken as given as every aspect of future telling and politics can be argued.

It's a very thought-provoking work, a true look at the author's life journey with reflections on how to seize the life you subconsciously desire. Grab a highlighter and pen, and sit down on a quiet afternoon/evening and read Absolute Victory. Take notes and do this in one sitting, and then come back. I don't think you can re-read it enough, as the message rings true and the confusing parts of life seem less confusing upon finishing Absolute Victory yet once more.I had an unusual feeling of peace come over me upon reading Absolute Victory, as the trivial concerns of the day, week or month slowly faded from memory to yield to more important questions about where I am going in life, while knowing that the typical track that many do, one which I was set to do, are not quite so meaningful and important as many make them out to be.I am fortunate to know Robert and have read this book at this particular stage in my life; it has given me the final push or affirmation to take on uncertainty and risk with the intention of fulfilling deeper hopes and dreams at this stage in my life.I will always keep reading and thinking.

Only one new insight about such an important topic would have made this worthwhile reading, but I got so much more out of it. Having more tools to critically examine my path in life is valuable beyond any price you can put on a book. However, saying this book is for everyone would not be appropriate. You need to be open for new ideas and ways of thinking. Reading this book with a closed mind or a predisposition to reject them for whatever reason will lead to a lesser experience. I am willing to bet that the reviewer who used the word 'bogus' in his/her title had some preconceived ideas about their life and the book before they read it. This is unfortunate because they could have gotten more out of it. I wish they had not hidden behind an 'anonymous' comment because a healthy dialogue would have been nice. Anyone who truly knows Robert Pino also knows that this is a very sincere and candid work. Robert's success in helping companies and people grow and improve themselves makes this book a natural extension of his life.

It gathers together the major Late Classical and Medieval writers who addressed the issue of women's place in the world, allowing one to read the relevant excerpts without having to hunt through all of those writers' works (which can be a very daunting task in the case of someone like Ovid or Augustine). As the title suggests, the book highlights not only women's detractors, but also their defenders (including proto-feminists such as Christine de Pizan) to counter some of the nastier misogynistic passages. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of gender in the West, especially those who confine the main part of their work to the 19th and 20th centuries. The Western so-called \\"war of the sexes\\" has its ultimate roots in this material, despite the way that (in my experience) it is often ignored or glossed over in classes that deal directly with gender."},{"Title":"Woman Defamed and Woman Defended: An Anthology of Medieval Texts","review":"This is an excellent book about the literary tradition of misogyny (hatred of women) in Europe.

Not just a sea-horse race, but a sea-horse race inside a giant diamond-shaped tank of oxygenated fluid that also holds a beautiful submerged woman dancing and creating music with the movement of her locks of hair, sometimes enhancing the gyration of her head with sudden tosses and jostles of her hips. There's not only that, but several automaton devices that use flotation and buoyancy to drive their mechanic parts and act out various historical and mythological scenes. Like Voltaire suddenly doubting his atheistic doctrines, or Atlas kicking a celestial object, or Pilate being branded on the forehead.All of that takes place inside the gigantic diamond-like tank of oxygenated fluid. A very lustrous fluid.By the way, the English translation sometimes calls the sea-horses \\"hippocampi.\\" Don't be confused: in context, it means sea-horses. It's not talking about parts of a brain. You might be thinking, \\"well there's no possible room for confusion there!\\", but au contraire. Because inside the tank is also a floating head/face of Danton, composed exclusively of the preserved nerves and musculuture, without any bones or skin. And re-animated with expertly applied electrical currents, courtesy of Canterel and his cat.And they're not just any sea-horses. They're sea-horses equipped with \\"setons\\" attached to a shining golden sphere that they themselves created by kneading together small globulets of golden wine that Canterel pours into the tank and lets float down to them.The entire episode I'm talking about took place long after the book had already left my jaw on the floor. In short: read it. You know that \\"dream-like\\" quality that hyped books supposedly possess? Say, like \\"Amnesia Moon\\"? Well Raymond Roussel accomplishes all that without any narrative tricks, without any deception, without any ill-defined or sensationally blurred \\"boundaries between dream and reality\\" or any of that nonsense. Roussel accomplishes his feats the old fashioned way: with elbow grease, and imagination. He accomplishes it by giving everything to you, not hiding things from you.Who is the Canterel I mentioned above? Canterel-- a name that one should never utter aloud except on bended knee-- has the wealth and quirk of Willy Wonka, combined with the wealth and ingenuity of Bruce Wayne. Which makes for a very rich, very marvelous fellow. His estate and private collection puts both of those men's assets to shame, quite extravagantly.As you already know, the book is a narrated trip through some of Canterel's exhibits. He aims to please, though. So don't think that the book will lack character, plot, or suspense just because it's a sort of museum-tour. There's stories within stories that explain the exhibits. And they have everything that archetypically good \\"stories\\" have, and more: love, betrayal, forgiveness, fantastic magnanimity, loss, disgrace, lust, vindication. I was breathless waiting for the resolutions of certain tales, practically jumping off my reading-bench to cheer for the characters, or otherwise immobilized by the revelations and vicissitudes.And it's all described soberly, no tricks. By the way, Roussel (though there's a chance it's the translators doing, since I haven't and couldn't read the original French) tells his stories, tells the motivations and actions of characters, with a very skillful use of words, using strong descriptive verbs and nouns. The sentences held together with a unique power. Many times I took great pleasure in re-reading certain sentences, because they were said so absolutely perfectly. Of course, that should be the hallmark of a professional writer, but I don't find it too often.So anyway you'll feel like you're there. You won't even have any disbelief to suspend. At certain points, like a particular early exhibit that I won't name, I said to myself, \\"There's no going back, this is too fantastic, there's no POSSIBLE EXPLANATION of this, Roussel has crossed the line, this is uncanny and totally unrecoverable at this point, I feel exploited!,\\" and I kept reading, kept reading-kept reading, \\"by god, no, by GOD HE'S DONE IT!, he's doing it, by god Canterel, Roussel, you've done it, my good holy god unbeliEVABLE!!! Whew. Wow.\\" I had to close the book for a minute and lean against a fence, nodding my head uncontrollably. When you close this book and put it on your shelf when done, you'll keep suspecting that it's about to burst open and spill out its contents all over your room, neighborhood, and city-- and you'll feel like an angry god for actually having the ability to close the book and contain it.Book will take your breath away. If not check your pulse. Or, try something else. Bye."},{"Title":"Locus Solus (French Surrealism)","review":"I used to have so much fun reading this book. I remember I miraculously found a copy in some book shop on the far southside of Chicago for $8. One night I was drinking with some classmates shortly after class and I made the mistake of lending this irreplacable book to one of them, which of course the fool never returned nor probably ever read or if he did appreciated. May every curse be piled upon your perfidious little name, punk, which it is a blessing I can't remember it was so long ago.I remember the first time I read Impressions of Africa, right after graduating high school. I was a naive young admirer of Duchamp at the time, and I kept seeing these references to Roussel, and the description of Impressions made it sound like a travel book. Had I known him then I might have expected something like a French William Cobbett. Ha! I don't think I realized something definitely strange was going on in those pages until I reached the part with the father and his sons echoing their voices off of each other's chests with their shirts being stuck to their skin &quot;by some sticky substance&quot;, -- the word &quot;substance&quot; somehow set me laughing for a solid twenty, thirty minutes, and all the hilarity, the absurdity of the Incomporables' show that had gone on before were finally apparent to me. I have been a lover of Roussel ever since; the only casualty was my perspective of Duchamp's accomplishment, which is as Duchamp himself admitted greatly indebted to Roussel's.Locus Solus is the book Roussel wrote after Impressions and the two make a pair unlike any other in literature. Locus is presided over by Martial Canteral, a figure right out of Jules Verne, who Roussel once said was a name that should not be spoken aloud &quot;except on bended knee,&quot; -- hm, yes -- Canterel is a famous scientist and inventor, and the book is set at his estate where a group of distinguished figures have been invited to a tour of guided by none other than its owner and director. The book follows the tour as one of the eyewitnesses, and the sights along the way are so bizarre, the machinery so complex and beyond any reasonable utility, it quite defies any attempt to describe the effect here. One impression I think that merits a word or two is the apparent lack of emotion in the book. I would say that there is a great amount of sadness and tragedy in the book that adds a kind of under-layer parallel to the encoded sentences of Roussel's method. The vitallium episode, in which Canterel invents a &quot;certain chemical&quot; that makes the bodies of the dead become animate again (but are still dead) has a very particular strain of anguish and loss inherent in its concept. And then there is also the weariness of the visionary experienced by the reader, the author, and the characters being audience to so many impossibilities one after the other piled up so high there is an actual physical exhaustion after the conclusion. And then of course there is also the tragedy of the author himself, who had both novels lavishly adapted for the theater, and created two of the most colossal failures in the history of drama, causing riots and scandal at the showings and humiliation to the author. He ended up a pitiful man, addicted to drugs and having spent all his fortune, he killed himself in his forties with a great dream &quot;of a glory that shall outshine that of Victor Hugo or Napoleon.&quot;This is not a book for everyone, perhaps even for very few. However there is no good reason these two books are out of print. It is long past time they are reprinted and Roussel be given the honor he deserves."},{"Title":"Locus Solus (French Surrealism)","review":"Roussel's novels are giant puzzles, in which he describes images and stories that have a unique carnival logic. Punning relationships generate textual rebuses (rebi?), in a way that makes the reader aware of the book as a mechanism, but Roussel gives too few clues to really understand it. In Locus Solus, Roussel gives a tour of the museum garden of an eccentric millionaire, who, like Roussel himself, collects with a frenetic and psychedelic rationalism. Please, Riverrun Press, reprint this book."},{"Title":"Locus Solus (French Surrealism)","review":"i read this book when i was about 13 and i have been wanting to read it again for 17 years. i remember it only vaguely, but i know it was good. please mister publisher, print it again."},{"Title":"Locus Solus (French Surrealism)","review":"I'm all for surrealism, but given the choice between reading an excessively lengthy textual description of a Magritte painting and actually looking at the painting, which would you prefer? If you chose the former, then this book will likely be right up your proverbial alley; everyone else would do well to steer clear--as many publishers obviously have.While it's entirely possible that the formulaic wordplay Roussel employed in his writing might be so interminably clever as to render the French reader dumbfounded, once translated into English, it's just plain dull. While I found the first couple of vignettes wonderfully imaginative and to the point, every successive chapter introduces progressively (and needlessly) more verbose descriptions of complicated machinations which overwhelm the reader with oftentimes irrelevant details, followed by an equally verbose explanation of all the nonsense the reader has just been exposed to. These easily dismissible scenes, while impressively crafted, are not interconnected in any meaningful way and there is never any sort of payoff at any point in the book, leaving me with the feeling that Roussel's primary goal in all of this was that of self-gratification. I could see this material becoming a fascinating short film in this day and age of flashy computer graphics, but reading it was an absolute chore.A word to the wise: This book is still in print in England and can be purchased on amazon.co.uk for SIGNIFICANTLY less than the used copies are going for here. The one I stupidly paid $30 for was actually one of these recent printings bearing a price tag of seven pounds fifty."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"The fact that WICKETT's REMEDY is readable and often compelling proves Ms. Goldberg's talent as a writer. The book simply put is a mess comprised of straight narrative, letters, period newspaper clippings, comments from the \\"dead\\" that run along the book's margins, newsletters, brochures and memos. Time shifts haphazardly and it's not always clear where Ms. Goldberg is going with either plot or theme. Still, by some magic a coherent informative story emerges for the patient reader. The ending is not satisfactory since too many storylines are left unfinished and the book just seems to stop. Even though the book is set during a flu epidemic and many sympathetic characters meet tragic ends, WICKETT'S REMEDY is a more positive and hopeful book than Ms. Goldberg's previous book BEE SEASON which was an utterly depressing look at family dysfunction and insanity tossed with some mysticism."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I completely disagree with Publisher's Weekly and find myself in complete agreement with the others who have praised Goldberg's follow-up to Bee Season (which I actually found to be disappointing, unlike this outing). The story chronicling Lydia, the flu epidemic of 1918, and the marvelous drink/medicine that gives the novel its title is a wonderful combination of historical fiction, an experiment in form, and a wonderful series of threads that all come together. The tragedy that follows Lydia including the death of her husband as well as being cheated out of what presumably amounts to millions, as well as her taking a position as a nurse in an experiment aimed to find out how the illness is being transmitted, makes for a story that often seems full of hope, only to have it taken away from you. The \\"Us\\" or the side notes/comments provide us some solace with the knowledge that there is some sort of afterlife waiting for our characters.At first, I found myself annoyed with the side commentary and found it quite distracting. It's difficult to gage when to actually read the comments and they make for a disjointed narrative. Once you get used to it however, you notice how much depth is added to the story. The use of letters, newspapers, and the jumping around in chronology also makes the story more convoluted and confusing (and it most certainly could use some work), but again, after awhile things make more sense. My only criticism is the pacing problems that the different styles cause, but by the end, you gain a larger understanding of what Goldberg is trying to accomplish.Overall, it's a pleasurable read. I would even go so far as to argue that Goldberg has surpassed Zadie Smith as the champion for this generation of fiction writers."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"While \\"Wickett's Remedey\\" was very readable and engaging, I found myself wondering when the book was going to come into focus. It seemed to have no ending, just an end. I was very dissapointed. I did; however, enjoy the marginal comments by the dead. I thought that was very original and insightful. I would try another of her books."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"\\"The 1918 influenza epidemic-whose cause is still a matter of debate-killed more Americans in ten months than died in all twentieth century wars combined and killed well over 20 million people worldwide. Gallups Island, now known as Gallop Island, in Boston Harbor was in November and December of 1918 the site of a United States Public Health Service study designed to determine the cause and mode of the spread of the illness. The subjects were prisoners; inmates of Deer Island Naval Prison were subjected to the testing.\\" Myla GoldbergLydia Kilkenny was from South Boston. She journeyed over the bridge that separated Southie from Boston, and found a world she wanted to join. She met a young man, Henry Wickett, studying to become a physician, and someone who wrote the most beautiful letters to her. He was of the world she longed to join. They married; Henry became disillusioned with his life and quit medicine, and started to sell a family elixir, Wickett's Remedy. At this time, in 1918 an unknown illness was spreading in Boston, and took the life of Henry. Lydia went home to South Boston, and began to care for the people who were dying from this 'flu'. In a world turned almost unrecognizable by swift and sudden tragedy, Lydia finds herself working as a nurse in an experimental ward dedicated to understanding the raging epidemic -- through the use of human subjects. These volunteers, prisoners of the local naval prison, were injected with phelgm and blood from someone who had the influenza, and luckily only one young service man died.The 1918 Influenza Epidemic is told in great detail, and spelled out in the form of a story of what happened. The dead also have a part of this story. From the margins come their words. At times, this form of narrative is off-putting, but for the most part, their words gave impetus to the story that is being told. 20 million people died of the Influenza in 1918, and my grandfather was one of them. My grandmother told a tale of suffering and fear. No one knew who would be next. How would she care for her family? She had 4 little children to care for, and she met and married a man who had also lost his mate to the influenza.While the story of Lydia and her courage in caring for men who were so ill, and the chances she took with her own life is a 'telling' one. I found the addition of the Wickett's Remedy, and its tale to be unsatisfying and not needed in this context. It did not add to the story, and while I understand that these unknown and untested elixirs were popular during this time, a mere mention would have sufficed. Yet as well-researched and polished as the book is, I did not find that I understood or knew the characters' mindsets. While I admire Lydia, I did not feel that I ever truly knew her.\\"Two hurdles confront a novelist who writes about epidemic disease. The first is the Yuck Factor -- as in, \\"Yuck, who wants to read a book about phlegm?\\" The second is that the writer will have to kill off a number of characters, and it can be tricky to find the balance between making a character important enough to engage the reader but not so important that her or his demise will destroy the narrative momentum.\\" Geraldine Brooks. Geraldine Brooks in the title of her critique calls this book 'Love In the Time of Influenza', how simply perfect. Wish I had thought of it.Recommended for the historical and literary senses. prisrob 11/19/06"},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"Even though this historical novel was set in the devastating 1918 Flu Epidimic, it is much more \\"up\\" than her \\"Bee Season\\" (which was great reading, but not uplifting). I listened to Goldberg narrate both in audio and found the voices and sound effects of the margin notes in \\"Wickett's Remedy\\" quite entertaining and effective. Some offer another view of what happened.Goldberg's lead character Lydia displays courage, independence, and strength. This \\"Southie\\" of Boston moves beautifully through the novel as she struggles with the limitations of her background and the tough hand of cards which she is dealt."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"The Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918 which killed more people than all the 20th century wars, Goldberg explains in an end note, is the main subject of a novel that takes place in Boston, and the South side in particular, an immigrant neighborhood full of vigourous life, until the epidemic hits and forces the authorities to close schools and businesses and put a damper on public life in general, including a law against spitting. Lydia, an Irish shop girl, marries a grateful customer, Henry Wickett, who quits medical school with an idea for his remedy, a cure all potion that would be sent to customers with his rosy letters, similar to the ones that made Lydia fall in love with him. When he catches the flu and dies, Lydia returns to her family, where the fatalities continue and her brother Michael, among others, dies. She develops an overnight passion for nursing and is hired to participate in a study that attempts to find a cure for influenza. Meanwhile, Quentin Driscoll, Henry's partner in the remedy, tranforms the potion, from Lydia's original recipe, into QD soda, which becomes a favorite, though he never shares the wealth with Lydia, who continues to write letters requesting he comply with their original agreement. Part of the book is a history of the soda, with newsletters written by Ralph Finnester who becomes the president of the company and a second son to Driscoll, whose first son died at a young age. Goldberg accentuates her story of the epidemic and the soda with a recreation of South Boston during the period and there's lots of Southie flavor here, with authentic dialogue and actual newspaper clippings, although somehow the Red Sox are missing. Also lots of references to life during the influenza epidemic, when people had to avoid contact with each other, a simple cough becoming a severe threat to be shunned at all times."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I won't repeat the story, but the flu epidemic does make for an interesting background. The characters are believeable, the plot is fairly strong, the setting is well described, but yet it just lacks in places. It's almost as if the author was trying to tell two stories: one about the epidemic and the other about the stealing of the formula for Wickett's remedy which never really rings true. It's too bad because I feel that could have helped develop Lydia's character so much more.It took me a while to get used to the marginal notes, but I did find them interesting. Shows that what one person sees could be quite different than what another sees. The other \\"additions\\" of newspaper articles, newsletters, etc. I found to be quite annoying at times.Overall, it was a good read but sometimes more effort than it should have been."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"Well-written though Myla Goldberg's second novel is, and despite its warm characters and evocative picture of Boston in the grip of the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918, I found myself strangely disappointed by the time I put it down. Her magnificent first novel,BEE SEASON, also had vital characters and strong storytelling, but it added a powerful spiritual dimension and pulsed with the dynamics of a contemporary Jewish family that she clearly knows from the inside. Here, Goldberg moves off her own territory in geographical setting, social milieu, and period, and I think loses something in the process. Not that she can't still write well: the book's heroine, Lydia Kilkenny, shop-girl turned nurse, is real and attractive, as are countless other figures who appear more briefly. But the psychic intensity of the erlier book is replaced by marginal comments from the other world, which some readers liked but I found slightly cute and only occasionally relevant.Although I found it interesting throughout, I have two main problems with the book: it has an irrelevant title and it lacks an ending. \\"Wickett's Remedy\\" is a name concocted by Lydia herself for a harmless syrup to be marketed by husband as a panacea, accompanied by personal letters to purchasers that he regards as the real cure; this is a brilliant idea that meets early success. But Wickett becomes one of the first victims of the Flu, and the remedy ceases to be sold a quarter-way through the book. The story of how the flavor was parlayed by Wickett's former partner into a soda empire to rival Coke is told in brief flash-forward sections that conclude each chapter, but these are rather silly in style and do not reflect at all on the main story.That is the story of how Lydia herself, a widow at twenty-three and also reeling under the loss of a beloved brother, finds some purpose as a nursing volunteer at the height of the epidemic. This culminates in a true episode -- the failed experiments on Gallups Island in which doctors tried to expose volunteers to the Spanish Flu in order to study the transmission of the often-deadly disease. Some of the procedures described turn the stomach, although Goldberg always writes with humanity and Lydia does grow in knowledge and compassion. But just as the real tests were inconclusive, so in a way is Lydia's story; you simply turn a page and discover that the book has ended. Somehow, the multiple strands of period narrative, newspaper clippings, publicity materials for the soda company, and marginal commentaries dissipate their combined effect instead of reinforcing one another. Although Myla Goldberg certainly has the talent to attempt such an experiment in form, I can't help feeling that she would have done even better with a novel of more conventional style.For another book set during the Spanish Flu epidemic, see Thomas Mullen'sTHE LAST TOWN ON EARTH; I personally find it the more successful of the two."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"It's lovely, with an inventive narrative. The whisperers are charming, funny, and heartbreaking. A beautiful novel, especially for those who love historical fiction."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I listened to audio version of this book, read by the author - a nice element. I thought most of the other voice actors used in this recording were unnecessary. I enjoyed the details of the main character's life in the early 1900's, but it got a little confusing when the book cut away to other random people having conversations that were completely unrelated to the main story. (also confusing when dead people made comments here and there) There were some sound effects that helped to create the atmosphere of that time in history, and others that were fairly annoying (the typewriter with the stern newscaster and also the QD Soda tour). Mainly I was disappointed after sticking with Lydia through her many challenges in life only to reach a sudden and unsatisfying ending. It's like the author just got tired of writing and said, \\"ok, I'm done.\\" I don't think I'll read more by Myla Goldberg."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I am all for books with funky narrators and interesting narrative styles. Though I'm still unsure about postmodernism, I love novels that push the limits on our expectations for genre. When I picked up \\"Wickett's Remedy\\", I thought that I was just in for an interesting story on the Spanish influenza. Oh boy, how wrong I was! What I wound up with was a great novel about South Boston during WWI, but written in a style that includes voices from those who had already past. Additionally, the author uses a bit of a scrapbook technique that includes letters, newsletters, and newspaper clippings. All of these forms are beautifully woven into the story in a way that gives it many dimensions and a great story.Lydia is an Irish girl from South Boston who yearns to live and work on Washington Avenue. While all of her neighbors are going about their lives in Southie, Lydia lands a job working at a famous department store on her dream street. It is there that she meets her future husband who is studying to be a doctor. However, he abandons that path when he and Lydia marry and instead decides to produce a remedy tonic. When the Spanish Influenza strikes, Lydia's (along with the rest of the country's) life is completely turned upside down. Her story is interspersed with newsletters regarding the world famous QD soda. These stories are masterfully braided together to reveal the full extent of Lydia's life and losses.To say I couldn't put this book down is a grave understatement. This novel had come to my attention a couple of times before I finally picked it up. Even once I did, I was a bit startled by the fact that there is the complete text in the center of the page with a couple of lines of subscript in the margins of each page. It took a bit of time to figure out how to handle this but it soon became natural to read the standard text and then glance over at the marginal notes. The notes are written in the first person plural and seem to be from the viewpoint of those who have passed on. Typically, they are used as a way for secondary characters to voice how they viewed a certain situation. This is incredibly interesting because it shows the shortcomings of the overall narrator while calling into question our personal memories and their accuracy. Each chapter is constructed a bit like a scrapbook. The majority of the pages focus on the overall plot with the marginal notes supplementing it. Towards the end of each chapter, the author throws in some news clippings, letters, and various kinds of dialog. It's a little bit of a game to try to figure out what it all means but as it comes together it's clear that the whole book is a beautiful tapestry of narrative techniques.As a history buff, I was extremely impressed by the amount of meticulous research the author performed. Most historical fiction focuses on a historical event but than manipulates it to fit the author's characters and views. This is not true of \\"Wickett's Remedy\\". The history is not only accurate but vital to the characters and the story. The plot is not merely dropped into a certain time period but instead is about that time and the people in it. This adds a realness to the characters that is often lacking in fiction. Overall, I think that this is a fantastic book both for its story and its technique. I have no qualms recommending it to book groups, friends, family, enemies, and strangers."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"An interesting book to listen to while hearing about the present day swine flu. It's about the Spanish Influenza outbreak and set in Boston. The ignorance of the flu at that time is amazing.The voices on the audiobook were at first confusing. Then, I really enjoyed them and they added to the story. Besides the narrator ( who is the author) there are ethereal voices that are from dead people as individuals and from the dead as a whole, basically editing the memories of the living as the story is being told. These voices are not in a majority of the story, but make it interetsing and remind us that the recollections of humans are dependent on so much more than actual experience.The main character is a young woman who loses a lot of people through the epidemic and \\"comes of age\\" as she does so. She is not so likable at the beginning but becomes really sweetas she matures throught the story. She eventually becomes an assistant nurse in a study on flu transmission that is rather disturbing. The ending is odd, and there is a back story of this \\"remedy\\" that she and her husband created that turned into a soda pop. Hence, Wickett's Remedy is the title. The main story, though, is about the Spanish flu, the terrible toll it took on the people at the time, and how it shaped this particular woman."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I listened to the author read this book on CD .... \\"and that has made all the difference.\\" Change of voice and a few sound effects give this book the status of a great radio drama which seems to be the right way for the story to be presented. Not only has Goldberg written an interesting and clever historical novel but she has presented it in the cultural context of World War I.Reading letters my grandparents exchanged as sweethearts during the War, the same immediacy of dealing with the ongoing fears of war and disease, while grieving and hoping for something better yet to come, rings true.Growing up in Dorchester, Massachusetts in the 1950's, I can relate very closely to Lydia's experiences in Southie, the Carney and Gilchrist's (though Myla mispronounces the name of the store).I will agree that the story is very ambitious and there is more that could be done with the many story lines, but leave some out and simplify it and .... what? The perspective is Lydia's and it also rings true to me. So does the ending.The whisperers in the audio version are a great device to show how one persons memory or telling of the story differs from another. This is Lydia's story as she experienced it. The QD soda story and the news reports add so much to my enjoyment of the book. Thanks, Myla!"},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"While this novel was on a subject that I usually find rather interesting, I found the work itself to be lacking. The \\"whisperings\\" in the margins only distract the reader and provide little to no substance to the work.

Overall, I would not recommend this book unless you really are sick and stuck on the couch, but even then it won't make you feel much better."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I am ambivalent about Wickett's Remedy. (I read the paperback. I understand she rewrote it from the hard cover edition.) I enjoyed the historical setting. Myla Godberg did a good job of evoking the period of the Influenza epidemic. I got a good sense for the setting as well and could well accept her premise. The margin notes were, I thought, one of the most clever and effective literary devices I've encountered. Wish I'd thought of it!However, there was something about the way the threads of this story were woven together that was unsatisfying. Or perhaps it is that they weren't, in fact, woven together very well. I wonder if, having set the stage for this complicated novel, she struggled to make it work. And then, suddenly, it was just over. As I said - unsatisfying. It wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't all that great."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I very much enjoyed Bee Season. This is a classic sophomore novel. Very ambitious. Consciously unconventional to very little effect. Very poorly edited. Haphazard story lines. Not a very enjoyable read. I found it interesting because of the historic context, but the descriptions of bygone places such as Boston's West End and Scollay Square are over-researched and not remarkably subtle.I find it unfathomable that anyone could call this book \\"awe-inspiring\\". I liked the review \\"Each reader can interpret the meaning of this book according to one's own life experience.\\" The same could be said of the back of a box of Wheaties.I found the descriptions of the epidemic compelling enough to take out some of the books she used in her research which are more interesting."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"As other reviewers have said, this book is confusing at the beginning due to the seemingly unconnected story lines. But I found it quite delightful as I looked for and made the connections as the story progressed.

I admit I cheated by reading the blurb on the bookjacket of the hard cover edition as to their relevance.I was really drawn into the story and connected with the characters and I felt the book gave a sense of what it must have been like to live during the flu epidemic. Fascinating book, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I bogged down on page 30 and thought of giving up on the book. The disembodied comments in the margin were distracting and fragmented. The main characters, Lydia and Henry, seemed flat and characterless.Now that I read the other reviews, I think I'll give it another try, with a better understanding of the purpose of the margin voices.I really wanted to read this book for its view into the 1918 flu epidemic. Boston was particularly hard hit by this and I wanted a more human view of it than the nonfiction book I'd read on the topic.Update: Well, I finally finished it, but have serious reservations. The QD Soda storyline didn't blend well with the overall theme of the effects of the 1918 flu pandemic on a South Boston's neighborhood. The mix of real news clippings, fictitious letters, and Lydia's third person experiences were often confusing. It's not always clear who's who. The voices in the margin (those in the book who died) often contradicted or shed little light on the story. The sudden aspiration to become a nurse that resulted in Lydia participating in a historic experiment on an island, seemed forced and lost what momentum the neighborhood account had.

However, we don't learn of her future after her time at Gallups Island at all, just that she dies young. Juxtaposing this with QD Soda's \\"invention\\" is confusing and in the end goes nowhere. I thought there were way too many loose ends, and though the reader cares about Lydia, she is left wanting to know about what happens to Lydia. I found the plot devices inc. tours of QD Soda and Quentin's and Ralph's correspondence to be quite tedious."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"This is an awe-inspiring book written by a remarkable new writer.

It's ridiculous and sad and so very engaging. Another reviewer complained that the cosmic perspective of the novel dwarfed Lydia Wickett's experiences, and I think that's exactly right, and just as it should be. The novel isn't really about telling any particular person's story. The novel is much more about how life unfolds senselessly and uncontrollably; how very little is within our control. Stupid decisions work out well, painstaking decisions work terribly. But in the end, everyone ends up in the same place, and every experience is precious. It's deeper and more mature than Bee Season, in which every character was desperately trying to find some greater order in the universe, around which they could form their lives, and that greater order was strongly implied."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"Myla Goldberg has written a charming, quirky and strange book (just look at the front cover). This is not a conventional novel but a creative one if the reader gives it a chance. The central event of the novel is the influenza pan-epidemic during World War I as seen through the eyes of a married couple in Boston and of the souls who have perished of the flu in 1918.Ms. Goldberg stretches out her book to the 1990's by the device of following the strange corporate history of the husband's invention, Wickett's Remedy. While the story covers a lot of ground (there is a sub-plot involving unethical medical testing by the US Government), the characters, even as they die off, are compelling. In a book about death, this wonderful novel reaffirms life in its own fashion. For further historical background, the reader is referred to John Barry's \\"The Great Influenza\\" which tells how 20 million persons worldwide perished from this deadly virus."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"There is absolutely no doubt that Goldberg is a masterful prose writer. Bee Season was not a fluke, and she demonstrates that she's more than capable of getting inside the heads of disparate characters-- not just Jewish characters from this century and people who might be like her, but people separate from her in time and ethnicity. Whether or not you end up loving this novel's plot, her sentences and descriptions are really gorgeous.This time she writes about Lydia Kilkenny, an Irish girl from Boston's South End at the turn of the century, who becomes a shop girl at Gilchrist's in a swankier part of town, is courted by and marries Henry Wickett, a shy medical student who quits to sell \\"Wickett's Remedy.\\" Henry dies of illness, and Lydia becomes a nurse during the influenza epidemic of 1918, taking part in a failed experiment on Gallup's island. Meanwhile, her husband's \\"business partner\\" has taken the original remedy and turned it into a bestselling soda, and we see letters from Lydia in the twenties trying to get some money owed her out of Driscoll, as well as Driscoll's letters to his dead wife and son, and various press releases and newsletters from QD soda which seems to be a sort of cult (I've been to the coke museum in Atlanta and it doesn't seem that even coke has the same weird culture Goldberg imagines for QD soda). Documents from 1993 describe a jubilee, and Driscoll's confession that a dead woman invented the soda (but a newsletter suggests this was treated as a joke, though not clearly by his adopted son who according to dcouments from the nursing home has since neglected Driscoll's care).Lydia's story also has marginalia from the whisperings of dead people commenting and contradicting on the narrative. I loved that. I was a lot less interested in all of the QD soda materials and tended to skim them. Each chapter ended with these, as well as excerpts from newspaper articles about the epidemic, and odd unrelated sequences of dialogue from patients, soldiers, random people. Very post-modern, but the only part of it that really worked for me was the marginalia. I was a lot more interested in Lydia than in Driscoll.But Lydia takes up 90% of the book and I found her story very satisfying somehow. OK, maybe it's true there isn't a lot of tension, but I really liked her and felt for her as she saw loved ones die and cared for soldiers she feared might die. Goldberg really evokes the time and place very well, and this is a worthwhile novel!"},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"Wickett's Remedy represents an idea that had a lot of potential but which never fully evolved into the novel it might have been. I have to give Goldberg credit for attempting some very ambitious narrative techniques (the marginal voices of the dead, the epistolary interludes from the present, while most of the novel proper takes place in the past), but they never fully mesh, and consequently, they feel more like a gimmick than a groundbreaking new narrative style.For me, the novel proper (following the story of Lydia and the 1918 influenza epidemic) was FAR more interesting than the present-day story of how Wickett's Remedy was stolen and developed into a successful soda product. And the marginal voices of the dead were just that -- marginal. I never could make up my mind what I thought of that, which in itself is probably a sign that whatever Goldberg intended was never completely successful. At least, for me.I understand that Ms. Goldberg substantially rewrote the novel for the paperback edition -- a rather daring choice -- but I can't speak to that edition. My comments pertain to the original hardcover. And for my money, it's nowhere close to her first novel, Bee Season, which I absolutely loved! Wicket's Remedy was interesting, but it never quite came together, and I never felt fully invested in the outcome of the story. A pity."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"This book was very well written, and was a very engaging story. I must say honestly though, that I often didn't enjoy the \\"newspaper articles\\" posted throughout, though I realize they relate directly to the time period. What I found most interesting is the \\"whisperings\\" of \\"Us\\" that can be found in the margins of the pages. It is intersting to see how others percieved an event as compared to the main character, and how their after-death memories and \\"whisperings\\" seemed to influence, in some small way, the world of Lydia. The story itself was great but I felt as though it lacked an adequate conclusion. Another chapter or two would have left a greater feeling of closure. Otherwise, an amazing piece!"},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"Wickett's Remedy is the kind of novel you feel awful giving a bad review to. It's a risky novel for Goldberg in many ways, and one wants to give her lots of credit for the chances she takes--moving away from the family study of her oh-so-popular first book, using marginal snippets of narration from a chorus of the dead, interspersing the story's main narrative with newspaper clippings, letters, brief conversations, and promotional chitchat. But in the end, the risks proved too much and the novel fails, the parts never creating a compelling sum.Wickett's follows Lydia Kilkenney, a young woman of \\"Southy\\" who in 1914 marries up in society via Harry Wickett, a shy, sickly medical student who meets her at her salesclerk job then wins her over through his passionate love letters. Soon after their wedding, Harry decides to drop out of med school and create Wickett's Remedy, whose medicine would not be in the good-tasting liquid Lydia creates, but in the letters he sends along with the tonic. Eventually, the business and their lives are interrupted by war and pandemic and Lydia must deal with first Harry's death, then others' deaths equally close to her. In this she finds her new calling--becoming a volunteer nurse, first at the local hospital, then by chance (actually mostly by default) at an experimental flu study (using criminals--deserters--as voluntary human subjects) on nearby Gallups Island. Her story is paralleled by the history of QD Soda, the soda Wickett's Remedy eventually was turned into by an unscrupulous businessman who had become Harry's partner just before his death. This parallel plot unfolds through a variety of narratives--letters, promotional pitches, etc. Finally, Goldberg also employs a chorus of the dead who comment on Lydia's narrative in marginal snippets, conveying the cloudiness and untrustworthiness of memory/perception.Unfortunately, the more creative narratives seldom add much to the story's impact and in fact often detract from it. The QD soda plot line in particular is overly intrusive and quickly becomes annoying. Though it gathers some thematic and emotional weight towards the end, it didn't seem worth the journey to get there. The chorus of the dead is certainly less annoying: one because there is simply less of it, two because the comments are all very brief, and three because there are some nice comical moments and even some poignant ones. But again, in the end, they didn't add much and so the result didn't seem worth the distraction, not only from the basic plot but also from the plot's emotional impact.Finally, even Lydia herself failed to compel. There were certainly moments of sharp emotional impact, deeply poignant moments, nicely written moments of insight, but as a character she never felt truly, fully there. She never felt able to carry the narrative on her shoulders. Part of it was she was somewhat buried beneath the other narratives--QD Soda, the historical news clippings and conversations, the chorus speech. Part of it was the episodic nature of the story, so that just as we get to know Lydia the Southy girl she becomes Lydia the young wife in a higher class of society. Then just as we become interested in that character she becomes Lydia the widow and then in short order Lydia the further grieving then Lydia the nurse's aide to a faceless mass of dying then Lydia the nurse to a smaller, more individual group then Lydia the new romantic etc. All of these incarnations deserved more space, more time spent with them but since we're never given that time or space, Lydia herself seems too removed.Again, one respects the willingness to try new forms of narrative, and the research is clearly well done with regard to the historical aspects of duel plague of war and flu in early 20th century Boston, but while giving her a well-deserved nod for literary talent and nerve, I can't give her credit for creating a very compelling story, either in terms of plot or emotion."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"There are numerous delightful aspects to this novel, especially the attention to historical detail and the ingenious \\"whisperings\\" in the margins.Unfortunately, Goldberg has added so many different strands that the ultimate work doesn't hang together well. There are too many different story lines, and as a result I found myself ignoring one that later proved relevant, and distracting by the irrelevant story of QD Soda. It was unfortunate, because the central themes, the story of Lydia Wickett in 1917-18, the Gallups Island experiment, and the role of memory and history, were all wonderful. They just got buried under the weight of all the other strands. If QD Soda had been edited out, one might have been able to appreciate the newspaper articles and other tidbits; as it was, it became an overly busy patchwork, hard to appreciate much of anything."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"This book is a nice, slow, home-cooked meal. You'll do an injustice if you try to hurry through it in one long sitting. The main character, Lydia, comes of age sweetly although her life seems like one tragedy after another. I didn't find her to be a passive character as did one of the other reviewers. Impeccably researched, very well written, and altogether quirky, my only complaint is that it ended a bit too abruptly."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I have been a fan of Myla Goldberg since reading her first novel a few years ago. In some ways, I enjoyed the first third of this novel even more ... Goldberg's depiction of Henry's courtship of Lydia is simply lovely in a romantic and somewhat old-fashioned sense. Ms. Goldberg's marginal notes, while distracting at time, are often used \\"to lovely effect\\" (as one reviewer phrased it). Here is one example: \\". . . It is practically impossible to retain the homeliness of unfamiliar features once they have grown dear.\\" And Ms. Goldberg's writing is extremely moving; the pages describing Henry's illness and death are heartwrenchingly beautiful. Unlike other reviewers here, I did not find Lydia to be a passive character.All that said, I was disappointed at the turn of plot following Henry's death. The marginal notes and subplot about QD Soda quickly grew wearisome. Some of the events that occurred at Gallups Island (at least as depicted in this novel) stretch the imagination. Still, I would recommend this novel, just to read of the romance between Henry and Lydia."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"Goldberg's first novel, Bee Season, was one of the best firsts I'd read in years. Instead of sticking with what worked beautifully the first time around, Goldberg resorted to a couple of clunky contrivances to spoil the formula in Wickett's Remedy. The novel starts out strong, with interesting characters and a compelling historical story line. Sadly, the interruptions of Goldberg's annoying margin commentary and the inscrutable QD Soda newsletter provide nothing more than a distraction. And by the end of the novel, even the story line gives out, stranded along with the protagonist, Lydia Wickett, on an island where both the good work she hopes to do and the story Goldberg begins with such promise amount to nothing much."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I love everything about this book especially the marginal notes. A main point that this book subtly makes is that perception is in the eye of the beholder. Lydia remembers how an event occurred, but the marginal notes indicate another aspect. These notes added a whole new dimension to the story that the sophisticated reader will appreciate.Another interesting flavor was the glimpses into a fictional present day with blurbs regarding QD soda told through newsletters and tour information. This made for a very multi-dimensional telling of a simple and gentle story."},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","review":"I loved Myla Goldberg's Bee Season and eagerly awaited her next novel. Unfortunately, Wickett's Remedy is clever at best. (I can't speak of the whole book, only of the first several chapters which I read). The main character Lydia seems strangely passive and passionless in response to her suitor's odd but successful courtship. The tone faintly suggests, \\"She is just a character in a novel\\"; everything seems like a clever device, or an opening for a clever device. The prose is somewhat belabored. I had to stutter-read, returning to the same sentence twice, to absorb the information it conveyed. Too bad that I couldn't just be \\"absorbed\\" as I was by Bee Season."},{"Title":"Past the Size of Dreaming (Red Heart of Memories)","review":"I loved this book. I'd been looking forward to it for a long time and it lived up to my expectations. Filled with transformations and strange magic, Past the Size of Dreaming continues the story begun in A Red Heart of Memories. Having found Edmond's friend Suki and settled (temporarily) in the magical, sentient house which served as the safe haven for Edmond and his friends during their adolecent years, Edmond and Matt attempt to locate Julio and Deirdre. Matt learns of the events that helped to drive the four friends apart fifteen years earlier through dreams which the magical house sends her. When Edmond tries to find Julio with magic he fails. Leaving Suki and her ghostly boyfriend Nathan (who is trapped in the house except on Holloweens and seances) to keep the house company, Matt and Edmond go in search of Deirdre, who is relatively easy to locate. A drive to the desert finds her ensconced as a small-town, small-animal vet. She is happy to see Edmond but reluctant to return with him to the house. Using their very different magics (Edmond can communicate with the natural world, whereas Matt can communicate with human-made objects) and some common sense, they end up finding everyone, including the twin witch sisters Tasha and Terry and the person Julio has become. Everyone has changed, some more than others. As the friends get to know each other anew, an old enemy begins to move against them. I don't want to give away what happens next, as this book is filled with many fantastic surpises. The writing is supurb and fans of Ms. Hoffmans earlier work will not be disappointed.

Obtaining House's blessing, Edmund also brings his childhood friends there for a visit.Most people on intimate terms with House have been transformed into beings with magical abilities that ultimately attract the attention of an evil sorcerer. He wants to bind this group to him. While the witches fight off the magical attack, Houses confesses that it purposely brought them together to defeat for reasons of its' own.PAST THE SIZE OF DREAMING, the sequel to A RED HEART OF MEMORIES, is a beautiful story where evil tries to triumph over good.

While I like Hoffman's prose and imaginative settings, I can't help but feel disappointed at another ending with so much open. She writes such vivid characters, and yet the story always ends with one problem solved and five more created.This is the story of the transformation of House, and 'Past the Size of Dreaming' refers to the task set by the House to it's children, which are being gathered by Edmond and Matt in the early book. They are opposed by the warlock who hurt Julio long ago.

The book contains many color reproductions of his large non-objective canvases. Still himself wrote the book and gives us a very good insight into his life and thinking process. He discusses what went into his paintings and how his unique canvas numbering system worked absent dates and titles to identify his work. It is also a journey through his body of work. His paintings were skillfully balanced with positive and negative spaces and his unparalleled use of color is well documented. This book is a must for any art lover in general and for students of American art in particular. I liked this book not only for the well reproduced paintings in color but also because it let's us into the painter's mind to get a glimps of his true genius."},{"Title":"Clyfford Still 1904-1980: The Buffalo and San Francisco Collections","review":"With the new Clyfford Still Museum opening in Denver, Colorado there is bound to be heightened increase in visibility for the works of the abstract expressionist Clyfford Still. This book was published as a catalogue for a retrospective exhibition and is a fine monograph on the artist. The works for the retrospective were joined from the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, NY and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and much of the written material is by the curators of those museums - Michael Auping and Susan Landauer, both of whom write with tremendous authority and knowledge about this intense artist..The book contains over sixty color reproductions of Still's major works and of special note there is a definitive chronology of Still's life and career by his widow Patricia Still. It is fascinating to note that between the time of his death in 1980 and the opening of the museum named for him his works were rarely shown in museums as a group of works. Practically all the major museums in the country own at least one work, but here we are able to see the impact of his mind and brush in a manner that allows the respect the artist deserves.

In the time of Coriolanus, Rome had no kings, but it was still risky for ordinary citizens like Shakespeare and his fellow players to say that rulers must submit to popular custom.Coriolanus is a great general and his success in battle should ensure his success in politics. He wants to be consul, but he is too proud to ask the electors to choose him. The people do want Coriolianus as counsel, they stand in awe of his prowess, and enthusiastically welcome his triumphant return to Rome. But no one stands above Rome and Roman law mandates elections and their forms. Coriolanus, dressed in a white toga to show his purity, must humbly ask the Roman people to give him the consulship. He feels his victories, which have saved Rome and enriched it, entitles him to the position and wants it simply given to him.He half heartedly complies with electoral customs but he is soon disgusted at himself. He leaves Rome and joins the enemy to march and conquer his native city republic.John F. Kennedy wrote a book entitled \\"Profiles In Courage\\" about politicians who have stuck to their principles and refused to pander to the will of the people when they felt the people were morally in the wrong. Coriolanus doesn't fit this profile. He sticks to his principles all right, but his chief value is personal pride. There's no question Coriolanus is courageous but he is also selfish. He looks to his welfare, not the Roman people's; he looks to his glory, not Rome's.If anyone shows courage in Coriolanus, it is Shakespeare himself. Shakespeare questions the right of the greatest man in the land to hold any position simply because he feels entitled to it. The people must be heard and leaders must accept. Shakespeare gets away with this because Coriolanus isn't a king, but his theme is clear.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"Incredible story with lots of plot lines and hidden meanings.

Yet, this must be a misprint. Latest? Certainly. Greatest? Hardly.For one thing, anyone with any familiarity with Shakespeare's plays must immediately note the protagonist's lack of humanity. Coriolanus' heartlessness is his chief characteristic. All the things that make him so compelling on the battlefield only serve to dull his appeal as a civilian. Since Coriolanus spends the majority of the play as a civilian, this is bad news for the audience.There may well be tragic events in Coriolanus. However, Coriolanus falls short of great Shakespearean tragedy. The lead is not exceptional (as are the rest of Shakespeare's tragic heroes). At best, Coriolanus is a dolt who becomes a savant on the battlefield. Shakespeare telegraphs, rather than foreshadows, the tragic events of Coriolanus. This, compounded with Coriolanus' inability to carry the play, makes for a rather frenzied mush of a drama.I recommend Coriolanus only to the Shakespearean completist. It is not one of his better works."},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"This inexpensive volume is a fine edition with very readable text, good notes, and a nice introduction. Coriolanus is not one of Shakespeare's most popular plays, though it has its partisans. As with several of Shakespeare's best plays, it is an attempt to combine an investigation of the nature of power with a psychological portrait. The nature of power or kingship was one of Shakespeare's great themes, featured in some of the great tragedies like MacBeth or Lear, and this theme runs through many of his history plays. In Coriolanus, however, this theme is handled less well. It is interesting to speculate why Shakespeare, who dealt with this theme so well in many plays, doesn't do such a good job in Coriolanus. The action in Coriolanus is set in a republic, not a monarchy. The structure of republican politics is not one Shakespeare would have known well and the problems of politics and authority in a republican are different than those of a monarchy. Particularly for modern audiences, whose intrinsic understanding of republican politics is much greater than Shakespeare's, the clumsy handling of the tension between the aristocratic Coriolanus and the plebes rings false. In addition, the psychological portrait of Coriolanus is not nearly as rich as Shakespeare's analysis of quite a few of his other protagonists. Much of the language in Coriolanus is powerful but it lacks the dramatic movement and insight of his best work."},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"+++++This play, written circa 1608, is the last of William Shakespeare's (1564 to 1616) eleven (some say ten) known tragedies. Even though it is known as a \\"Roman\\" or \\"political\\" play, serious readers will discover that it so much more. I found that it stayed with me long after I read it.This play is set in ancient Rome. It is essentially the story of warrior Caius Marcius (later known as \\"Coriolanus\\") whose honor, pride, and sense of social rank dominates his life and interferes with his ability to function effectively when he's not on the battlefield.One of the great attributes of this play is that it does not have many characters and thus is easy to follow. The major characters are as follows:(1) Coriolanus (originally Caius Marcius): a valiant warrior and patrician (nobleman) with a non-overbearing wife. \\"A soldier to Cato's wish\\" and a modest hero who \\"hath deserved worthily of his country\\" but who lacks tact and refuses to placate \\"the mutable, rank-scented many.\\"(2) Volumnia: his overbearing mother. \\"In anger, Juno-like.\\"(3) Menenius Agrippa: \\"a humorous patrician\\" and an old and true friend of Coriolanus who is trusted by the plebeians (lower class)(4) Titus Lartius and Cominius: fellow generals with Coriolanus.(5) Sicinius and Brutus: tribunes (representatives of the plebeians) of the common people and Coriolanus' political enemies. \\"A pair of strange ones.\\"(6) Tullus Aufidius: general of Rome's enemies and rival in glory to Coriolanus.This \\"Shakespeare PELican\\" book (published by Penguin in 1999) has some interesting material before the play proper. I found the introduction to the play especially informative.I would recommend, in order to get the full impact of this play, to either see it on film (the BBC production is excellent) or to see it on the stage.Finally, I cannot understand why this play has been overlooked as one of Shakespeare's great works. (It was, in fact, written during Shakespeare's greatest period, 1599 to 1608.) The story itself is interesting with many subtle themes. The only thing I can think of is that there are some terms that you must know to properly understand the play (such as patrician, plebeian, tribune, etc.). These terms can be easily looked up in a good dictionary.In conclusion, this play, in my opinion, is an overlooked gem. This book published by Penguin is an excellent resource for students, teachers, theatre professionals, and anyone interested in discovering this great play!!+++++"},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"This is Shakespeare's greatest tragedy in my opinion. Everybody talks about Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, and Romeo and Juliet, but Coriolanus for some reason is mostly, and unjustly, ignored. I feel that Coriolanus is the only pure tragedy among Shakespeare's works. Macbeth was a sociopath who brought all his troubles on himself; Hamlet was a confused young man who couldn't make a decision and who waited too long to get the job done; King Lear was an old fool who played games with his daughters and brought most of his problems on himself; Othello could have avoided his problems if he simply sat down and had a real conversation with his wife; and Romeo and Juliet were just a couple of immature kids who simply needed a few hard kicks in their butts. Coriolanus is different. Coriolanus was simply an honest, hard-working soldier who got the job done and told the truth, but was brought down by the guile of his enemies. That, in my opinion, is the greatest tragedy of them all.It seems that people either love or hate this play. Many consider Coriolanus to be a very unlikable character because he is supposedly arrogant, but I disagree. Coriolanus just worked hard, told the truth, was a straight shooter, and refused to play silly games by telling people what they wanted to hear. I guess I see something different in this play than most critics and readers of Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"Shakespeare's last and greatest tragedy, *Coriolanus* dramatizes the conflict between pride and envy--those two antagonists which were the favorite characters of ancient myth.Coriolanus is a man of Virtue, when virtue meant 'manliness' not 'modest chastity.' Above all, he had the virtue of pursuing virtue, which he refused to compromise and which he refused to hide. In contrast, the aristocracy and the mob whom they serve despised Coriolanus precisely because he was good and refused to be otherwise.*Coriolanus* is Shakespeare at the height of his powers, and the real tragedy is that this work is not better known."},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"I never understood why this play is so unpopular. Coriolanus is a very striking figure. He is a brave and valiant soldier. Yet, he has contempt for the people he protects. In all honesty this is very common. Shakespeare never allows the intensity of this play to drop for a moment. At first Coriolanus fights to the extreme for Rome. Then he fights to the extreme against Rome. His reconciliation with his former enemy Aufidius in 4.5 is a very memorable scene. Only when he is confronted by his mother, wife, and son does he go through a crisis of conscience. It is interesting that because he begins to see the world in terms other than himself, his downfall becomes inevitable. To be sure, this play is not a masterpiece like &quot;Julius Caesar,&quot; &quot;Hamlet,&quot; &quot;King Lear,&quot; or &quot;Richard III.&quot; But it is A LOT BETTER than some of his popular plays like &quot;Othello&quot; or &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; I highly suggest it!"},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"Any Shakespeare play that leaves people with totally different interpretations regarding the nature of the lead character can't be all bad. That said, \\"Coriolanus\\" suffers from its ambiguity.The first time I read it was in college. My kindly professor laid out the case for seeing Coriolanus as a kind of fascist strongman brought down by his contempt for the people, and I went away comforted in my small-L liberalism. This time, however, reading it on my own, it was hard not to see Coriolanus as something else entirely, a deserving elitist brought down by an envious, parasitic mobocracy who couldn't bear to see him succeed. In short, John Galt in a toga.A more disturbing realization with this second reading was that as a play, \\"Coriolanus\\" doesn't hold together. It's considered likely to be Shakespeare's last tragedy, written in 1608-09, but lacks for the vitality or singular inspiration you expect from the seasoned tragedian of \\"MacBeth\\" or \\"King Lear.\\"It has a fantastic first act as I read it, brimming with great dialogue, highly charged scenes, and a well-extended battle sequence. Act I also sets up the core issue of the rest of the play. \\"He that trusts to you,/Where he should find you lions, finds you hares/Where foxes, geese,\\" is how the bold patrician Marcius puts it to the rabble rousers at the play's start. \\"He that depends/Upon your favors swims on fins of lead/And hews down oaks with rushes.\\"Marcius will later be renamed Coriolanus, after conquering the city Corioles. Rome proves more of a problem, where he's rejected by an easily-led and ungrateful mob. They have a point about Marcius' coldness when it comes to their need for corn, but he's not a dangerous character. Yes, he's more than a trifle haughty and dominated by a glory-hungry mother with vicious tendencies, but he is no threat to their young republic. He prefers to fight and leave the power trappings to others. He even declines booty he took from an enemy city.Coriolanus being neither villain nor sympathetic hero is a problem with the play. So is the cast around him. There are two types of characters in \\"Coriolanus\\": his loyal but impotent patrician friends and the weaselly plebs who oppose him for largely obscure reasons. The characters lack depth, even Coriolanus's mother who goes from diabolic to dishwater in a few scenes.The last four acts mix affecting scenes and great lines with a very choppy storyline. Coriolanus is always turning on a dime. Coriolanus vows not to wear humble robes in order to appeal to public favor, then does. He promises not to lose his temper in a key moment, and then does anyway with gusto. He tells his mother to go away one moment, and the next kneels before her. Coriolanus famously offers fewer soliloquies than any of Shakespeare's tragic heroes, perhaps because he doesn't have an inner self worth knowing.I liked this play more as a Shakespeare buff. It's the flip side of his \\"Richard II.\\" Richard II fatally overplays his sense of divine right as his subjects prove better than he deserves. Here, the title character is deserving but undone by common men who act in uniformly baser ways. The yin-yang idea of noblesse oblige in Shakespeare's day seems on display in these plays when considered together, presenting a kind of cultural bubble level that tilts depending on the angle of the viewer.On its own, \\"Coriolanus\\" is occasionally gripping but ultimately frustrating reading, in need of an inspired director with a properly skewed take to give it the cohesion on stage it lacks on the page."},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"&quot;Thy valientness is mine. Thou suckest it from me.&quot; That would be Volumnia's (Coriolanus' mother) quote -- and one of my favorites. &quot;Coriolanus&quot; is an intriguing story and the characters are marvelous. I have yet to see a better portrayal of a suffocating mother. Volumnia will live in my heart forever."},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"With its scenes of war and mobs, CORIOLANUS is a work best expirienced on the stage, of course, being one of his least popular plays, it doesn't get produced too often.The only killing Coriolanus does is on the battle field, but he still comes off as a much less likable character than the murdering Hamlet or Macbeth because Coriolanus spends much of the play berating the citizens of Rome. CORIOLANUS has often been called Shakespeare's manifesto against democracy because of this, but the play is much more complex than that. Yes, it's a play about the fickleness of the masses, but it's also about leaders who don't perform their responsibilities either.The play is much more political than emotional, and therefore not one I'll return to often, but its political statements are as timely today as they were 400 years ago, if not moreso."},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"The commentary is modern and relevant, and the play itself is a masterwork: it challenges the audience directly with the character of Gaius Martius Coriolanus, who derives his being from war. It is a very great play, worthy of long and careful study. But the Kindle edition is essentially unreadable: it's impossible to tell the length of lines, since all is presented in scarcely differentiated blocks of text which, alarmingly, change sizes are you're reading. There are no notes to explain terms. The apparatus considered essential for modern readers is lost in the transition to Kindle format. (Try to find any act-scene-line combination: it's almost impossible). The Kindle is pretty slick, but the formatting of Shakespeare's play is beond this device. Buy the paperback; or let me know if you find a Kindle-compatible version that preserve stage direction, notes on the text, and the proper division of lines."},{"Title":"Coriolanus","review":"This is a pretty decent political tragedy. The book has a great inroduction that helped lay out the themes of the play. While this was a good work, it wasn't my favorite by Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Northrop P-61 Black Widow Pilot's Flight Manual","review":"The P-61 Black Widow is one of the really rare warbirds from World War II. It has a certain mystique because not too many were built and because they were designed to fly at night.The following information is what I've been able to collect over the years, and is not guaranteed to be accurate:Only 705 were built. Of these only four are known to exist, one each at the Smithsonian (not on diaplay), Wright Pat Air Base Museum, one at Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Engineering in Beijing, China (reportedly for sale for $2 Million - They cost $170,000 new), and one at the Mid-Atlantic Air Museum (maam.org) which is being restored, hopefully to flying status.The gun turret on the top of the P-61 was the same as on the B-29. The B-29's had priority so a lot of P-61's were built without the top turret. There are also stories that when you turned the top turret to either side that the plane became unstable.Anyway, this book is a reprint of the original pilot's manual. A study of this book, and the pilot was supposed to be able to fly the thing."},{"Title":"Northrop P-61 Black Widow Pilot's Flight Manual","review":"The heavily armed P-61 Black Widow was the U.S. Army Air Force's first dedicated night fighter. Equipped with radar, four .50 caliber machine guns and four 20mm. cannons, the Widow was a fearsome adversary. It flew as both an intruder and interceptor in Europe and the Pacific.Service deliveries of the aircraft started in May, 1944, with the 348th Night Fighter Squadron (NFS) of the 481st Night Fighter Group (NFG). The first P-61 kill was recorded on June 30, 1944 (some sources say July 6), when a Widow of the 6th NFS downed a 'Betty\\" bomber over the Pacific.706 P-61's were built in total.Originally printed by Northrop in 1945, the P-61 Pilot's Flight Operating Manual taught pilots everything they needed to know before entering the cockpit. Originally classified \\"Restricted\\", the manual was declassified long ago and is here reprinted in book form. This affordable facsimile has been reformatted, but care has been taken however to preserve the integrity of the text. It's a fascinating read and one of the more unique ways to appreciate this unique warbird."},{"Title":"Rome wasn't burned in a day: The mischief of language,","review":"Give yourself a break, some laughs, and a lesson in the English language.

Basically, the book tells of the cases that the TV series have shown.There are three sections in the book: Hauntings, UFOs and The Unexplained. There is a very touching story in The Unexplained section, A Mother's Love. It tells the story of a mother who even in death could not forget her children and want to see how they have fared in life. So she carried the memories of her beloved children with her into the next life. When she had enough money to travel to the location where she had lived in her previous life, she packed up to look for her &quot;old&quot; children. Not all stories are touching like this one. Some are pretty eerie, so you have got to have the nerves to read this alone. =)There are even photographs in the book where you can see some of the unexplained phenomena. Overall, the book is pretty easy to understand and enjoyable to read. A MUST-READ for lovers of the Unknown."},{"Title":"Sightings","review":"&quot;Sightings&quot; is a very good book companion to the television series. Like the show, this book presents convincing evidence for UFOs, ghosts among other things. I didn't really come out a believer, but the book is very enjoyable. The areas that study ghostly hauntings are chilling at times and the sections on UFOs will have you raising new questions to what lies out there, or what is it that the government is doing, or hiding regarding these matters. There are interesting photographs and the writing is fast-paced and seeks more to inform the reader rather than make a sensation of the subjects. That's one thing I admired about the TV show, and this book, it doesn't make some big spectacle about the unexplained, but simply reports the facts and presents the evidence and testimony. That makes it more effective (and sometimes scarier) still. This book documents these events, for sensation watch &quot;Independence Day&quot; or read some science fiction novel. A really good book. Wether you're a believer, a non-believer, or just a person who likes to read on many different subjects, &quot;Sightings&quot; deserves a peak."},{"Title":"Sightings","review":"The haunting section of this book truly creeped me out. Particularly the section about \\"Voices of the Dead\\". For some reason it brought to memory snippets from the ultra-spooky \\"Session 9\\" film (based on a true story as well). \\"The Ghosts of Gettysburg\\" made me sad rather than scared. To think of all of those young men lost forever really struck a nerve. \\"The Blue Lady\\" was a fascinating tale of co-existing between human and ghost/spirit that I found pretty nifty. Most of the tellings had to do with terrified humans being haunted by malevolent spirits that sometimes physically hurt them so the \\"blue lady\\" was a nice change of pace here. I saw the movie based on the story of \\"The Entity\\" so I knew what it was about going in and didn't learn anything all that new here though it did scare the life out of me when I was a young girl. I was hoping the \\"Sightings\\" crew would've dug up some fascinating proof or adding something new to the story but all in all this one seemed the least effective of the bunch. \\"Ghost Writer\\" was flat out creepy as I've seen (often) a figure out of the corner of my eye both at home and when alone at work. I chalk it up to an over-active imagination and a wee bit of paranoia but now I have to wonder . . . I wish I had caught this show when it was on the air. My only complaint are the pictures documenting the proof of each story are stuck smack in the center of the book so I have to keep flipping back and forth when a picture is referenced. It's a bit of pain but then again maybe I'm just lazy.I could take or leave the UFO abduction stories as they all seem to be more of the same type of story I've read time and again (people see odd lights, black out, are missing huge chunks of time,etc.) None have turned me into a believer just yet . . .Many of \\"The Unexplained\\" stories were emotionally moving. Especially \\"A Child's Premonition\\" and particularly \\"School Room Angels\\" which was a new case to me. It's sad and tragic that the children in Beslam didn't have the same experience.I recommend to this to anyone with an open mind and curiousity about the unknown."},{"Title":"Sightings","review":"Susan Michaels was the one and only writer for the television series Sightings, and this book recounts some of the more interesting topics covered by the groundbreaking show. Whether you believe any or all of the accounts presented here is not crucial to your enjoyment of the book because Michaels is a talented writer who knows how to tell stories in a fascinating yet concise manner. I myself am pretty open to all kinds of paranormal possibilities, and there are a couple of stories here that don't seem to merit inclusion in my opinion; nevertheless, they are interesting and who can say where the truth lies in each case? The book itself is broken up into three main sections: Hauntings, UFOs, and the catch-all Unexplained. While the book cannot even begin to give a detailed treatment of the subjects addressed, it does present a wonderful cross section of unexplained happenings, many of them quite familiar to those of us interested in such topics-e.g., the death of Thomas Mantell, the mass UFO sightings in Mexico City during the 1990s, the haunted castle of Berry-Pomeroy, and the Iranian UFO incident of 1976. There are stories on cattle mutilation, past life memories, psychic detectives, spontaneous human combustion, alien abduction, crop circles, and a number of additional fascinating topics. Most esoteric among the chapters is the story of the reputed curse that stunted a young Orson Welles' future career in the field he had already mastered. The ghost section is particularly impressive, highlighting some incredible investigations that I remember quite vividly from the Sightings television series. New evidence discovered by the Sightings teams is mixed with long-debated incidents and events that have achieved classic status among students of the unexplained.You don't have to believe all of the stories you read here; in fact, you should not believe them uncritically. Susan Michaels gives you the objective facts of the cases in question; in the tradition of the Sightings television show, she leaves the answers open and subject to thought and interpretation on the part of the audience. Few books explore such a rich cross-section of unexplained phenomena as effectively as this book does, and I recommend it highly to all those open-minded enough to accept the possibility that the impossible sometimes happens."},{"Title":"Sightings","review":"Although I read this one quite some time ago, I remember it being an interesting mixed bag of the paranormal. Good pictures and interesting content."},{"Title":"Sightings","review":"I was a huge fan of the \\"Sightings\\" TV show and I had to buy this book. I won't go into too much detail since that's already been done by others, but here is my opinion:The book is well-written and interesting to read, even if you don't believe in the paranormal. (I believe in most, but not all paranormal happenings.) I like the way the book represents the show by dividing into three sections and covering a wide range of paranormal topics (much like the show). It covers many of the segments that were presented on the show during its five season run. (My favorites are UFOs, cryptozoology, and ghosts.)The book would have been better with color photos, but the black and white photos are still interesting to look at. Also, updates on the stories would have been welcome, but they're not here. The foreword by the show's host Tim White is interesting to read since it is one of the only places that you can see his opinion on all of these things. (On the show, he only reported the facts, he didn't give his opinions.) Like the show, the book presents the facts to you and lets you decided for yourself what you believe. This way, no one is offended.I've read other paranormal books, but this one is one of the best! \\"Sightings\\" fans and paranormal fans should buy it and the companion book \\"Sightings: UFOs\\"."},{"Title":"Sightings","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this book. While I'm not all that convinced about the \\"paranormal\\" I found the stories to be quite interesting, and some certainly made me think that there may just be some plausibility to things like UFOs and ghosts.

Not this one, though."},{"Title":"The Message of Philippians (Bible Speaks Today)","review":"I am very familiar with this Philippians commentary from The Bible Speaks Today Series (IVP). I loved the commentary and found his writing and perspective and understanding deep and penetrating but accessible.Motyer's area of focus is the links between OT and NT. He gives the reader a deep and insighful and personally meaningful discussion of the text, pointing out the meaning of the words in the original languages when it is helpful to our growth.

This is a great series that teaches kids about sportsmanship in an interesting as well as humorous way. However, this book, \\"Arthur and the Best Coach Ever,\\" shows are startling lack of coordination between those working on the television show and those were developing the book series.Both the television story and the book share a couple basic plot points. The soccer coach for Lakewood Elementary is no longer able to coach the team and Ed Crosswire is brought in as a replacement. In both versions, none of the kids are very happy, as they liked the old coach and Ed's coaching abilities are rather questionable.The similarities stop about right there. In the book, Ed is presented as an inept coach who knows nothing about soccer and is always ignoring the team while he tries to run his automotive business from the sidelines. The team members begin to feel like they don't care about them, although really he's just caught in a pickle because he has no understanding of basic soccer concepts, or how to coach a team.The exact opposite happens in the television episode. In the TV version, Ed seems to be quite knowledgable of soccer, even having played in the past, and tries to run the team like a machine, putting them through overly demanding drills.Overall, \\"Arthur and the Best Coach Ever\\" is an okay story and in my opinion, somewhat better than the television version. Still, the lack of synergy between the TV show and the book causes confusion among followers of the seires and I'm not entirely certain what exactly this particular book teaches kids about good sportsmanship. Also, some of the humor found in the other \\"Arthur\\" books is missing. Pass on this one, and try one of the other, better, \\"Arthur\\" books instead."},{"Title":"Arthur and the Best Coach Ever (Arthur Good Sports #4)","review":"My book called Arther and the Best Coach Ever.

Once I finally found it I was ecstatic. I am an avid fan and one that really appreciates sports lingo. This book had me laughing and smiling from cover to cover.
