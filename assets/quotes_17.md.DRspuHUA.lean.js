The ending was completely unbelieveable - she was the cause of his losing everything else he might have held dear in his life, but it didn't matter because he loved her? I thought her responses were incredibly immature and self-centered, and I felt sorry for James for being so caught up in her. This is one of the few books I've read lately where I just intensely disliked one of the main characters, and the ending didn't resolve anything for me because I didn't believe it."},{"Title":"Sweet treason","review":"Lady Katherine MacGregor's sedate life is destroyed when deserters from the English army cross into Scotland and kill her family. Vowing revenge, she becomes a spy for the Jacobite cause. She poses as a prostitute and steals a satchel containing secret documents from an English officer. She is caught, but claims she thought she was simply stealing the officer's money. James Burke, an English officer and viscount, is given the responsibility of escorting this &quot;Scottish prostitute&quot; to Lancaster for her trial on charges of treason. The first half of the book is a wonderfully funny road romance, as Katie and Burke match wits and exchange barbs during their journey. He suspects she truly is a spy and is determined to discover the truth. Still, he finds himself unsettled by his growing attraction to a woman he disdains as a prostitute. She slowly is forced to admit her attraction to one of the hated English. Eventually, recognizing her feelings for him, she saves his life, which sets in motion a chain of events that lands him in hot water. I love this book for several reasons, but mostly because of the fabulous characters. These are two of the most real people I've ever read in a romance. Gaffney modulates these characters perfectly. Although flawed, the characters always remain likable. In some romances, readers are &quot;told&quot; by the writer that a character is supposed to be arrogant, or intelligent, or some other such adjective, but the actions of the character don't really bear that out. In this novel, the personalities of the main characters directly influence their actions and the course the book takes. Sweet Treason also contains wonderful bantering dialogue that makes me laugh out loud at times, and yet I wouldn't call this book a comedy. It takes a turn to the dramatic about halfway through, and the drama is just as involving as the comedy is funny. The love scenes are fresh--I didn't read them thinking I'd read scenes like them a dozen times before. Even the secondary characters are well-developed and original. I also found the heroine's &quot;pathological lying&quot; to be quite logical for the story--after all, her life depends on her ability to clear herself of treason charges."},{"Title":"Sweet treason","review":"I am a huge Patricia Gaffney fan and I must concur with other reviewers here who give this book a tepid review. This book starts out just swell - energetic and fun and sassy...and this it all just...goes away.Disappointing and not up to her usual good work."},{"Title":"Sweet treason","review":"I cannot imagine how anyone could fall in love with the heroine, who is a brain short of a lobotomy and a pathological liar. The hero must be a masochist, for he keeps on coming back for more betrayals, the last of which leaves him without family, friends, home, fortune and very nearly, life. I found their romance preposterous and pathetic. Too bad because a lot more could have been done with the premise. Gaffney's Wickerly series (To Love and to Cherish, etc.) is much better."},{"Title":"Sweet treason","review":"This book started out great, the first half does a good job of setting up the story. The interaction between the two main characters is funny and romantic, and then it takes a turn for the terrible. At every opportunity for the characters to grow and develop along with a premise that could have been very interesting, the author plunges the characters into more hateful acts. Instead of exploring a developing relationship between two people at cross purposes, this becomes a story of a sick psychotic love obsession.In a romance novel the lovers have to be someone worth winning, not someone that you are sorry they got stuck with. In true Jane Eyre style, by the end of the book you can't stand the selfish, stuck-up, &quot;heroine&quot; who knows whats right but can't do it, and you feel so disgustingly sorry for and disappointed in the ruined &quot;hero&quot; that you put the book down feeling sick. Worse, you feel as though you wasted your time."},{"Title":"Sweet treason","review":"this book wasn't horrible - the first part was actually pretty entertaining, but it got a bit tedious after a while.

The book seemed to start falling apart for me after the first sex scene, which was VERY hot, as the main character Kate, has an unforgettable seduction scene with James in which she must convince him she is a whore, rather than being faced with the possibility of hanging for treason. We already see that James suspects Kate/Katherine's (sexual) innocence, but after taking her, it seemed strange that a man of his supposed experience had no indication that he'd just taken a virgin. I kept waiting for it - even for a sign on the sheets, but any physical evidence is ignored by the writer and there obviously would be the physical barrier, pain for her - something. Then, it degenerates from there with James lapsing into alternating boorish, callous behavior, and being nauseatingly gushing and obsessive in his thoughts and emotions over Kate - even after he believes her to be a true whore, and responsible for a betrayal that leads to his near-hanging and ruin of his good name, estrangement from his loved ones, inheritance and family estates, etc. The end does not satisfy! The loose ends are never sewn up, and from this reader's' perspective, he never has the epiphany moment desired, i.e. that Kate is not a whore, what she did and did not actually do to betray him, and why she did it, etc. He just is obsessively \\"in love\\", and unrealistically satisfied with having her, even though his life has been ruined, and his eyes, she's still he traitorous little whore. Such a shame! This book had two very well-drawn, sympathetic characters in the beginning, and strong plot potential. The sex scenes are very good, but if you're looking for story, this one is readable, but still a let-down."},{"Title":"Sweet treason","review":"I enjoyed this story, as I do just about all of Patricia Gaffney's books.

The photographs are superb but the strongest point of the book is that it does not hide the many weaknesses of the F-117A (the chapter about laser lock on the targets and its problems was astonishing!) and it also contains a chapter about other versions of the F-117 and newer stealth types like F-22 and B-2.

He was there in the beginning when the only skydiving was in isolated pockets on the East and West Coasts. He opened a parachute center in Michigan. He went on to take more risks-as a publicist. He worked with a lot of big names including his close friend Jerry Lewis.This book is fun to read but there is a reason: Jac won an Emmy for his writing.

In his book, tantamount to a self-aggrandizing piece of -- uh -- 'work' with a misleading title, he certainly strikes me as the ultra-liberal starry eyed false idol worshiping type - with little to no conscience and definitely morally bankrupt -- who would do anything for approval, attention, kibbles, and bits from his master(s) and his ilk.

But what most don't know is that, 11 or 12 years before his last stand at the Little Big Horn, Custer's name was almost synonymous with victory. What made his defeat at the Little Big Horn so shocking was his brilliant record in the Civil War. The Indians did what the Rebels were never able to do. Those who are not specialists in the American Civil War have also been taught that Confederate cavalry was far superior to Union cavalry. While this was usually true in the early years of the war (1861-2), exactly the opposite was true by 1864. And one of the best, if not THE best of the Union cavalry commanders was George Armstrong Custer. Phil Sheridan, no slouch himself, once called Custer &quot;the best man in the Cavalry Corps.&quot; One of the youngest generals in the Union army (he graduated from West Point just in time to take part in the first battle of Bull Run as a 2nd lieutenant), Custer took command of a cavalry brigade just in time for the battle of Gettysburg and played an important part in that battle (often ignored). In the fall of 1864 he was promoted to division command and played a crucial role in the Appomattox campaign. Urwin (who is a friend of mine, though we've never met--we've corresponded) presents Custer's little-known Civil War career in very readable prose, and I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Custer, the Civil War, or military history in general"},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"Popular opinion of George Armstrong Custer has changed dramatically through the years. During the Civil War and for decades afterword, he was regarded as a true American Hero. Then sentiment switched, based almost entirely on his death in what has become a politically incorrect battle.Custer's value in preserving the Union during the Civil War was so profound, General Phil Sheridan presented the table upon which the surrender was signed to Custer's wife and said &quot;...there is scarcely an individual in our service who has contributed more to bring about this desirable result than your gallant husband.&quot;This book relates many accounts of how Custer, arriving upon a battle, could instantly size up the situation and seize the initiative. He inspired his men in battle and when he ordered them to charge he would lead them personally, miraculously escaping the hundreds of bullets fired at him by an enemy who could easily recognize him by his long blonde hair and flamboyant dress. One of his cavalry troopers said, &quot;Under him a man is ashamed to be cowardly. Under HIM our men can achieve wonders.&quot;Following is a quote from the book, about Custer in the battle of Five Forks: &quot; 'We are going to take those works and we are not coming back until we get them!' The Red Ties lunged ahead...Old Curly and his staff in front as always...General Custer's Bugler, Color Bearer, and Orderly...All went down...Miraculously, Custer was untouched by that scything fusillade. Swinging down from his saddle like a stunt rider, he grabbed his fallen guidon without dismounting, swirled it over his head, jammed his spurs into his horse, streaked right up to the enemy, and leaped his charger over the earthworks.&quot;Custer's actions in the Civil War are now allowed to speak for themselves in Urwin's outstanding book. If you are interested in the Civil War and admire personal courage, you will enjoy &quot;Custer Victorious.&quot;"},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"This book tells the fascinating story of George Armstrong Custer's Civil War career. The self-confidence of this man, followed by his real accomplishment, is amazing. Prior to reading this book, I was aware of only Custer's battle with Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg. Now I find that Custer met Stuart on numerous occasions and, in fact, it was his brigade that was responsible for Stuart's death at Yellow Tavern. For the life of me, I can't figure out why this epic rivalry between these two great cavalry leaders is not better known.The bad news is that the writing is merely adequate. The prose is a tad purple and the last chapter, in which the author summarizes his theory that Custer was truly a great military leader, is superfluous in that the author has done a much more convincing job in merely telling the tale. Finally, I might quibble about the title. I almost didn't buy this book because I thought it was an alternative history of Little Big Horn.We live in an age with a scarcity of heroes. This book presents us a hero in the classic mold. We could do worse than to emulate this man. It is perhaps telling of our times, however, that rather than to acknowledge Custer's heroism, we defame his memory."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"A good read. We see a man who seized the moment and became one of the youngest most decorated and honored generals in our country's history. His critics called him &quot;the boy general&quot;. Perhaps the most impressive attribute about him was &quot;that when a hero was needed, he saddled up and charged&quot; when no one else would. Like him or not, he liked a good fight and would race the devil himself to get to it first. He stood up and was counted. He pushed himself and the men who rode with him throughout the Virginia country side. In Urwin's accounting, you can almost all but hear the sabers rattle, the canons roar, and the clash of men desperately fighting as Custer led his Michigan Wolverines to glory within the most trying time in American history. For too long this part of the Custer past has been hidden to the casual reader of American history. He was then and is today a real American hero. Though often misunderstood. He lived, he breathed, he loved, and in the end he found that he bled real blood. There is much to know about this man and the foot print he and the 7th Cav left on the dusty pages of American history. Perhaps it is as Evan S. Connal, &quot;Son of Morning Star&quot;said, &quot;If our heroes prove to be immortal then so, perhaps, are we. The man knew no fear, that is what made him so dangerous to his enemies, on both sides. He expected to win every time--he always had, and in his mind at least, he always would."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"Being from Michigan, I knew George Custer was a Civil War hero. After reading this book I realized just how important that man was to the Union cause. Although young, Custer was mature beyond his years, his prowess as a calvaryman is second to none. He was loved by his troops and respected by his enemies, some who he bested many times during the Civil War. He was a true leader in every sense of the word. Fearless and steady, always leading his troops into a charge. Ever concerned for the well being of his men. This book is a wonderful piece on a great man who was lost in history by speculation and heresay. Had he his Michigan Calvary Brigade, his beloved &quot;Wolverines&quot; or men like them at Little Big Horn and not 17 and 18 yr old troops as recently discovered, even though being outgunned I am sure there would have been different results for historians to ponder. Rest in Peace Major General Custer, your name is forever cleared."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"Most people think only of Custers last stand at the Little Big Horn. Not many realize that Custer was a brilliant CW general. Dr Urwin corrects this historical oversite wonderfully."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"This is a fine work of scholarship on General Custer. It is incorrect to assume with this book that Urwin has a tendency to Custerphilia. If that be so, then may we accuse other historians of Robert E. Leephilia, or Martin Luther Kingphilia, or John F. Kennedyphilia? It is only the truly biased that will attach such a title to an author who is presenting Custer in a just light, rather than anyone else. We don't have to be a contemporary of an historical figure to know the facts and contributions of his life, and Urwin's excellently researched book brings out all the facts surrounding Custer's outstanding leadership as a Civil War soldier and officer, and most importantly, Urwin has finally given Custer his just due as a great American patriot who was so instrumental in preserving what we so easily refer to today as our USA. It was General Phil Sheridan, who stated in an enclosed note to Mrs. Custer when presenting her with Lee's table upon which the surrender was signed, &quot;that there is scarcely an individual in our service who has contributed more to bring about this desirable result than your gallant husband.&quot; Urwin brings out all the facts that substantiate this statement; not denigrate or fictionalize it. If you know nothing about Custer, read this book and its preface first, then for an account of The Little Bighorn, read &quot;To Hell With Honor&quot; by Larry Sklenar. As Urwin states, &quot;Custer's critics have been legion, but only the most vehement and biased has ever dared to suggest that his performance in that bloodiest of America's wars was anything less than brilliant.&quot;"},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"George Armstrong Custer is known to most people today as the general who led his soldiers to slaughter at the hands of the Indians at the Little Bighorn in Montana. But it was the glory and fame earned as a dashing and courageous Civil War cavalry officer that made that defeat so shocking and controversial. Gregory J.W. Urwin focuses on those Civil War years in this study.Custer graduated last in his class from West Point in 1861 (he may have been expelled if the army wasn't in desperate need of officers at the time). Assigned to a cavalry regiment, he first saw action at First Bull Run. There and later with McClellan on the Peninsular and then with General Alfred Pleasanton, Custer gained a reputation for bravery and bravado. He especially distinguished himself at Gettysburg and in the Shenandoah Valley with Sheridan in 1864. But perhaps his greatest achievement was the constant pressure he and his troops put on Lee as he retreated toward Appomattox Court House; Lee said it was a major factor in his decision to surrender.Custer was dashing and fearless in battle - and was not shy about having the spotlight on him. This, of course, breeds jealous enemies as well as cheering supporters (and is one reason why the Little Bighorn debacle was, and remains, so controversial). Urwin goes out of his way to make sure his book has no odor of the academic about it (despite the numerous footnotes and extensive bibliography): he writes in a familiar and totally informal style and describes much of the action in a novelistic way. This makes much of the book a page-turner - a fresh thing for historical writing. A most enjoyable read, and probably the definitive account of Custer in the Civil War - before his experiences on the Plains changed him and ultimately led to his downfall."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"The author does a good job of describing the many engagements in which Custer was involved, and generally supporting his position that he was an excellent leader of calvary. Since Custer was a very capable general, the reader will be able to learn a great deal about these engagements and the leadership qualities needed to handle small detachments of cavalry in the Civil War era, and will come away with a new appreciation for his abilities and his contributions to the Union victory. (I say \\"small\\", because Custer's command was only about 1,200 men for most of the war-- small enough so his personal style of leadership could be most effective.)Unfortunately, as noted by some other reviewers, the author lets his enthusiasim get away with him, to the detriment of the book and the case he is trying to make. To put it simply, he simply isn't objective enough. For example, he all but states that Custer's cavalry played a decisive role at Gettysburg (which it clearly didn't). On some occasions he uses then-contemporary reports of casualties inflicted, prisoners and guns taken, etc., to proclaim the extent of Custer's victories, when other, more objective documentary evidence proves that his victories, while still impressive, were not quite that overwhelming. Plus, the constant references to \\"Old Curly\\", the \\"Red Ties\\" and the like give the reader the impression that he is reading a children's book, not a work of scholarship.If you are interested in the Civil War or in the qualities needed to lead small, mobile forces, this is a worthwhile book-- just be ready to plow through the cheerleading."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"This is a good read and will open up a new opinion of Custer for most people. It was only in the 20th century that the name of George Armstrong Custer became associated with the ultimate bad decision and failure. In the last half of the 19th century, he was still remembered for his daring and SUCCESSFUL civil war exploits. It is nice to see his Civil War record documented in one spot so that future generations can see that there was more to this warrior than the Battle of the Little Big Horn. He employed the same tactics but with much more confidence and obviously greater success."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"This is a Great General Custer Book because you get the insight and the true feeling of how to be a courageous leader.

This is about the man America forgot. This is the same man who is buried at his beloved West Point next to his adoring and devoted wife, Elizabeth. Greg Urwin has concentrated his scholarly edition on the years leading up to and during the four years of the Civil War. He had done at that time what had not been done in 125 years of military history. He brought Custer out of the myth and into the light as a real American hero. He shows where those of the day when Custer fought and lived, thought him brave, courageous and loved by the men of the Michigan Brigade and Third Cavalry Division of the Army of the Potomac.We learn why the man who died at Little Big Horn in southeastern Montana in 1876 was called General and truly why that same battlefield was named for him. Urwin shows us that the man known as Autie by his family and friends deserved to have the place where he died with his boots on named for him, not because of the limited battles with native peoples of the plains but because of his career and exploits of the Civil War.Huzzah to Professor Urwin for his work to lead others to rediscover the Man America Forgot."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"The Civil War has been much romanticized. The life of George Armstrong Custer has entered the realm of near mythology. The most successful period in Custer's short life was his civil war career. Urwin here presents a record of the successes of Custer's civil war career. There is a tendency in this book to Custerophilia. While none of us in this time period can really know the man, study of the masses of literature from the period suggest that the &quot;boy General&quot; was somewhat unique. More than most of his contemporaries, Custer was able to motivate his Civil War commands to significant achievments. His personal audacity caused extremely high casualties among the men he commanded. Despite this he never seems to have engendered the kind of disdain that Judson &quot;Killcavalry&quot; Kilpatrick, a contemporary, gained from his troops. It seems that members of his Michigan cavalry Brigades greatly esteemed their general despite their losses. Whether he was in fact a tactician or just daring and lucky; his civil war record is quite remarkable. This book is a worthwhile read for students of the civil war and of cavalry and Custer's part of that history."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"The premise for this book is solid: Too often, George Armstrong Custer is judged on the basis of his effort at the Little Bighorn. Too many people ignore the estimable record he developed during the Civil War.The book traces his role in the Civil War, from a young staff officer to one of the younger generals in the Union Army. He first took command of a combat unit a short time before the sanguinary struggle at Gettysburg.This book traces his exploits in battle from Gettysburg to the very end of the war at Appomattox Court House. His record was solid. At Gettysburg, he helped blunt J. E. B. Stuart's effort to attack the rear of the Union line as Pickett's and Pettigrew's troops attacked Cemetery Ridge. The book depicts other of his battles, from the Wilderness, Yellow Tavern, Trevillion Station to his fine work in the Shenandoah Valley to the closing out of the conflict between the Army of Northern Virginia versus the Army of the Potomac.The major quibble I have with this book is its almost hero worship tone of Custer. He had a fine record in the Civil War and he merits much praise, but I sometimes have a sense that the author is attacking a straw man. Many students of the Civil War have been positive about Custer's performance."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"this book is valuable as a reference to Custer's Civil War service. At least you will learn in which battles he participated. Whether or not he was the brave hero portrayed is questionable simply because this author is so in love with Custer that everything else is disregarded.Urwin was only 24 years old when he wrote this book, and it shows. It's almost adolescent in its praise of Custer. He denigrates everyone who criticized Custer during his 7th Cav days. The enlisted men were \\"trash\\", the officers \\"petty and jealous\\". This is a book written by a young man with a lot to learn."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"An excellent book and it shows what a great military commander Custer was. There can be no doubt about his military prowless. This book shows he just wasnt some glory hound that didnt have any idea what he was doing and just relied on dumb luck.His ability size up the situation and put a plan in motion was excellent. His courage cant be questioned by any one. He either led the attack or in the back with the rear guard where ever the action was the heaviest. His men adored him, other soldiers wanted to transer to his regiment and the enemy repected and feared him so much they put a bounty on him.In regard to one reviewer he did play a big part in Gettysburg He stopped Stuart from getting behind the unions line when he was badly out numbered by Stuarts men. If Stuart would have reached his objective Picketts charge could have been different a lot different. I also like to 2nd the plug the one reviewer gave for if people wanted to read about the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Read the book To Hell With Honor by Larry Skelnar. I have read and researched the battle a lot and this is probably the best book out there."},{"Title":"Custer Victorious the Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer","review":"George Armstrong Custer is one of America's most famous soldiers, but his fame today is derived almost totally from the defeat that cost him his life. Today, Custer is the poster boy for hopeless causes- the perennial loser. However, one of the big reasons why the defeat at Little Big Horn was such a shock to Americans in 1876 was because before that battle Custer's name had been synonymous with victory. The thesis of Gregory Urwin's book, \\"Custer Victorious,\\" is to illustrate by using Custer's Civil War career that he was far from the incompetent, glory hunter of current popular opinion. Instead Urwin sets out to show that GA Custer was one of the best brigade and division commanders in the Union Army.Urwin's task is not too difficult. GA Custer's Civil War career was pretty spectacular. Promoted from a staff position to the command of a cavarly brigade on the eve of the battle of Gettysburg, Custer would prove to be an outstanding combat commander in virtually every engagement his unit fought in. Eventually, his profiency as a brigade commander would earn him the command of the 3rd Cavarly Division and a promotion to brevet major general at the age of 25.Custer's critics like to point out that Custer's units suffered high casualties and that his successes were more a result of dumb luck than any tactical ability, Urwin ably destroys these misconceptions. It is true that Custer's men suffered heavy casualties, but that was unfortunately the cost of victory on Civil War battlefields. Also Custer never got the reputation for being careless with the lives of his men. His willingness to share in any danger that his men faced and the victories and prestige his units garnered under his command created admiration rather than resentment among his men. To prove this Urwin provides quotes from admiring subordinates and constantly refers to the 3rd Division as the \\"Red Tie boys\\" to remind the reader that many men in that unit wore red ties around their necks in tribute to the one worn by their long-haired commander. Urwin also utterly destroys the idea that Custer was a tactical buffoon who lucked into victories with flashy cavalry charges. Urwin shows that Custer used a mixture of dismounted and mounted tactics to overcome his opponents. He also shows that Custer had a good eye for terrain and keen sense when to launch a charge, which he used to great advantage during the later campaigns of the Civil War.Urwin does make a very convincing case that GA Custer was an outstanding combat commander. His use of primary sources to build his case is very thorough. However, Urwin undoes alot of his work by constant cheerleading. Urwin's Custer is too perfect. Custer did make mistakes, but Urwin either dismisses them or just glances over them. The entire book is written in this annoying \\"rah-rah\\" cheerleader style. Urwin's adoration of Custer is just too much and brings down the entire academic tone of the book. In his forward, Urwin makes a statement about how as a liberal democrat he does not worship military types, but then the rest of the text makes that statement absurb because it borders on almost idol worship.\\"Custer Victorious'\\" research is impressive and because of that it almost overcomes its almost hagiographic tone to build a pretty solid case that Custer was an exceptional combat leader. However, its constant cheerleading will make some very skeptical of its assertions."},{"Title":"Paradox Alley","review":"After finally finding and reading (twice over) this last book of John DeChancie's Starrigger trillogy, all I can say is I was sorry that the story had to end...this author has put together a set of books with a story so interwoven and captivating that you will find you won't want to put down untill you are finished. My gratitude to John DeChancie for a great adventure!"},{"Title":"Paradox Alley","review":"This book completes a mind-stretching trilogy that never fails to entertain. From the first book of the series, &quot;Starrigger&quot; through &quot;Red Limit Freeway&quot; to &quot;Paradox Alley&quot;, the reader is treated to concepts so amazing and soul stirring that it harkens back to the Glory Days of hard science fiction. More importantly, Mr. DeChancie's sense of humor and irony shines through in all three books. His characters are believable and as &quot;real&quot; as any ever created by Heinlein himself. You care about what happens to them. These are amazing pieces of fiction and if anyone in Hollywood hasn't opted them for the big screen, they should."},{"Title":"Paradox Alley","review":"This is the second book in one of the best series ever, with a great &quot;hard science&quot; foundation, and a great story. I couldn't put them down until I had read the entire series through, and sorely regret that I cannot find a copy of this book anywhere."},{"Title":"Paradox Alley","review":"\\"Paradox Alley\\" is the final book in a trilogy, falling after \\"Starrigger\\" and \\"Red Limit Freeway.\\" Unlike the other two in the series, it cannot be read as a standalone novel without a great deal of confusion. That said, the premise is this: the stars, galaxies, and possibly even the universes, are all linked by nearly indestructible highways with exits that jump the traveler to the next world over. Any vehicle can drive on these roads (though, it might be recommended that the vehicle be air tight and radiation reflective), so fortunes have been built and lost on the market of transporting goods and people across the universe. However, two questions plague all users of the interstellar roads. 1. Who built the roads? 2. Why didn't they leave a darned MAP?Quite against his will, our truck-driving protagonist has been chased across the road system because someone started the rumor that he had the map. He picked up all sorts of people along the way. He also picked up a paradox, of the temporal kind. By the beginning of \\"Paradox Alley,\\" he and his passengers have finished their outbound journey and discovered who built the roads. It turns out the builder(s) did leave a map, and the protagonist did have it, but it wasn't the map he thought he had. The protagonist has to now figure out how to get himself and his passengers back home before the whole mess started.This book is faster-paced than the others in the series, starting off by dumping the reader straight into the middle of the action. The story also takes the reader through convolutions that either require slow reading or re-reading for comprehension, but that ultimately neatly solve all of the loose ends in the story but two. DeChancie's voice, vocabulary, and easy invocations of technical and scientific concepts with which his audience are probably familiar remain consistent, making \\"Paradox Alley\\" a meaty read without turning it into a hefty tome. The meat does not prevent this book from being a pleasant beach book, either. Like the other two in the series, \\"Paradox Alley\\" is enjoyable within a day or less on the amusing characters alone.Five Stars: \\"Paradox Alley\\" ends the series with the satisfying crunch of a virtual pair dividing, and eases the reader into the mellow aftertaste of noticing all the clues in the trilogy as to what the protagonist does after the books, and realizing how he does it."},{"Title":"DECEMBER 7, 1941: The Day the Admirals Slept in","review":"This book is another look at what events transpired before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and how individual clues that might have indicated a possible attack were missed or ignored.This book concentrates a lot on the issues with the Navy Department's Second Deck which caused problems when all of the information that should have been distributed to several commands was concentrated in one person's hands with only his own impressions deciding who would see what. There were power struggles going on within the Navy as well as between the Navy and the Army over who was responsible for what.This is a good short book on Pearl Harbor and is a good read for those interested in the period as I am. It adds a few new items to the discussion, but no major revelations."},{"Title":"30-Minute Meals from the Academy (California Culinary Academy)","review":"I have used this book, and others in the series, for years now.

You who live with her know how rarely I see her, how much her presence delights me, and I'm touched that you should ask me to come see her. All the same, I'm not going to accept your kind invitation, for the time being at any rate. The reason is that my pink cactus is probably going to flower. It's a very rare plant I've been given, and I'm told that in our climate it flowers only once every four years, Now, I am already a very old woman, and if I went away when my pink cactus is about to flower, I am certain I shouldn't see it flower again.So I beg you, Sir, to accept my sincere thanks and my regrets, together with my kind regards.-- Sidonie ColetteThis charming letter from \\"Sido\\" --- mother of the most celebrated female writer in France --- to Colette's second husband begins \\"Break of Day\\". But forget about the husband. Within sentences, Colette pierces your heart with the ultimate news of her mother: \\"A year later she died, at the age of seventy-seven.\\"\\"Break of Day\\" is many things, but above all, it's a love letter from Colette to Sido. And that was a stunning departure for Colette in 1928, for she was just coming off the huge success of her Claudine series and her two Cheri novels. In the first, we follow the sensual awakening of a young girl. In the second, a younger man has a long affair with an older courtesan. Not terribly shocking stuff --- child prostitution wasn't outlawed in France until 1909 --- but not discussed in public, and thus very racy reading.Colette was a powerhouse. She published fifty books. She was a marketing wizard, with chocolate and cosmetics bearing her name. And, in 1954, she was the first woman in France's history to be given a state funeral.So by l928, Colette --- like our latter-day Madonna --- needed no last name. She was a brand, and her product was sex.But here she asks a remarkable question: Who obsesses a woman most --- her mother or her man? We're trained by habit and media to think only of the man, the night, the perfume, the champagne. And then there's reality. As women hit their 50s and \\"the change\\" frees them from an insistent awareness of reproduction.... but this is beyond me. So I turn to Colette.Problem: memoir or novel? The catalogue says fiction, but \\"Break of Day\\" doesn't even seem like writing. Page after page, you feel you're reading the diary of a season in Colette's life.Here she is, awake early, writing in a notebook \\"until the smell of the sea warns me that that the hour when air is colder than water is at hand.\\"Here she is, fending off worshipful guests.Here she is, in the closest thing to an ongoing story, dealing with a young man who has no chance of becoming her lover --- trying to pair him with a young woman who's smitten with him.Here she is, on every page, delivering a bon mot: \\"I no longer ask for anything except what I can't have\\" and \\"My true friends have always given me that supreme proof of devotion, a spontaneous aversion for the man I loved\\" and \\"I instinctively like to acquire and store up what promises to outlast me.\\"And here, most of all, is a tribute to a great mother.But beware. Colette is a master, and this is a masterpiece; her writing darts toward truth but won't stay there. In Secrets of the Flesh, her biography of Colette, Judith Thurman tells the story of Colette's first wedding night. In the morning, when she came downstairs, there was Sido, still in her party dress. She had spent the night awake, brooding and inconsolably sad --- and now Colette was devastated by her mother's sadness.A touching scene. But hardly one that suggests a healthy separation. Or anything like the relationship Colette describes in these 168 pages.So this is fiction. But not like any fiction you have ever read. It's so easy on the eye, so seductive, so physical that you feel the book more than you read it. It's what a man thinks of as woman's writing, in the sense that it's written from intuition and marrow. Men fear irony, Colette writes. And she's hardly the first to note that young admirers --- and admirers not so young --- have urgent needs. She, in contrast, is beyond all that. In her house in the South of France, she has her garden and the sea and the sky for comfort. She's done --- at least for now --- with carnal love. Her heart beats for a greater lover: \\"Here is the dawn. Today it is all little clouds like a shower of petals, a dawn for those with hearts at rest.\\"I know a number of women of a certain age who tell me they are glad to be done with the fire and disappointment of romance. \\"Break of Day\\" is for them. As it is for the bewildered men in their lives. As it may be for young readers who'd like to know what lies ahead.It's easy to be dazzled by Colette the superstar. Or entranced by her life. Or lured into her racy novels, though they're so much less sexy now. You'll do better just to read her at her best. Start with \\"Break of Day\\" --- and watch her create, one perception at a time, the most admirable and liberated woman you may ever meet in print."},{"Title":"Break of day,: A novel","review":"I really wish that this book was availible here. I found it in a used book store last year. I read about it in a women's rights manual during high school. Reading the article I searched frantically for Break of Day, as I hope others have done or will. Break of Day works delicately on all your senses. Awakens your nose to the smells of Colette's own gardening. She has you listen to her interesting and sometimes not so captivating friends. Your eyes and hands caress a world of animals, friends, ex-husbands, and nature. Break of Day has you kneeling in the dirt and breathing the air of the coast. This book is about being alive and knowing beauty."},{"Title":"Break of day,: A novel","review":"As in all of Collete's works it takes you away to another more gentle place. Curl up and enjoy her. She looks at life through a fine tooth comb. She is one of my favorite writers. Read all of her works and a collection of her essays \\" Earthly Paradise\\" you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Break of day,: A novel","review":"Colette's late novella is the story of the renunciation of eros. Breaking through to her final conclusion, Colette finally abandons the heartache of romantic love in the name of living a life devoted to the beauty and enduring vastness of nature. Colette's prose is a sublime construction-a woven fabric emanating from a deeply felt, naturalistic sensibility. Her descriptions of the changing of the light, of the fineness of the sand and of the convulsions of the romantic psyche are incomparable. This poetic \\"memoir\\" is sui generis-it is a love letter, an act of betrayal, a poetic epiphany."},{"Title":"Break of day,: A novel","review":"This book describes Colettes daily life in a cottage in a rural setting on the Mediterranean cost of Provence in Southern France, in the city of Saint Tropez. Besides Colette, two other characters strikes out in the account: Viale, a young painter and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cl&eacute;ment, an young woman. Colette, which is an older woman, has a relationship with Vial, and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cl&eacute;ment is too in love with Vial. So this m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois provides an unspoken tension which in an indirect manner fuels the account. The style of the book is in the form of a poetic diary. Colette seems to be a somewhat lonely figure whose closest relations seems to be with the cats which lives together with her in her house. Also she seems very attached to nature which she describes with sensuous sensitivity."},{"Title":"The Puzzle of the Happy Hooligan (A Hildegarde Withers Mystery Novel)","review":"Schoolteacher Hildegarde Withers is taking a well-earned holiday in Hollywood, when she is surprised to be offered a job as a production expert on a new picture about Lizzie Borden (she is worried the producer might imagine she was a contemporary of Miss Borden's). No sooner has she settled into her new office than the writer in the office next to her dies mysteriously, apparently having broken his neck. Naturally, Miss Withers starts to investigate, and it seems that the murderer is intent on making her his next victim, much to the dismay of Hildegarde's old friend Inspector Piper of the New York police.This is another delightful and funny murder mystery, with an intriguing plot and some very colourful characters, especially the eccentric movie producer Thorwald L. Nincom, who is intent on finding the perfect Lizzie Borden, and quite unhampered by any question of historical accuracy in his picture. Miss Withers is more succesful at solving murders than at persuading Mr Nincom that Shirley Temple would not make a great Lizzie Borden. This is possibly the funnist Miss Withers story of all."},{"Title":"A History of the Old South","review":"A really valid portrait of the South that has escaped many reviewers; if one is looking for a colorful, accurate evaluation of the mindset that permeated the \\"class\\" society and the driving economic power that human bondage ensured, a must read. Prof. Eaton is a marvelous writer for historians and for the general public."},{"Title":"Urban Fortunes: The Political Economy of Place","review":"I feel compelled to write a short review because of the two negative reviews accompanying this listing. This book is an extension of the arguments in \\"The City as a Growth Machine,\\" the seminal sociology article from 1976, by Harvey Molotch. Molotch's basic argument is that previously, local government and community studies focused on intra-elite competition and the like. His major point was that regardless of differences of opinion within the local political power structure, all in fact were united behind a \\"growth agenda\\" directed to an intensification of land uses and an increase in rents (the economics term, in the sense of the rentier class). The book extends these arguments much further. For example, one of the points made is about the \\"use value\\" versus the \\"exchange value\\" of place. The latter is about making money off place, the former about the intrinsic value of home, etc. The other major point (also in the article) is the growth machine's \\"value-free development\\" ideology, that growth is always good, adds jobs, etc. This book is as important to urban studies as Jane Jacobs _Death and Life of Great American Cities_. Whereas Jacobs focuses on design, density, and mixed uses; Logan and Molotch focus on the sociology, politics, and economics of local government. In the argot of today, they focus on the \\"back story.\\" Sections on the role of sports, gambling, etc., in the growth machine efforts are no less worthwhile. Any one who is active on local land use issues will find this book to be a revelation. My only significant \\"criticism\\" is that the book is 17 years old and could use an updating with additional citations, etc. In short, this is an essential book."},{"Title":"Urban Fortunes: The Political Economy of Place","review":"If you've ever tried to understand seeming arbitrary political decisions about land use, or why some growth issues are never discussed, or why certain transportation projects are funded and others are not, this book provides an structure of understanding local and regional politics in America in the late 20th century, one you won't find in Planning School or if you are in transportation engineering.It also tells how globalized capitalism is driving localplanning.Logan and Molotch's thesis is to local politics what Darwin evolutuionary concepts are to natural botony and natural history. You will never watch local government the sameway again after reading this book.This book is considered one of the most important books in sociology of the last 50 years, and won the American SociologyAssociation book-of-the-year award in 1990.If you are a died in the wool Cato-Institute/ American Enterprise Institution/Chicago School liberatian /free market-solved everything person, you won't like it. But if you want tohave a an alternate paradigms of how political economy of the the city works in your head, this provides a good alternative."},{"Title":"Urban Fortunes: The Political Economy of Place","review":"Who rules cities? Logan and Molotch have a theory. This book lays it out, in fairly simple terms. It argues that landowners have a shared interest in \\"growth\\", i.e. increased property values (land's exchange-value), and are willing to do whatever it takes to get them, including taking over government. This puts them in conflict with residents who care about their neighborhoods (land's use-value) and don't want growth's unstoppable engine.It's a brilliant book, with insights on every page and some poignant stories as well. Logan and Molotch are sociologists, not writers, so the book drags at points, but it's well worth it for anyone who's interested in the subject. My major critique is that it underplays the importance of planning and doesn't provide a good explanation for it, but that's a rather minor criticism, all things considered. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Urban Fortunes: The Political Economy of Place","review":"Logan and Molotch use the explanation of the city through the tension that exists between owners who see the city as exchange value and the residents who see the city as use value. According to the authors, the local elites are associated with politicians and local media to generate a coalition, whose speech is that the results of their actions will benefit everyone. Such discourse is needed to operate the \\"growth engine\\", transforming the city and its value in use of all, the exchange value of a few."},{"Title":"Urban Fortunes: The Political Economy of Place","review":"&quot;It seems obvious that only in the largest places is it possible to attain the highest incomes in the lucrative occupations; for individuals with such ambitions, large may be the only option.&quot;The above is an excerpt from this tedious text that calls itself, untruthfully, an introduction to urban studies. Such statements are made throughout the entire text with no figures upon which to base such assumptions. The authors insist on the omnipresence of unexplained jargon, vague statements, farfetched metaphors and ambiguous assumptions in order to arrive at a certain point they are failing to make.It is painfully obvious that the authors are not capable of any coherent and/or original thought and in order to fill out the 360 pages of &quot;Urban Fortunes&quot; they heavily rely on recycling and reusing the ideas of others, followed by an extensive 70-page bibliography and a 20-page index.As an innocent bystander I feel cheated for losing forever the time I spent reading this text, yet I feel that much worse for the unsuspecting undergraduate college students who, according to the back cover, are required to buy this book for their classes."},{"Title":"Urban Fortunes: The Political Economy of Place","review":"When I first got this book, by the glowing reviews on the back, I thought that I would be treated to a jargon-free discourse on sociology. Unfortunately, the people who wrote the reviews on the back are either 1) stupid 2) lying 3) being blackmailed by the author or 4) exchanging glowing reviews for their own books. Mr. Molotch is unable to explain even the most basic concepts in political science, economics, or sociology without resorting to jargon that he is unwilling (or unable) to define. After closely examining the book, I found no fewer than 78 terms that were repeatedly used which he refused to define, and whose meanings seem to change more than Madonna's choice in attire did back in the 1980s. The one achievement of this book is that it manages to set the course of the social sciences back many years. Rather than using rigorous analysis, the author uses platitudes, nonsense words and shoddy analysis. The book makes no contribution to the literature, and has no value to policy-makers, students, or historians.On the good side, various paragraphs of the book may make for good cocktail party chatter, provided the drinks being served are not watered down."},{"Title":"The Restaurant & Bar English/Spanish Spanish/English Dictionary","review":"This book does cover a wide variety of topics, but it could go a lot more in depth. Good for managers and restaurant workers with little or no Spanish speaking ability. For more advanced users who already have the rudiments down, this leaves a lot to be desired. As we who work in the restaurant industry well know, there is a lot of detail to working in kitchens and a wide variety of things that need to be communicated. A lot of those verbs, phrases, and descriptors just aren't covered.

At least, not yet.These stories are the kind I like: reasonably literate, very explicit, and basically about people being happy with each other. The stories don't rush into the physical coupling - they always give a few pages to set their scenes end engage the imagination. There's no [almost] sub/dom theme here. Almost all of the stories are affectionate and mutual. That suits my tastes just fine, and doesn't interfere a bit with a juicy story. Quite the opposite, it encourages unhurried, detailed descriptions of the players and their play.These stories really are what erotica should be.

A very delicious selection from a mistress of the genre."},{"Title":"Sweet Life: Erotic Fantasies for Couples","review":"'Sweet Life: Erotic Fantasies for Couples' and I have essentially broken up by now. We've tried making it work for some months now, but the sexual chemistry just isn't there. It boils down to irreconcilable differences: I want something that is well-written and original; Sweet Life strives for as many cheap thrills as you can get with third-grade diction and vocabulary.We gave it an earnest attempt at first: the wife and I got comfortable together and I read aloud the first five stories or so to her. Interest waned as it became apparent that certain phrases would be repeated throughout each tale. Phrases such as 'already erect', 'thrusting repeatedly', 'cries of pleasure' became commonplace, predictable. Every paragraph featured at least one superlative adjective.Maybe if we'd built a drinking game around our reading-time ('Wet and slippery', take a drink!; 'So darn hard', take two drinks!), we could've made it work. But the inspiration wasn't there, so the inspiration wasn't there.Besides droll repetition of stock erotica vocabulary, Sweet Life lacked the sophistication that I've come to desire in my fiction. I can't boast a collegiate background in literature, but I do appreciate it when my books can adroitly turn a phrase. I can count on Chuck Palahniuk's novels to titillate. Terry Pratchett does things with his sentences I didn't know were possible. And Stephen King, while getting on in years, still can work his prose into a frenzy, with a long-enough running start.But Sweet Life's stories (with one exception, a doozy by Hanne Blank that has almost no sex in it) are, without fail, contrived, formulaic and clich&eacute;. Some examples:'Although my internet-whiz husband spent his days in front of a computer screen, he kept in shape by by swimming laps at lunchtime at the health club next door to where he worked.''Negotiation has always been the hallmark of our relationship.''...it had literally been years...'At 'literally', I nearly slammed the cover on Sweet Life, thinking, \\"There's just no excuse for this abuse of language in our relationship.\\" But I kept my calm and just laughed it off, and let the distance grow naturally.One day soon, I'll nonchalantly move the book to the cardboard box in the closet and the next thing it'll know, someone will be shelving it for purchase at the local thrift shop. And then I'll have completely moved on."},{"Title":"Sweet Life: Erotic Fantasies for Couples","review":"Add me to the list of very satisfied readers. This fantastic anthology made its way into my hands about a week ago, and I'm already re-reading my favorite stories. And sharing them with my long-distance girlfriend has been highly arousing and a real spark for both of us. The stories are really well written and are a serious source for fantasy material. In \\"Playing Doctor\\" a man plays a therapist who compels his wife to confess, then act out her fantasies. \\"The Last Train\\" is an amazing exhibition story where a man watches his girlfriend with another man. And there are several hot threesome stories, of every combination. It's an outstanding erotic anthology, and my girlfriend and I are looking forward to trying out some of these in person, hopefully soon!"},{"Title":"Sweet Life: Erotic Fantasies for Couples","review":"This is the ultimate book of fantasies for couples. I have looked for many years for something &quot;interesting&quot; for my wife and me, but this is one of the first successes (others were way too tame). It seems every common fantasy is covered in a story, including women taking their men, women encouraging transvestitism, the traditional rape fantasy, hookers, public exposure, lesbianism, groups, and even man-man couplings involving women in some way. To truly enjoy this book one must have an open mind and be willing to escape into the stories. Anyone who is even the slightest bit uptight or prudish would be immediately embarrassed or even offended.Golly.... I must be awfully kinky myself to enjoy it so much."},{"Title":"Sweet Life: Erotic Fantasies for Couples","review":"I think the thing I liked the most about this book is that the stories are full of hot steamy sex, but they're still very sweet and loving.

The writing is high-quality and my partner and I appreciated the emphasis on consensual relations. While not all of the stories fit our tastes and individual fantasies, the overall variety ensures there is something for everyone. We tagged the stories we liked and found about half of the book was suited to us, which is plenty. We also purchased Sweet Life 2 and found that book to be more \\"advanced\\" in it's exploration of alternative sexual experiences but again, if you chose the stories that apply to your tastes there should still be plenty of reading.

Religion is a notoriously difficult concept to define, so this is no surprise. What Langmuir contributes to this issue is a separation between private religious impulses, and religious institutions. Langmuir refers to the former as &quot;religiosity&quot; and to the latter as &quot;religion.&quot; Under these definitions, almost all humans have religiosities of one form or another, but they do not become a &quot;religion&quot; until some form of institutionalization takes place. This definition is not without difficulties, but it does deserve serious engagement.&quot;History&quot; is also covered in the first part of the book. With regard to &quot;history,&quot; Langmuir's book is more about the interpretation of history rather than history itself. In looking at the motivations and judgments of historical figures, Langmuir questions why we must accept explanations of earlier scholars or historical figures with regard to their actions or motivations. Langmuir argues that as present-day critics and judges we can reach different conclusions about the past rather than be bound by those people's explanations for their own behavior.In the last part of the text, Langmuir weaves these two notions together to analyze antisemitism. While others have tried to provide social, theological, or racial reasons for antisemitic actions and behaviors, Langmuir concludes that antisemitism is reducible to an &quot;irrational&quot; form of religiosity., a paranoid conspiracy theory about a group of people---like that found in the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion.&quot; Some worldviews are irrational and illogical, and antisemitism is one of them, according to Langmuir.I disagree with Langmuir's analysis of antisemitism, although his work on history and religion is still valuable. Antisemitism has many facets, from theological to social. Certain New Testament quotations can be used to justify antisemitism and early Christian theology, including Augustine, is notoriously uncomfortable with the presence of Jews. Antisemitism and fascism have histories of their own, and are not simply periodic insane ramblings from people who lack appropriate medication. Rather, they are human worldviews with a coherence and logic of their own. This in no way justifies them as practices, but running away from them and dismissing them as simply &quot;illogical&quot; will not make them go away or help us to understand these all-too-human worldviews any better.For a better treatment and analysis of contemporary antisemitism read Michael Barkun's work &quot;Religion and the Racist Right.&quot;"},{"Title":"History, Religion, and Antisemitism (Centennial Book)","review":"In this work Langmuir takes the eleventh and twelvth centuries as the key period in the transformation from what he calls Anti- Jewishness to Anti- Semitism. Anti- Jewishness as he understands it has to do with Christianity's conflict with Judaism on matters of faith and practice. Anti- Semitism he insteads see as irrational, and fueled by imaginative constructions and fantasies. The latter as he understands is a reflection of Christian uncertainty in itself at this time.Langmuir has a wide knowledge of sociology, and anthropology and his writing focuses on understanding collective and social phenomenom.This work may not be the comprehensive history of Anti- Semitism which would explain it in all its various historical manifestations. But it is an informed scholarly work for all those who wish to understand the medieval Christian variant of this form of human evil."},{"Title":"History, Religion, and Antisemitism (Centennial Book)","review":"My book came in the time I expected and in the condition I hoped for.

It was an exciting time for outreach, and questions arose about how to run these ministries. The book helps with suggested names (some now outdated),staffing issues, and literature to use. My sense is that this manual would not be so vital for present ministry as much as a great resource for looking back on the Jesus Movement in America--the 60's thru the late 70's or so. Some vintage photos are included in the manual. Candles and people sitting around. Maybe it could be updated by someone for use today. A good enjoyable read, especially for those interested in urban evangelism."},{"Title":"WHAT DO YOU DO DEAR LB","review":"The tight-rope was the funniest part of the book.

Not only is this book written on a very basic level, but it provides no visual aids to assist the reader in understanding complex ideas that very often have powerfully visual/tactile components; for example, the chapter on the periodic table makes frequent reference to earlier models but provides no reproduction of them to illustrate the comparative discussion.

I used this book and her The Smugglers ofSandy Bay as research in preparing an exhibit on the War of 1812 for the Sandy Bay Historical Society in Rockport. The detail she includes gives a real sense of life in that period that was helpful to me. I also read these books as a child and the stories still captivate me. She did take poetic license with onehistorical character in Smugglers, but I pointed that out in the exhibit toshow that we can't take everything we read as completely accurate. Her then contemporary Rockport books of a young girl in the 1950s in Rockport, the Rowena Carey series, paint an engaging portrait of the Rockport of that era. Rowena is also a chubby girl who doesn't let her extra girth stop her enjoyment of life and has a feisty response to any teasing.

It compares and contrasts the different genetic models of epilepsy in addition to many other facets of the field. It discusses the GABA ion channel model, aberrant synaptic neurobiology, rodent and primate models, pharmacology of agents inducing and treating the various syndromes. I used this as helpful background to a Grant I wrote on the Strasbourg rat and absence epilepsy. For 2005, the book still remains relevant and useful as a tool even though it was written several years ago. Additional areas of exploration included kindling (chemical and electrical), neurotransmitter chemistry, the differences in the developing and immature brain.

He told me that it was \\"a collection of old pictures of men together,\\" and that it was not meant to be eroticism. He was right on both counts, but the book is so much more than that. It is a chronicle--historical documentation of a segment of our culture, a glimpse of part of who we were as a society that might have been lost had not John Ibson meticulously produced this work. Can you imagine that at one time in the not so distant past, men of all walks of life--cowboys, soldiers, athletes, businessmen--felt comfortable enough with each other to display their kinship openly? A hand laid firmly on a shoulder or knee, an arm draped around another man's neck--regardless of sexual orientation, these were demonstrations of genuine affection. I bought the book because I love black and white photography and for that I knew I would appreciate the book's significance. But there is far more there; John's commentary on the culture of our times is well-researched, insightful, and extremely well-written. For historians, sociologists, collectors and artists, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Picturing Men: A Century of Male Relationships in Everyday American Photography","review":"Writing in an erudite, scholarly manner Professor John Ibson has managed to present a substantive survey of the evolution of male gender perception in his PICTURING MEN: A Century of Male Relationships in Everyday American Photography. And for all its heavily researched scholarship, Ibson also has created a very tender elegy about the history of male intimacy, tracing the genuinely warm comraderie as depicted in extant studio and personal photographs rom the mid 19th Century to the gradual emergence of homophobia after World War II.This is a book that probably is best read twice: the first 'read' should be a slow thumbing through the pages of wonderfully tender and humorous photographs of men in pairs, in poses, in groups of pageant/pantomime, in dorm rooms, barracks, and in nature. The second read should be on of thoughtful attention paid to the written word, an experience which is never cloyingly sentimental, yet ever mindful of the sad fact that our society has created a ban on men expressing tenderness to other men. He wisely shows the tendency to use rough-housing and elaborate greeting techniques to convey the feelings now considered not only 'inappropriate' but worse - as in the 'Don't ask, don't tell' stance of the military. In the most sensitive chapter of this gentile book Ibson studies life in the military from the Civil War through World War II, pointing out both sides of the argument that war and its accompanying terror encourages men to bond, at least psychologically if not sexually. And in keeping with the tenor of the title \\"in Everyday American Photography\\" he references the manner in which Life Magazine - that pre-internet, pre-mass media resource which shouldered the burden of documenting for Americans how things were - shows the intensity of male relationships during WW II and its waning in the 1950s.Ibson is careful to remind us that his picture research comes from his own collection of photographs gathered from swap meets, antique stores, and auctions and that his own feelings are supported by such disparate sources as songs (especially \\"My Buddy\\"), memoirs of soldiers, studies of wars by such men as Stephen Ambrose, John Horne Burns, Norman Mailer, and Allen Drury, and movies. In other words, this book stands solidly as a statement about the sad loss of man's ability to accept intimacy, especially when it comes to his fellowman. A beautifully written, highly readable, very valuable book and treatise."},{"Title":"Picturing Men: A Century of Male Relationships in Everyday American Photography","review":"Since I came to this country almost forty years ago, I have always felt American males are the most isolated, and handicapped emotionally in the world. I don't classify this book as gay history, but it is a book on visual testaments of male emotions(affections?) when it was intact. This book will give you a smile you didn't know you had. I sincerly, and eagerly wish that we take few deep breaths, and take few backward steps to regain what we have lost not too long ago. LOVE. I thank you for this book."},{"Title":"Picturing Men: A Century of Male Relationships in Everyday American Photography","review":"I was taken by surprise when I saw the level of affection and intimacycaptured in these photos of men from another era.I can't imagine men of my time allowing themselves to be caught in expressions of such open affection.I seriously doubt that all these men were gay men, so how does one account for the shift in what is socially acceptable.Men of my generation would likely be most uncomfortable, I think, with what appears to be genuine affection and buddyship, but it may be that the lives of those men were enriched in a way that we can't appreciate today."},{"Title":"Picturing Men: A Century of Male Relationships in Everyday American Photography","review":"I bought this for my best friend who's gay. I almost hesitated doing so, the men in these photographs leave a WHOLE lot to be desired. He likes it, though, because he has a few of these old postcards, and is a photography buff to boot.

I was surprised to find that this is not fiction about her Gumshoe Girls, but a true life story about herself and an ill fated romance she had with a bona fide con man after the breakup of her long marriage. From the moment I started reading, I could hardly put the book down. Her story is told in intimate detail, great humor and sarcasm. The only bad thing about the book is that the story ended. It was also interesting to learn what she was doing at the times she was writing her first two books (or at least the first two that I read). I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tell Me Something Pretty","review":"I just began reading &quot;Tell Me Something Pretty&quot; but I doubt I'll be able to finish it.

It is highly emotional, and nearly made me cry!After that, the book switches to its true form...a book with captivating text and even better photos of wolves, taken ina areas where they are very elusive and have lots of foliage to be hidden among.Jim Brandenburg, a very well-known wildlife photographer and the author of multiple wolf books, even goes far enough to explain his first encounter with wolves and how he felt at that time. The book is highly educational, but also very touching.Overall, the book has great text with even greater photographs, and is definitely a good read. The high price, however, is quite a problem. But if you like wolves, and if you're willing to pay the price, definitely buy this book. It's excellent."},{"Title":"Brother Wolf: A Forgotten Promise","review":"This book was extremely engaging and beautiful. The writing and pictures bring a whole new world beautifully. This book was designed so well, that it was very hard to put the book down when reading! It brought a whole new perspective to my view on my Siberian Husky, and no doubt a new relationship! This is a must read for all those wondering about the Wolf, and a definite with those who have dogs as companions!"},{"Title":"Brother Wolf: A Forgotten Promise","review":"This is the most beautiful wolf book I own. The book reads poeticly, and will make you seriously fall in love with this animal. You will see through the wolf's eyes. This is one of few books were the author photographed all wild wolves, and never &quot;lived&quot; with the pack to do it."},{"Title":"Brother Wolf: A Forgotten Promise","review":"Jim Brandenburg starts off his book &quot;Brother Wolf: A Forgotten Promise&quot; with a heart rending letter from one who has evolved right next to us, The Wolf. He describes (anthropomorphically) the way in which the wolf must view us. Strange and getting stranger, the wolf doesn't feel that he knows us any longer. After that Brandenburg becomes serious presenting the wolf not as the Devil of mythology, nor as the Angel of the new animal loving mythology. Instead he chooses to present the wolf as it is, a highly specialised predator filling its' important niche in our ecosystem. The text is easily understood by all. Complex behavioral jargon is avoided as this book was meant obviously to give the general public an idea of some of the facts surrounding this animal.The photography is of course a beautiful example of why Brandenburgs photos are so popularly appealing. He shoots just as he writes, exactly what the animals are. His pictures communicate a depth of understanding that only someone who truly knows the wolf can achieve. If you wish to begin your own store of knowledge on the wolf &quot;Brother Wolf&quot; is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Brother Wolf: A Forgotten Promise","review":"Jim Brandenburg succinctly captures the essence of the wolf.

I'm really looking forward to reading this book!"},{"Title":"Brother Wolf: A Forgotten Promise","review":"In Brother Wolf: A forgotten Promise, the author, Jim Brandenburg, becomes a bit more philosophical and introspective than in his earlier book, White Wolf, ( also a great book ). The study and photography for this book was done in the Boundary Waters area of Minnesota near Ely.Having been in Ely two years ago myself )and knowing nothing of Brandenburg), I happened to visit a wolf visitor center. This sparked my interest in wolves and when I came across the Brandenburgs books, I ordered them both. I ordered used books from Amazon and they are in perfect condition. In&#34;Brother Wolf&#34;, the author describes the wolves of the boundary waters area where he lives in a cabin part of the year. If you have any fears or heard the usual old wives tales of the evilness of wolves,etc. this book will dispel those fears. It is finally time to take a realistic look at an animal who has been demonized for many years.Brandenburgs writing is excellent and very enjoyable to read. His photos are beautiful.

Outstanding photography draws you in however, the text does not back up the potential of the book. THe pictures create an outstanding book; the words can make you loose interest fairly quickly.

Tyler Fier seems to be a very handsome &amp; charming guy- and very evil.

This time we are taken back to a time of war in 1861 Georgia. Despite the fact that Tyler Fear has gone off to fight for the North, against the Savannah Gentry's South, she can't help but feel connected to him. Savannah's sister, Victoria, insists that the Fear family only brings evil and that she must stay away from Tyler. Savannah refuses to listen to anyone or anything but her heart, which is telling her she belongs with Tyler Fear. After returning from the war, Tyler is a changed man. Savannah doesn't know how much he has changed, but she soon finds out when she moves with her sister to Tyler's home, Black Rose Manor. And Black Rose Manor is anything but homey and warm, literally chilling it's inhabitants to the bone.While the first installment of this series, A New Fear, is still one of my favorites, Forbidden Secrets is a very entertaining read. I love how R.L. Stine weaves in bits of history into his stories, making them feel more grounded and permanent in a way. As always you are on your toes and you think you know which characters fall on the side of evil and which ones fall on the side of good, but R.L. Stine does a wonderful job in throwing you a curve ball, surprising you at the very last moment. Even when little things are obviously predictable, you are still pleasantly surprised at the outcome. While you know that there is more to Tyler, as he is a 'Fear' after all, you quite can't put your finger on it - he is very suave and sweet.If you're a sucker for quick entertaining thrillers you won't be disappointed in Forbidden Secrets or the The Fear Street Sagas."},{"Title":"Forbidden Secrets: Fear Street Sagas #3","review":"This is a fabulous story about life in the past with a Fier.

It takes place during the war, and the main character is Savannah Gentry (not Madison, like it says on the back of the book for some reason) who falls in love with Tyler Fier. Her parents are dead and her brother is killed in the war, so she and her sister Victoria go live with Tyler, despite Victoria's insistence that his home is evil, yadda yadda yadda. As soon as they move in the deaths begin (including the token face smashed-in death with bubbling brains) and as usual, not everyone is what they seem."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln: For the people (TW)","review":"I first read this book when I was in elementary school and devouring every book I could find. At the time, I found it very good as it appealed to the historical view of Abraham Lincoln that our teachers gave us. However, as I reread it now I see how limited it is, with the concentration on his childhood and almost nothing about his leadership during the American Civil War. This was the defining moment for Lincoln and one of the few moments in the history of the United States where it could have ceased being a country. Therefore, while it reads easy and is understandable, many of the most significant points in the life of Lincoln are missed."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln: For the people (TW)","review":"This book was about Abraham Lincoln, who was the president of the United States during the Civil War.

The exercises seem deceptively simple; at times, you want to throw down you pen and bang you hand on the table and proclaim, \\"what the hell is this about.\\"Simply put, these exercises allow you to begin to tap into the right brain . . . the creative side of the mind. Examples of this include writing with the non-dominant hand, working with an 'idea compass,' and other examples of working with 'process work' from which themes and then images are obtained. Some of the goals here are to inject emotion into your work, jump start a stalled work.Ayers concludes by looking at the import of sounds of words with inflection points, accent points and the like. She's a poet by trade, but the import of what she lectures on can be applied to standard fiction and even more technical writing. This is a unique course on creative writing; you will not find anything quite like it anywhere. Approach it with an open mind--even if you're a natural skeptic."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Creative Writing Workshop","review":"A wonderful tape series on the act of writing.

As an experienced java guy and web developer, I feel I should have been able to read a book like this through and end up with a good working knowledge of Struts, but this isn't the case. For a start, there is a lot of filler in this book just taking up space (a lot of it, double-spaced with wide margins). For example, not only are there plenty of source listings in the body of the text (including some from the struts source, to give you a \\"look inside\\") but there are chapters such as number 4 on the HTTP protocol and 5 on JSP and servlets. Not only is this sort of information widely available elsewhere, it is pretty unnecessary in a book obviously targeted at people with a working knowledge of web applications and java in particular.The other chapters did not do a good job in my view of explaining the struts framework. There was ample description of the example classes (such as beans, with all their getters and setters printed in the book) which was very easy to follow, but the coverage on bringing it all together was poor. For example, from the chapter on struts-config.xml there's only one sentence on what the \\"input\\" attribute to the action tag means: \\"The input attribute allows the action to redirect back to the form that was used to enter the form values by specifying its path.\\" I feel this could have been explained a little better! Why devote 4 or 5 pages of the book to listing the source of a trivial javabean and then shortchange the reader on the descriptions of the actual subject?I'm going to buy another book, I suggest you also might want to think about starting elsewhere."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"This book (like many of its type) reads more like a collection miscellaneous notes than a structured, organized text book. It is disjointed and incomplete. Moreover, it encourages bad practices (at least the examples do).The book fails to intelligently synchronize and present the relationship between the JSP page, the action class, the action form and the struts-config.xml. In fact, you never see the struts-config file (it's kind of important).The last straw came when I was reading a 4 line section about a particular tag usage. The authors offered this brillant insight - ..&quot;for more detail, refer to the Struts documentation&quot;! Gee, thanks...maybe the authors should have given that advise in the introductory paragraph and left the rest of the book blank.The discussion of &lt;html:select&gt; and &lt;html:options&gt; and the mechanism to store and retrieve these data elements to and from the Action Form was ambiguous and misleading. Moreover, hard coding data elements in a Vector inside the JSP is just downright bad practice. The point of Struts is to minimize the need to put java / javascript code in your JSP.Overall, poorly organized, poorly written and not that useful."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"I find this book to be full of inconsistancies and unexplained references, and generally disorganized. The authors often present the code samples with a minimum of explanation, or just discuss a small part without the surrounding context. They consistantly use parts of the technology that are explained much later in the book, leaving the user to try and sort it out. They don't even bother to warn you or cross-reference. This is a tightly interwoven framework, and I had hoped for a better &quot;map&quot; to what ties in with what other parts (and why).The chapter on the struts-config.xml, arguably the pivotal file of the entire framework, is shown by inserting the DTD and a few confusing notes about some of the attributes. The chapter ends by telling the reader to go out and get a GUI editor.Many pages are wasted listing out code for a concept better shown in a few well-chosen lines. The code that is included is poorly documented.Now, I need to go find another book to give me some cohesive idea of using Struts -- maybe this one will serve better as areference once I'm familiar with it."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"Thanks for a book having a very practical approach to integrate Struts in web applications running in EAI environments !The examples described are - especially when combined with the attached cohesive set of apps - a very good starting point to get apps running in the environment Java/Struts/J2EE (and even Web Services using Axis...).Dirk V.

This book does give bits and pieces knowledge of everything to start preparing a web application except for struts, which should have been the main topic of of the book.For example, as much as I have read it doesnt give the context of how the struts config xml relates between the jsp page and the action classes. Instead it gives a better idea of what an MVC architecture or a HTTP protocol or what the end user sees or about the Model part of MVC.Doesn't the author understand that when you are trying to learn struts, the reader probably (about 90% of the readers) has prior knowledge of all these things. And if I need to know about any of these there are better books that I could buy instead of a Struts book.I would highly recommend NOT BUYING THIS BOOK.

I've been learning on my own, but felt a great desire for something to give me a boost. I heard a few good things about this book, so I bought it rather excitedly -- after all, it's the newest book, so it ought to be the most complete, right?I found this book *seriously* lacking. Its example applications are trivial and its explanation of anything Struts is almost completely superficial. As an example, the book claims to cover Struts 1.1 but didn't mention Map-backed ActionForms at all -- and hardly mentioned DynaForms, other than showing one simple example.In summary, the writing style is quite good, the introductory material fair, but the detailed coverage is abysmal."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"This is an excellent book on Struts 1.1. This book was a somewhat of a late arrival and I had already purchased &quot;other&quot; Struts books available. Therefore, I was a bit hesitant to buy it. But after browing through it at a local bookstore, I decided to buy it anyway. I am glad that I did, because it is very well written indeed. The authors write in a very clear and communicative style that is quite refreshing! It is apparent that they also &quot;know&quot; what they are talking about as well. Acutally, it is quite an eye opener for me. It is beginning to impress upon me the &quot;awesome&quot; potential of the &quot;open-source&quot; community. This book is entirely based on the open source software. Anybody who still has doubts about what the open source movement is should read and work through this book.The authors also maitain a web-site for this book.

The next morning, I get a detailed e-mail from Kevin giving me the link to these utilities on the Cygwin site. This is very impressive!

I have some background in Java, but not using it in Web Apps. I soon learned about MVC and Struts. I scoured the web for Struts tutorials and if you're like me, found them VERY lacking, very incomplete and very unhelpful. I've struggled with configuring ant, compiling java files by hand all to no avail. There had to be a better way. I finally broke down and got this book.I was soooo excited to get this book and start my web app development projects using Struts. The book starts off pretty good by disecting a very simple struts application, but it didn't tell you how to run/deploy the application. I figured I could just deploy the app with Ant, (since i've struggled with it before) but I decided to be patient and told myself, perhaps I should finish reading the entire book first before I start writing web apps.Then the book transitioned to what I believed to be a somewhat complex struts app for beginners. The authors do a good job in dissecting the code and explaining how it works, but again, no help in how to run and deploy the application. I felt like I was being rushed.Later on, I started to get bored and began skimming the book. The stuff near the end was getting complex and I still was shaky on the easy stuff. I read the first couple of pages of EJBs with Struts and Web Services with Struts. They were interesting, but I wasn't ready to get into that yet, I still felt like I was missing something.I still recommend that you get this book. If you're new to web application development, this book really breaks down best practices and demistifies web app buzzword terms such was MVC, EJBs, J2EE web services, SOAP and other things a web app developer should know, but you will get it shoved down your throat. Be warned, this book isn't for beginners. It's for those who have been struggling really really hard trying to learn struts on your own through tutorials on the web. You should be somewhat already familiar with Ant, (or you can get that shoved down your throat too), setting up environment variables, Tomcat, Databases and some database terms (primary key, auto increment, things like that). I had to tweek the build.xml and build.properties files to work in my environment. That didn't bother me too much because I learned something in the process.I'm not dissapointed in the book because I learned so much from it. Had I not already struggled with Struts and learning how to write java based web apps, I'd be lost. If you're someone like me, it's worth it. Get it."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"This was the first book that I bought in order to learn Struts. I found that the text was generally unhelpful as it was written from the point of view of Struts 1.0x, whereas 1.1 invalidates much of what the authors talk about (you might as well rip out the chapter about validation and throw it away, because NOTHING in there is valid), assuming it wasn't bug-ridden anyway.The supporting website hasn't been updated since May, 2003, and the links to updated files are all dead (the chapter 3 hello program on the CD doesn't work, so you're SOL now).The ONLY saving grace is the CD.I suggest you look elsewhere for an introductory book; this book seems to be hacked out quickly to capitalize on the Struts phenomenon and just as quickly abandoned."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"Completely useless as a reference book.

I took it home and started working through the demo application in Chapter 3, Hello World.Of course they don't give you any information on how to install it or set it up for Tomcat. There's a companion CDROM that has all the source on it, but it is also poorly documented. I can't figure it out.I went to the web site for the book and it's horribly out of date. There's a link to a new version of the HelloWorld application, but the link now points to a squatter's domain.I'm sorry I spent any money on this book, but I guess I should be glad that I didn't pay full price for a brand new copy."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"Parts of the book are really well-written, illustrating a concept by showing how it is implemented in a sample application. However, this approach isn't consistently applied, particularly in the sections related to the tag libraries. In many cases the descriptions don't relate at all to the code, leaving the reader to guess why certain parameters were used, or how a particular tag relates to its associated bean or resource file.A few more diagrams might be useful as well. After slogging through the sample code and its associated descriptive text, I was able to learn quite a bit about the Struts framework. But it was much more difficult than it had to be, especially for a newcomer to Struts such as myself. The very nature of the Model-View-Controller paradigm that Struts is built on requires a separation of code related to presentation from that related to business logic or data access. I found myself building little maps for myself as I read the book, trying to keep track of where (and when) a bean was created or maintained, since without a clear understanding of the framework there's no easy way to trace the life of an object. I think the book would have been much better if the authors had invested the time to create some of these maps for us. Paradoxically, the very shortness of the book forces you to spend MORE time than would be necessary if the discussions were more complete.This book is not an easy read, but I found it useful nevertheless. Be prepared to invest a lot of energy in hacking your way through the code, and don't be shy about writing notes in the book if you really want to understand what's going on. The authors have thoughtfully included an electronic version of the book on the CD, allowing you to search for key words to find what you need. And I liked the overall approach of using a sample application to bring the framework to life."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"Struts Kick Start is a very complete and clear presentation of the de facto j2ee/jsp/model 2 standard.

Use this tool to create the JSP, but what if you don't have that tool and are limited to the tools you can use?Since the tool generated code is required before compiling the included source code - that is a glaring omission.

Also the style of the books is pretty much like this.. here are a couple basic notions and consideration about the new subject, here is a code dump of a toy application using these techniques, and finally areally quick and superficial overviiew of the code. So apart from a few simple concepts the only way to learn something from this book is to go dig in the source code, and even so you learn only how to do that thing.. not how to do things in general..and that is not my idea of a good tutorial.Also, I would have loved to see coverage of XDoclet to produce configuration files..."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"This is a very well written book.

The term \\"kick start\\" does not imply going from 0-60 in 6 seconds.There is virtually no in-depth coverage of advanced features, such as beanutils or scaffolding, but those fall outside the scope of the book. There is much coverage of basics such as the HTTP protocol, session management, and MVC.More advanced readers should probably opt for [...]the more obscure and advanced knowledge."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"This book is somewhat of a late arrival in the rapidly crowding Struts book market. Having purchased all of the other books published on Struts, I was somewhat reluctant to buy this book. I had the opportunity to browse through it at a local book store and decided to buy it anyway. I am glad that I did.The authors write in a very clear and communicative style. They apparently know what they are talking about as well. This combination makes it a very useful text.The authors also maintain a support web site for the book. I was having trouble installing certain components of the excellent freeware Unix tools &quot;Cygwin.&quot; I wrote an email stating my problem the previous afternoon. In the morning, I got a detailed e-mail message from Kevin Bedell explaining how to go about correcting this problem and a hyperlink pointing to the desired section of the website.

The author assumes ALL users know how to set things up and run a web application. The title is &quot;STRUTS kick start&quot;, it makes sense that it should include readers who has no prior web set up experience. This book teaches you all the knowledge about STRUTS, but fails to show you how to set up and run the examples. If readers can't run the examples and practice, no matter how good the content of the book is, it is useless. Only men miss little-big detail like this!"},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"I bought this book to learn Struts: not to learn ABOUT struts. The authors clearly have a firm grasp on the topic, but unfortunately, this book is more of a 481 page example of them showing the reader what they know than it is instructing the reader in how to learn what they know. I have had this book for several weeks, and have read through many of the chapters before finally coming to the conclusion that this book is really quite worthless.For example, one of the main selling points for me was that Torque was covered - and even included on the CD. But when I got to Chapter 6, where Torque is discussed (all three paragraphs of it), it's such a &quot;high-level&quot; overview, that I'm no better off than when I started. Here's a quote from the book: &quot;After you've set up the XML file [the code preceeds this quote] and a property file [no code, no explination - what property file?] that tells Torque which database and connection pooling scheme to use, you use Ant [how?] to have Torque automatically use both the SQL files [which SQL files?] to create the database and the Java files to map classes to tables.&quot; p102.

For what its worth, when I'm learning something new - upfront - I need to take baby steps - confidence builds and learning is accelerated on and up. Chapter 3 dives directly into a \\"hello world\\" application without one single word in the entire book devoted to \\"Here is what you need to follow along boys and girls...\\" Not one line of \\"before we begin, do this and do that.\\" So if your looking for a good text on \\"guessing with struts\\" look no more.

At that time there were no books available for the budding Struts developer, &quot;Read The Fine Manual&quot; was not an option ... you read the website, you read the code or you asked questions on the mailing list. This situation finally changed this fall with the release of a flurry of titles dedicated to Struts. I present here my thoughts on one of the latest: &quot;Struts Kick Start&quot;.What is Struts?Struts is a framework for developing web applications. It is a distilation of the current set of known best practices into a working code set that can be extended to meet almost any web application requirements. It part of the Jakarta Project at the Apache Software Foundation.What do I know about Struts?I have been developing web applications, using Java, for four years and using struts for over a year, and am a regular participant on the Struts mailing list. I was also a technical reviewer for one of the other Struts Books released this fall and was recently invited to speak at the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire on the use of Struts.What's good about this book?There are many excellent things that I could point to. I particularly like the obvious depth of research that accompanies this book. There is a very interesting history of the development of the MVC design pattern and they even name the inventor. Do you know who invented MVC? If you want to know, buy the book!The chapters cover everything that you will need to know, in the order you are most likely to need to know it. There's even a chapter explaining the &quot;struts-config.xml&quot; file's DTD! (You may want to skip that on the first few readings :-)There is good coverage of the Struts taglibs. I see a lot of questions about these on the mailing lists, so this information is very timely and it looks very well explained.I like the coverage of other open source tools that work well with Struts. This is an important point because Struts does not do everything for you (by design), so there will be areas that will benefit from other tools. I'm looking forward to trying out some of their recommendations and easing my own Struts development lifecycles.What's not so good?Just one niggle, and it's more of a programming style issue, but in their example code they have references to their business objects. They explain that it is important to separate out business logic from action logic, which it is, but then proceed to use their business object within the action.Now, I realise that example code is not the same thing as robust, production-ready code, but when people are first learning a language or framework, they tend to copy exactly what they see in the book they are learning from. Even though example code should be light on error checking (for reasons of readabilty), it should be heavy on correctness and good style.Should you rush out and buy it?If you are about to use Struts on a project, are new to Struts and need dead tree documentation for those RTFM moments or are evaluating Struts for future projects, then you absolutely need this book.If you are an intermediate Struts user, then this book would still be very useful to you and I can certainly recommend it.If you are an experienced Struts user, then you've almost certainly exchanged emails with James or Kevin, on the Struts mailing list, so you can make your own mind up!"},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking to get a practical, working knowledge of Struts in a short amount of time. It also gives clear advise and recommendations on design issues and technology choices not only for using Struts and JSPs, but also on integrating with back-end databases, Enterprise Java Beans systems, and Web Services systems.The book develops a practical Struts application, including database integration, that walks through all the real world development stages from design to deployment, highlighting best practices and key issues at each step. While doing all this, the book is brief and to the point. This keeps it fast moving and interesting while providing a useful working knowledge of Struts. The authors provide clear recommendations on manyissues. Design or technology options that exist at various points are highlighted and the trade-offs identified, but the authors do not get bogged down in technical digressions at these points, but rather state their recommendation with their reasons and then refers to other resources for the reader who wishes to delve into the issues further.In addition to the basic Struts application, the conceptual background is clearly laid out and chapters on the details for all the Struts tags are provided. Another highlight of the book are the chapters on advanced topics of integrating Struts with Enterprise Java Beans and with Web Services. In a brief amount of space, these chapters walk through all the steps to set up and run an example application that can serve as a model for real world development. Again, all the key design and technology decisions are highlighted and explained.A big plus with this book is that all the example applications and the technology products needed to set them up and run them are included on the CD that comes with the book, so you can be sure you are working with the exact same software and setup that is documented in the book."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"The Struts framework is becoming a de-facto standard for developing interactive web applications using servlets. If this type of development is something you are responsible for, you should consider getting a copy of this book to help you take the next step in your professional development. The \\"kickstart\\" concept means that the authors don't spend a lot of time on fluff or auxilllary material. You are quickly exposed to the core concepts along with a large number of examples to illustrate those technical points.There are a number of assumptions made in this book. The web server used for examples is the Jakarta Tomcat server. If you're using that platform for your development, you'll be very comfortable with the book. The authors also assume a prerequisite knowledge of JSP, as well as the use of MySQL for writing applications that access data from relational databases. From a cost perspective, this is all good in that you can set up your test environment for free. On the other hand, if you use other packages such as IBM's Websphere Application Server and DB2, you'll have to make the adjustments on your own.The book is very comprehensive in what it covers, and there is an abundance of code to help you see working examples that you can use for your own purposes. Since I'm not as \\"up to speed\\" on servlet technology as I'd like to be, I'd prefer a somewhat slower style for learning. But that's not a knock on the book as much as my own personal preference.ConclusionIf you're comfortable with web applications, deployment, and servlet coding, this will be a good choice for getting started with Struts. If you're still relatively new to all this, you may want to get a book that doesn't assume quite so much to start with. Once you get familiar with Struts, this would be a good companion book for examples."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"When I am writing this review, the price of a used copy starts from 56 cents. You can imagine what quality you can expect from a book whose owner is so eagerly willing to part with it.I did read this book and here is what I have to say. In short, do not buy this book or even read it. It's a waste of time.I can't believe Craig McClanahan recommended this book. How much did Sams pay him to say that?"},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"This book fills a major gap in the Struts literature: it shows you how to solve real-world problems using Struts. If you want to learn the details of how Struts works, you need a different book. However, if you're sick of wasting an hour every time you need to figure out how to use an html tag you've never used before, this is the book for you.I'm learning Struts so I can use it to write a commercial application. I didn't buy this book until I had finished the first two modules of my app, and I really regret it. I remember wasting 3 hours one day figuring out how to use &lt;html:select&gt; in conjunction with &lt;html:optionsCollection&gt; to render a lookup table from my database. I'm pretty handy with Google, but the fact is, there's not a lot of solid information out there about how to use the Struts tag libraries. This book contains the exact code I needed - I could have copied it into my JSP and been on my way in less than a minute.It's obvious to me that Turner and Bedell struggled through Struts the way I did, and decided to write a book with all the answers once they figured the answers out. They did a fantastic job. They cover all the aggravating details you're going to face writing real apps, and they explain the solutions clearly and accurately.Bottom line: After reading the three major Struts books, I can tell you that none of the books alone will get you where you need to go. I recommend &quot;Programming Jakarta Struts&quot; for learning Struts theory, and this book for learning how to get real work done."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"Problems started from chapter 6, beginning was simple, easy, as beginning of any other JSP book. Author decided to make a nice example of struts application, the \\"stock tracker\\" application. I was so happy to see a good example, since other books lack complex examples. This example was realistic every-day type of applications we see on the web (banking or paying bills, rental). It also deals with retrieving XML data from the disk, and I find this also an often case in the real world applications. So the example had all chances to be good, and therefore book seemed to be oriented to people who really want to do some progress in JSP (and struts) development and to do some serious applications, not hello world in 21 ways (\\"hello from jsp\\", \\"hello from DB\\", \\"hello from servlet\\", \\"hello from preprocessor\\", \\"hello form plug-in\\"). So his example was promising to provide some logic, state machines, db access and synchronization, that \\"hello in 21 ways\\" approach lacks.Also some use cases were mentioned and at that moment the book had all chances to be really serious one. Real life example, use cases, db, xml, regular expressions. In only he touched xalan and xerces it would be state of art idea for the book. Wow!However, all fails down, since author just mentions these technologies, but never goes down to the details, possible problems, drawbacks and finally leaving you on your own to learn them.Use cases without UML diagrams. He does not mention any other UML diagram. If the decided to go into use cases, the he should have done it as it is done in real life, use a tool to draw them and go thru activity diagram, state diagram, class diagrams, component and deployment diagram, etc. I got impression like he tells a reader: \\"Hey, there is something called Use cases, learn them alone\\".Again, he needed a db backend, he used MySQL and provides SQL schema which is good enough to copy paste to my SQL command editor and to get tables ready. To access db from servlets he used Torque tool to generate java source code for accessing/updating records for tables he designed. But again same mistake follows - doesn't go any further than saying \\"It's worth taking a moment to see how Torque works\\" - and that's all he says about Torque! Ant is needed to run Torque. No even a sentence about how to launch Ant on Torque to generate java code for your own tables of your own application, which I believe, it is to expect from a reader to do. Well, perhaps he thought you will use provided java source on the CD and not build your own code. But what if a reader wants to do his table?So now I got nothing out of that nice example. After several days trying to rearrange sources and put them into a project for JBuilder, WebSphere, Eclipse, somehow I got that code compiling and working, and then run into various problems regarding exceptions about locating property files, unable to connect Torque classes to MySQL, etc. I think that author should have provided several project files for several tools to help a reader to launch and start any of the provided examples, or at least, to provide Ant build files for some free application server.Finally, the general problem in the book is that author does not go into the depths of any technology that he uses, leaving a reader in troubleshooting alone. He has no serious attitude nor is willing to take a reader by hand and show him/here nuts and bolts, problems and highlights of Struts. Everything is kept on an introduction and shallow level. Book was meant to impress with its example, which is left in \\"wireframes\\", unknown UML term for me. My favourite sentence from the book: \\"The Action can be very simple or very complicated.\\"I give 2 stars because I liked the example. For someone of my experience (6 years in java) I would recommend some cookbook rather than this one, my greetings goes to Struts books: Struts Survival Guide, Struts in Action, Professional Jakarta Struts, in exact order. There are nice tutorials by Borland and IBM about struts and JSPs."},{"Title":"Struts Kick Start","review":"First, this book was published in 2002, which means it was written in 2001. Rather out of date.I have three very major complaints.1. The author, like almost all Struts book authors, starts right off the bat giving examples of JSP files that include Struts tags...a topic that is not covered until many chapters later! So the beginner (me) is left scratching his head wondering what all this gibberish is about. How much easier it would have been to provide the early examples in HTML and then later show them using tags AFTER tags have been introduced and discussed.2. There are l-o-n-g sections of nothing but HTML/JSP code with almost no commenting. Do ANY publishers get it that they don't need to print EXACT code listings? The printed page could have arrows and circles and bold print highlighting codes snipets and discussing what they do. This book leaves it up to the reader to find the important nuggets in hundreds of lines of code.3. Certain sections are so terse as to be meaningless, and even go so far as to tell the reader to look at the Struts documentation and then you'll understand it all. HELLO?? That's why I bought the &%$#!! book.On the plus side, the font is nice, there is plenty of white space and it is easy on the eyes.Skip this one. This is my 5th Struts book and I'm STILL looking for a good one. I think a good rule is that if a book is written by an open-source code author, avoid it like the plague. Coders are NOT writers. Unfortunately, the editors don't seem to be writers either. Maybe that job was outsourced..."},{"Title":"Alexander's Bridge","review":"This was Willa Cather's first novel, and, while showing glimpses of her later talent, is mostly disappointing. The metaphor of the bridge--the conduit to both the past and the future--figures prominently in this story of a Boston architect torn between his ongoing \\"mid-life\\" crisis and his energetic, passion-filled past.The story contains some heavy-handed symbolism (e.g., the bridge), melodramatic action (\\"With one [hand] he threw down the window and with the other--still standing behind her--he drew her back against him), and awkward phrasing: \\"'He was simply the most tremendous response to stimuli I have ever known.'\\"Still, the story moves along well, and there is an interesting Henry James-like contrast of Europe and America. The beginning nicely portrays the Boston upper class, and the dramatic conclusion includes passages of great strength and imagination. It is in this last chapter, especially, that her skills are most evident. Willa Cather is the Pulitzer Prize winning author of \\"O Pioneers!\\" \\"My Antonia,\\" and other great works. Definitely recommended for those with an interest in her work."},{"Title":"Alexander's Bridge","review":"Light on plot, heavy on symbolism, and a little predictable, Cather's first novel (a novella, actually) still contains moments of brilliance, especially in its strong characterizations and occasional flashes of wit. The story concerns a Boston architect who is contendedly married but suddenly embarks on an affair in London with an old flame from his youth. He soon becomes tormented over his double life but finds himself unable to resolve his conflicted feelings. Heavily indebted to the Gilded Age novelists, \\"Alexander's Bridge\\" reads like a typical first novel from a writer who shows a lot of promise.Later in life, Cather wrote an essay entitled \\"My First Novels (There Were Two),\\" as close to an apology for a first novel as most writers ever make. She admitted that most of the \\"younger writers\\" in her peer group followed the manner of Henry James and Edith Wharton, \\"without having their qualifications\\"; she \\"thought a book should be made out of 'interesting material.'\\" Only while writing her next novel, \\"O Pioneers!,\\" did she realize that \\"taking a ride through a familiar country\\"--the rural Nebraska of her youth--was \\"a much more absorbing process.\\" Nevertheless, \\"Alexander's Bridge\\" hints at the virtuoso novelist she was later to become, and it's certainly better than many writers achieve in an entire lifetime."},{"Title":"Alexander's Bridge","review":"Alexanders Bridge is the first novel by Willa Cather and it is surprisingly strong for a first novel. The bridge metaphor obviousily plays a major role in the novel and is used for good effect and the dynamics of Alexanders relationships between his wife and with his first love who on reuniting becomes his mistress. His turmoil is well described and his final decision no surprise. At times the symbolism is too much and Cather uses it to dominate the story instead of supplementing it .This is still quite good and shows her genius which became more apparent in later works"},{"Title":"Alexander's Bridge","review":"Willa Cather's first novel, it concerns the life of engineer Bartley Alexander, the bridge he's building across the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, and the triangular relationship he has with his wife and mistress. The bridge becomes a symbol for his failures: the great bridge he's building collapses (causing his death) at the same time his affair with Hilda collapses. Cather had only published short stories before this, and was reluctant (though resigned) to writing a novel. It's a short work, and Cather herself thought it was shallow and trite (she almost disowned it). Her next work, O PIONEERS, would be much better."},{"Title":"Alexander's Bridge","review":"I had just read Death Comes to the Archbishop, by Willa Cather and loved it. I found it truly fair and a beautiful view of New Mexico in its earliest days and how influential the Catholic faith was to the whole region. I am not Catholic (would you believe Mormon?), but I gained great respect and love for those devoted servants of the Lord who went out to settle western America and build in them a Christian faith.Soooooo, I read the inside cover and found other books by Willa Cather. I knew many of them, but wanted to read one I did not know. Imagine my disappointment to find it just another book about an illicit affair! Yep, I am a prude and admit it, but I felt she was so capable of better themes...in fact, I know she is! Hence only 2 stars. No, I didn't \\"hate it\\", but I was surely disappointed!"},{"Title":"Alexander's Bridge","review":"Trying out a new author... Short stories are fun and easy reading on a hot summer day.. It was free so made it even better... probably would read other books by this author"},{"Title":"Alexander's Bridge","review":"It is a story of an affair between an actress and a married bridge architect. They used to be an item way back when, but since then their ways separated and he married another woman, the wholesome, angelic type - the kind you might see portrayed in pastel colors on tin biscuit boxes of British export alongside an inspirational Keats quote.Alexander the successful architect is suffering from an early mid life crisis, feels bogged down in a perfect, but uneventful marriage, and yearns to feel young again. Just like Alexander's marriage, this book is oppressively uneventful. The description of the affair is wholesome and insinuated. The scant plot, though spanning two continents and three countries, is nonetheless slow pacing. Watch out, though, for the abrupt, perplexing turn of events toward the end.The writing style is eloquent and the paragraphs flow well and are carefully structured, but the narrative is dull (except that peculiar, incongruous turn near the end) as are the characters. I see no compelling reason to read this burdensome, fatiguing novel, unless you happened to enjoy that famous Edith Wharton account of 19th century WASPy New York society, in which case this might be your cup of tea."},{"Title":"Alexander's Bridge","review":"This is an amazing story about a successful engineer and his simultaneous romantic relationships with two brilliant and capable women. Originally published in 1912, it must have been scandalous, creating sympathetic portrayals of each of the three main characters: Bartley Alexander, a leading bridge building engineer; Winifried Alexander, his intelligent, enabling, supportive, and capable wife; and Hilda Burgoyne, Alexander's mistress, a talented and spirited British stage actress.This is not a perfect book. And in the preface written by Willa Cather in 1922, ten years after it's original publication, it seems Cather almost apologizes for some of the choices she made in telling her original story - conceding it was not truly a story she understood from personal history, but rather a young writer's attempt to tell a story similar to the stories told by authors she admired.It is not a long novel, so I was able to read it for the first time over the last few weeks. I enjoyed it very much.The title \\"Alexander's Bridge\\" refers to several primary metaphors, including:a) The story is about Alexander's attempt to bridge his life between two great loves, the two amazing and unique women in his life.b) \\"Alexander's Bridge\\" is also a metaphor for the institution of marriage, a \\"singular span\\" that is capable of bearing conventional loads, but that may not be the safest or most facilitative structure to handle the demands of some modern expanses, loads, and conditions.c) And \\"Alexander's Bridge\\" refers to the Alexander's repeated and unavoidable attempts to bridge his current life and responsibilities with the passions, memories, and goals of his youth.Alexander, for many good reasons, not only loves Hilda (his current mistress and first love), but maybe as importantly he also loves the person he was in his youth when he was around her chemistry and environments. And he regularly struggles with his present life, where his marriage, career, and all the related societal and work obligations have taken over almost all his time and concerns. Throughout the story, he is consciously, and unconsciously in his sleeping dreams, struggling with the relentless memories of the past.While I love the insight and universal perspectives in this book, unfortunately, my two least favorite sentences are the last sentence of Chapter X, and the last sentence of the Epilogue. It appears Cather was torn with what summarily should be said about Alexander's choices, because the Epilogue is in notorious conflict with the last sentence of Chapter X.The whole book is an intelligent exploration of morality, ethics, and dualities - it seems unnecessarily disarmed with such an overriding negative spin as is suggested in the final sentence of Chapter X. I understand Cather must have been under a great deal of social pressure in 1912 to identify Alexander's behaviors as destructive, but almost the entire rest of the book is one big long wink to savvy readers that she was under pressure to put such a pat moral perspective on the totality of his actions.In later books, like My &Aacute;ntonia, Cather created a male narrator that does not identify his undying loves as destructive. My &Aacute;ntonia, as a book, is one man taking the time to recollect and share his fond memories of one of his first love's (&Aacute;ntonia). A beautiful aspect of My &Aacute;ntonia is a concession by the narrator that his love for &Aacute;ntonia never died, even though she married and lived a life separate from him.Alexander's Bridge, in almost every other part of the book, suggests that Alexander was not intent on being self-destructive; but rather, he had excellent reasons for loving both women and for pursuing so many hard to achieve simultaneous business goals. Both women are drawn lovingly (as Cather is so capable of doing).Cather was brilliant. Notice that Alexander does not die because his bridge crushes him, or because its weight and undertow drown him. He does not die of hubris. He does not die because he is arrogant and ignores the engineering data. As soon as he receives data suggesting the one bridge cannot meet all the demands placed on it, he immediately changes directions and makes best efforts to get everyone off the bridge. He does not die because he is not self-sufficient or because he is unable to swim. He dies because fearful people around him panic, and they pull him under the water as they drown.The book is an exploration of this important question: Is it possible for good and moral people to have a healthy extra-marital affair? And in 1912, seriously and carefully examining that question in a mainstream and literate novel had to be controversial. The book suggests that when people are faced with more than one great love, whether or not they choose to pursue only one of those loves (and therefore exclude the other), the conflicts inherent in those decisions continue the rest of their life, regardless of whether they choose to love only one or both.I recommend people read this book to read the internal dialogues of all the main characters. The book challenges common presumptions, and it questions its own presumptions. Buy a version that includes Cather's 1922 preface.When Alexander sees that one bridge (one relationship) will not safely support the load, he is not a fool. He doesn't stand idly and sink with the ship (the bridge). He makes best efforts to save himself and as many others as possible by letting them know that his one bridge will no longer keep them safe. And he personally goes back out onto the unsafe bridge and tries to save as many of the other men as possible.The book is not simply a critique of the traditional love relationship formula. Rather, it is more intent on being illustrative of circumstances that might merit something other than simple Victorian guilt as a response to non-singular love relationships. It compassionately shows how one man had separate and distinctly beautiful relationships with two unbelievably good women. It shows how the social constructs of that era led good men and women to live with self-inflicted and sometimes crushing guilt. Each character loves deeply and genuinely. But in that era, they were forced to choose only one.

This novel is too short, too abrupt, and too lacking in the details needed to pull off decent character motivation, somethng I find vital to novels dealing with infidelity and love.The scenes read as disjuncted and they do not develop very well.

I haven't got a thesaurus handy, but the point is when it was all over I certainly wasn't sorry. I was left with almost no emotional feeling of invlovement with any of the characters. Whether this was due to the fact that I wasn't sure which characters were real, imagined, duplicitous or even multiplicitous, I can't be sure. Just as I can't be sure if this was ever intended to exist as an elaborate thought exercise or a brief history of physics with a sprinkle of philosophy and music as garnish, or was the author actually trying to write a novel. I was trying to read a novel, but I'm not sure if I did.

The message's originator, \\"H\\", puts him in mind of a past love. As the memories emerge, John finds himself caught up in a bizarre concept.

He is also a captivating and imaginative writer, versed in history, philosophy and human motivations. It is sometimes difficult to track how many universes might compose this story. Two is more than enough, but Crumey takes us through them with skill and finesse. We meet Erwin Schroedinger, heading for an assignation at an asylum.

Crumey's writing fits no pigeonholes - his style and careful plotting and characterisation prevent such narrowness. Although it jumps between Harry's and John's world, as it must, it builds the backgrounds of those worlds seamlessly. Through it all, Crumey carefully explains how such conditions are found in quantum physics. It's not a classroom lecture, but a well-developed set of plausible scenarios. All the while, the author's keen sense of irony and humour helps make this book a flawless page-turner.It's difficult to know if we are to suspend belief in reading this book - fantastic as it may seem at the beginning. Crumey's careful explanations of two alternative(s), even opposite, things occuring simultaneously makes the entire book acceptable. After all, there are many anomalous events reported in our world.

It is true that the book starts off with a seemingly easy-to-understand concept: a Physics professor is led by a phone message to believe that he's being contacted by a former lover. It gets more chaotic from there. Readers are confronted with several interwoven stories, which tell the tales of various German geniuses and madmen, ranging from Schumann to Schrodinger, all connected by a number of uncanny 'coincidences'. As the novel unravels (or ravels?, readers are confronted with ideas of what is reality as Crumey asks difficult questions such as this without necessarily providing answers. I read this novel during the summer, and even now, words such as \\"strange\\", \\"unique\\", \\"supernatural\\", \\"heavy\\" still pop into my head whenever I think of it. I was most impressed by the author's attempt to make connections between so many concepts presented in the book, ranging from musical to literary to scientific.

But I was greatly dissapointed. Not one of these stories was even worth finishing. To give you an idea, this book is short that each of the stories is 65 pages or less. Even for a novella, that's still really short. I doubt that there's an author out there who can make a satisfying romance in less than 100 pages (I dare someone to prove me wrong!)A MIDSUMMER DAY'S DREAM offered just what you'd expect from Linda Lael Miller: a story that had nothing going for it but raging hormones. This is why I no longer read her books. Every single one of her stories reads the same: hero meets heroine, they start humping. Seriously. That's the whole plot. They have nothing between them but instant lust, and nothing holding them together but amazing sex by the end of the story.LOVERS OF THE GOLDEN DRUM had a more promising start. I liked the idea of a legend that turns out to be real. According to the author's note, the legend itself actually exists, so it's up to the reader to decide if there's any truth in it or not. The problem was that she links past to the present by have a woman in modern times dreaming the events of the legend that occured in the past. I found that the modern storyline just detracted from the historical one. I think this would have made a better historical romance (with the whole present-day tie-in just left out), because the two storylines just didn't mesh together well. I never felt that the modern-day stuff worked.OUT OF TIME was fairly well written, except for the romance aspect of it, which was very rushed and weak. Of course, maybe that's to be expected of a story that's less than 70 pages, but still, it was a let-down. The author does a good job with the time-travel aspect of the story, and her historical backdrop is fairly well written, so I would like to see what she'd do when not restricted to so few pages. I think she would have the talent to write a good historical or paranormal romance if she's given the space to do it. Unfortunately, this novella isn't worth the time it takes to read it.ECHOES OF LOVE was written much like LOVERS OF THE GOLDEN DRUM was. The premise is that the heroine is actually the reincarnation of her great-grandmother (though she doesn't know it), who is looking for a second chance at true love in her next life. Interesting concept. The only problem is that the author decides to tell both the past story and the present story. In 60 pages, there's barely enough room for one love story, let alone two. As a result, both stories suffered greatly, and neither one was properly developed.I think that this anthology was nothing more than a money-grab by the publisher. These authors should have been given the room they needed to work. Because they were so compressed, the stories all came across weak, and the romance contrived. I've read better anthologies in my time. Don't waste your time on this."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"another great story that I enjoyed, and really liked that other authers as well. Can't wait to read more from them all."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"Time travel romance is not a genre that I generally enjoy reading, so this collection really took me by surprise. Each story was incredibly well-developed in only 60 pages or so, but it's the settings and the interesting way they were presented that made this book shine! The first two stories are particularly strong in this collection, and the other two are fun too!In A Midsummer's Day Dream by Linda Lael Miller, California vintage jewelry shop owner Francesca attends a Medieval Festival near London. After an encounter with Merlin in a costume shop, she slips into the 1300's. She is mistaken by the locals for a witch, and comes under the protection of an infamous duke who thinks she's a prostitute. He is destined to die in a jousting match, and Francesca must find a way to use her groing love for him to change his fate.Lovers of the Golden Drum by Diana Bane vasillates between present day and events that occurred in Scotland centuries ago. A newspaper story about a Golden Drum that saved the life of a boy triggers a series of very realistic but haunting dreams for Maggie about a Scottish Boy named Douglas and the girl Margaret who loved him. She travels to the Outer Banks of North Carolina in the middle of winter to resolve and put to rest these dreams. She meets an interesting bookshop owner, and a mysterious older man, as she tries to uncover facts about the legend of the drum and the boy it saved, and determine why the story haunts her dreams. The Outer Banks is an area that's always intrigued me, perhaps from reading so many Nicholas Sparks novels, and I really liked the way the time travel element was presented in this story, though dreams, making it more realistic than when it just magically occurs.Out of Time by Anna Jennet is about a woman who falls off a cliff after being chased by attackers while on vacation in Cornwall. Instead of crashing onto the rocks below, she remains suspended in time for a bit before falling through the fog and into the sea. She is rescued by a knight, and finds herself in the 12th century. I was particularly humored by the repulsion of the dirty conditions there, especially the unbathed people.In Echoes of Love by Elaine Crawford, a workaholic New Yorker is a few weeks away from her wedding to a rather dull, money-hungry man when she discovers that she's inherited her great-aunt's ranch in California. Her fiance and her parents wish her to parcel up the land and sell it, but she falls in love with the peacefulness of the place. When her great-aunt's story is revealed through dreams and a journal, Brenn starts reliving a modern-day version of the events."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"Back cover reads:Secrets written in stardust...Promises whispered on the wind...Some lovers were meant to find each other--across eternity...TIMELESSNew York Times bestselling authorLinda Lael Miller takes a vintage dress-shop owner on a breathtaking adventure in medieval England-where a bewitching love awaits...Diana Bane unlocks the secret love behind Maggie's taunting dreams of a clan war from centuries past...Anna Jennet takes a plunge into the sea from the cliffs of Cornwall--and falls back in time, into the arms of a heroic knight...Elaine Crawford finds time is of the essence when an engaged workaholic inherits a California ranch--a place she's seen somewhere before..."},{"Title":"Dialogue for the Left and Right Hand","review":"This is a memorable collection of poetry. Although the works included vary in subject matter and theme, the common thread is Cramer's simple and eloquent writing from his own experience as a forty-something American male at the end of the twentieth century.One theme that recurs throughout the collection is the awareness of mortality, both our own and that of all life, that most of us develop as we reach middle age. The poems reflect an unyielding sadness in the face of the inevitability of illness and death; at the same time, they demonstrate an existential resignation to mortality as a necessary condition to human existence. Thus, in responding to the medical news of a friend, Cramer writes &quot;All I did was hold on and say nothing,/Because the answer is there is no answer&quot;.I find the most moving poems in the collection to be those in which Cramer deals with the loss of his parents. Both &quot;December 9, 1993&quot; and &quot;Villanelle After a Burial&quot; are deeply touching pieces. The latter in particular is noteworthy, as it represents a hauntingly beautiful use of a traditional poetic form by a poet who usually writes unbound by traditional formalism.There is of course much, much more to this collection of poetry than this brief review can convey. Cramer has a gift for giving unique and memorable expression to experiences and emotions common to many of his peers. Many of us will recognize our own lives in his verse."},{"Title":"The child in the church","review":"If you are lover of Montessori and want to know the history of the development of the material, then this is the book for you.

The problem is they print the key on the ceram wrap, so when you tear it off when opening the package, it's easy to lose. Especially as was my case, where I got married and ended up moving out of my parent's house.Now that I'm taking Spanish II (necessary to graduate as a writing major), my Quia key is lost to me, and there is no way to get it back lest I buy another one. Which I imagine is probably close to the full price of the book, this inhibits me from doing my work and getting a good grade in my spanish class, as I don't have another student loan sitting around to pay for this thing.To exasperate matters, accounts must not survive a year of inactivity. As a person with a computer science minor and a taste for code, this is a fool-hardy programmatic notion on behalf of the designers, considering most of their books are probably sold to students. Or worse, perhaps it's an insidious, evil notion contrived to leach every possible penny from poor college students.If you do decide to buy this book, hide the key in a piece of ceram wrap and staple it to the inside of your lip if you intend on taking another course--lest you suffer my travails."},{"Title":"Workbook/Lab Manual for Asi es, 4th","review":"Sorry to say, this book is not for a beginner.

(That destination helped them feel more 'at home' than adjusting to a new life as flatlanders.) Portia Sperry loved the rolling countryside. She and co-author Lois Donaldson researched the long-ago times seriously and drew an honest picture of life in the 1830s. Zabeth Selover's colorful illustrations in the original edition have an unusual folk charm, enhancing the story. The authors include an Indian tale, the requisite encounter with a bear, and square dancing at a housewarming - - with \\"Abigail\\" being the most important ingredient to this mix.I'd like to think there may be a future author who recalls the times around 2005 and builds a story around another young girl. Gwenyth Swain, who grew up in Brown County's Wallow Hollow, wrote about \\"CHIG\\" (isbn: 0440419204) & the Depression years in Brown county which was the era when the Sperry family struggled and \\"invented\\" Abigail to help with their survival.It is disappointing to not read any review from the author's family, or reviews by the many who listened to the story of the sweet little doll & then begged to have their own! The reason may be that the reviews written for the 1938 edition of \\"Abigail\\" were not transferred with the 2000 edition published by the Indiana Historical Society. \\"Abigail\\" IS STILL AVAILABLE IN ITS INDIANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY edition.Portia Sperry is remembered with admiration & affection in Nashville and Brown County. Reviewer mcHAIKU recalls many happy times with Emily Sperry Eads (that's her poem in chapter #16)!

It is great for anyone wanting to add special touches and effects to their home.The book starts out overview of materials including color photos of all the tools you will need. There is also guide to mixing paints and a great chart on various materials for painting. There are many wonderful effects that can be achieved by adding your own pigments or otherwise modifying standard off the shelf paints. Numerous techniques follow including colorwashing, dry brushing, rubbing off, sponging, graining, aging, stippling, combing, stucco, embossing, stenciling, stamping and creating a few stone finishes. There are also instructions for painting on glass and using masks or resists such as wax.Over 25 projects are included for walls, floors, windows, furniture and accessories as well. Some projects include striped Greek vases, checkerboard wall, slot-machine counter front, and colorwashed flowers, daisy-strewn floorboards, cork-tile games floor, and a mosaic border. My favorite projects were the whimsical window frame, fossil tabletop and a beautiful Japanese style fabric screen. There are also some great design motifs such as shells, artichokes, and boats. Conveniently, small templates, which you can enlarge, are included for all the projects.Most of the projects use latex or acrylic paint, only a few use oils. Step-by-step directions are given for each of these techniques or projects. Close-up photos show each technique in a few different colors and recipes are given for each one. Some of the effects and projects have pictures of finished rooms or objects done with them.Almost all of the techniques here, and more, are also covered in Chronicle's companion book, Paint Recipes.

Pigs can carry some deadly diseases, and male circumcision prevents certain cancers & is ideally done on the 8th day. He concluded that behind such medical advice must be God's direct wisdom. Thus he pitched his book into the apologetics arena.While some regulations, such as quarantine & hand washing, overlap with medical wisdom, I doubt that their rationale was primarily medical. Eg, pigs can be safe enough if cooked well, while some foods on the OK list can be unsafe enough (cf. Gordon Wenham, The Book Of Leviticus (Eerdmans), 1985:167f.). More to the point, the NT removed the regulations. Should we conclude it lacked God's wisdom?

The topic isn't that difficult, but the samples just don't demonstrate the ideas very well.The typos etc are acceptable, but when it appears that the authors know less about programming than the reader, then it creates a really bad impression for Microsoft Press.I'm sorry I didn't rather wait for Amit Kalani's book instead."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"This books structure makes it very easy to get a chapter a night done and prepare you for the exam.

This book is not a good introduction to creating applications for Windows for a couple of reasons. First, much of the information in this book is badly out of context. For example, the first lab in Chapter 9 gives complete, detailed instructions on how to create a project in Microsoft Visual Studio. This lab would have been more useful as the first lab in the first chapter (obviously). In addition, many security related items are brought up in early chapters, but discussion of them is deferred to Chapter 11. Second, the book assumes familiarity with Windows concepts or products without explanation (which, in a \\"Foundation\\" book, I believe it shouldn't do). A discussion on remote components assumes a familiarity with IIS. I have finished chapters on Application Domains and Services and Installing and Configuring Applications and I still don't have a good idea of what a .dll file is, or how to actually create a componentized application.That said, the book is not a total loss, it just requires considerable effort on the part of a novice to understand the information."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"Actually I am editing my oppinion after reading this book almost three times now ...

The book itself barely gets you going for the material you'll need to know. I admit that the 302 test questions were helpful, though. When you start taking some of those sample tests, you'll realize how quickly the book material was lacking. The Transcender really helped cover a lot of other ground that this book didn't. Oddly enough, the test still pulled some punches on material that was covered in neither, unless you plan to go very deep on every topic which is next to impossible.This book might be the only reasonable paper resource out there, especially with the test questions, so just be forewarned....be careful...and you'll have to study deeper than you might expect in various areas."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"I used this book to pass the exam.

Tony Northrup writes well and covers the material with minimal errors--he gets 5 stars. Shawn Wildermuth writes decently, has more errors and doesn't cover material in great depth--3 stars.

I found, like some other reviewers, that when I saw a typo I could see what it was supposed to be. And having to think about what the typo really meant forced me to concentrate more on that sentence. How's that for looking on the bright side.Realistically, let's hope that a second edition comes out fairly soon that basically contains the same information but is better edited.Conclusion: here is everything you need to know in one book.

OTOH just following the test related table of contents (70-536), reading the help and trying everything yourself + purchase of practice tests would most likely be better (something you'll have to do in any case since the book does have quite a few white holes AND you can't rely on the answers provided by the practice tests)."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"It's a gr8 product, the only setback was that Microsoft has just one book for VB as well as C# coders, so half of the book is useless for me"},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"ofcourse this book is not for newbie level it is for people whom they want to pass the exam, i read manybook before this book and cover in depth the .NET foundation but the topics are not organized in a way to be memorized for the exam, this book is simple to memorize the questions for the exam"},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"The book is too long, with irelevent information for the reader. The book covers all samples in both Visual Basic and C Sharp, making the volume twice the size (and probably price). However, the exam lets you pick one language. Why spend time covering the differences between VB and C#?The authors completely ignore C++. This is a valid language choice for exam 70-536. (Look at the microsoft website, under 70-536). So if you are a C++ developer, you need to reintepret the C# samples. However the authors have no problem giving every example in both VB and C# to make their book bigger.I gave this book two stars instead of one. This is only because of the 90 day 2005 Professional edition, and the Exam discount.The discount runs all the way to 2010.After reading their book I am considering writing my own.

This was no exception. It did provide a fairly detailed overview of security (over 150 pages in total).Since I used this book to study for the exam I (extensively) used the practice cd that comes with the book to test myself as I read (and re-read) chapters.As others have mentioned there are several typos in the book and exams. There are several questions which are frustratingly ambiguous and there are (at least) two answers which are absolutely incorrect. The editor needs a performance review...I thought that these questions would appear in the final exam and if I could memorize them then I would pass the exam. Wrong. NONE of the questions in the practice exam were in my final exam. In fact, there were questions in the final exam that weren't even covered in the book (yes, I went back and checked...). I passed the exam only because I had familiarity with the subject from my hands on experience as a developer and from (lots of) extra research on google i did away from the book.The moral: You can't use this book alone to pass the test - you must supplement everything you learn in this book with your own investigation and hands on practice. You have to know your stuff to pass the exam.

My only source was this book. By me passing I guess you can say it did the job for the task at hand. About 11 out of 16 of the chapters in the book are very easy to understand and very helpful and straightforward (minus the typos). However, some of the others, particularly those dealing with diagnostic and management configuration could use some work. My biggest issue with the book is not with how it is written, but the content. There were about 5 questions which I had no clue about and do not remember their content being directly mentioned (if at all) in the book. I am not pointing fingers at anyone, but there is a problem there with either the book's content or the access the authors had of what would be covered on the exam. All in all, I give it a 3 out 5 since I did pass. Although, I did study this book everyday, heavily, for three straight weeks. As for the practice questions, I thought they were ok as well. They helped me learn some things not covered in the book (oddly enough) and were useful to point out important points on specific topics.

Microsoft has posted the corrections for the book, but the best way to overcome the errors is to go through the practice tests and look up questions you feel you are right about. Additional reading is a must and missed questions are the best prompt to guide you to additional resources.While definitely a thick book, the content is extremely detailed. Though keep in mind that there are many ways to reach any given end or effect - the various authors programming / example styles expose the reader to a few ways to expressing the same result, which is quite beneficial.In terms of organization, this book is very good, especially considering that multiple authors were involved. The only chapter that merits additional scrutiny is the security chapter, which helps throughout the book, as security considerations are sprinkled throughout.In summary, with a moderate amount of experience with .NET (2.0+), this book is an excellent primer for the test and provides the requisite understanding of the framework to prepare one for the exam. The only caveat I found was that for people with .NET 3.0 or 3.5+ experience, some of the methods may be a slight bit different due to minor changes between 2.0 and 3.5."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"The pluses:- It covers the items in the exam and gets you basically familiar with them.- It has the practice tests CD which is very helpful.The minuses:- It doesn't cover the items in the exam enough to pass the exam.- It has many errors.- It is poorly written so that you don't always understand fully what can or can't be done with the item you are studying.- Most of the time you will need to look at MSDN or the Framework help to get the full concept of the item you are studying.- Some of the lesson test questions are out of order so you get asked about something that isn't covered until the next chapter or lesson.Overall:I'm glad I got it.

As a foundation book, instead of giving a very general description about the topic and just list the members of the realted classes, I really think that the author should spend more time explaining what is it exactly, what the developer can benefit from using it and good examples are essential.Most examples given in this book are very short and doesn't make any sense some times. We can always find the information about how to use a class, method from MSDN or other sources, but I suppose what a reader really needs are good exmaples that involve the related comcepts, classes, etc.Anyway, I will continue to read this book as it is the only book written for the exam."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"After reading this book cover to cover and taking the practice test many, many times I was able to pass the test on my first try.What really pissed me off (along with my co-workers) is the amount of errors both in the book and the practice test.

I hope they'll help calm someone's nerves, because I was a nervous wreck before my exam yesterday.First, about me:> I studied in earnest for three weeks, using only the book and accompanying practice exams until the last three days> I used Transcender during the last three days, and never scored above 60% on the full practice exam> I am relatively new to .NET (four months exp. writing production-level apps), but not new to software development (working with Java for over four years)> I passed the exam yesterday, on the first attempt, with a score of 859With that said...1. To anyone sadistic enough to take a Java cert exam (like my moronic self), the MCTS is a cakewalk. Unlike the ferocious Java exams which try to bait you into picking the wrong answers, 70-536 seems to do the exact opposite. I'll elaborate on this in point 2.2. Remember taking the SATs and being given the advice to first eliminate clearly wrong answers before analyzing the ones that might be right? Do that on this exam, and you'll immediately cut your answer choices in half on nearly every question. For the vast majority of the questions, Microsoft practically GIVES you the answer - almost like they're trying to sell you on how intuitive their framework is. These questions are multiple choice, with one answer choice being cartoonishly incorrect, another answer being kind-of-correct but clearly too convoluted, then two or more other answers that are extremely similar, except for some minor detail.3. You do not need to go into the MSDN and know every object mentioned in the book like Adam knew his wife. You should, however, be very familiar with the methods and signatures of Stream objects, Serializer objects (XMLSerializer, especially), AppDomain, and Culture/Region Info. As for the rest, just pay close attention to the methods and objects used in the book's examples.4. The Transcender exam is WAAAAAAAAAAAY HARDER than the actual 70-536.5. The MeasureUp exam that comes with the book is slightly easier than the actual 70-536.6. On my particular exam, there were no questions whose material hadn't been covered by the book. Be careful, though, because from the Transcender exams it seems the book's authors left out at whole lot about interoperability.Seriously folks, this exam isn't that bad if you're a seasoned software pro and familiar with OOP. Get a solid grasp of the stuff in the book (the labs really help), use Transcender for some details that the book misses, take the exam, and pass that sucker.Good luck!"},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"I used this book as my primary resource for the exam, backed up with a transcender for additional practice tests. I passed the exam on the first attempt. Based on that, I'll rate it as 4 stars (more like 3.5).Yes there are errors - so make sure to get the errata. Do the practice tests on the CD (several times!). I can't imagine not using this book, given that it's the only one at present. If you look at the exam topics on the MS web-site, you could spend weeks or months on MSDN chasing down the relevant information. This book brings it together in one place, and avoids you spending loads of time on irrelevant topics. I think the book covers just enough to get you through the exam - provided you know the content very well. This is not an easy exam.As for a general .NET book, the various chapters provide a useful introduction to each topic, but don't go into that much depth - just enough for the exam. Part of the issue is the exam covers a very wide range of topics, so it's difficult to go into much more depth without making the book 2,000 pages long.At the end of the day, it got me through the exam, which is ultimately what matters."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"Simply unbelievable. For those of you who have not heard, the \\"first edition\\" of this book had a ridiculous number of errors in it. In fact, I originally had a copy of it from my work, and I had to print off the errata (list of corrections and fixes) and it was OVER 60 PAGES. Yeah, it was really fun trying to read the book on one side of my desk, and having a 60+ page document on the other side trying to find all the errors and bad code examples.....so anyway, I bought the \\"second edition\\" from Amazon. While it looks like the 60+ pages of errors that were found in the \\"first edition\\" were all corrected, there ARE STILL MORE OBVIOUS ERRORS IN THE BOOK. I cannot express in words how amazing this is to me. Did ANYONE with a technical background actually proof-read this book the first time? If not, shouldn't someone have done it before printing a second edition that was made because ONLY because there were 60+ PAGES OF ERRORS in the first edition? This to me is inexcusable. And how Microsoft could put their stamp on this book is baffling.Anyway, other than the errors, the book is fine.....it just makes it hard to read this book for an exam, because can you really trust the content 100%?

It does a good job of getting across what material will be covered on the exam, but that's about it.Much of the material lacks context and is poorly written. I spent more time on the internet looking up material that was in the book in order to get an understanding of it adequate to answer the sample questions than I did in the book itself.This book, like many I've bought from Microsoft Press, has many editing errors, but I found many of the exercises, labs, and sample questions contained errors, making study for the exam very frustrating.The practice tests and lesson review application that shipped with the book is also disappointing. You can't choose, for example, which lessons or Chapters you want to practice, instead you have to choose groupings of topics that include topics scattered throughout the book and that aren't necessarily related. The menu and interface layout is difficult to use, I mention this only because I find it ironic that such a poorly thoughout app is shipped with a book essentially about application design..."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"So many errors that it has to be done in 2 partshttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/923018/en-ushttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/935218/en-usIt looks like I still have ver 1 I'm still seeing the errors listed on the Microsoft website and I just purchased the book 01DEC07.

I was waiting on Amit Kalani to come out with his highly anticipated book, but I'm starting to wonder if that will ever see the light of day.In any case, it seems that this book has had corrections made to it since the earlier reviews. I've noticed that more recent printings have a slightly darker cover and that the errata listed at Microsoft's website has been corrected in the book. I could find no mention of a 2nd printing on the inside cover or anything else to suggest a reprint. This doesn't make up for the missing content but does at least make me feel a little better in that I don't have to constantly reference the 33 printed pages of errata while reading."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"This book skims over several subjects because it's trying to cover too much material. Chapter 6 and 7 on Graphics and Threading (respectively) both suffer from this. Large fonts and long lists of methods and properties leave little room for actual knowledge sharing. The order in which they cover the subjects leaves a lot to be desired as well. Just look at the fact that chapter 6 is Graphics and chapter 7 is Threading.Anyway, the content tries to cover all that is required and probably prepares you for the test as well as possible (I haven't taken an exam yet). So, i was thinking 3 stars.But then I arrived at chapter 9 - Installing and Configuring Applications. My guess is that Mr.s Northrup and Wildermuth had around 13 or 14 chapters done and were coming down to the wire when they asked Bill Ryan if he wouldn't mind contributing a chapter or two. Then he turned in what he had and they ran spell checker on it. That must be it, because there are errors on every page! Paragraphs copied from other chapters, review questions that have nothing to do with the section just read, and a lab in section two that has nothing to do with the Installer class discussed in section 2. If you look at a code example on page 489, you'll see what I mean. Not only does the code not work, but it's faulty in it's design. He mentions that the class implements IEnumerable, and then tries to use a counter to move through the list (but fails to increment the counter). That's retarded. Since I'm still in the beginner stages of all of this, these mistakes can set me back a while when I stare and try to figure out what he's doing.Anyway, one star. The editors should go back to school somewhere. Rosemary Caperton and Sandi Resnick are pointed out specifically as proof-readers, and Jim Fuchs and David Robinson as technical editors. If I was any of them I'd ask for my name to be removed in subsequent editions."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"It seems this book was written by a team of beginners and I'm not talking about the numerous typos, but something like \\"class\\" instead of \\"object\\", \\"include\\" instead of \\"using\\" (many, many times) etc. It deserved 2 stars only for the exam voucher and for being usable after a look at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923018/en-us for a long list of errata."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"I'm afraid I have to go against the positive reviews and give this book one star.The first and biggest problem I had with this book is that it does not attempt to teach you very much about the topics on the 70-536 exam. Or, perhaps it *does* make this attempt but it fails pathetically. Instead, it scratches the surface of the topics and \\"points you in the right direction\\". I'd hoped the book would take a more rigorous pedagogical approach to discussing the exam topics. Microsoft's MSDN is better at explaining the topics than this book, in my own opinion, and this is how I will study for the exam going forward.The book is divided into chapters and each chapter has several lessons. At the end of each lesson is a set of review questions.Here are some examples of the problems I had with the first two chapters of this book (before I decided to give up on it):Chapter 2, Lesson 1 does *not* discuss the System.IO.File class nor does it mention System.IO.Directory, yet the very first question in that lesson's review is in regards to these two classes.On page 56 the authors mention overriding the Parse() method to provide a conversion from Strings. Override it? Override it from what class? It's not defined in System.Object. Probably the authors mean *provide* a Parse() method.On page 948, one of the answers to a question reads, \\"...when an abstract method inherited from System.Object is called.\\" What? System.Object does not define *any* abstract methods.There are other problems as well. Chapter 2 lists many methods on the DirectoryInfo and FileInfo classes. Sometimes the authors tell you what return types the methods have and sometimes they don't, and sometimes they are just wrong (p.92, the OpenWrite() method).I admit I only read the first two chapters of this book but I believe it's a total waste of money. I don't understand how this book can have any positive reviews. Before you buy this book you really should spend some time looking it over at a bookstore. I wish I had."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"Yes, this book does help with studying for the material, but we just took the exam from a training boot camp......if I'd only used this book plus the study questions that come with it....no way. I read the book for 8 months previous to coming at least 4-5 nights a week.....went through all the practice exam and review questions, but the exam was really a bit different. The camp I'm at was the only reason I passed....no way with the book alone can you pass...in my opinion. There were questions on the test that weren't even in the book. I just took the exam an hour ago! There's too much errata in this book. Someone printed the errata and passed it out to class, and there's about 10 pages (front and back) with misspelling and incorrect code. In addition, we found more errata as we went along.I'll use this in day to day for reference, but man...talk about trying to push something out while not even having a strong review.....all people in the class agree this book needs a new revision!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"This product didn't meet my expectations, and I found it very difficult to follow.

That reflects the fact that I did pass the exam using this as my primary reference. But in my opinion it is a pity that as far as I know it is the only book specifically geared towards the exam, because I just couldn't get enthused about it.Ok, to be fair to the authors there are certain givens when studying for an exam. I never did expect a book that prepares for an exam to be a \\"quick fix\\" for one's own lack of knowledge. A fair degree of .NET experience is an assumption before attempting it. But what bewildered me was that in places it seemed to make relatively simple concepts seem confusing, which is the last thing one would expect. And often the specific detail likely to be encountered in an exam seemed to be almost obscured rather than emphasised.If it wasn't for the fact that it does, I suppose, expose one to the requirements of the exam I wouldn't even contemplate bothering with the book. Something like the WROX C# 2008 book would win hands-down for actual content, though it does not necessarily cover the 70-536 criteria fully (but is a far superior and more in depth examination of most of the topics you'd need).A plus is that the sample test questions (unlike the ones at the end of each lesson) did seem to me to be reasonably similar in difficulty to those in the actual exam. I personally used them near the end as a way to identify weaknesses, and to some extent cram.I believe that the second edition has corrected the unbelievable morass of errata, but to me there was a bit more wrong with this book than that. It just isn't well written.To summarize, I found it difficult to rate this book. It's the book I reluctantly admit helped me pass the exam in the absence of anything else similar."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"There are heaps of mistakes in this book - it makes it so hard to learn things for an exam from!

If you have a working PC development background, this book will be straight forward and you will be on your way to the MCTS certification of your choice (Windows, Web or Enterprise). If you are an old mainframe programmer (like myself), you need to take a Visual Basic.Net or a C# course before you study this book. My warning is that there are a lot of \\"common terminology\\" that Microsoft assumes you already know...but it is not common in the mainframe world.

The errors can be corrected by going to the Microsoft web site (press). The book skims through several topics required for the exam. But, the exam focuses on in-depth information. You will find questions in the exam that is not directly provided in this book. For example, the attribute [ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)] used for specifying how the .Net class should be exposed to COM objects is not mentioned anywhere in the book, but it was asked in the exam. There are several other such examples. Also, there are several notes in the book that says that it is important for the exam. But, the exam does not cover those topics at all. In another one of the review for this book, someone had mentioned about buying Transcender. You can buy Transcender if you want to learn about the topics. But, as far as the exam goes, you may find a question or two that is anywhere similar to those in the Practice exams. For each of the topics, you need to use MSDN web site for in-depth information. And you need to cram the properties and methods. For instance, there is a question about which property to use to check whether a method is accessible to a derived class when using reflection. The correct answer is IsFamily. But, there is no way you can remember this without cramming. It is virtually impossible for every developer to have experience in every topic covered in this book.

Another thing is that this is the most error-prone book I've ever read. In a novel typos aren't critical, but in a study guide for an exam, they are indeed. So be alert and use the errata. I found out it was better to take the hours needed to correct the text, than spilling time wondering about the accuracy on stuff that looked weird to me. My advice: buy another book !"},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"I also have the newer (corrected) version of the book (check the copyright page in the beginning of the book, mine lists version: 5 6 7 8 9 QWT 1 0 9 8 7). Despite the numerous corrections, I still find some errors, even those that are unlisted in the errata list. When looking at the four KB articles on the Microsoft site, the errata list shows a gap between part 3 and 4. So I think there is something missing in the errata.For example: an error I discovered today, on page 712, the second bullet reads:\\"One or more PrincipalPermission properties. Use Authenticated to restrict access to authenticated users, Role to restrict access by group memberships, and User to restrict access to a specific user name.\\"This is incorrect, there is no 'User' PrincipalPermission property. Replace 'User' with 'Name'.It should read instead:\\"One or more PrincipalPermission properties. Use Authenticated to restrict access to authenticated users, Role to restrict access by group memberships, and Name to restrict access to a specific user name.\\"This is in particular a strange error, because on the previous page the authors says:\\"Memorize these three properties (Authenticated, Name, Role). Remember, PrincipalPermission doesn't expose any other properties--not a user's full name, phone number, password, or any other attribute.\\"For the rest of the book, I found the topics are not very well explained. Except for the chapter dealing with Code Access Security, which I found was very clear. In general, I did not like the fact that there are so few images in the book that could clarify the text. Sometimes the text alone is a litte bit boring to read.

This goes from writing style in the text itself all the way down to sample code and labs found on the accompanying CD. C'mon, for the amount of effort put into this type of manual, and the perceived 'stakes' involved in passing these tests, give us some materials that are consistent so that as learners, we aren't distracted by the inconsistencies.The exam simulation software sucks. The user experience there is dismal - dismal on the order of Windows 95 user experience dismal. You would be better off biting the bullet and picking up the Self Test Software exam prep package for this particular exam.Overall, the material covered in this guide, paired with significant on-the-job experience and supplemental exam prep (like the STS packages mentioned above) should be more than sufficient to pass the exam covered. But don't use this book as your sole preparation tool.Again, at 1050+ pages, I would like to see electronic only versions of these types of books.

You need to consult MSDN documentation heavily and frequently as most methods are overloaded with so many variations.

I can summarized my experience in the following:The book will not be sufficient to pass the exam, and makes for a really bad and frustrating study guide.The authors of the book that have an incomplete understanding of the material.The authors and editors of the book have horrible writing skills.First of all the book is missing much of content from the actual exam, probably about 40 percent. Don't let the books objectives insert fool you, there are huge gaps in the book, and you will not pass by using the study guide as your only resource. While the study guide is missing a lot of content, it also goes too far into detail for some content that is actually included in the book. For example, for the exam you will only need a broad understanding of reflection, you will not need to be able to write an entire section of code on \\"creating code in runtime\\", you will also not need to memorize the exact steps of using the .Net configuration tools.Often it seemed then when the authors didn't understand an item, instead of researching it themselves and then thoroughly explaining it, they just cut and pasted random information / code examples from MSDN with no after thought, or they simply skiped the difficult item all together. It's understandable that the authors would have such bad knowledge of coding, since as they personally state that they have only written \\"hundreds if not thousands of lines of code\\" (pg 68).Some examples of their poor understanding include:The StrongNameIdentityPermission in the book (pg 661), is generically described as \\"defines the identity permission for strong names\\" , pasted verbatim from MSDN. A more complete and meaningful explanation would have been \\"Restricts the assembles that can call this method, based on a specific public key from the calling assembly.\\"On page 603, instead of actually explaining how to use the PerformanceCounterClass, the author instead find it necessary to show us how to append PerformaceCounter properties to a StringBuilder class.On page 819, the authors the describe how to perform \\"Exception Handling in Managed Code\\". They quickly list how you shouldn't do it, and that \\"you need to do something else\\". Of course instead of actually saying what it is, and even mentioning the solution, they list a 2 page cryptic code example.As of the second edition, there are still many code and grammatical mistakes. The authors often try to get cutesy with inappropriate personal anecdotes that feel completely out of place, or use bad worded filler material like \\"These two classes have an intuitive synergy that becomes evident when you use them.\\" (pg 482).Reading the book I got a feeling that the authors got paid per page written, so they felt compelled to stretch things out as much as they can with extra tables for class parameters and methods and unnecessary code examples. Mind you, instead of actually adding all of this filler material, they could have just been more thorough with the exam material.Bottom line is that there is no excuse for incorrect code samples, grammatical mistakes, very poor writing, and missing content. Especially since this is already the second edition.Some other reviewers of this book have stated such ridiculous explanations as: \\"i'm glad there's errors and that you have to research to figure them out.\\" or \\"Places where this book is \\"weak\\" is where YOU as a reader need to learn how to use MSDN and look it up yourself.\\" , those are NOT valid excuses for such as horrible book.For a good example of a study guide see: Kathy Sierra's study guide for SCJD, even though that exam is much harder, the book is concise and straight to the point. Teaching you only what you need to be taught.As for the actual exam:It was easier then expected, especially when compared to the Sun Certified Java Programmer course (mind you I did purchase extra exam practice questions, and study from them).Whereas in the SCJP exam, there are many tricks questions, and you needed a thorough understanding / memorization of writing specific code, and knowing when code wouldn't compile, run, etc. For this exam, having a broad general understanding of all topics will be sufficient, the most obvious answers are typically the correct ones, and you really don't need to memorize/ be able to write entire sections of code .For study preparation I recommend reading through the book, without trying to memorize code sections. Skipping the labs. Purchasing extra exam questions like Transcender, and working through them, and looking up any missing items on MSDN.It took me about 100 hours to prepare for the exam, but this is having already a solid understanding of Object Oriented Programming, having passed some Sun Java Courses, and having used .Net at work. I probably could have studied for less time, if I was warned about this book.Also make sure to place special emphasis on studying streams, including all related streams types, crypto , compression, text, etc, and their corresponding method signatures.I'm giving this book 2 stars, instead of 1, solely on the fact that that this is really the only 70-536 study guide in print, and using it will save you time over trying to figure things out using Microsoft's atrocious MSDN, which is just as poorly written and confusing."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536): Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation","review":"I used this book as my initial source of preparation for the 70-536 and would recommend it not only for the content, but also for the perks the book contains which include a MeasureUp practice test, a 15% off voucher for any Microsoft Certification exam (expires 2010), and a 90-day trial of Visual Studio 2005 for the few readers who would need it.The book itself does a good job of introducing though not comprehensively explaining each subject area covered by the test. I felt that some of the content was more instructional filler than study guide (e.g. sections such as \\"What Is Inheritance?\\" or the verbose \\"Case Scenarios\\" which I just skipped over) but all in all I'd say the book is a pretty handy resource.After having taken the test, I can't recall a question pertaining to a class or concept that this text didn't at least introduce you to.That said, I wouldn't rely on the book alone in preparing for the test. As mentioned, the book is a good introduction, but I'd highly recommend using the included practice tests and even supplimentary tests (like those from Transcender) to identify any weak areas requiring deeper study.I personally used the book, its test, and the Transcender tests and Google as preparation material.

Early in the book, on page 68, Mr. Wildermuth attempts to assert his expertise to the reader by declaring that he has \\"written hundreds, if not thousands, of lines of code\\". I have shown this little blurb around to many of my colleagues and clients. It has turned into somewhat of a euphemism for a n00b. For instance:Dev1: \\"How did the interview go with Ted?\\"Dev2: \\"Not great. He's got a good personality, but his skill set is a little weak.\\"Dev1: \\"What kind of stuff has he worked on?\\"Dev2: \\"I would say that he has probably written hundreds, if not thousands, of lines of code.\\"Both: \\"ROFL!\\"orDev1: \\"Holy cow!

I would say that, for myself, preparing for an exam includes a multi-pronged approach. It starts with these books and continues to MSDN and Transcender. But most importantly, I think you have to definitely open up Visual Studio and practice. Write some code!

You will not do it. Do not think this book is for beginner's, it's not. You must have a firm grasp of object oriented programming to understand .NET.

There is a lot of content in the book and I think they put it in a format that is easy to understand. Some of the content such as Code Access Security, WMI, and COM Interopability are a bit thin, but you can make that difference up with MSDN.My recommendation is to buy this book. Read it from cover to cover. DO ALL THE QUESTIONS, EXAMPLES, LABS, AND PRACTICE TESTING!!! Once you're done with all of this, if you have money to spend, perform the Microsoft learning online content. If you can't afford that, go to online practice test sites, such as MeasureUp and do those. Once this is all done, you should have a grasp of your weak spots.

But it is sometimes sufficient to notice that some chapters have not been understood correctly. There are more questions on the CD though.- A few topics are poorly explained. More schemas and diagrams and explanations required (the part on evidences in the application domain chapter). But at least the book lists what is to learn.

I considered using an alternative practice exam solution, but the software that came with the book was adequate, and in some instances, more difficult than the actual exam.With that being said, I too agree that this book alone will (most likely) not enable you to pass the exam. This book is a *study guide*, not a *cheat sheet*. The goal of the book is to introduce you to exam topics and prepare you to solve exam problems using the .NET Framework App Foundation. This book is intended for candidates that have experience with previous or current versions of the Framework, who wish to condition that knowledge to pass an exam. The authors inform you of what level of skills you should have at the beginning of every chapter.As with any technical book, it can use a little work.

There are also some extremely weak sections that are of minimal help when taking the exam. This includes threading and interoperation chapters. Look for additional help on these subjects. I also thought that the instrumentation needed work.Another issue is the presentation of information on capabilities. The book includes tables containing the more important methods, but the signatures for these methods are not included; it would have been extremely informative since this information indicates best how a method is used.

It is not a story book or an activity book that your child will return to again and again. It is intended to be a single-use activity. Stickers are removable in the sense that if your child gets one in the wrong spot or gets one crooked, the sticker can be removed and repositioned. It should be noted, though, that stickers are paper and not reusable in the sense that vinyl Colorforms would be.Each sticker in this particular book is numbered, and the numbers correspond to outlines on the activity board. Outlines on the board are slightly smaller than the stickers, so do not show after stickers are applied. Due to the number of stickers and the small size of the board, some stickers will overlap. We found it best to apply the stickers in 1-2-3 order.This book kept my 3 1/2-year-old entertained for about half an hour. She needed some assistance removing stickers from the paper backing, but enjoyed matching numbered stickers to numbered outlines on her own.My one caveat was that the stickers were fairly fragile.

Contact.","review":"There are two things I would like to address in this commentary. First, I would like to say that all of Mr. Henry's books are fascinating and entertaining, but the real value lies in his ability to provoke thought in the reader. He presents a unique prospective on ancient symbolism and language. Personally, I am grateful to Mr. Henry for opening my eyes, my heart and my mind! I am indebted to him for expanding my thoughts and increasing my awareness of so many possibilities! If it weren't for his thought provoking and sometimes mind-blowing suggestions I would still be looking at everything with a 2 dimensional, profane, and exoteric eye! Instead I am driven to do my own research into the esoteric and sacred texts as well as some mainstream work, in order to learn more about where I came from, why I am here and where I am going!I highly recommend ALL of Mr. Henry's books and DVD's. However, the casual reader may find it difficult to grasp the deeper concepts at first. If you like books that put a new spin on old ideas this book is for you! I find myself digging out his DVD's and watching them all over again because they are so packed full of interesting ideas that I missed the first and second time around! His books are also treasures to keep and re-read from time to time!I would also like to take a moment to address the comment that was written by \\"Iconoclast\\". I, too, have read Mr. Sitchin's books. While Mr. Henry properly cites Mr. Stichin's work as a reference point, I don't think that he has plagerized his work in any way! William Henry cites a lot of different sources in his works, which is common when giving an historical account. However, he adds a fresh, new approach to those historical accounts that delight and entertain the reader! It is obvious that \\"Iconoclast\\" is an avid follower of Professor Michael Heiser's work, of which I am also familiar. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Heiser's work as well. However to say that William Henry needs to be incarcerated and/or medicated because his ideas are different is ...well...medieval! Perhaps \\"Iconoclast\\" is a reincarnated Crusader from the 10th or 11th century!I would also like to add that William Henry has never claimed to be a professor of language or a linguist. On numerous occasions I heard him describe himself as an Investigative Mythologist.In fact, I have had the good fortune to have listened to many of William Henry's radio interviews on Coast to Coast and Jeff Rense. He always struck me as a compassionate, sincere man who never denigrated the ideas or religious beliefs of others. He patiently listens to the ideas and rants of others and shows the utmost respect to them, no matter how outrageous or silly they may sound! To me that is the mark of a truly great and wise man! I just don't understand why iconoclast would attack the man merely because he does not agree with him!Also, Iconoclast has copied and pasted that very same comment on another of Mr. Henry's book reviews. I don't know Mr. Henry, personally, but, for what it's worth, I wanted to defend him against this obvious ploy to discredit him!Peace and Happiness to ALL!"},{"Title":"Oracle of the Illuminati: Coincidence.

Contact.","review":"William Henry's books will only cost you money and fill your head with utter nonsense. He has no ideas of his own. He has borrowed them all from other writers, especially from Zecharia Sitchin. The only way in which he has shown to be very original and unique, is the way in which he \\"interprets\\" the ancient Mesopotamian languages, while having no knowledge of their grammars at all. He never studied languages, and it shows. He admits that he does not use the dictionaries the ancient Mesopotamians wrote themselves, which allow a perfect understanding of their languages. No, mister Henry uses an English dictionary instead to do the job (Webster's)!!! English has no connection whatsoever with these ancient languages. He is also convinced that, if a word in a certain language sounds like another word in another language (chosen by Henry himself), they must both share a kindred meaning. F.e.: the Babylonian name \\"Gilgamesh\\" sounds like the Hebrew word \\"Golgotha\\", so there must be a link between them, a shared meaning. Which meaning? The one Henry himself attaches to both words, a meaning which wonderfully \\"corroborates\\" his theories.This con man is clearly a psychotic person who is in desperate need of a straightjacket and a tranquilizer shot. He should either be send to prison or to a mental asylum. He should return the millions of dollars he stole out of the pockets of credulous, gullible people by giving them a false world view, based on linguistic errors and fantasies.On the internet I found a very profound critique of Henry's linguistic distortions and fantasies, written by professor Michael Heiser who actually DOES know ancient languages. If you read this critique, you will see Henry's \\"stargate\\" collapse immediately:http://www.sitchiniswrong.com/Disciple%20william_henry.htmProfessor Heiser: \\"In a nutshell, Henry dispenses with all the methodological, literary, linguistic, and anthropological (as that field pertains to language) knowledge accumulated in the past few centuries. He rejects facts we all know to be true-namely, in this case, the very idea that sounds that come from the human mouth (i.e., spoken language) DIFFER AS TO MEANING in different people groups. Lest this sound unbelievable, or perhaps incomprehensible, what I mean here is that Henry actually operates on the assumption that words can be taken apart by syllable sounds and then spliced together with other syllables-even from different languages-and meanings supplied to the results. To someone who has had my language experience (a dozen or so ancient languages learned from a deductive nuts and bolts grammatical perspective) this is positively maddening-and utter nonsense. I know the uninitiated reader may think I am caricaturing Henry's approach, but the proof is below. You've got to see it to believe it... Henry's major tool for determining the symbolic or root meanings (etymological meaning) to the syllables he chops ancient Sumerian, Akkadian, Egyptian, and Hebrew words in to is-I'm not kidding-the English dictionary. That's right, the English dictionary-whose word etymologies derive from Indo-European languages which were compiled before the decipherment of cuneiform. How is this possible you ask? Good question. I honestly can't even begin to describe the amazing extended non-sequitur rabbit trails William is about to take you on. I was truly stunned into silence a number of times, barely able to even follow the lines of thought. The matter turned from being laughable to disturbing, though, when Henry expressed his opinion that these ancient languages were a kind of bird language (I'm still hoping this doesn't mean what it sounds like). I am left with the impression that William may need some sort of help - but maybe I misunderstood that point. Well, here we go.\\"Heiser considers William Henry to be \\"Someone who interprets ancient texts with an English dictionary. Someone who violates every rule of language meaning and linguistic philosophy I've ever seen or heard of, as well as the cumulative body of anthropological knowledge surrounding division of people groups by language. Someone whose case is built on non-sequitur etymologies - where relationships of sounds (in English no less), syllables and language groups can be separated and spliced together at will to serve an interpretive agenda. Someone who refuses to get his word meanings from Mesopotamian sources. Someone whose approach to language cannot be applied in the real world lest it be shown to be utter nonsense.\\"He's right, you've got to see it to believe it!"},{"Title":"GERMAN 1918 OFFENSIVES","review":"This work by retired US Army Maj.Gen. David T. Zabecki is a model of military analysis at its finest. As the published version of his doctoral dissertation it is extremely well written in a explanatory style that is at once concise and cogent as well as thoughtful and thought provoking. For those interested in understanding war in general, and particular that most unfathomable bloodletting called The Great War, this work should be come a classic. Zabecki makes a contribution to knowledge in three areas:1. A very useful distillation and summation of Operational Art as a framework for analysis;2. The introduction into English of an invaluable data collection of German material on what they were trying to do and how they were thinking about executing it in the last year of World War I that significantly adds to historical understanding;3. An important example of how to how to use the relatively new (for the West) concept of Operational Art to mine important insight from historical data while also coincidently showing how proper historical research can provide insight into the Operational Level of War.For those who want war story narrative or a simpleton's guide to \\"maneuver theory\\" they need to look elsewhere, but for those who teach national security, who consider themselves students of military history, or look for insight into one of the turning points of battlefield lethality, Zabecki's book is indispensable.The only negative about this book is the publisher Routledge's pricing. It is definitely worth the asking $140+ a copy, but, because that is so out of line with most books of this genre, I fear that it will be consigned to a few library shelves when it should be on the desk of every serving officer and serious student of national security issues.

Ms. Rice is one of those rare authors who paint an incredibly accurate portrait of her characters, in which the reader feels that they are right there. The entire story is believable and I especially love her portrayal of young adults. She seems to have the minutest detail down pat, including their fears, frustrations and mannerisms! It is very hard to put down a Luanne Rice book once you get started. This was one such book! I have read Cloud Nine and Home Fires by this author and recommend them highly as well.The story follows Diane Robbins and her handicapped daughter, Julia, as Diane struggles as a single parent to raise Julia. Her husband abandoned her after finding out their daughter was \\"not perfect\\", yet her husband's brother, Dr. Alan McIntosh, continues to stay by her and Julia's side and never abandons them. It is through the friendliness of Amy Brooks, a lost and troubled girl, which helps Diane see, experience, and find the love that has been missing from her life, but has really been there all the time! Definite soap opera material, but written with such sensitivity and tenderness that makes it believable and not mushy-gushy. The reader sees love and hope bloom in several of the character's lives as their lives intertwine and they begin to open up and care for one another. A good tearjerker of a story! Ms. Rice once again portrays her heroines as strong women experiencing several of life's greater challenges, yet preserving and not losing hope.I would love to see a sequel to this story! Wonderful story of love and hope! Highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I'd not read such an absorbing book for a long time.A love story, no doubt, but of a different kind. Not only does it warm your heart by the love of a woman and a man who are kindred spirits but got thrown apart by a mistake; the love a mother has for her child - a child whom no one wants to keep in their home, and the love of a child for her mother, a mother who is unable to love her the way she deserves.Sappy, true, but how it grabs you with the beautiful dream that it holds. How many of us seek for the love that knows no bounds, a small spark of love that that would lead to a changed world forever.We see each character from their own eyes, we feel their emotions, feel their pain, cry their tears, wallow in their sorrows. The simple prose leads us deep into the beings of each character of the story, a truly wonderful experience indeed.Lovely story. You'd identify with it if you have ever loved before."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"This isn't a book I would race right out and buy, but it is an easy flowing story, and interesting enough to keep you turning pages. Dianne Robbins plays Super Mom, raising a hopelessly and terminal child, taking in a foster child, working and being a single mom. The grandmother is kind of cute, she lives with Dianne, and makes a few happy appearances. The love story behind all this is a little strange. Dianne and Alan only had one date, yet they seem to have always 'longed' for each other. Dianne married Alan's brother, who left her pregnant when he found out the baby was severely deformed. Luanne Rice tries to convince us that Dianne hates Alan because of what his brother did, but it doesn't wash real well, and the outcome is predictable. And throwing in the part where the deformed child has her say kind of puts a fakeness on the whole story. I hated the ending, I think you will too. I got the feeling that the author had to end it in a hurry and used whatever means available to do so. But it's okay. If you are bored and nothing else is around, you might like it."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I loved this book.

This book did not disappoint as she weaves family & emotions in an enchanting manner."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"There are many reasons for which we choose to read a novel, all of them perfectly reasonable depending on whom we are, our location perhaps such as a holiday, daily commuting for some or just simple curiosity.A few years back I happened to see a Hallmark movie called Follow the Stars Home and due to undeniable curiosity about the author herself, I added this particular title to my \\"wish list\\"...This wish list is in fact a little notebook I keep with me always listing all the goodies I hope to acquire somehow later, all items to be strictly purchased at one or another Charity shoppes!Not all wishes come true of course (I am still hoping for an old convertible VW with automatic drive...) but when my husband found this book on some obscure shelf and waved it from afar, I just crossed it off the list! One down, a million more to go...Luanne Rice published this particular novel in 2000 and has since written many more stories, all absolutely worth reading if they are anything like this one! The movie came out I believe in 2001 with the DVD release in 2002 and yes, I also own a copy of it!What makes this story special for me were the feelings I experienced when I first saw the part played in the movie by Blair Brown. This was the perfect Mum and the ultimate GrandMother! Quiet, faithful, courageous, solid, funny, tender, feminin... I just had to read Follow the Stars Home and find out more.I was not disappointed! The introduction would have been enough! Somewhere I simply lost myself and felt a myriad of emotions that could only be inspired from someone as caring as Luanne Rice.This is a story of love, courage, endurance, broken dreams but also wonderful and unexpected gifts! This is the story of a young mother who chooses to keep the baby she carries after being told of her little girl's birth defects. Despite her husband's careless rejection of this baby she already loves so much and his subsequent abandon, Dianne learns to survive with the help of Lucinda her mother and Alan, a faithful friend and pediatrician. Alan is also the child's uncle and he is in love with Dianne. Theirs is an unusual but incredible family who together meets every challenge and crisis resulting from this lovely little girl's declining health.Julia is not going to get better and time is so precious!Luanne Rice's does not shy from recounting the daily struggles this young mother faces whilst caring for her beautiful little girl who comes to mean so much to everyone who loves her including Amy, her newfound friend.Amy is a lonely little girl who just wants to be loved. Her father died at sea, her mother suffers of deep depression and lives with her abusive boyfriend. Amy reaches out to Julia and forges a special bond with the little girl. Theirs is a friendship that knows no boundaries.Throughout the story you will find yourself rethinking many emotions. This is not just a story about love and romance or wishful dreams, nothing is perfect and each character is aptly developed to remind you life is not a destination but a journey!The movie adaption called for different locales and a change of names for certains characters but the overall effect does not change its haunting appeal.On a final note, whilst reading the book I discovered Blair Brown's rendition of Lucinda is absolutely perfect and I think every mother's heart could identify at some point with her!The script for the movie itself was also co-written with the author and merits a round of applause! I found the actors selection to be grand and their performance flawless. Campbell Scott never disappoints!I give 5 stars to the book and 4 1/2 stars to the movie!Note: I was not asked to review this Book/DVD and therefore all opinions expressed are solely my own!"},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Utterly Compelling.Poignant and achingly beautiful prose.Heart renderingly bittersweet, and yet so uplifting.What an amazing journey Luanne Rice leads us through.There really are no leads in this book. She writes thestory with such even-handedness. Each character fully realized, including a cat and a dog.There are several love stories here.Man and Woman.Mother and child. Father and daughter.And friends of the heart.Her ever so gentle portrait of the love of a family for a severely disabled child is stunning. Reading aboutthe child's physical problems and the care she requires is not depressing. It is inspirational.Another child has problems other than medical. I loved her character. Anne of Green Gables is mentioned as a favorite bookof one of the characters. This book has the same gossamer quality of happy-healing-loving warmth.Just a downright beautifully written, perfectly realized story."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I really enjoyed this book very much. Luanne Rice definitely writes with a lot of feeling for her characters in the book, making it seem as though it really happened.Dianne Robbins has spent eleven years caring for her exceptional child's every need when her ex-hisband, Tim McIntosh would not accept a 'defective child.' Throughout these years of waiting, watching, and caring, Alan hid his love for his brother's wife. But Dianne has closed her heart toward men. Alan, being Julia's pediatrician as he always has been, begins to win his way into Dianne's heart as the story moves on.The story also demonstrates Julia's struggle with Rett's Syndrome, a degenerative neurological disorder in children.I found the book very worthwhile to read."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I picked this book up at an airport before a 3-hour flight.

It isn't what it sounds like and its even better then it sounds. Its a wonderful book and it all works out in the end. It's like a modern day fairy tale"},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Once I started this book, I could not stop, I read the whole thing in a day and a half. I saw the Hallmark movie first, but as usual, the book was so much better! The relationship between Tim and Alan had gone into much more detail, as the relationship with Amy, her mother and Buddy. If you're looking for a romantic book about courage and strength, read this one!"},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"This book is a keeper. Diane faces some difficult times, he daughter, julia is disabled, and cant be understood. Julia finds a kindred soul, in Amy a girl whose the same age as Julia. Amy becomes dianes second daughter, and together Diane and Amy open there hearts to love, and friendship. Lucinda is a treat. The four of these young women embark on a vacation. The book ends with new love, of family, of the heart. Also, the understanding of a girl who cannot speak, but her brain certainly isnt impared, who watches the whole scene unfold like a flower, and memorizes, each loving memory she shares with her mother, her grandma, her friend, and the man she calls dad."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Very few authors have the ability to touch you in a way you will never forget.

I am sure I will be re-reading this book several times."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Yikes! I love Luanne Rice, and have read each and every one of her books. However...This one was simply awful, I am sorry to say. It was SO overly sweet and sacharine, I found myself nauseated throughout most of the book. It was also unbelievably repetitive- I did not need to hear a million times over about Dianne's contempt for Tim, the circumstances of his abandoning her, or the deep connection between she and her daughter, Julia. I got it after the first few times! It was also really predictable, but not in a good way....and the scene with Amy and the dog in the river? Please, that was the last straw. It was beyond far fetched....it was just silly. I expect better from this author. Some of her previous novels have moved me to tears, but this one is a joke. My best advice is to skip it."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Of all the Luanne Rice books I have read, I found \\"Follow the Stars Home\\" to be her most \\"sappy\\"!

I found this book too much like the older Danielle Steele books!I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I agree totally with an earlier reviewer, Vanessa's point. Like this author, didn't like this book. The beginning held promise. The story in between was pages and pages of predictable developments. The denouement wasn't worth the read. The good seed, the bad, The altruistic, the selfish. All contrast,no shading."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"After reading &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; I was hoping that this book would be just as good but it was better. It is so wonderfully written. Julia was a beautiful child and you could just feel the love that Diane and Alan had for her. While it would be so easy to dislike Tim because he did not have to courage to face up to his responsibilities,my dislike for him was tempered by my admiration for Alan, for he took over for his brother. While there were many times that I cried, there were just as many times that I smiled and felt good. What made this book even more wonderful was the last chapter where Julia speaks to the audience. What a beautiful child she is."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"On the front cover of my copy, it has a little blurb about what this book is about: \\"A novel of mothers, daughters and the courage to love again from one of today's most cherished authors.\\" I don't think I have read many of Luanne Rice's books, though I do know of a few people who really adore her books. Because of their recommendations, I picked this one up at a garage sale over the summer and finally got around to reading this past week.It is a novel of mothers and daughters and the courage to love again. It is beautifully written and very sentimental. It is about a woman, Dianne, who was abandoned by her husband before her daughter was born. Her daughter, Julia, was born with a lot of birth defects and was a life-time job of care-taking. It is beautifully written about her love for her daughter. It is also about Dianne's mother, Lucinda, who is always there for Dianne. It is also about a young girl who came into all their lives because she lives in a bad home. It is about all of them. It is also a romance between Dianne and her brother-in-law, Alan, who really inspired the definition of sticking through thick and thin for the last eleven years.It is a beautiful story ~~ almost too sweet in some spots. It is compelling though since I couldn't stop reading it. It's perfect reading for those dreary winter days when it's too yucky to go outside to do anything. So curl up with this book and enjoy a lazy Sunday afternoon escaping into the world of Dianne and her family.1-14-07"},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Dianne Robbins has been a single mom ever since the day she learned the child she was carrying would be born with serious defects. Still, she's made the best of things, and created a loving home with her mother for 11-year-old Julia. Her ex-husband's brother Alan -- Julia's physician -- has always been there for them as well.Meanwhile, local 12-year-old Amy Brooks is also feeling alone. Her mother Tess, depressed since the death of Amy's father, allows an abusive boyfriend to live in the family's home, neglecting and mistreating her young daughter. Amy flees to her longtime doctor...who in turn connects her with his sister-in-law and niece.Upon first meeting, Amy is instantly bonded with Julia and Dianne. Unlike many others, she isn't the least bit put off by Julia's defects. Amy quickly falls into a routine, visiting the two after school and on weekends. Not only does she help Dianne take care of her daughter, but Amy also finds family and friendship for the first time.Others, however, are not so content to let her do that. The anger of Amy's mother's boyfriend continues to grow, and if it's unleased upon the girl, it could prove fatal. In addition, Julia's health continues to prove problematic; and even though Dianne has been expecting precisely that for the past eleven years, the possibility of losing the one person she has truly loved is devastating."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"A most heart warming book.

I really liked Stella the Cat and Orion the Dog they added some humor to the story."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I found the made for TV movie at a local thrift store and fell in love with the characters, so I decided to find the book. I was shocked to see that Luanne Rice is the author since I have read several of her other books and loved them all.

I'm not a highly emotional person, but this book had me crying, laughing and raging as I went from chapter to chapter. The relationships between the characters are so well developed that I feel as though I know them as my own acquaintances, or maybe even friends. If you appreciate stories that involve romantic love, parental love, and love among friends, I would highly recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I had bought this book to take on vacation, but had such a great time on vacation that I never got around to reading it. I came home to see an add that this Hallmark made-for-tv movie was going to be playing in a week, so I started reading. I loved the book! The movie was &quot;okay&quot;, but I was disappointed how much the movie left out and how it twisted the relationship of Dianne and her ex-husband. That's Hollywood for you!The book is a wonderful story of a mother with the ultimate love for her handicapped daughter, but still has so much love to give a neglected girl who befriends her daughter.

We need to take the time to get to know and understand them."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesDianne Robbins has had a rough life but has never given up. While pregnant, she was abandoned by her husband when they discovered the baby was severely handicapped and unlikely to ever have a normal life. Tim couldn't handle it and took off, leaving Dianne to pick up the pieces of her broken love.Now, ten years later, Julia, her daughter, is still struggling through her life, with the help of Dianne, Dianne's mother Lucinda, and Juia's uncle and doctor, Alan, who is Dianne's former brother in law.When Alan brings a young troubled girl, Amy into Dianne's life she finds that she has more love to share then imagined. Will she now open her heart to Alan, the man who has loved her silently and patiently, through it all?This is a beautiful story of love lost, love found, and all the kinds of love a person can share. Listeners will feel the emotions along with Dianne and company, and come to know these people as friends.Dianne is a strong woman who stands tough through all the blows life has dealt her, never giving up on her daughter, and never regretting the life she could have had if not for Julia. In Amy, she finds another outlet for the love she has to give, which brightens the young girl's heart and soul, giving her the peace and affection she can't find in her own home. Alan is steadfast in his devotion to Dianne and Julia, never quite hoping, but never giving up either, on the possibility of a deep soul-stirring love with Dianne.The closing of the book, told from a different perspective from the rest of the story, adds a sweet touch. Some readers my find it unnecessary and too sappy, but I thought it was the perfect way to end the story."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I wanted to read this book after I saw the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie made from it. I'd never read anything by Luanne Rice before. The movie left me with a lot of unanswered questions and I wanted more background. I like both the movie and the book but it was nice to get more character development from the book."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I enjoyed a lot of this book. This is the first Luanne Rice book I have read, so I cannot compare it to her other works. I had watched the movie first and was excited to find out that it was based on a book. The book, for the most part, was good. The characters were well developed and the book explains the back story of the main characters a lot more than the movie does. The reader can understand more why Tim leaves (even though by no means does anyone root for him) because his character is developed. There is a lot of crying in this book, which I don't really like, but that is understandable since each of the characters have lived very hard lives. The reason I am giving this review 3 stars is because there is a fair amount of profanity, which I do not appreciate. There are also three sex scenes which, even though Luann Rice does not get into graphic detail, were still too drawn out. I am married, but I still did not appreciate this otherwise good story being damaged with sexual references. Also, and unfortunately, the ending was weak. There were just too many questions. Ms. Rice hinted at what would happen, but she did not write about the accounts. A final chapter or even an epilogue would have been better. It just ended rather abruptly with the reader looking to the next page to hopefully find more (and instead being disappointed). The movie ended the story much better."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Luanne Rice's Follow the Stars Home is the story of Dianne Robbins, a single mother in New England trying to raise her special needs daughter Julia, who has spina bifida and Rett Syndrome (an autism-like disorder that results in gradual loss of speech, hand-wringing, loss of muscle tone, and seizures). Dianne's fisherman husband Tim McIntosh walked out on her shortly after finding out that their unborn baby would be born with genetic abnormalities, and Dianne, with her mother's help, has been raising Julia for the last eleven years. Dianne is a carpenter who builds elaborate wooden playhouses, allowing her to work from home and keep an eye on Julia's many needs (feeding, diaper changing, digestive upsets, etc.).Tim's pediatrician brother Alan is Julia's primary physician, rushing over at each and every (frequent) medical crisis. He also happens to have dated Dianne before his brother Tim rushed to marry her, and Dianne carries a lot of baggage concerning her hatred of Tim for abandoning her and Julia. Even though Alan has been in love with Dianne for the past twelve years, her own deep emotional scars from Tim's abandonment and physical exhaustion from being the sole caretaker for Julia keep her from recognizing and reciprocating Alan's love.Dianne's mother Lucinda is a legendary local librarian who is deeply troubled by Dianne's refusal of Alan, and when Amy, a young girl from an abusive home, becomes a mother's helper for Dianne, Lucinda finds many parallels between her own turbulent youth in an orphanage, and Amy's home life (Amy's barely-functioning depressed mother and her mother's physically abusive live-in boyfriend Buddy). Lucinda's favorite novel is Anne of Green Gables, and the novel plays a central role in Follow the Stars Home as an inspiration for both Lucinda and Amy (orphaned girl with a vivid imagination discovers the power of writing).Much of the story revolves around the healing process as Dianne struggles to come to grips with Alan's deep love for both her and Julia (he was present at Julia's birth), being a \\"second mother\\" to Amy when Amy is taken out of her home by Child Protective Services (Dianne fantasizes about Amy as the child she would have had if Julia had been born without birth defects), the reality of Julia's rapid physical and neurological decline, and a final confrontation with Tim. The final poignant chapter is written in the first person by a previously unheard-from central character, and provided a fresh look at the many stories contained in the book.The most startling storyline is revealed in tense fragments, with tantalizingly brief shards of the present traumatic event opening the story before whirring back into Dianne's past. Rice's storytelling is deliciously paced, full of small nuances and everyday detail that really lend her characters much more depth than was allotted to them in the faithful Hallmark Hall of Fame adaptationFollow the Stars Home. This was my first novel by Luanne Rice, and based on my enjoyment of it, I look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I didn't like this book.

Abandoned before she gave birth to a daughter with many birth defects, Dianne struggles to raise Julia and to understand why Tim left her. Though she swears she will never give her heart to anyone, ever again, she still harbors feelings for the other McIntosh brother, Alan, who is Julia&#65533;s doctor. Her life is changed by Amy, a bright twelve-year-old whose own heart hides many scars and pain. When an accident leaves Dianne and Amy hospitalized, Tim begins to believe he has a second chance with her, while Alan feels that maybe the time has come to reveal the longing he has felt for Dianne for many years. Rice has created characters with depth and personality, ones that you can relate to in their flaws and feelings. The plot is very basic: will she fall back into Tim&#65533;s arms, or will she give her heart to Alan? Or neither? What of Amy, from an abusive home and unsure where she belongs? What drives the book is Rice&#65533;s bold writing and excellent narrative, strengthened by believable characters and situations. One develops instant attachments to the characters, even Tim; Rice doesn&#65533;t want the reader to grow too fond of him, but he&#65533;s not a complete jerk, and he&#65533;s given more development than one would expect. Dianne&#65533;s fragility and strength are contrasting parts of her character, and Rice uses them appropriately in the proper situations; plus, in Dianne, we find a heroine whose flaws and failings are refreshingly normal and easy to understand. Dianne loves her daughter Julia, but one gets the impression that a small part of her sees in Amy the &#65533;normal&#65533; child she wants. Character motivations and behaviors are consistent throughout; no one does anything that seems out of character. Alan&#65533;s feelings for Dianne seem sincere, and Amy&#65533;s crush on Alan makes for some amusing and touching moments. Tim&#65533;s motivations in both leaving Dianne and trying to make up with her are integral to his character; one may not like him, but one can see and (maybe) understand why he did what he did. The supporting characters (Malachy, Lucinda, Buddy, Tess, more) are also well-realized. Brisk pacing and dialogue help move the book along, with few dull moments. There&#65533;s some foul language, and some sexual content, but not in excessive amounts. Some people would see this as a &#65533;chick book,&#65533; but it&#65533;s far deeper than the potboilers that often populate the stands. Rice has brought us a wonderful story, full of good characters one can enjoy and love."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I love this book so much that it is beyond words! It's so heartfelt, warm, loving, caring, and at the same time balences it with mistakes, wrong turns, hatred, and despair. First I saw the made-for-TV movie and I really enjoyed it, although I felt the plot was rather hollow. Then I decided to read the book and see how far the movie was off and which was better. The Book passed the movie by miles. I swear, the book is so far ahead of the movie, the movie is dot to it!! A DOT! The book is so much better and the plot is so different and extrodenary. The only fault I found, was that I was alittle disappointed that there wasn't more to the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending was wonderful, but I just wish they would have went into more detail.

Then all of a sudden she forgives Tim and sees Alan as the love of her life. Like a switch was flipped. I also felt Luanne Rice left the ending hanging. Dianne is very hurt, her daughter sick and Tim doesn't pay for his sins. Book finished. Very frustrating."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Dianne Robbins is a single mother, her daughter, Julia, is disabled and while doing her best to raise her, she struggles with the thought that she is not a good enough mother.Dianne's story begins with her marriage to fisherman, Tim McIntosh, falling apart.

Ms. Rice's writing is impeccable. Her characters are so real, so personal that they feel like close friends. The warmth and depth of feeling in this book is touching....I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I purchased this book after reading and loving Cloud Nine. This book was wonderfully written; however, the ending was a bit loose and I was wondering if my book was missing pages.I loved all the characters, even Tim who broke my heart. I hope those people who quickly turn when facing a handicapped child will reassess their actions, and learn to smile and love.A heartwrenching/heartwarming story!"},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"If this book tried any harder to say self-important, warm, pithy points, I was going to scream! The editor had to have been asleep at the wheel here. Some good editing, especially of the moralizing parts, could have saved this book. Alas, too late."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"This is a bittersweet story of what might have been. She shows so clearly how life can change in a heartbeat. We never know what the future holds for us or how we must learn to cope under the harshest conditions, but she learned to dream and to have the courage to follow her heart. She looked so frail and lovely, but she had a constitution of steel. She was small and strong and showed how a woman can endure hardships unimaginable to most of us and still come out a winner.He had no home, no address, which was the price he'd paid for what he'd done. Once he'd had it all: a lovely wife, nice home, money to throw away on himself and a successful career. He was a good guy at heart and his intentions were never bad -- he didn't mean to hurt anyone. Mark had been running from responsibility and civility for eleven years when he met her. He resided on his boat called 'Aprhrodite,' named after the goddess of love. Once I was called that when I found him, an Adonis she'd called David (after the famous statue). Too much had happened at once and he freaked out, could not cope. Circumstances changed all of his bad memories, so it might be possible to find love again, with reservations. He needed someone to take care of him. He kept time with the music in his head.He was her hero until he abandoned his obligations at a pivotal time. His voice had made her want to promise him the stars. She couldn't \\"let go,\\" so she was left with a burden which most people could not handle, but Alan rescued her from a life of drudgery. It was as if she would drown from heartbreak, as evidenced from the dark crescents under her eyes.This wasn't the life she would have chosen. They'd been inseperable until a death intervened. When a loved one dies, so does parts of those left behind -- the parts which allow one to love. When you love, there's no way to \\"not hurt\\" like Zach and Mark (different circumstances) when the devil did not take a holiday. He chose to burn his bridges and could live with himself without reprieve from the interesting, yet not quite fulfilling, nomadic existence. He had studied dolphins and their music off Nova Scotia. People tell lies because they are afraid of the truth. He'd done his best to protect her from the facts.This was a sad story with twinges of conscience. To make it appear real, I have observed such a child in reality since my move -- in social surroundings which made reading some of the details painful. Miracles do occasionally happen. She had a near-death experience in New York City on the way to see 'The Nutcracker' ballet at Lincoln Center (see next review) and found it easier to forgive and let the hate die, so she could live. Her dreams now appear to be within reach, but at a price. It had felt so good to be loved, but can a person die from loving too much? No man is ever \\"always\\" true to his word as he makes false promises to love her until the end of time. The hours spent together seemed like a dream. But things change, people change. You can't control fate, and you can't survive alone, looking at the stars in Orion. She'd believed his blatant lies that life together would be beautiful and last forever and a day. You never know when it might end and so you must hold your chin high and do the best you can -- hoping that things will work out."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I love romance novels but I hate tear-jerkers. I won't read a story if I know it's going to make me cry. Luanne Rice's previous book, Cloud Nine, was absolutely wonderful even though I cried buckets over it. (I didn't know that it was going to be that sad.) Even though this new book, Follow the Stars Home is magical, I must warn you that it also has a few tears. The characters - Alan, Dianne, Lucinda, Amy, Julia, Tim - are all so real, you don't want to let them go when the book is finished. The plot is pure soap opera: woman marries the &quot;wrong&quot; brother, bears a disabled child, husband leaves, while angelic doctor-brother lovingly and patiently waits in the wings to take over from irresponsible brother. Small scenes are full of love and caring; big dramatic scenes make you catch your breath in fear and apprehension. This book is far above a standard romance. Rice is truly gifted and talented and I will continue to read her with great joy, even knowing there's bound to be some teary moments."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Lobsterman Tim McIntosh worked the New England coast. He loved his wife Dianne, but could not deal with the sickly child that was born to them. Instead, Tim abandoned his spouse and little Julia. She sufferers from illnesses that leave her physically and mentally dying from birth. Perhaps because he loves Dianne or just feels bad by his sibling's abandonment, Tim's brother Alan constantly is there for Dianne and Julia. Alan's actions add to the guilty feelings and shame that fill Tim's heart, but his soul cannot take the steps needed to reconcile with his beloved wife nor shower his child with the love she needs.As Dianne supports herself and Julia, she meets a troubled twelve-year old Amy Brook, who becomes a little sister to her. Amy helps Dianne fully understand what love is all about, but will Tim ever learn the same lesson before it is too late?FOLLOW THE STARS HOME focuses on the meaning of love and its capacity to meliorate many human frailties. Dianne, Tim, and Amy seem very real because their characters are fully developed. The audience will dislike what Tim did, but understand his actions and frustrations. Reader's empathy towards Julia will gush throughout the novel. This emotion on the part of the audience shows how talented Luanne Rice is in sensitizing her fans, though for most of the novel the audience &quot;sees&quot; the ailing child through the eyes of the other characters. Using Julia's thoughts as a climax leads to a feeling that this was a contrived closing but Ms. Rice reaches inside our very hearts and souls with an inspiring novel that reflects on how precious but fleeting is life.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I have read stories of people turning a truly bad life situation into an inspiration for us all, but Luanne Rice has accomplished the ultimate with this book. This was a first Rice book for me, but I am here to purchase more. Her ability to weave the lives of her various characters and mingle their individual personalities, weaknesses, and most of all strengths is struly inspiring. Her love for her disabled child, and I question that word disabled when it comes to Julia, and her ability to include another &quot;well in body, not spirit in child&quot; into her life made me reevaluate what it means to be a mother. Dianne is the epitome of what I consider the word mother and also daughter to mean. Alan was what all fathers should be defined as. Rice is a genius with story and words."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"This was my first opportunity to read a Luanne Rice book. Once I began it was hard to put the book down. The characters came to life and left you wanting to know more about each one. I enjoyed the switching back and forth between various character's stories - current and present. The two questions I had were what finally brought Diane to the fact after 12 years of indifference that she was in love with her brother-in-law. Although it was a beautiful love story it seemed to have elements missing. The biggest disappointment to me was the ending. Although it was sweet - I really wanted to know what really happen to these two characters - did they get married, did they have children, what happen to Amy and Diane's mother??I would have liked to see the author place a 2-3 page Epilogue to round out the story."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"This is the first Luanne Rice book I've read, and I'm very worried. It appears that my wallet will become lighter after buying more of her books! Just by reading the previews, you 'think' you know how it will turn out, but it left me surprised at the end. I can't say I shed tears over it, but it did pull on my heart strings! Very wonderfully written; very descriptive, and all the details make you feel apart of the story. I've been to many of the locations mentioned, and she's nailed them down right to the bends in the road. I highly recommend this book for those rainy days when all you want to do is read a good book."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"This book will take your breath away! The characters were written so well, I felt like I knew them myself. Dianne is an incredible person, the unconditional love she gives her daughter Julia, who was born with birth defects. Her strong heart for over coming the blow of her husband Tim leaving her when Julia was born. If I could have had a word with Tim myself, I would have blown him out of this world! At first when I started reading this story, I thought, &quot;This is so cheesy&quot;, but man, I changed tunes about half way through the book. Amy's character will warm your heart and take you by surprise as well as Lucinda. Even though the story is really about Dianne and Julia, the others fit in so well and make it seem so heart warming. I have to admit, Alan, Tims brother almost seems to good to be true. Get your tissues ready and enjoy a heart warming story. The end will simply make you cry - Julia's Story. Some how I felt so much better about how Julia felt and what she really understood after I read the ending, you will absolutely close this book and think about it for days, It is definetly a story of &quot;Following the Stars Home&quot;,as difficult as it was, Dianne did, she followed her heart!!!"},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"The most impressive thing about Luanne Rice's writing lies in her ability to tell a lovely, poignant story using characters you feel you have met somewhere before. In \\"Follow the Stars Home,\\" a realistic human situation provides the opportunity for the author to take a look at love from several perspectives.Dianne Robbins, initially attracted to Alan, a charming and upstanding young doctor, is wooed away by his brother, Tim, who is battling his own personal demons. Dianne falls into the common trap of thinking she can save a man by marrying and loving him and chooses Tim over Alan. Tim ends up breaking her heart by leaving her pregnant with their severely handicapped child. Wary of men, she spends the next eleven years lavishing her tremendous capacity to love on her handicapped daughter, Julia. All this time, Alan, who has secretly loved her, has maintained a steadfast devotion to Dianne and Julia and has become their guardian angel.In an effort to help both Diane and Amy, a troubled young girl, Alan brings Amy into Diane's life to assist with Julia. This placement ends up being positive for everyone involved and allows the author to explore another facet of the healing power of love. I found this story beautiful and honest and not sappy at all until the author decided to write that atrocious ending.This brings me to my criticisms of this book, mostly in the area of mechanics:Luanne Rice doesn't appear to trust her readers' intelligence. This is the only reason I can think of that she would repeat descriptions almost verbatim throughout her book. This is terribly annoying and distracts from the story. How much more satisfying to read a description ONCE then be shown in the remainder of the book how these initial descriptions affect the behavior and/or perceptions of this character by others.I have seen this next problem in other well-known authors--Research. What is wrong with basic research? The constellation Orion figures heavily in this book. It would seem to me that with a couple of clicks of the mouse on the Internet, she could manage to find out that Stella the cat could not be sitting at a window looking up at Orion in the summer as Orion is visible at night in North America only between December and March.My biggest problem, however, is with the ending. It was designed to preach at us--making certain we understand once and for all that Julia is a fully sentient human being. Rice did a far, far better job with this objective by developing it slowly over the course of the book. We see Julia through Amy's eyes. Despite her rough edges, Amy is kind and caring and not willing to accept the limitations even Diane sees in her daughter. Diane's love for her daughter is tenderness bordering on desperation. Amy, however, helps us to validate Julia as a fully realized person because she validates her. We did not need the spiel at the end. It did not tie up any loose ends since nearly all of the information had been given out earlier and Julia's comments do nothing to assure us of Amy and Diane's full recovery or the fate of Amy's mother, which would be new information at this point. It would have been much easier to swallow this tell-not-show summary if it was written as Julia's reminiscences of perhaps a year later following the patients' recovery and the subsequent wedding and life in the new house. This is a great story not managed as well as it could have been, but still worth reading."},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"Our book club chose this book from a list of others not being familiar with the author. It was definitely a favorite out of the 10 books we have read since the beginning of our club. Everyone felt a connection to the story and were unable to put it down. It is a quick read and when you're done you want to have another book to pick up immediately because you become so involved in the story and in reading - you hate to have it end.I would highly recommend reading this book. The ending is a blessing to all who read it!"},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"I read this book soon after a friend gave me a copy of Cloud Nine. I like Luanne Rice's writing style, which is very similar to that of Nicholas Sparks who is my favorite author of fiction. I sometimes find it hard to get going with novels, but this one held my attention. Maybe because I had a child with spina bifida who passed on, but I believe the whole story will capture your attention and heart. The characters are likeable, even when they are supposed to be &quot;bad&quot;. It flowed nicely and didn't drag on and on. My only disappointment was the ending, which I felt could have been wrapped up a little more completely. I look forward to Ms. Rice's next novel"},{"Title":"Follow the Stars Home","review":"This book is not the typical novel that I normally read. I read it for something different than the everyday romance novel. I will most definately be looking for more books by Luanne Rice. This book was so real in the emotions that the characters portrayed. I truely felt for Dianne and Julia when I read how cruel Tim had been to them. I felt bad for Alan having to live and see the women that he loved week after week. I really felt for Amy, having a mother she loved, who didn't have enough self-worth to save herself to help the girl that she loved. I was happy to see that almost everyone got what made them happy in the end.

This study has very little in the way of actual content, instead focusing on asking sunday school style questions. The book never actually answers any of the questions or provides deeper insight, meaning that there is little to learn from this study except the thoughts that you and your study group are able to produce. For those hoping for an in-depth look at Romans that will guide you into deeper, more thorough understanding of scripture, look elsewhere. This book is a waste of your time, energy and money."},{"Title":"Romans (MacArthur Bible Studies)","review":"John MacArthur is noted for his in-depth studies and exegesis. This excellent study on Romans comes complete with a NKJ version of the Book of Romans, with short marginal notes on what MacArthur considers commentary you should know about. There is a section included in each chapter called \\"Going Deeper\\" which is also a wonderful optional challenge for study. The questions are not easy but not overly difficult for anyone who is willing to work at it. Romans, the most doctrinal book of the Bible, is of inestimable value for any Christian to know and know well. MacArthur makes it easier, although not easy. I teach Bible studies and my mature women students are salivating to get to this, having been familiarized with MacArthur's other works. So if you really care about the Bible and about what Romans teaches you about living the Christian life, this isn't fluffy. It's serious business and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Romans (MacArthur Bible Studies)","review":"This is a great study of the book of Romans. MacArthur goes into such detail with the words and tense that a person can gain so much understanding by the original language. Be ready to work hard and be in the book of Romans for a while.

Norman Paulsen had an early desire to know the truth of the nature of life and was drawn to the great Indian yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda. He became a novitiate in Yogananda's organization, Self Realization Fellowship, and trained under the direct tutorage of this saint. He dropped out after a few years, as he knew that he had another calling in life other than being a monk in SRF.The book recounts his experiences with Yogananda, and the years after, when he organized a brotherhood colony called Sunburst, originally in the Santa Barbara/Goleta area of California. It is a fascinating account of his successful attempts to live closer in harmony with Nature, as advocated by Yogananda. Dedicated to the harmonious principles of a God-centered life, closely aligned to the natural rhythms of the earth; his colony has prospered and still serves spiritual seekers today, even though he died earlier in 2007.The book also goes into a theory about the evolution of man on this planet, which is intuitive insight on the part of Paulsen. This has been the more controversial aspect of this autobiography, since it is contrary to many of the conservative ideas of the origins of man on this planet.If you are interested in Yogananda or alternate and more harmonious ways of life, this is a great read. This confirms that Life has a great purpose and that it is accessible to all those who seek - they shall find if steadfast and sincere."},{"Title":"Sunburst: Return of the ancients : an autobiography","review":"If you liked Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi, you'll love this autobiography of Norman Paulsen, one of Yogananda's monks who cared for Yogananda in his old age, and went on to found a very successful New Age community in California.

While the heroin meant to go and connect with her mother what she really does is find out how strong she is and what she is capable of. She learns that she can stand on her own two feet and a person's history is not always the way it looks on paper.

I was surprised at the ending of this book,I was expecting the villian to be who they were. Excellent characters and action,suspense and also I fell in love with a few of the horses that were talked about. Nora, would you write a sequel about Kelsey and Gabe. Love this book. I will be reading more Nora books."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"There's just nothing that I don't like about Nora Robert's writing. She's descriptive without being boring. She pulls you into her stories before you get past the first page. Her plots grab you and her characters hold you.True Betrayals is no exception. The idea of receiving a letter from someone you thought was dead intrigues me. Especially, if it's a parent. And from there the intricate interweaving of family, friend, and enemy relationships leads the reader into a story that you'll remember for a long time.But, of course, the romance between Kelsey and Gabe was the glue that held the story together and kept me reading."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I never knew much about the triple crown until I sat down and read this book. I love the way Nora Roberts develops the characters. I thought the scandalous plot was a little corny, but the overall book is quite well-written and entertaining. A little corniness is okay as long as the plot develops, which it does."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This is the first Nora Roberts \\"mystery\\" that I have read. In the past I have read her more traditionally romantic books, and I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. There is a breadth of information and a depth of characters here that puts this above many of her other books for me. I was genuinely interested in Kelsey and Naiomi's relationship, and pleased with the way that both of them, and Kelsey's father as well, seem to learn and grow in the course of the book. The supporting characters are also good, and there is enough detail to the descrptions of the world of horse racing to make the story feel realistic.Interestingly enough, I think the weakest character in the novel is Gabe, who seems fraught with contradictions that I think should have bothered Kelsey, given her concern for ethics and rights and wrongs. I am not disturbed by Gabe's background at all, but I am puzzled by the acceptance of him as a \\"gambler,\\" which sometimes seems to feed into some of the stereotypes abotu racing that the novel seems to be trying to contradict.Overall, I think this is a good vacation read. I enjoyed it and will look for mor eNora Roberts books from this sub-genre."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This was one of the best ones I've read in awhile. Good story, kept me going. Would highly recommend if you love Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This has so far been a great story that I have been very intrigued by. I haven't finished yet but can't wait."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Nora Roberts does it again - no surprises there. She combines mystery, romance and murder and a good story set in a backdrop of horse racing in the south. It was easy to sit down and get wrapped up in the lives of the characters in this story - I could not get to the next page soon enough. The twistes and turns of this story made it more than just another NR book. Nora Roberts has the ability to weave a tail that can hold you from start to finish - definately worth you time."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I really liked this book. I don't usually read Nora Roberts but this book was worth reading. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"No one is better than Nora Roberts in combining romance and suspense. I absolutely love this novel. I purchased it some time ago in hard back and I have re-read the whole books or only certain passages so many times it is ridiculous. Ms. Robert's character development is so good that any author could take notes and pointers for her. The main characters of Kelsey and Gabe are so well thought out and so well written that by the end of the novel you feel as though they are real people that you have known forever. Roberts brings you into the world of horse racing and you get so involved that you would swear you are working at on of the two ranches featured in the novel. The minor characters are also well thought out and provide complete purpose to the novel. The love story that is the main premise of the book burns slowly and with purpose until the two characters finally collide and fall passionately in love. Roberts does a great job of making them friends first and allowing them to get to know each other. Once they fall in love the support and understanding between the two characters is sweet and incredibly honest and sincere. This is a food read. I whole-heartedly recommend the book for any current Nora Roberts fans or for anyone considering starting to read her books. This is Nora at her finest."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Love her books. Although a little predictable, it was still entertaining.This is a nice vacation book because it is a feel good book. Could of read this book all day."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This is a story of a mother and daughter who were reunited after 20 + years and the ill feelings between the 2 families. It also has a good look into the horse racing life. Lots of adventure, murder and of course Nora's usual doses of sex and intrigue. It's not the most exciting of her books, but very worth the read."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I love this book! I am a big horse lover, and I have a family member in the racing industry, so this book really caught my attention. If you have any interest in horses, or have ever read a Nora Roberts book, this is a book for you!"},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Ms. Roberts provides a fascinating insight into the world of thoroughbred racing and the human commitment involved in racing.Her characters come to life and it's a pleasure to watch them deal with a truly creative story problem. The setting drew me in as well.This is a solid read that I have enjoyed each of the three times I've read it."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"True Betrayals is yet another hit from Roberts, although this time, she has inserted the unique element of a Thoroughbred farm into the mix. Kelsey, our heroine, is out of sorts with her life, lacking direction or true purpose - insert the long-lost mother, who she previously believed was dead. Gabe, the hero, is a gambler turned breeder, bent on rising above his bad boy past to succeed in his one true passion, horse racing.Gabe and Kelsey share the typical Nora Roberts romance - nothing to scoff at, but with a little dash of humor, and a lot of well-written chemistry, they're drawn together. What sets this book apart is the detailed description of Thoroughbred horse racing, seen from the breeder/owner point of view. Thoroughbred racing is not a subject I claim to know much about, so I don't know if Roberts was accurate in her descriptions or not. What I do know is that there was enough believable detail that the horse racing scene, and horses themselves, were integral parts of the overall storyline; this romance would not have been a success without them.If you're a horse breeder yourself, you may or may not enjoy this book - Roberts is detailed enough that you might find yourself picking apart the details and not paying attention to the story. If you're not, I highly recommend this book to both new and old Roberts fans. The villain is pretty well known from the start, but there is enough suspense to keep you intrigued, and of course, its hard not to fall in love with either Naomi or the horses. Kelsey can get annoying with her constant dwelling on her life purpose, but Gabe is a likeable enough character for both of them. Can't miss with this one."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This was my first Nora Roberts book. I've had it for a couple years before I had time to start a new book. Once I opened it I was hooked. It has murder, lust, and suspense. It's a total page turner.

So there I was at the store looking for a new book to read... tried to look for a different author when the cover of True Betrays caught my eyes and I ended up buying it... anyway I loved. This book is different from the other ones I read from N.R. it was a very nice surprise... the romance was there, but also lot's of family stuff that you can identify with, day by day situations, mystery and everything else you want to see in a good book!Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This is one special book! Not only has Ms Roberts written a beautiful romance, but what makes this book outstanding is the portrayal of a mother's love and the sacrifices she makes and has made for her daughter. While many, like myself, would have wanted to see the real villain punished for the many misdeeds at the end, the fact that this does not happen only gives the book more strength. Wonderful, Ms Roberts, and thank you for writing this beautiful book."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Kelsey Byden didn't quite know what she wanted to do with her life, but that was before her mother came back from the dead. Soon Kelsey is voluntarily moved from her high end Georgetown apartment and into the new world of Virigina horse farms and the racing elite to be with the mother she never knew -- a mother who spent ten years in prison for a crime she may or may not have been justified in committing. In Virginia Kelsey meets Gabe, a high rolling horse owner with just enough luck on his side to escape a horrible past. Then there's Kelsey's grandmother, who is not pleased with recent developments....The story is entertaining, if not exactly logical in terms of the horse racing details. Kelsey certainly finds herself in the horse world, becoming a spokesperson and budding assistant trainer in the course of several short months. In short, it's a guilty pleasure. If the mother-daughter relationship won't hook readers at the beginning, the developing romance will. After all, it's horses and romance. What better combination is there?"},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This is a great book. Takes you behind the world of horse racing. Lots of twists and turns. Really enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Definatly a page turner and book to keep you interested (and inside) on these hot summer days. Kelsey and Gabe are easy to like and the story easier to fall into. The characters are real and complex and the overall theme on horseracing and life on a horse farm is endearing and only adds to the overall enjoyment of this book. Highly reccommended to Robert's fans."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I read this novel about 3 years ago when I was a freshmen in high school and I know it may seem a bit advanced for my age at the time but I was totally blown by the plot.

Currently I'm in looking into purchasing more novels by Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"While I loved the drama and action that always accompany a Roberts novel, I was particularly intrigued by the setting of this one.

She throws a little bit of everything in this novel to make it one of her best...betrayal, murder, romance and of course--love. The title says it all. I was hooked from the very first page."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I think Nora Roberts has a fantasy with horses and horse farms, as we've seen in her books Irish Thoroughbred, Irish Rebel and now True Betrayals which was written in 1996. Unlike the other two, True Betrayals is not pure romantic fiction but a blend of several genres. To me, it was very interesting and kept me amused and entertained for several hours.Kelsey Byden was led to believe that her mother, Naomi Chadwick, had been dead for quite a few years and when she received a letter from her mother asking if she'd come visit her, she was an emotional wreck. It seems the real reason her mother wasn't a part of her life as she grew up was the fact that she had been in prison for killing her lover. Talk about shock value! Kelsey decides to visit her mother to try to come to terms with her emotions - Kelsey had recently divorced and just finding out her dead mother was very much alive was enough to make anyone emotionally unstable and made Kelsey question everything in her life.Naomi has a working horse farm in Virginia and Kelsey goes to try to make sense out of her life. Sounds like a typical plot line, right? Well, sort of, but if Nora Roberts is writing it, you can bet there are a few twists and turns along the way. Like Kelsey being thrown into a situation that could result in another murder.Can the trainer who works for her mother be the answer to Kelsey's broken heart? Can Kelsey ever trust her mother again after being deceived by her for so many years? Will Kelsey ever believe in herself again? I won't give away any of the plot, you'll have to read and enjoy this one for yourself!I do have to say that the plot is not the part of the book that I enjoyed the most - sure there's a little mystery thrown in just to keep things interesting. Sure there is lots of romance and sorting of feelings toward the mother-daughter relationship. But what I enjoyed the most were the descriptions of the horse ranch, the surrounding areas, actual workings of the ranch, etc. Nora Roberts is first rate at painting a very vivid mental image and I found myself slipping off to Virginia and owning a ranch of my own in my imagination while reading this book. The lush green landscape, the openness of the working ranch, the racetrack - ah, it sounded like pure heaven.The plot is very predictable: everyone lives happily-ever-after, mother and daughter are reunited, true love waits for Kelsey, etc., etc. What makes the story enjoyable is the mix that Roberts has perfected - not just pure romance, but a little mystery and intrigue also."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Kelsey Byden thought she knew her life, but was devastated when she received a letter from the mother that she thought was dead. Naomi thought it best since she was in jail for murder, but now that she is out and found a life of her own, she wants to see her daughter. When Kelsey visits her mother at her horse farm, her life changes forever. It is there that she has to come to terms with Naomi, and meets her future in Gabe.This was a well-written book with a lot of information about horses and horse racing. The interaction between Naomi and Kelsey was very intense, but I found the character Gabe lacking."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"&quot;True Betrayals&quot; is a fabulous book that will definitely keep you reading.

After getting over the initial shock, Kelsey decides to travel to her mother's thoroughbred farm in Nothern Virginia. Kelsey has to deal with her family's strong disapproval, especially from her grandmother, but decides that she really must meet the woman who gave her life. Kelsey arrives on the farm and slowly begins to bond with her mother and the handsome man who owns the neighbouring farm, Gabe. This story is full of betrayal, sabotage, romance, and excitement. Overall, a highly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I'm a Nora Roberts fan and a horse-lover, so my expectations for this book were high. The book didn't disappoint, providing an entertaining story, strong characters to love and hate, and some mystery as well. Although she obviously did her homework about horse racing and the horse world, there were still inaccuracies that got in the way of my enjoyment of the story. Additionally, I found the analagies and puns about card-playing and roulette and other forms of gambling to be overbearing -- one of those times you just want to say &quot;We get the point, OK? He's a gambler.&quot; Perhaps BECAUSE my expectations were so high, it doesn't rate 5 stars, but still it was a good story and worthy of staying in the bookshelf."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"THIS WAS MY FIRST NORA ROBERTS READ!

First, the heroine was betrayed byher family that her mother's dead, when she was actually in prison formurder. When she actually meets her mother, that's when the storypicks up. Though I like horses, the story behind horse racing never really caught my interest. There's a lot of sabotage in the horse racing industry that I never knew about. Nora made it a little more interesting to me. I felt the romance between the hero and the heroine was a bit swift. By the end of the story, the true betrayal will have you saying, &quot;No, it can't be!&quot; The action and drama was enough to keep me flipping the pages."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I just finished reading True Betrayals and then went and purchased two more of Nora Roberts books. The lady just keeps you wanting to read more and more. Where she gets her wealth of information is a wonder, but she certainly does a fine job. I have yet to read one of her books that I haven't loved. This one fell right in line. If the writer doesn't cry, the reader probably won't either. I wonder if these books get to her in that way. I hope she never quits. I will pass this book on to my reading friends."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"True Betrayals was an exciting story with lots of romance and suspense. One of Roberts' best. It gave me an interesting look into the world of horse racing and an intriguing romance between Gabe Slater and Kelsey Byden and I am a sucker for a good romance. I have a tendency to enjoy her older work more than her current work and right now I'm reading Sacred Sins which has Ben Paris, who is maybe a bit more of a handful than Slater. All in all, a good read. One that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Excellent story - a real treat and the typical Nora Roberts novel that I have come to love. If you enjoy race horses, romance, adventure and mystery, True Betrayals is your book. To summarize, 26 year-old Kelsey Byden, recently divorced, and definitely raised with the upper crust, receives a letter from a mother she thought was long dead. Her father, Phillip Byden and Grandmother, Millicent raised her to believe that her mother had died when she was a baby. Her grandmother is a hard-core social climber, expecting no less from her granddaughter. Her dad is an English Professor at Georgetown University, very kind and soft-spoken and very much under the rule of his controlling mother. Kelsey confronts her father as he admits that her mother had asked him to tell their daughter (who was only three years old at the time) she died after she was arrested and sent to prison for killing a man. The story begins to unfold as Kelsey decides to meet her mother, Naomi Chadwick, who owns a thoroughbred horse farm, Three Willows, in Virginia. There, Kelsey connects immediately, heart and soul, creating a new life, one of hard work, long days and many rewards, completely opposite the elite socially correct life her grandmother expects of her. She falls head-over-heels with the horses and begins to understand and become attached to the mother she never even knew existed. Along with this new life comes a new love, rugged Gabe Slater, a man raised on the wrong side of the tracks by a dead-beat father. Gabe is a gambler and has overcome the odds to make something of him and his horse farm, Longshot. The more Kelsey is drawn to the life of a thoroughbred caretaker, the more she is determined to delve into the somewhat vague facts of her mother's trial 23 years ago. Some things come full circle and along with the excitement of the Kentucky Derby and the race at Belmont, all leading to a Triple Crown event for one of Gabe's prize horses, Double or Nothing, comes murder, blackmail and cut throat tactics by men who are willing to do anything to win the golden purse. Connections of murder and greed begin to unravel in both past and present occurrences. True Betrayals is a story that keeps the reader hooked until the very last page. The characters are completely likeable and the storytelling comes with many surprises. It's a book that is hard to put down, leaving the reader sorry to see it come to an end."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Though I enjoyed Nora Roberts' novels, I took a sabbatical from them as too often one novel had too many similarities with the next. Needing escapism reading, I picked up some of her books again. I have found the same issue with some of the trilogies, but True Betrayals stands on its own. Characters are well developed. When trouble occurs in two of the horse farms, the culprit or culprits are not obvious and do not become apparent until revealed later in the book. There is a well developed connection between characters. I think it is one of her better novels and highly recommend it to anyone - especially Roberts fans."},{"Title":"Wings in the Night: The Weird Works of Robert E. Howard, Volume 4","review":"Wildside Press deserves again highest praise for this thoroughly edited series of Robert E. Howard's weird/fantastic stories. Not only for fans of Robert E. Howard this series is (and most certainly will be for a very long time) THE edition to go for.Volume 4 of the series contains with \\"Wings in the Night\\", \\"Worms of the Earth\\" and three \\"Conan\\" tales some of Howard's most famous stories, which will probably be already known by any serious Howard fan, but are otherwise an absolute \\"must read\\" for those new to Howard's work.In spite of my praise for this excellent series, there is one point of criticism and disappointment, which should not be left unmentioned: While Volumes 1 - 3 contained 240 pages, which made the price for each volume not exactly cheap, but at least acceptable, Volume 4's page count has been slashed down to meagre 179 pages (with the price nonetheless remaining the same). I know that small publishing houses have to make a living too and am also willing to pay a higher price for hardcover or any other beautifully styled editions. Nonetheless I am disappointed with this down sized edition, especially as Wildside Press has shown with Volumes 1 - 3 that they can give us readers more \\"Howard\\" in one book. So as a Howard fan (who will nonetheless continue to buy the hardcover editions of this series) I rate this book five stars, as a (greedy) consumer I rate it three stars.In spite of my criticism I am looking forward to the fifth book of the \\"Weird Works of Robert E.Howard\\" series and would like to thank the staff of Wildside Press for their great efforts which they put into this edition."},{"Title":"Wings in the Night: The Weird Works of Robert E.

He sets out to deal with this menace methodically.3.5 out of 5One of Bran Mak Morn's subjects is being crucified while he is visiting some Roman commanders.

John Betancourt should be commended for his efforts to bring REH to new readers.Howard wrote with an intensity that, in my opinion, is unmatched in modern literature-the worst of Howard is far better than the best of many.This volume contains one Solomon Kane story, One Bran Mak Morn story and the first three Conan stories that saw print; while these are not the best Conan stories that Howard wrote, they are far better than any produced by his imitators (including best-selling author Robert Jordan).The volume itself is nicely bound and has a nice dust jacket; while it is, perhaps, not of the same quality as the volumes produced by Donald Grant in the 70's and 80's, it is a giant step up from the paperback versions that have been the staple of new Howard readers for the last 30 years.For those who have not read Howard before, I highly recommend this volume-in fact, I highly recommend the whole series. I envy those of you who are just discovering Howard-as I said before, the worst of Howard is far better than the best of many."},{"Title":"Wings in the Night: The Weird Works of Robert E. Howard, Volume 4","review":"This volume is a little different, inasmuch as it contains almost all stories about Howard's super warriors, Kane, Kull and Conan, apart from the Cairn on the Headland, which you could call a story about a reincarnated warrior of that ilk, if you like.Weird Works 4 : Wings in the Night - Robert E.

HowardWeird Works 4 : Cairn on the Headland - Robert E. HowardWeird Works 4 : Tower of the Elephant - Robert E. HowardSolomon Kane is deep in cannibal country, when he comes across even worse. Flying man-beasts that are too many for him to fight, and he is overcome.When he wakens, he realises he is alive, even though he should not be, and is told of the akaanas, or flying-men, and realizes they may be the source of the Mediterranean harpy legend.Kane has an advantage against them the others do not, he has firearms, and the staff of N'Longa. He sets out to deal with this menace methodically.3.5 out of 5One of Bran Mak Morn's subjects is being crucified while he is visiting some Roman commanders. This does not sit well with him or his aide, as he feels the punishment does not fit the crime, and the Romans are making a joke of doing what they will with the barbarians.Bran has a plan for revenge on the Roman who gave the order, but Gonar cautions him against using mystic means. Bran ignores here, and seeks the Black Stone with the help of a were-woman. What he unleashes is a lot more than he bargained for.4 out of 5King Conan is bored. Politics and statecraft and maps, and all that stuff.In a dream, a man magically enhances his sword, and that certainly comes in handy later when the odd traitor and demon relieves the tedium of the ruling class.4 out of 5King Conan's army of Aquilonians has been smashed by a far superior force, led by a wizard. Conan refuses to sign over his kingdom, and the wizard throws him in a dungeon.He escapes an assassin and a monster, and rescues a wizardly rival that Tsotha had imprisoned. This wizard, please, summons a flying steed to bear Conan back to his kingdom, to take revenge.4.5 out of 5Another reincarnation type horror, with a Norse flavor. Nice to be given necessary supernatural artifacts via the reapparance of centuries dead ancestors, when that happens, that is for sure.3.5 out of 5Conan is in thieving mode here. In a tavern, he is asking the assembled crowd of nogoodniks why no-one has stolen a famous jewel from this tower.They tell him because it is guarded by some very nasty things.He, of course, investigates, and meets a master thief attempting the same thing.Humans, animals, a giant spider and a wizard are to be encountered, not to mention an alien.3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Chinese On the Move (3CDs + Guide): The Lively Audio Language Program for Busy People","review":"Chinese On The Move is a lively, sound effect and rock riff filled language CD that gets the listener into the Chinese language right away.

From a technical aspect, the maps are really quite good, considering the limited tools and data that Ptolemy had at his disposal. There are many mistakes, those about Africa and Asia are extreme, but it is possible to recognize the general shapes of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The descriptions of how to determine locations from astronomical observations and the manner whereby it is interpreted is a classic example of stretching a technology to its' limits. For somewhere in the neighborhood of fifteen centuries, his maps were not significantly improved, which is a technical achievement that may be unequaled in any other field.From the political and social realm we see that the Mediterranean is the hub of the world, with China and India a significant, albeit peripheral part. Africa below the Sahara desert is a great unknown, as there is little more than an empty spot on the map. North Africa is simply Libia and southern Africa is Ethiopia.The translators have done a very good job with what was a very difficult subject. They begin with a great deal of explanation and close with a series of appendices that clarify many of the intermediate points. There is also a section of maps, where Ptolemy's are compared with modern ones. However, this is a translation of the theoretical chapters only, so if you are looking for the complete text, you will have to look elsewhere.One of the greatest technical triumphs of the ancient world, Ptolemy's Geography can teach us much about the world in which he lived and worked. I found this translation of his great work to be well worth reading."},{"Title":"A River View and Other Hudson Valley Essays","review":"As a person who grew up in th area in which Burroughs wroteabout, I feel that he caputered it very well.He is an great writer and I would recommend him to anyone."},{"Title":"The Violent Land","review":"This is a must read for Amado fans.

The story takes its merry time to reach an obvious conclusion. Also, the characters are often hard to keep apart as they intermingle in various ways. As well, Amado keeps an objective viewpoint throughout and sometimes seems to be condoning the actions of the &quot;Colonels&quot; and the inequities of the whole social structure he is describing, which is unusual considering his leftist past.Not to be underestimated, however, is the sensuous atmosphere which pervades the book, the beautiful descriptions, and the sometimes (though not often enough) biting irony."},{"Title":"Key Words of a Kinship; Primitive Oneness of the English and the Tamils","review":"Amazing.

To help us navigate what we need to do in the military, we constantly deal with regs and specifications.

When I saw that it was written by a former chaplain, I was afraid it might be heavily religious. But while it had a small section on religion, it was not at all preachy. It's more of an interactive self-help program than a book you read from cover to cover. It comes with two detachable questionnaires similar to what marriage counselors use. Only instead of meeting with a counselor, the couple read and discuss advice provided in the book's discussion guide. After reading some of the advice on a number of different topics from sex to even pets, I wish the book were around years ago. I can't say for sure if it would have saved me from marrying the wrong person for the wrong reasons, but I think it can probably help a lot of couples before and after marriage.

The storytelling is crisp and detached. We are lucky to have so acute an observer of the passing scene. Universality is achieved through the careful attention paid to minute particulars. Reports of artistry and fidelity make points in understated fashion.A man is rewarded with a house for giving information. When the debriefing is over hardly anyone comes to see him. He was an ordinary colonial child. It was his fate to be detained for five weeks in a dirty cell for merely taking a picture. Later he joins the counter-revolutionary forces. Horror comes slowly. Debriefing doesn't describe methods and experience. His parents may have spoiled him when they let him use a parachute.A little boy dies on the barbed wire near his house playing a character from Sleeping Beauty. In another story the character doesn't know what day it is because the areas for services, churches and schools, have closed. With a mother gone and having undergone other losses, villagers and members of the family are going away from the land, carrying belongings. On the way through Kruger Park the grandfather, old and slow, is lost. The family does not hope to go back to Mozambique when the war is over. The people in the new village, it is fortunate, speak their language.A twice-married man goes to a resort. The place seems to glisten with women. He flings stones into the sea and finds a ring. After advertising it in a local paper, he ends up marrying the woman who comes to claim it. The moon in the southern hemisphere seems the wrong way around. A couple rents a room to a young man because their son is to be away for eighteen months. The lodger works in a restaurant. Vera, the daughter, tells her parents that Rad, the lodger, wants to make a meal for them. Vera and Rad become involved with each other. She carries a black box for him on an airplane trip and the plane explodes.A woman leaves a conference with four members of a youth delegation. She feeds them at her house. It seems their education was interrupted by two years detention. Those two years will never be regained, she surmises. Goats live on a shipwreck island and cause erosion. Through exogamous marriage the islanders change. They are moved. Afterwards the island is used as a weather station. A tour of duty on the island lasts a year. The personnel are subject to problems with insects and mice. Then there are cats on the island. The birds and turtles are disturbed. Young men from the university travel there. They are under orders to shoot the cats.An Afrikaner farmer shoots a black man. He carries the man in his bakkie to the police station and confesses to the shooting. He had ridden with Lucas, the victim, in a vehicle in which there was a loaded weapon. Driving over a pothole, the weapon had discharged. The ending of this story is a surprise. Teresa took a leave of absence from her job and slept away from home, away from her Swedish husband, in order to find out the circumstances of the jailing of her mother, brother and sister. The husband had suspected an affair. Houseguests at a lodge troop out to witness lions eating a zebra. In the night they see the cubs in the body of the zebra. In daylight scarabs are seen devouring the stomach leavings.A man, for reason of the indemnity process, is supposed to be free. He walks and takes buses. His friends help. The movement wants him to leave the country but he enjoys being home again. He notes a fellow bus passenger as being out of place. She is someone who would treat her servants well, but place her children in segregated schools. He is now living without consequences, being underground. He finds out the woman's husband is away in Japan and that they are drawn to each other as a couple. There is an interval of closeness in the absence of an exchange of personal identifying information. After several more moves the police find him and he is brought to take a seat in an ongoing trial."},{"Title":"Jump and Other Stories","review":"N. Gordimer writes with a very gripping style.

When a whaleboat washes ashore with a man lying inside, Rachel is almost afraid to hope that the man is Richard, her husband found alive. Unfortunately, the man is Captain Jared Mitchell, sea captain of a whaling vessel who asked to be set adrift from his ship and drank himself into oblivion.Refusing to believe in Richard's death, Rachel doesn't welcome the attraction that she feels for Jared, a big gruff, hairy man so unlike her blonde husband. As Jared recovers in her parents' cabin, he loses his heart to Belle, Rachel's precocious five-year-old daughter. Though incensed that Jared rents her husband's cabin from her family, Rachel can no longer deny her attraction to the handsome captain who has opened his heart to her daughter. Their relationship would be such a sure thing if only Rachel could let go of Richard. Will she be able to let go of the past before it is too late?Full of intense emotion and love scenes set among the tempestuous background of the sea, Ms. Goodger's captivating writing is at its best. And the unanswered questions behind Richard's death add a pleasing element of mystery to this tale. And for those romance readers, who devour romantic tension, prepare for a literal feast as this read thrives on romantic adversity. Though the tension in this read proves to hold the reader's interest, the only drawback is that Rachel and Jared's constantly thinking that the other does not love them gets a little overcooked. However, this is definitely a read to be savored again and again-a keeper."},{"Title":"Gifts From the Sea","review":"In the days of the thriving whaling industry, the residents of Truro, Massachusetts survive by recovering cargo from the shipwrecks near their Cape Cod community. Rachel Best and her husband Richard have lived in Truro all their lives. He knows the nearby Atlantic Ocean as well as anyone, but when he disappears at sea, everyone else concludes he died. Rachel refuses to believe her spouse is dead so every morning regardless of the weather she walks to the ocean expecting Richard to return.Sea Captain Jared Mitchell has wanted to die ever since he blamed himself for the accidental deaths of his wife and daughter. Unable to cope, he tries a strange suicide by commanding his whaling crew maroon him in the sea. The ocean fails to listen to his plea; so on a cold autumn day, Rachel finds the whaleboat containing the half-dead Jared. She and her family nurse Jared back to health. Jared falls in love with Rachel who begins to reciprocate, but she feels guilty because she still believes Richard is coming home.GIFTS FROM THE SEA is an insightful American romance that is excellent when it concentrates on a second chance at love though closure from the previous relationship has not occurred. When the novel meanders into unnecessary subplots, it loses some of its wallop. Jared is a compassionate hero while Rachel is more difficult to accept because her marriage was not a happy one so why one wonders why she loyally clings to a memory. Still when Jane Goodger keeps the love story of the lead couple front and center, readers receive a wonderful historical romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Gifts From the Sea","review":"Rachel Best is always watching the sea near Truro, along the Atlantic Coast, searching for her husband lost at sea months before.

But Rachel, oh what a headache she was! So she loved Richard but she knew he didnt love her and yet she held on to him so tightly and refused to believe he was dead and I didnt understand why you'd want a man who didnt love you back while you have Jared - who does care and yet she couldnt give Jared her heart completely? I didnt like that she needed to feel \\"free\\" and know for sure that Richard was dead before she could be with Jared completely. I wanted to smack her so many times. I dont think she deserved Jared. And then the misunderstanding after they had confessed their love for each other, got me so upset too. The banter between them just went on too long and I kept hoping the book would finish already. I did like Belle's relationship with Jared and that he liked the simplicity of the sea town and didnt want to leave it. However, the novel was a disappointment, which is a shame. I had read about Jared in \\"If I wait for you,\\" which is his brother's West story and had looked forward to reading Jared's story so I guess my expectations were high. I just feel Jared needed a stronger heroine - one willing to fight for his love. I must say though that this author does know how to write and be able to come up with things for h/h to do while many weeks and even months pass, giving ample time for her characters to actually get to know each other and develop. But I think it took too long for Rachel to finally embrace Jared."},{"Title":"Gifts From the Sea","review":"From the back cover:Something lost, something found...For months, Rachel Best has been watching the ocean from the beaches of Cape Cod for any sign of her missing husband, whose disappearance has left her to raise their daughter alone. Although a funeral service was held, Rachel refuses to believe her husband is truly gone. Her hopes are dashed when she helps to bring a single whaling boat ashore, only to discover not her missing husband, but a brute of a man who is his complete opposite.Captain Jared Mitchell of the Huntress was in great spirits--celebrating a successful voyage--when he was separated from his ship. But finding himself under Rachel's care, and as weak as a kitten, is too much for the hardened sailor to bear--and a painful reminder of a personal tragedy he cannot forget.Brought together by fate, Rachel and Jared sense a growing affection--and a love that can heal them from guilt and fear if they'll only take the risk...And my review:After devouring Goodger's THE PERFECT WIFE, I quickly set out to find everything this author had ever written. I expected to thoroughly enjoy GIFTS FROM THE SEA, but was never able to get more than halfway through it.My first complaint, thought a minor one, is that there's no year given for this historical novel. It speaks of whaling ships and a community that lives on the booty of shipwrecked boats (their \\"gifts from the sea\\" that provide their livelihood), yet also speaks about Santa Claus coming each year. Yes, I know the origins of Santa go waaay back, but wasn't he being called \\"St. Nicholas\\" instead of Santa Claus until the last 100 years or so? Maybe it's just me, but I found this kind of jarring, and it seemed a little out of place. Correct me if I'm wrong.Jared, the hero, was an interesting well-rounded character, and romance readers who like tortured heros will adore him. Rachel, the heroine, was a bit more difficult to like, or connect to. I could never understand why she mourned her husband so deeply, considering that he never really loved her, and that their marriage was more of a brother/sister relationship instead of husband/wife. She didn't really love her husband, yet she's dying inside wanting him back? Okay....But what really spoiled the book for me was the lack of real attraction between the hero and the heroine. Oh, he was attracted to her all right, but it seemed to be all physical. Once he recovered from his illness, he didn't think about anything but having sex with Rachel. They're constantly snipping at each other and lusting after each other at the same time. I want more of a motivation than just overactive libidos to draw a couple together.I guess I'm in the minority here, but I can't recommend buying this book. If you're still determined to read it, I would recommend borrowing it first. I'll give Goodger one more try, but so far she's been two good books and two bad ones.

This lady is not only a supremely gifted comic writer, she is a fabulous comedienne performer, giving delicious readings no veteran Hollywood or stage actress could match.

This old gal is funnier than Lucille Ball!!!"},{"Title":"Eudora Welty Reads","review":"What a joy to hear the voice of Eudora Welty! Caramel sunshine. Maybe the reviewer who wrote that the pace was too for them fast might get out the book and follow along. Or maybe they'd be more content imagining another voice and another rhyme. Their own maybe. The beauty of the written word is precisely that it can be pondered at leisure in a cocoon of one's own making. Another option is to take a risk and trust the author to speak her stories in real time. Ease on down and enjoy."},{"Title":"Eudora Welty Reads","review":"While I love reading Eudora Welty stories in print form, I was highly disappointed with the tape. Ms. Welty reads so fast it took me half of the first story to begin to be able to follow her. Having lived in the deep south, I was used to people down there telling me, a native northerner, to slow down. Ms. Welty turns the tables with this tape. If you are able to play the tape at a reduced speed, you should enjoy her rich characterizations and storylines."},{"Title":"Eudora Welty Reads","review":"I grew up a few miles from Jackson, Mississippi, where Eudora Welty lived. All of my parent's generation had the same melodious Old South speech. This speech is not the caricature heard in movies; it's an almost aristocratic, even slightly British accent, and very hard to describe. I thought it had died out until I ran across an on-line example of Welty's readings. The slow cadence is an essential element. I was so disappointed when I heard this tape. Someone surely had told her - no, must have threatened her - to read as fast as she possibly could. How sad!"},{"Title":"How Can I Keep From Singing: Pete Seeger","review":"\\"Tell a man what he may not sing,and he is still half free, even all free,. But tell him what he MUST sing if he never wanted to sing, take up his time with it so that his true voice cannot sound even in secret--there,I have seen, is slavery.\\"Pete was born in 1919,started Harvard in 1936,and because it could not hold his interest,he began a lifetime of Folk Music.There was nothing more important in his life than making music and singing his songs with other people. With his wife Toshi ,the unsung hero,always by his side and his home and family a foundation of support;Pete and his music could always be found supporting one cause or another.This book does a marvelous job of showing that Pete fought injustice all his life;no matter whether he found it in a union hall,freedom marches in the south,cotton fields or even the government of the country he so loved.Pete's whole life can be summed up in one song that is now known and sung all over the world and is a war cry against injustice and in support of freedom.\\"If I had a hammerI'd hammer in the morning,I'd hammer in the evening,All over this land.I'd hammer out a danger,I'd hammer out a warning,I'd hammer out of love and betweenAll of my brothersAll over this land.If I had a bell...If I had a song...Now I have a hammerAnd I have a bellAnd I have a song to singAll over this land.It's the hammer of justice,It's the bell of freedom,And a song about love betweenAll of my brothersAll over this land\\"Dunaway writes in an easy flowing style and has done an amazing amount of research to make sense of a life that has been central to the whole Folk Music scene that took off in the 1930's and reached its peak in the 50's and 60's and in one way or another continues till today. All one has to do is to think of,hum or hear \\"We Shall Overcome\\", \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" ,\\"Deportees\\" or any of the hundreds of other songs that Pete and his fellow travellers made so popular;and you know what an impact they made on the music scene in North America and many other parts of the world.In this book ,if you have been a fan of Pete,Woody Guthrie,Josh White,Allan Lomax,Doc Watson,Burl Ives,Bob Dylan,Mother Maybell ,The Alamacs,The Weavers,The Kingston Trio,and numerous others ;you are going to find all kinds of things that will surprise you and bring back many memories.The book has many wonderful photos as well as the words to many songs and information behind those songs.Extensive notes on each chapter will provide sources of information that is hard to believe exists.A complete Discography lists all the Pete's recordings ,arranged chronologically and each almum lists each song therein contained.Some time ago ,I found several copies of \\"Sing Out\\" magazine,so often mentioned in this book. These are from the 60's and a treasure trove of photos,articles,words and music to songs,and unbelievable information about and playing Folk Music.I checked and found that it is still being published and copies of old issues can still be purchased.\\"Where Have All The Flowers Gone?\\"Well,there are many who have left us;but many are still around;including Pete himself now 87. The music was well recorded and we are fortunate to have it ;even though it's seldom on Radio or TV. Folk Festivals still exist and mank Folk singers are still appearing at them .One of my favorites,Jackie Washington,continues to play at various venues in Hamilton,Canada.While I'm at it,and just for the benefit of anyone who is looking for something wonderful in the Folk Music area;I would highly recommend,\\"The Folk Songs of North America\\" by Alan Lomax. It has the words,music and background to hundreds of Folk Songs. Then again, you might want to find some of the Asch recordings.I have the 4-CD set of Woody Guthrie,an absolute treasure of Folk Songs.Thanks David,you did a wonderful job with this book."},{"Title":"How Can I Keep From Singing: Pete Seeger","review":"PETE SEEGER WAS MY FIRST POLITICAL HERO. HIS MUSIC RAISED MY CONSCIOUSNESS AND THAT OF MANY OTHERS OF MY GENERATION. MY UNCLE SANG WITH HIM AT FUNDRAISERS AND I MET HIM SEVERAL TIMES.

THAT WAS ALL HE SAID, AND I DID AND KEPT DOING IT UNTIL ARTHRITIS AND THE LOSS OF MY VOICE STOPPED ME.I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT PETE ALTHOUGH I DISAGREE WITH MANY OF HIS VIEWS, WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS. I CANNOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FATHOM HIS CONTINUAL BELIEF IN COMMUNISM, BUT I ALSO HAVE TO ADMIRE, GREATLY, HIS HONESTY, INTEGRITY AND ABILITY TO ALWAYS MAINTAIN HIS VALUES. IS HE A GREAT MAN? YES, WITHOUT A DOUBT, PERHAPS ONE OF OUR GREATEST EVER AND SOME OF HIS VISIONS FOR AN AMERICA OF PEACE, HARMONY AND EQUALITY SHOULD BE HONORED, NOT RIDICULED. THE BOOK IS VERY EVEN IN IT'S TREATMENT OF PETE, BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE. IT ALSO GIVES A VERY IMPORTANT IF NOT HORRIFYING LOOK AT THE HATRED, BIGOTRY AND VIOLENCE OF AMERICA THAT PETE BATTLED ALL HIS LIFE. PETE WOULD BE HORRIFIED I'M SURE TO KNOW THAT HE WAS AS MUCH AN HISTORIAN AS HE WAS ORGANIZER, AGITATOR AND PROPHET. BUT LIKE IT OR NOT HE WAS AND IS.

The story is very close to real life, except for all the violent parts."},{"Title":"Hitchcock and Selznick: The Rich and Strange Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick in Hollywood","review":"For any serious fan and student of Hitchcock, this compellingly readable book is a must. Should be on the bookshelf along with Donald Spoto's great book &quot;The Dark Side of Genius.&quot; Where Spoto's book provides excellent detail on the Hitchcock side of this strained but dynamic collaboration, Leff's book fills the gap on the Selznick end, providing both an historical perspective (Hitchcock on the rise, Selznick at the beginning of his decline) and an insightful look at the filmmaking methods of both men, striving to push the envelope in the repressive era of Will Hayes' Hollywood code. Hitch may have bridled under Selznick's heavy-handedness, his obsession with using name talent and his emphasis on dialogue and character development. Yet, many of the great Hitchcock films that came after their colloaboration bear the mark of Selznick's influence in all these areas. Mr. Leff's book offers an eminently fair rendering of each man's creative contributions and personal angst in their 10 year association, and is an important contribution to mid-20th century American film history."},{"Title":"Hitchcock and Selznick: The Rich and Strange Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick in Hollywood","review":"They were the odd couple of cinema: Hitchcock's spry, intelligent thrillers were very much at odds with Selznick's adaptions notable for their fidelity to their source. Hitchcock, in contrast, was anything but faithful to the source material of his many film adaptions. Both adaptions and original material focused on key visual images around which the plot was built. Selznick was the opposite of Hitch in that his productions were focused more on the narrative. Their collaboration managed to enrich each other's skills.Although they made few films together during their ten year \\"collaboration\\" (in reality Hitch was under contract so his status was more as suborindate than equal), most of them are hampered by their lack of cohesive styles. As producer/director they didn't hit their collborative stride until Hitch's Notorius in 1946. Most of Hitch's work was with other producers and studios for which he was loaned out like any other actor or director of the time.Nevertheless, Hitch learned valuable lessons in structuring a film for the American audience. He also managed to reach an audience that he could only have imagined before coming to America. Selznick's most valuable lesson was learning to let his directors occasionally have their way on projects.Leff's book is a bit too scholarly in tone for the average film fan but is well written and researched. It's also quite expensive given that it's a large format paperback (this probably has to do with the small audience imagined for it and the fact that it comes from the UC Press). Many of Leff's more interesting observations have turned up as commentary on a number of Criterion DVDs (particularly the Spellbound DVD released last year).There were many classic films produced during their time together but just as many misfires (Spellbound, despite it's many attributes is a good example of the disasterous turn their collaboration could take). Hitch hadn't hit the height of his powers as a director yet. His most powerful films (Rear Window, North by Northwest, Vertigo, The Trouble With Charlie, Strangers on a Train, Psycho and The Birds)loomed in his future. Nevertheless, his films from this time frame are, at times, revolutionary in one way or another (Saboteur, Shadow of a Doubt, Lifeboat among many others).This book details their work together from uneasy partnership to the truce that allowed Hitch to produce one of his most magnificient films (Notorius). Although Hitch's work has come to dominate our culture more than Selznick's (with the possible exception of Gone With The Wind), neither man would have achieved his goals without the other."},{"Title":"Hitchcock and Selznick: The Rich and Strange Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick in Hollywood","review":"This book is just what I needed for some research about this period in Hollywood. it's precise and informative. A perfect complement to some other books about the same subject."},{"Title":"Hitchcock and Selznick: The Rich and Strange Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick in Hollywood","review":"You probably couldn't find two more fascinating personalities in the history of cinema than Hitchcock and Selznick, and Mr. Leff does an excellent job providing background information and behind-the-scenes details on their collaborations. The book tends to slow down at times, mostly due to expositionary passages which are essential, but which delay getting to the good stuff.One thing I would have liked more of would have been more information on what each of these characters did away from each other. I realize that gets away from the main thesis, but I think that Mr. Leff tries to involve as many of those details as he can into his narrative but is forced to pare it down to stay on course.What's particularly interesting is how Hitchcock and Selznick virtually switched places in the Hollywood hierarchy over the course of their time together. Knowing what we know about each man in his later years lends an extra creedence to Mr. Leff's work."},{"Title":"Robespierre's rise and fall,","review":"While this book deals with Robespierre from his birth, it concentrates on his time of fame. He comes off as a most unlikeable man, and I found it hard to disagree with the picture, based as it is on solid research. Robespierre was notorious for denying a trial to people before they were executed, but it is sobering to realize that the seventy-some people executed in connection with Robespierre's fall also were denied a trial!"},{"Title":"Phoebe's Knee","review":"This book has some sweet and mildly interesting characters, but its plot borders on the ridiculous. A rather hip and apparently super-agile and -fit 65-year-old woman gets herself into unlikely situations for even a youngster, let alone an elderly mystery-solver. Add to that the &quot;evil&quot; cult which has moved into a small fictitious Vermont town and the rather silly and far-fetched goings-on leading up to an anticlimactic jumble at the end, and you have a very light, almost comical read that may be suitable for an afternoon at the beach, and I will admit that it kept me at least mildly entertained. However, the shocking number of typos and grammatical errors in the copy of the book I had were thoroughly distracting and disappointing."},{"Title":"Time remembered: With sketches from Eastern Carolina and Captiva Island : a memoir","review":"Elizabeth Pearsall's writing style is a joy.

Daddy and Grandaddies all tobacco farmers)A darling woman for writing it. Details abound deliciously. Thank you, Elizabeth!"},{"Title":"Hicksville","review":"I consider myself a graphic novel snob. And I just don't have the time or energy for poorly executed work. Lone Wolf &amp; Cub, Usagi Yojimbo, Maus, Watchmen, the Swamp Thing books, Top 10, Nausicaa, Transmetropolitan, these are the collections you'll find displayed proudly in my living room. Not only is Hicksville in that collection, but it's quickly catching up to Watchmen as the story I've most often loaned out to non-comics readers.Hicksville is self contained, consistent, and human. I never got into the whole DC/Marvel thing, but Horrocks' enthusiasm for comics history draws you in. And while he plays with that history, he weaves in compelling stories about people which are subtle and adult. Yes &quot;adult&quot;, but not in any gratuitous way. Here, it is in the way that we have all experienced life as we get older. Relationships are confusing and sad. Wounds take time to heal. Quests for answers don't always (ever?) work out as we had hoped.At first I was worried the art was too simple and sketchy. I quickly realized that I had underestimated his style. The frames have a smooth, even flow that carry you with an unhurried pace through the story. As the various threads begin to weave together, the drawings take on much of the burden of storytelling. And frames which don't need any words, don't have any.You might go back to the beginning the first time you get half way through so you can savor the art and the story before all is revealed. Don't feel bad, his unassuming style (both in drawing and in storytelling) just lowered your guard.I believe this is a great work."},{"Title":"Hicksville","review":"As an enthusiast of the comics medium, I'm very excited about this book. Hicksville shows a maturity and grace that has finally gotten beyond the pulp conventions of comics' first fifty or so years, and the anxiously antinomian hipness of the last twenty. Horrocks has deep affection for all those periods, but the voice he uses is entirely his own. In Hicksville, we have a true graphic novel, delving into character and atmosphere, rather than relentless, explosive action. Horrocks' cartoony, accessable art style never seems forced or draws attention to itself. Unlike other similarly-ambitious comics artists of his generation, such as Seth or Adrian Tomine, Horrocks never comes across as arty or forced. The plot -- with its concern with the history, art, and business of comics -- may be initally offputting for the non-comics-literate reader, but anyone who perseveres (and uses the glossary in the back) will find Horrocks' enthusiasm infectious rather than offputting."},{"Title":"Hicksville","review":"Dick Burger has made millions and is one of the most powerful people in the comics industry. He's often compared to comic legends like Jack Kirby for revitalizing the industry and Stan Lee stands in awe of him. Leonard Batts, a comics biographer, begins the process of creating the definitive book on Burger. But as Batts begins his research he finds Burger has a dark secret back in his home town of Hicksville--a small remote town in New Zealand where comics legends come and the library has books found no where else in the world. Will Batts survive discovering this secret or will it drive him to the edge of destruction?Hicksville starts off a bit slow as it takes a little bit to figure out the pacing and the interweaving of the short comics, but once you get into the story and action really pick up. This book is Dylan's love letter to the comics world, his way of perhaps saying that the best comics in the world...are those ones that aren't published. And that sometimes the biggest and most talked about folks in the industry...aren't the greatest. Sometimes it's the small quiet ones that change the world. In many ways the story line reminds me of some of the subtleness of Twain's short story \\"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven\\" as Twain makes some of the same comparisons to that the greatest in a given area might be the ones that you've never heard of before.The artwork takes a bit of getting used to, as it's not as well drawn as say Blankets or Fun Home Family Tragicomic...but it does have it's own style and grace to it, especially as he blends together the stories with the short comics--each having it's own style to set it apart. And sometimes the drawings and figures are so big that the frames themselves can't contain them and the characters take on a life of their own carrying the story with them.If you're a fan of graphic novels or the comics industry...or even if you aren't--pick up this book and give it a read. Then read it a second or third time just to see what you missed."},{"Title":"Hicksville","review":"As an outsider to the world of comics (well, I grew up on Tintin and Asterix, and love Adrian Tomine's stuff, as well as Joe Sacco), I found this book to be a bit of an exercise in navel-gazing somewhat comparable to when a novelist writes a novel about writing or the publishing industry. The book's plot revolves around the history of comics and the industry's evolution into, well, an industry. One that stifles \\"art\\" and creativity in the name of serving up the latest installment (and movie) of the spandex-clad superheroes.This somewhat whiny message is woven into the tale of a journalist trying to learn about the background of the industry's current superstar, a quest which takes him to a semi-magical small town in New Zealand, where everyone reads and appreciates comics. Horrock's exhibits a remarkable dexterity of storytelling in sustaining the story while interspersing all manner of digressions, subplots, and asides which may or may not be real. But while this is abstractly impressive, unless one is really into the whole world of comics, it's not likely to captivate. The art is not really to my taste, I prefer more consistency and realism, but it does suit the story perfectly.

It covers the simplest things, from how to bath a kid, to how to deal with sibling rivalry. Mom's recovery from giving birth is covered, too.

The contents reflect that the writer has a through understanding of the basic fundementals of the nanny career and how the Professional nanny should function. Although I understand that the author was an aquaintance of Dr. Ben Spock, Debbie Davis, Jay Belskay, Fran Herman as well as other early childhood education pioneers, the work in this text is original and you get the sense when reading it that there are no pretenses.

I think it should be complete package."},{"Title":"The Nanny Textbook: The Professional Nanny Guide To Child Care 2003","review":"I've had the priviledge of reading this book cover to cover many times, as well as taking Anne Merchant's online classes.

Her book serves as a major source of information. However, Mrs. Merchant is a true educator, as she requires much research outside of the classroom and the course book.This first addition does have some typos and misspelled words... however, I see that as a fault of the editors and not an indication of Mrs. Merchant's understanding of the above subjects. Mrs. Merchant is a true pioneer in the education of nannies, a largely unregulated job force.

At times it seems a little too simplified, but overall it's a good book to have if you are involved in raising children as a nanny."},{"Title":"The Nanny Textbook: The Professional Nanny Guide To Child Care 2003","review":"I bought both this book and \\"The Childcare Textbook\\" from the same publisher. I was very disappointed to find out that they are actually the same book with a different title. I was going to return this one, but had somehow lost the receipt. So I'm stuck. That aside, this book was a huge let down.They market this book as a textbook, but through its generalizations, short length, and small breadth of information that is a laughable description. It is very outdated, referring to the children as \\"charges\\" and taking the stance that the nanny is more of a servant that should bend to the will of the parents rather than taking a stand on certain issues and working together towards a common goal. I read two thirds of the book, but couldn't finish it because I couldn't believe that I paid nearly twenty dollars for something that had at least two typos on every single page. This was even the second or third edition of this book, the publisher should be ashamed.It does have a few good bits of information: such as writing a contract, and making a nanny log (all of which is recommended on the countless-- and free-- nanny websites)but where it falls short is where it recommends that you download their information off their website that hasn't existed in like five years. This text book for a free online nanny training program, no longer has a nanny training program attached to it. Therefore, all of the resources that it recommends are gone with it.I really have found that a better childcare guide, one that offers more insight into actual issues with child care are the \\"What to Expect\\" books, and others aimed at parents. You have to modify the things that you are reading slightly to fit that of a child care provider but they are much more thorough, that you can notice at first glance, the \\"What to expect\\" books are four times thicker than the \\"Nanny Textbook\\" itself. Then for things like contracts, questions to ask a future employer, and conflict resolution, I just use the internet as a source.I feel bamboozled and enticed by the very name of the book. Don't let it fool you. This is no textbook. If you read it you will not pass some magical state nanny exam. A book that is one hundred and fifty pages long cannot explain the nuances of working with children from the ages of 0-18 well enough to call itself a stand alone resource.And don't forget, don't bundle your purchase with \\"The Childcare textbook\\".

It provides solid guidelines on professional skills ranging from how to bathe infants to interviewing skills as well as crucial child development knowledge and how to conduct yourself professionally while working in the most private of others' domain: their home. Being a nanny is not just about caring for children, but also knowing how to respect the private sphere of a home/family (and every one is different) while successfully carrying out her job. For parents employing a nanny, this book also gives insight to realistic expectations for your nanny as well as perspective into how challenging the role of nanny can sometimes be, so that when problems arise, solutions can be reached that work for family and nanny alike.Most importantly, this book addresses discipline which is essential to creating a safe environment in and out of the home. Discipline is often avoided by both nannies and parents - nanny fears that parents will not agree with discipline method resulting in Nanny losing her job, parents are uncomfortable with anyone else \\"judging\\" their child. The solution is for parents and nanny to approach discipline together (it is not easy after all - pooling ideas for creative and positive ways of enforcing limits is a plus) and openly communicate on a regular basis, thereby increasing their trust and understanding of one another's capabilities to discipline age-appropriately and effectively. This book provides concrete advise on how to handle this crucial and delicate issue. No discipline actually limits the fun or enriching activities that Nanny (and parents) can safely undertake with children.As a former nanny who has worked with many families with two to five children ranging in age from newborn to twelve all over the United States and in several foreign countries (with American families), I wish that I had had this book as I was a nanny!

I do think these prejudices can be true sometimes, but as I have learned to respect and even prefer older books I now see this line of thinking is just plain wrong.Some older books and author like G.K. Chesterton, C.S. Lewis and Hilaire Belloc have stood the test of time and are still read today by a great number of people, and for good reason. What they wrote remains as fresh and relative today as when it was first published; sometimes more so. This is their enduring attraction. Some authors however get forgotten, and for reasons I do not understand. Arnold Lunn is one of those authors. I had never heard of him, and after searching in vain I can only find a few of his skiing and mountaineering books in republished form. Why? I am not sure.Older books connect us to a past generation. They help us see better. Where we were and why we are here. And perhaps where we are going. I think that sometimes modern man falls into a subtle philosophical evolutionary lie that humankind if reaching further and further upwards, and therefore that which is past is necessarily of inferior quality to what we have today. This idea is not helped by the obvious advances in technology. But whether man is advancing morally and spiritually is something I have great doubts about. I believe we have lost much in terms of traditional values and I doubt many will disagree. Lunn was living at a time when these values had already very much disintegrated to a large degree in the circles he was moving, but he was still able to look ahead at a time when sexual promiscuity would be rampant (and he predicted the decade correctly when it would happen!) We owe to our ancestors and to ourselves to read their books.When Arnold Lunn, Author of \\"Now I See\\" and a well known figure in his day and contemporary of Chesterton, finally entered the Catholic Church it was a chance remark of John Henry Cardinal Newman's that nudged him through the door.\\"You approach the Church in the way of reason, you enter it in the light of the Spirit\\".What a gem! I found this book in a 2nd hand bookshop filled with mostly cheap novels. A diamond in the trash heap!I feel like this book has spoken directly to my present need. The author was convinced that logic and rational thinking could prove the veracity of Catholicism, though of course not save a person in an ultimate sense as that was down to the grace of God and personal holiness, which takes faith. Logic can take you to the doors of the Church, only faith will let you enter. I see much of the same of my own line of reasoning in this book, and it is nice to see that men before me have gone down similar paths. He speaks of men who stand at the threshold of the Church never entering, but forever spoiled against Protestantism. I see this possibly happening in my life and I do not want it. I know of authors and other Christians who remain in a sort of Christian limbo their whole lives, having studied early Church history and come to the conclusion that Evangelicalism is wrong, they look at Catholicism and are repulsed. He deals with this very real phenomenon, and for this I am grateful. If you are one who seeks for rational explanations to religion, then this book may help you in that endeavor.His was a deep struggle into the Church, not an easy one. One he was seemingly willing, one the one hand, to let linger and yet fear of remaining in that same position was strong too. And it was that fear, in spite of having been intellectually satisfied of the claims of Rome, coupled with a chance remark he came across by Cardinal Newman that pushed him over the threshold. I have found this to be true in so many men who entered the Church including Chesterton. They are convinced long before they have the courage to take that step of faith.There many funny moments in the book like when he mentions the creed of a Church which has left aside belief in the supernatural. Rather than 3 person in one God, it's 3 persons and no god. Making reference to the drawing power of such a limp religion.He gives a very funny (in my opinion!) story of a time he went to seance and while he comes to believe that these spirits do exist he doesn't think they are very smart. I won't give it away as he probably tells it better than I could recount it.Here are some choice quotes from a man who was apparently fairly well known in his day and the other of a few books relating to various subjects including mountaineering:\\"The Humanist avoids certain actions, not because these actions offend God but because they injure other people.\\" p.10\\"It is much easier for a man to return to an intellectual acceptance of Christianity than to that devotional life which is the essence of all true religion\\" p.14\\"I had been converted by reading certain books, and had come to the conclusion that the case for Christianity was proved to the satisfaction of the jury. I had reached this conclusion without saying a prayer or entering a church, or in any way changing my way of life.\\" p.15Quoting Wesley here: \\"I have frequently observed that there are two very different ranks of Christians, both of whom may find favour with God, a higher and a lower rank.\\" p.16Questioned by an Evangelist after his conversion \\"\\"Do you know the Lord Jesus Christ?\\" he asked. \\"I do not\\" I replied \\"but I'm quite sure that He knows me, and this assurance is not without its influence on my life.\\"\\" p.16\\"If it were true, which it is not, that no man is converted by by logic, reason can nonetheless help a man to retain his faith. It is a crime against the rising generation to send out young men into the world unprovided with any defense against the attacks of militant atheism. The reasoned arguments for the faith are not sufficiently strong to coerce the unwilling into faith, but they are stronger than any argument which can be brought against Christianity, and are quite sufficiently strong to reinforce and to strengthen the will to believe\\" p.16He quotes one of many of Chesterton's prophetic words on page 128 regarding the suicide of thought, but Lunn was also a prophet in his own right. Written in 1933, this quote (though you really should real the whole paragraph to get the full context) was prophetic: \\"The old-fashioned prejudice against seducing a virgin was based on the assumption that for the woman such a fate was \\"worse than death,\\" To our granddaughters in 1960 such a fate will, perhaps, seem not worse than, but as common as death\\" p.19\\"The function of religion is not, as professor Huxley assumes, to provide cultured gentlemen with emotions similar to those produced by a Beethoven symphony; it may restrain the cultured gentlemen in question from doing things they would very much like to do and encourage them to do things that are difficult to do.\\" p.22There are many larger quotes I have underlined which I have not rewritten here as I do not want to give too much of the book away and it would take too long to rewrite them anyway. So I simply encourage you to buy the book. It would be nice to see a reprint of this book, and it is only sad that this author is not more well known in our day, as the issues he deals with are just as pertinent today as they were 80 years ago.Throughout the book the author mentions other books that helped him along and which may be of benefit to you too.

This is a masterful spiritual biography. With each book I read I am always considering whether or not the book will be worth reading again; this book, God-willing, I hope to read every year for the rest of my life. Lunn was an incredible writer and, as typical with many English writers I've read, has a wonderful sense of humor.The book is essentially a timeline of the intellectual arguments Lunn wrestled with that lead to his conversion to the Catholic Church. His logic is valid, sound and easy to follow. There are a number of references to books that aided his decision to convert and curious tidbits that I think any reader would find fascinating. For example, Lunn is very sympathetic (which may not be the right choice of word, but think in terms of an admirable type of sympathy)of John Wesley, who pops up throughout the book, in such a way that any Methodist will appreciate and any Catholic, who doesn't already respect Wesley, might be convinced to think differently.It's an enjoyable read and I think Catholics will find it profitable to help fortify their defense of faith, non-Catholics (Christian or not) will find this book a formidable challenge to their faith and all who read it will find it immensely joyful."},{"Title":"Now I see","review":"An autobiography describing the author's conversion to Catholicism, with delightful discussion of his successes in confirming, for himself, fundamental doctrine"},{"Title":"Now I see","review":"When Arnold Lunn, Author of \\"Now I See\\" and a well known figure in his day and contemporary of Chesterton, finally entered the Catholic Church it was a chance remark of John Henry Cardinal Newman's that nudged him through the door.\\"You approach the Church in the way of reason, you enter it in the light of the Spirit\\".People don't tend to read old books anymore.

The target audience for this book is those primarily interested in health research, but it useful for all those who must make their way through journal articles. Greenhalgh goes through the basics and touches on important issues.

As a med student, I loved it and found it very practical. It contains a great deal of material on how to evaluate the type, methodology, and statistical methods of research papers. There is no glossary, and in places the layout is hard to look at."},{"Title":"How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence Based Medicine","review":"This is a very readable and informative book on how to read and assess medical research papers. The author touches on something broadly applicable to almost any field, and that is how to exercise critical thinking, how to ask the right questions, what logical traps to avoid. This is so doctors don't get fooled by eager pharmaceuticals representatives; Also, for patients to educate themselves in Bayesian statistics so they can overcome their doctors flawed tests recommendations. This book will also help researchers conduct their own experiment in integer ways to derive informative results for society at large. It will also help policymakers not being fooled by flawed research studies.The author has been criticized for not often technically describing the statistical tests she refers to. But, this was not the author's purpose. She states right upfront in the preface, if you want to dig deep into the technicalities getClinical Epidemiology: A Basic Science for Clinical Medicine. The author has conveyed something more important than providing another treaty in statistical epidemiology. Frankly, if you are interested in the various statistical tests, Wikipedia will do just fine. But, what tests to use when and how are very important considerations she addresses with much expertise. What analytical framework and methodology to use in what research situation. How to judge if such research conducted by others used inappropriate frameworks. Those are tough issues often more difficult to handle proficiently than conducting statistical tests.She provides extensive information on related subjects. Her introduction to Bayesian statistics in chapter seven is really clear. She explains the likelihood ratio in the most straightforward way I have seen yet. Her chapter on economic analysis is surprisingly insightful as she defines all the different types of such analysis. Appendix I consists in a very rich set of checklists for finding, appraising, and implementing [medical] evidence. It is a good reference guide to the entire material within the book. Her chapter on statistics for the non-statisticians is outstanding. She actually teaches you a lot about statistics without going into the math. She even uncovers several traps that many professional statisticians may fall into especially when blinded by economic interests. Her discussion on distinguishing causation from correlation or regression is well thought out.In summary, this book offers a lot of valuable qualitative information to better interpret quantitative research for both the layperson and the expert alike."},{"Title":"How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence Based Medicine","review":"&quot;How to Read a Paper&quot; reads more like a short essay than a book. While it is well written and often full of spirited discussion, this text is somewhat short on substance and generally too simplistic. The author rarely delves beyond the surface when explaining and exporoing this field, leaving me, at least, unsatisfied. Whereas a simplistic approach to any field may be useful, the amplification of themes once introduced is where real learning occurs. This book falls short, where several other excellent texts in this field carry on. I do like the author's style, and would encourage her to scribe a more thorough text... but if I were you I'd wait for that effort before buying this one."},{"Title":"How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence Based Medicine","review":"This book is an excellent, easy to read guide for anyone who needs a better understanding of research studies, and how to evaluate their applicability and reliability.

If you look online you can find the individual articles scattered here and there and at one point I even found all the articles (essentially this book) as an ebook available for free download.I refer to this book time and time again when I need a refresher on the various aspects of research and also to verify that I hit on all the points when evaluating a study.Great book, very user friendly."},{"Title":"How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence Based Medicine","review":"This book is a good way of getting to know eved. research--great way to understand the subject also.Thanks for getting it to me on time"},{"Title":"How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence Based Medicine","review":"This book definitely gets into the nitty-gritty of scientific papers but with a sense of humor that keeps me coming back.

It is I believe a partner to a very thick book on the treatment of chronic depression. There are very few effective treatments for chronic depression. He seems to have found an approach, which offers patients real and statisically real help. This Patient's Manuel is actually more a pamphlet and introduces the patient to the CBASP (Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy). When I first read the manual I couldn't make much sense out of it. It seemed too distant from my own chronic depression. The manual was not written as a self-help book or as a book explaining the tormenting aspects of depression. It is intended to be used in conjunction with a therapist who uses the CBASP Method. After several sessions with my psychologist I read the manual again. This time things started to click in and make sense. It explains and shows how certain techniques are used to address the \\"Global thinking\\" of the chronically depressed. It is helpful to understanding and work with the CBASP as a patient.I've given it four stars, because I find the word \\"Manual\\" in the title misleading and I think the price is rather high for just 40 pages. I didn't feel that the manual prepared me for the therapy. It has, however, helped me during the therapy. This help alone is worth four stars."},{"Title":"A Simple Guide to Chinese Ingredients and Other Asian Specialties","review":"This book is small but packed with great information.

Nearly every page is full of clear, color photos of various types and brands of ingredients with a full description of each, from fresh fruits and vegetables to sauces and dried ingredients, plus a description of the item in Chinese so that one could just go to a store and point at the description. Sometimes when I go into an Asian grocery store, I'm a little overwhelmed and awestruck by the variety of unknown items. This book certainly helps to clarify things, as well as give you new ideas to experiment with. Another helpful aspect is the alternative names of items, plus actual brands that your local store might carry.

I mistakenly thought the book was about Tango. - I had hoped it might give me some insight or means to finding that elusive communication between dancers. I should have read the fine print before buying: 87 pages, 5\\" X 5\\".What you get is an attractive small book, very nicely laid out, with 17 B&W; full page head-shots of couples with eyes closed in embrace and 24 pages of quotes on Zen, Dance and other topics (the kind of quotes that make nice signature tag-lines). Tango Zen Exercises begin on page 69. The exercise are comprised of instruction and photos: 1 paragraph on Warm Up, 2 pages on Individual Standing, 3 pages on Stretching, 3 pages on Individual Walking, 2 pages on Couple Standing and 2 pages on Couple Walking.That's it.My advice is to take one of Mr. Park's live workshops on Tango Zen - the book might have more value for you then, it has little value to me now. But then it was only $10."},{"Title":"Tango Zen: Walking Dance Meditation","review":"I bought the small booklet Tango Zen which handles tango as moving meditation.In pair dance one's attention is in feelings and sensations bought by music, dance movement, sociality and sexuality - in the here and now that is!Where in sitting meditation the body is still and the mind gets used to being still and alone, the motion of dance, its naturally flowing action and sociality - why not sexuality too - is a suitable next step to conceiving the whole spectrum of life in a meditative way: flowing, participating in life, enjoying life without grasping anything too much.A very nice idea - I do not know how much new there is in the book if you know lots about Zen, but the book is quite cheap/small and easy to read: a suitable reminder of a nice way to meditate in motion!"},{"Title":"Tango Zen: Walking Dance Meditation","review":"Tango is hot!

The tango is on MTV, in new movies, and young people worldwide are discovering that it is the best way to have fun, meet people, and be incredibly beautiful and sexy all at once!So who knew that you could combine the tango with meditation? It seems that not only can you do so, but even Buddha himself practiced meditation while walking. Zen meditation can be practiced in more active ways than the sitting posture. Chan Park says \\"One can meditate while dancing Tango, experiencing deeper appreciation of physical, emotional, and even spiritual aspects of inner-self.\\" You know those books that offer a new idea whose time has come? This may well be one of them. Tango zen is such a beautiful concept that it is bound to catch on.This book includes a bit on Zen philosophy as well as well-illustrated exercises which should help any beginner to get started. It is a small book, but it contains all you need to learn this fascinating new meditation/dance technique - and the book can be easily held in the hand while learning to do the exercises. It does not attempt to give extensive instruction on all tango moves.Anyone can benefit from this technique, and Chan Park's book is highly recommended. Personally, I would be very happy to see our parks full of people doing tango meditation together! What a civilized sight that would be!"},{"Title":"Tango Zen: Walking Dance Meditation","review":"Tango and Zen - this sounds like a culture clash. But it isn't. Of course everything is Zen once you are in it. But maybe Tango is a little bit more, just because there is no direct familiarity.For everybody doing Zen this familiarity is quite obvious, because one should try to reach maximum awerness every single moment.But for most Tango Dancers this is a new approach. Normaly we just dance, try to do the correct step, stay upright, opening our mind for what the partner is up to now. Once we get in the Zen-Mind, all this is not important anymore. We are there, floating free, just music, all movement. Doing Tango-Zen helps us to reach this state of mind, it combines the best of both worlds."},{"Title":"Tango Zen: Walking Dance Meditation","review":"As a tango dancer, I am all too aware of the tension in tango between the show and stage style and the more intimate milonguero style. There has been a tendency for the showy style to be considered to be more advanced but, in truth, the levels of skill, musicality and connection are so much higher in milonguero. I was so delighted to discover this book which encapsulates within a fusion of tango and zen, all that is wonderful in tango. This book ought to be required reading for all those who find the athletic, gymnastic form of tango neither possible nor to their taste. Power to your elbow Chan Park! You have made an old tanguero very happy."},{"Title":"Tango Zen: Walking Dance Meditation","review":"For the cost of this book plus shipping, I didn't feel I got value. Also, some of his instruction for the particulars of tango is very different than instruction I've received from many teachers from Bueno Aires where Argentine Tango originated."},{"Title":"Tango Zen: Walking Dance Meditation","review":"Chan Park is one of the finest teachers of tango. He is at the very peak of this art.He teaches like no other tango-teacher. How many tango teachers can say that?Unlike the run-of-the-mill (though very good) dancers, who take to teaching, Chan is an exception. He dances wonderfully and he teaches sensitively.Few others combine this so well. Teaching is an art and few possess the ability; fewer still are also great dancers. Chan is both!The majority of travelling tango teachers perform fancy tricks that have been well-practiced & overly-choreographed beforehand, that are designed to impress students. That's fair but few of them can teach well.Every once in a while comes a teacher who can leave you feeling like everything that came before was somehow lesser; and everything that comes after Chan Park is better. This is the reaction to Chan Park's teaching, from all of my friends, who have studied with him, in Germany, in Italy, in America and in Argentina, where he lives, in Buenos Aires.Chan Park has taught in over 20 countries and is probably one of the best known of the best known Argentine Tango dancers alive today; for Chan Park is one of the few: Naveira, Salas, Veron, Arce, Rodriguez, Frumboli . . . Chan Park.Chan Park is, in my opinion, a quiet genius because he has developed a unique approach to teaching tango; an approach that really benefits the student be he or she a beginner or advanced. He really is value for money and this book, little though it may be, contains an awesome amount of tango teaching 'gems'.If you have not been lucky enough to be taught by Chan Park (and very often his workshops are over-subscribed and booked-full way in advance) then you must at least read this excellent book.If you are lucky enough to get a place on one of his TangoZen courses you will not be disappointed. I see that in 2012 he is due to spend a weekend teaching at the \\"Tango : Triora\\" event in Triora, in northern Italy, so make sure you get along there, from 25-28 May 2012. See: www. italiandream.info for more on that rare event.ZEN? Do not be put off by the Zen element. Chan teaches pure tango, and he brings it from Buenos Aires. Chan is an excellent example of a Porteno traditional tango dancer. He will teach you a way to dance traditional tango that you never knew was possible. Zen is a label he uses because he has found that a higher state of consciousness can be reached when dancing tango well. He is not wrong about that!This book is also available in Espanol and in Italiano. French and German copies next ... I look forward to seeing so many of his pearls of wisdom appearing in these languages too, as those poor souls are missing out at this moment.Chan Park is also a tango film-maker and his film \\"Tango Your Life\\" will be out in 2012. Well worth waiting for!As for this book ... 10/10! Top value for money, especially from the Marketplace sellers above.For the reviews on this page that award 2 stars because the book is small, well, I know of lots of big fat books that have nothing to say; that are worthless in fact. Just look at the 9/11 Commission Report, for starters (even the authors now admit it, so don't blame me for saying this!). Size is not important. The value of the quality if this gem is way beyond its very fair price.This is a 5-star little book!"},{"Title":"Maigret travels south","review":"Published originally in 1940, and featuring translations by Geoffrey Sainsbury-- this volume contains Liberty Bar and The Madman of Bergerac. Both novels are set in the south of France-- Simenon does his trademark wonderful job of making a place and time quite real to the reader:*Liberty Bar*Liberty Bar was the 17th Maigret book, originally published in 1932. It didn't appear in English (trans. Geoffrey Sainsbury) until 1940.It's one of the best Maigret books I have read so far. Definitely a favorite within the series. Maigret travels to Antibes for to investigate a very sensitive murder-- that of one William Brown. While the book contains many typical Maigret elements, the atmosphere sets it apart. Maigret is nearly lost in the unreal Antibes environment-- sun, bars and luxury. He nearly abandons attempts at normal detective method, and instead tries to feel his way through this strange world. It's as though in the south, the nature of justice itself is confused-- or perhaps not even relevant.Recommended.*The Madman of Bergerac*If I hadn't read The Madman of Bergerac together with Liberty Bar, I probably would have liked it more. It's a clever idea-- Maigret manages to solve a murder from his bed after being injured from an incident on the train. It's a clever conceit, and it's a pleasure to watch Simenon manage to capture Bergerac with a stationary main character.There's some extra interest for historians of 1930s Europe in the book, as aspects of the plot illustrate neatly how Jewish/Eastern European refugees were viewed by their Western European contemporaries.The Madman of Bergerac was the 16th Maigret novel."},{"Title":"\\"Gentlemen prefer blondes;\\": A play in three acts,","review":"You could say that author/screenwriter Anita Loos invented the chick-lit genre. Her entertainingly fluffy satire \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\\" certainly fits the bill, with its love-seeking heroine and amusing jokes. It never dips far below the surface, but its lightness is part of its appeal.\\"A gentleman friend and I were dining at the Ritz last evening and he said that if I took a pencil and a paper and put down all of my thoughts it would make a book.\\" Meet Lorelei Lee, a pretty blonde socialite with a love of jewels, men, and luxury. She has a married boyfriend, but is convinced to go abroad so her name won't be \\"smirched.\\"So Lorelei and her pal Dorothy head off to Europe, bumping into exalted people (like \\"Dr. Froyd\\") and winning the hearts of wealthy men, in between days-long parties. Gold-digging, millionaires, money and love all get wrapped up in the tangle of Lorelei's everyday life...Lorelei first appeared in Harper's Bazaar, and a short story stretched out into a full-length novel that appeared in serials. A first edition sold out almost instantly. Now Lorelei has countless descendents -- sure, those determined gals have been updated for the twenty-first century, with jobs and Web access. But light women's fiction could be seen to stem from Loos's novel.A satirical edge runs through \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,\\" poking fun at the jazzy gals whom Loos had to deal with regularly. Loos doesn't spare anything -- the book is riddled with intentional typos, like \\"encyclopediacs,\\" \\"safires\\" and \\"maskerades\\" (yet she can spell \\"champagne\\"). The shallowness of the flappers is best shown in straight-faced jokes about the latest Parisian styles of buttons. Loos's satire doesn't bite down to the bone, but it does scratch lightly in a deliciously catty way.Lorelei has an entertaining mix of determination, idiocy, and a constant belief in her own towering intellect. She's so much fun it's hard not to like her, in spite of the fact that she's an utter airhead. She talks matter-of-factly about how she has \\"almost one of everything\\" (diamond-wise), and tries to reform the entire world (without success, needless to say).Gentlemen may prefer blondes, and people seeking a fun light read may prefer \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\\" If you are in the mood for vintage chick-lit, Loos's witty little novel is a fun diversion."},{"Title":"\\"Gentlemen prefer blondes;\\": A play in three acts,","review":"The reader tells Lorelei's diary-story with an openness, a directness that charms the listener. This is a real Lorelei, not a cartoon, and therefore even funnier."},{"Title":"Mary Emmerling's Romantic Country: Style That's Straight from the Heart","review":"I have enjoyed all of her previous books and I hoped this might be her best effort yet. However, I think she is too focused on Santa Fe and the southwest feel. There was way more of it in this book than I wanted to see. Where were the beach houses, the lake cabins, the mountain hideaways? I was disappointed overall and wish she had been less regional in her subjects."},{"Title":"Mary Emmerling's Romantic Country: Style That's Straight from the Heart","review":"I have long been a fan of Mary Emmerling since viewing her style and decorating tv shows. I have never before purchased one of her books and I am very happy I did. It is a great book to curl up with in a chair with and make for a cozy afternoon read with a candle lit in the backround. The photographs are crisp, clear and stunning. There are many different types of country style offered in this book and I believe there is something to appeal to those with widely differing styles of country decorating tastes. What I found particularly great about the book was that it strays from the traditional view of romantic country with it's laces and at times overly frilly and feminine fabrics and accessories towards a widely diverse notion of what is romantic in decorating. It teaches each person to find what is romantic to them from their own life and heritage and to call upon that in finding your own style. Offered are many photos and decorating styles/themes to inspire. Also fun about the book are the many lists of things considered romantic. Better still...make your own list after reading the book! A great overall read to inspire and relax with.

But the photos and the explanations of how things were acquired or made or modified to fit into the very lovely personalized homes - are really priceless! And she goes IN DEPTH into each home - 4 or more pages of writing and gorgeous photos of insides and outsides on each home plus a description of the people who own it. The groupings are very well planned, too - sections on simple cottages progressing to romantic, traditional and some rather elegant places -The reader who complained that the book is \\"too heavy\\" into Southwestern Style may be right - a lot of N.M. and AZ homes - I might have enjoyed more English Country or Seaside cottages, but there are many, many ideas and images here that can be adapted to any small house - I was feverish with enthusiasm after reading through the book the first time, and have gone back for inspiration many, many times since."},{"Title":"Mary Emmerling's Romantic Country: Style That's Straight from the Heart","review":"Finding this treasure at a used book store was quite a happy accident!

Also includes glossary."},{"Title":"Claiming of the Deerfoot","review":"Like his brother, Luke Short, Peter Dawson could well be described as \\"a thinking reader's Western-writer\\"; though his novels and tales have all the elements we expect in a Western--strong, lone heroes, starkly beautiful countryside, lawlessness met with bursts of violence--his characters know how to use their brains as well as their guns. In these two novellas from the late pulps (one originally published in 1939, the other in 1942), we see this ability in full flower. \\"Barbed Wire\\" is the story of Jim Lance, who wins a Colorado homestead in a poker game and finds himself opposed by \\"range hog\\" Ed Nugent and his foreman Ben Starr, who want all the \\"little guys\\" off the range. Their primary tactic is not one of shooting, but of legal maneuvering, and Jim must find equally legal and creative means of blocking them by trying to anticipate what they'll do and finding a way to head them off each time. The title story takes us to the mining camp of Ledge, where Ed Thorn, a former stagecoach driver disgraced by the rumor that he was connected to the bandits who held him up and killed his shotgun guard in Montana, comes looking for work. The local short-run stage line is owned by the father of the dead guard, and Ed has rough sailing to convince the man to give him a chance. Then, just when it seems he's got his life turned around and even found a girl who's beginning to care for him, a figure from his past turns up, and Ed, like Lance, must try to stay a step or two ahead to save his name--only to find that his nemesis may be two or three steps ahead of *him*. The moral of the two stories might, indeed, be something like, \\"Some days you get the bear, some days the bear gets you.\\"Though \\"Deerfoot\\" turns rather heavily on coincidence, I think it works better as a story than \\"Barbed Wire\\"--which, oddly for a pulp story, lacks even so much as a token female character. On the other hand, both pieces are tightly written and offer vividly drawn people, a strong leaven of action, and elements of humor and nearly poetic description. These novellas show that Dawson was equally skilled in shorter fiction as in full-length pieces."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed \\"Numbered Account,\\" I was ambivalent about reading another book from the same author because I doubted he would maintain the standard. However, I was thoroughly entertained by \\"The First Billion\\" & in some ways thought it superior to \\"Numbered Account.\\"If a tad more formulaic, \\"Billion\\" is smoother, more polished, with fewer rough edges than \\"Account.\\" The story is indeed carefully plotted, & I liked the side plot that some readers here do not. I enjoyed the false start aspect of it.Both Jett Gavallan & Grafton Byrnes are decent characters, & Konstantin Kirov is a decent villain with some complexity. Gavallan's ex is less well developed but still an OK character.The background of a Russian IPO is a great choice. Reich explains the financial world he uses as a setting very well. The reader does not feel patronized & understands what is going on.Another book I got to read for free because I am a deployed Soldier. If your church or community group collects paperbacks for this cause, donate some--it's a very worthwhile scheme."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"John \\"Jett\\" Gavallan knows his Black Jet Securities Company has been in trouble since the bottom fell out of the dot.com world. Borrowing from his days as a fighter pilot, Jett takes a major chance on a Russian firm Mercury Broadband that he plans to go public via the New York Stock Exchange.However, an online highly regarded financial analyst, Private Eye-PO, warns people that Mercury Broadband is a bad investment stunning Jett with the revelations. Jett's assistant Grafton Byrnes travels incognito to Moscow to uncover the truth while Jett tries to locate Private Eye-PO. Soon Jett heads to Russia to confront Kirov, the CEO of Mercury Broadband, who may be part of the Russian Mafia.Though not quite on a par with NUMBERED ACCOUNT, THE FIRST BILLION is an interesting financial thriller that is at its best when Jett struggles between ethics and the deal of a lifetime. The latter half of the story line turns into an international chase tale with body counts outgrowing monetary accounts and Jett acting more like John Wayne. Still readers will find this adventure exhilarating but would have preferred that Christopher Reich keep the hero continuing his work on the bottom line of a ledger sheet rather than body bags.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"The First Billion is an outstanding novel. Reich maintains the perfect balance of realism and fantasy pitting a savvy American banker against an even savvier, and certainly more ruthless, Russian Oligarch. The story is very fast paced and adventurous. More importantly, it sheds a bright light on the sometimes questionable practices of Investment bankers bringing High Tech IPO's to market and the always questionable, but never less than fascinating tactics of Russia's oligarchs - the handful of conniving men who managed to wrest control of Russia's economy for themselves.Reich paints a detailed, vibrant picture of both these worlds. When the two clash, sparks fly! I really enjoyed this book. If you like Paul Erdman or Frederick Forsyth, you will definitely enjoy it, too.A triumph. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"I bought this book at the beginning of Sept 2003. Normally I read such a book within 3 week.

Right."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"Christopher Reich has produced his third novel, \\"The First Billion\\", and it is a worthy addition to the first two books he offered readers. New authors always seem to be more harshly judged than their more veteran peers which I find quite unfair. The author who is arguably the most successful writer in the whole techno-thriller spy genre has just released his newest book, and while I am in the minority in that I enjoyed the novel, it has been overwhelmingly thrashed. No author is going to produce the perfect book each time out, and no author is going to have an easy time when his or her first book was as successful as Mr. Reich's first work, \\"Numbered Account\\". His first book remains my favorite of the three, and I would place his newest at number two, with, \\"The Runner\\", third. And even though placed third the book was well above the average of much of the production line derivative nonsense that fill bookshelves be they real or in cyberspace.This book is weak in two areas from my standpoint. The author became a bit clich&eacute; when he decided to have a former pilot head a securities firm, and then names it Black Jet Securities. Tying a series of names or forced events to the character's former profession become tiresome when overused. Having the same character purchase a military attack jet on his American Express card also was hard to read without wincing. The other part I had difficulty with was a side story that didn't really seem to be necessary. It served more as a distraction than as a key element to an otherwise good tale. While dealing with what has emerged from the former USSR is fine, dredging up behavior that harkens to the cold war is becoming a bit overused.Mr. Reich is very good when sticking with his expertise in finance, and staying close to that theme made, \\"Numbered Account\\", so very good. And in this book, when focusing on the enormous risks and difficulties of bringing a Russian based technology company public on the NYSE, the book is at its best. He is a talented author, and I hope he gets back to what he is best at. He has shown he does not need to travel the paths that others have already beaten to a pulp. \\"The First Billion\\" will not likely be your favorite book by Mr. Reich; it is still a worthwhile read that is well above the majority of the competition."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"\\"I knew you'd be happy. Listen, Jett, everything's copacetic over here.\\"Everything's copacetic-a code phrase between friends and warriors that signals danger as it did during the Gulf War. John \\"Jett\\" Gavallan is the CEO and driving force behind his company named Black Jet Securities. Named after the Stealth Bomber he flew during the war, his company stands at the brink of incredible success. He has hedged everything he owns and gambled his company's future on a bid to become an international player in the world of Initial Public Offerings (IPO). In six days, he is supposed to bring Mercury Broadband, Russia's leading internet multi-media company to market on the New York Stock Exchange. The IPO is expected to raise around two billion dollars, with a chunk of that going to Black Jet Securities for fees and services.However, on the Internet, an anonymous webmaster who runs a very well known IPO news website states that Mercury is a sham and that soon Gavallan will be explaining why he defrauded the world from behind bars. He also seems to have digital proof in the form of pictures of Mercury equipment. As some of the big investment houses begin to question the deal, Gavallan sends fellow Gulf War pilot and friend Grafton Byrnes to Russia to check out the situation. While the Swiss financiers that claim to have checked things out assure Gavallan that everything is fine, Gavallan wants to make absolutely sure with everything riding on the deal being legit.Soon, as he is held hostage by Konstantin Kirov, head of Mercury Broadband, Byrnes makes the call that for listeners should have reassured Gavallan. Warned, Gavallan begins to dig and discovers that everything he has believed the last few years has all been a lie. A lie that is poised not only to wipe out his company but could easily cost him his life as the offering will go through-one way or another.This is really a novel of two parts. The first 300 pages is an incredibly slow read as the players are moved into positions and the intricacies of IPO finance are explained. Much as he did in his previous book \\"Numbered Account\\" the author relies heavily on his own financial experience to detail numerous pages of market information, which does little to move the novel or the story forward. In addition, this section also consists of an extraordinary number of long flashback sections including ones that relate to the Gulf War. The resulting back-story is not handled well and further slows the pacing of the entire novel.However, once the tale actually gets going as Gavallan chases around the world via Lears and even a MIG in an effort to save himself and his friend, the novel becomes enjoyable. The problem is that it is a long way to get to the good stuff and the journey is for the most part, mind numbingly boring.That is precisely the problem with this entire novel. The characters are flat, the writing virtually unemotional and distant even in scenes that are supposed to convey intense emotion to the reader and the entire novel moves incredibly slowly. This novel quickly became very hard work to read and should have received some judicious editing."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"Actor and Audie Award finalist James Daniels gives a riveting performance of this globe spanning story propelled by rapid fire action and dark intrigue.

The First Billion is a nailbiting thriller, no questions asked.Characters alone should be enough to get this book in your hands at the first possible opportunity -- a Russian ISP seeking Western financing; an ambitious investment banker from San Francisco risking his entire company on this Russian firm's IPO; a sharpshooting DrudgeReport type online muckraker posting some skinny about why this Russian firm is a scam; an FBI agent in somewhat over his head in the shifting sands of international finance; Swiss bankers violating a number of banking laws and selling customers' secrets...Plus, an intriguing love story between two protagonists where one conceals an important secret.Fabulous story here, the stuff that John Grisham novels are made of. If one were to have a minor gripe, it would be that Reich gets a little carried away with a lot of unnecessary description of the environment, background etc...which really doesnt amount to much in terms of the plot. Yet, if you are a good skimmer, this should hardly be a problem.Highly recommended action + spy thriller with a liberal dose of financial and tech trivia thrown in, which also makes for an intriguingly real look into the dark side of both the industries."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"As finance professional, I like reading novels based around my business.

And remember when you make a novel, Clancy's spy thrillers sell well so let's revisit a Russian theme as the bad guys.

It's a little more than the influx (seemingly limited) and outflow (seemingly continuous) into and out of your wallet and bank account, but not much more. Really. Here is what finance boils down to. Look outside at a birdfeeder. What do you see? You see birds of all sorts pecking away at the food and at each other. The birds are the brokers, the high rollers, and the day traders. Two of them won't share the same perch. There's probably food around elsewhere, but a full or even half-full bird feeder is easy pickings. The more aggressive birds will try to chase the others away. Then there is the neighborhood stray cat. That's the government. It has sharp claws, treads quietly and tries to keep things orderly, but has no wings. It makes an inept appearance once in a while and occasionally grabs a laggard sparrow too slow or stupid to get away, but for the most part it is useless. You're the investor, feeding the maw. The bird feeder becomes empty and all the birds go away. You lug the 35-pound bag of seed out, fill up the feeder, and start the whole cycle again. If you got something back, like gratitude, it would be nice, but the most you'll probably get are some stains on your deck to clean up. And so it continues.That's pretty much all you need to know. If you want to get more deeply into it, however, pick up a novel by Christopher Reich. Reich's specialty is in the area of financial market thrillers. That term may seem like a contradiction in terms --- along the lines of \\"jumbo shrimp\\" or, alas, \\"legal ethics\\" --- but that's what he does, and does it quite well. His books are giant \\"for examples\\" of how the financial world works. I'm not talking about walking into Best Buy and trying to haggle the 16-year-old clerk into letting you finance that plasma screen TV you've had your eye on. I'm talking 67th floor, gnomes of Zurich stuff, the stuff that makes you feel helpless, inept, poor and really, really angry.THE FIRST BILLION is Reich's third novel, and while Reich at times attempts to do a little too much with it, the title remains a good solid read. The story centers on John \\"Jett\\" Gavallan and his company, Black Jet Securities, as they prepare to take Mercury, Russia's top media company, public on the New York Stock Exchange. Gavallan is taking major risks to do this, including the use of Black Jet's own capital to float the offering. When rumors of fraud start to swirl in the financial waters surrounding the offering, Gavallan dispatches Grafton Byrnes, his business partner and best friend, to Russia to personally investigate whether or not Mercury is everything it is supposed to be. When Byrnes disappears, Gavallan starts an investigation of his own, attempting to salvage the future of his company as well as rescue Byrnes.His search takes him on a dangerous trail across the United States, from San Francisco to West Palm Beach, and then around the world from Zurich to Moscow, where he discovers the truth about Mercury, Black Jet, and the enigmatic Cate Magnus, who mysteriously and abruptly left Gavallan's life as he was about to reach the pinnacle of his success. Gavallan discovers that Black Jet is being used by an entity far larger than Mercury for a purpose far more diabolical than a stock fraud. In Russia, almost alone, with only his wits to carry him through, Gavallan finds that he must put a stop to what is about to occur, for the stakes are much larger than his company.Reich does an incredible job of explaining to his audience the complexities of higher finance and the way money works --- he makes it not only understandable but also exciting. Speaking only for myself, making such a topic understandable is akin to explaining the concept of rocket propulsion to a six-week-old beagle and seeing the light of comprehension spring into its eyes. There are many parts to the game Reich sets up, and while it may seem to take him a while to get the board operational, you'll be glad that things move slowly before he really picks up speed and starts moving things along.If there's a problem at all with THE FIRST BILLION, it's that many of the characters are a touch too complex. Gavallan would have made an interesting character without his Gulf War baggage, which for some reason wasn't entirely convincing. Ditto for Magnus, whose background slowly became somewhat improbable. And I probably could have done without the pairing of Boris and Tatiana; I kept waiting for one of them to say \\"Look! There go Moose and Squirrel!\\" Additionally, THE FIRST BILLION might have been a more streamlined read if Reich had been able to resist stopping the action intermittently to fill in the backstory, a process that eventually becomes tedious.These shortcomings, however, are minor compared to what Reich has done, which is to rip back the veil to reveal what really, and ultimately, goes on behind the scenes, and to make you want to know as well. Recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"This is the second book by Reich that I have read, and again this book is very slow. The plot is easy to figure out, Reich can be very very long winded at times. This book reads more like a screen play than a novel. Worth reading I like I did only on a long plane trip."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"Jett Gavallan is a corporate warrior on a very dangerous mission: he must save his best friend from the grasp of a Russian mobster while somehow salvaging a huge business deal that might just keep his business afloat. Careening from San Francisco to Moscow to Florida and New York, &quot;The First Billion&quot; is one of the most suspenseful and satisfying books I've read this year, at once a nail biting page turner and an instructive meditation on the risks of international business. I'd place the style somewhere between Ludlum and LeCarre, but Reich has a snappy panache that is all his own. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"I found this to be a real page turner. It has an interesting and topical basis in the crime and corruption that can surround the taking of a private company public in the days of greed that we have been and are stil living through, to some extent. Add to the mix that the company is Russian and that the owner is as amoral as he is ambitious and then add to that mix those that are trying to prevent it from happening and the pages are starting to turn. The focus of the book, Jett Gavallon, a former F-16 jockey and now a high tech entrepreneur is suspected of some very serious crimes in his association with Konstantin Kirov, the owner of Mercury Broadband. How that all meshes together is what makes this book such a good read. I was fortunate to have a weekend during which I could really sit with this book and let the story just run. I throughly enjoyed it and I suspect you will too."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"I had nothing else around to read while I had this in my hand, so I kept coming back to it and finished its pages. After a time it became a matter of testing my will power or seeing if I could triumph and prevail by plodding through this disaster to its end with out doing myself bodily harm.I finish many books that I am not overly fond of, but this has got to be one of the worst. From the very beginnings of this story we are confronted with a righteous protagonist with everything in the world. In fact, he is a dashingly handsome, brilliant young personable CEO of a company on its way to the top. Only he has made a mistake and gotten into bed with the evilest of flawed characters on a recent IPO. What unfolds is a dummingly stifling plot that wanders across the globe as our hero saves the day. What's really painful is the way his characters fall into the most obvious stereotypes.I think that Reich should give up writing novels and go work for DC comics. QUICK, go look for another book on your list and be thankful you did not buy this one."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"I looked forward to this book after reading his other two, but it just didn't keep me interested. It started to get better after the 1/2 way point, but until then, the jumping around to set the situation didn't allow for the smooth flow of the story."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"This book has it all -- international intrigue, a killer cadre, a duplicitous lover and a former fighter jet jock now CEO of his own brokerage firm. Only a taste of reality is missing."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"See book description above.The unabridged version of this book was also good. The reader, James Daniel, narrated at a steady pace but in a sometime undramatic way. The story itself was strong and addicting.

He never leaves me disappointed.Bea G."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"As a nice touch on the side, the author's German name &quot;Reich&quot; means &quot;Rich&quot; in English and it is very appropriate for the title of this book &quot;The First Billion.&quot; Reich's book is an excellent novel with a great cast of characters in a fictitious world of corporate intrigue and the big game of Wall Street. Not only is it an interesting read, but it's an adventure. I would also recommend another powerful suspense thriller which I greatly enjoyed and is along the same lines to some degree, which is Alec Donzi's THE CONSULTANT."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"But not a novel of the Third Reich! Sorry, couldn't help it. I really enjoyed this one. The author is very adept at narrating financial intrigue. He employs very smart prose in general, but is a master at this stuff in particular."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"I loved Christopher Reich's first two novels -- NUMBERED ACCOUNT and THE RUNNER -- but his new one's my favorite. The plot is intricate and exciting and it moves at warp speed. This is a stay-up-all-night-and-then-pass-it-along-to-your-best-friend thriller that satisfies on every level. Congratulations on another great book, Mr. Reich. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"I chose this book simply by spotting the spine while at the library. But once I got into it, it just seemed rather formulaic. Flashbacks occurred at predictable interviews. The major characters, at different times, all seemed to stop and look at themselves in the mirror. There just wasn't anything all that intriguing."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"Kirov is a Russian businessman who owns Mercury Broadband, the Russian version of AOL. He's coming to market with a $2 billion IPO sponsored by Jett Black Securities. This is the can't miss, can't lose deal of century.Sound too good to be true.It is.This book has a little of everything for the Cold War Warrior: veteran fighter pilots, dark secrets, Russian gangsters, Chechen nasties, and a nostalgic review of the KGB - you know the guys with the thumb screws and rubber truncheons. Only these days they have abandoned the ruble in favor of the dollar, exchanged funny looking uniforms for $5,000 suits and their MiGs for G5 business jets.The only criticism I have for this book is that everything gets wrapped up very neatly, and my experience with Russians is that nothing ever gets put back together exactly right."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"\\"The First Billion\\" is too long and slow-paced to be a truly effective thriller. Christopher Reich is a good writer, but he could really use a lesson in self-editing. He has a verbose writing style, and wastes page after page describing extraneous details that have little to no importance to the story.This is one of those books you end up skimming, rather than really reading. I really wish this 600-page book had been more aggressively edited. This book could easily have been made at least 100-150 pages shorter without sacrificing much of the story. There is a subplot in this book involving the Alaska Pipeline that could have been completely eliminated, in my opinion.This book also has some severe plot problems. The first 250-300 pages of this book are incredibly slow-paced and boring. Nothing major really happens in this book until about the midway point, when a mass murder takes place. After this murder takes place, the book picks up the pace dramatically and reads much more like a thriller.My suspicion, however, is that most readers will give up on this book before reaching page 250. I came very close to doing so myself.The book is further worsened by cardboard characters who are neither sympathetic nor believable. Almost all the major \\"good\\" characters are rich, good-looking and materialistic. The \\"hero\\" of the book is a 38-year old millionaire CEO who is trying to make more millions for his investment banking company. In the end, I didn't really care that much about him or how he ended up.My advice is to skip this book. If you're looking for a good corporate thriller, read the books of Joseph Finder, which are much better written."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"Couldn't get into this book, I found the characters morally weak and the pace of the book very slow. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish, not worth my time. I started this book three times, in the mean time I read four others. Finally I decided that it wasn't worth my time, very dry"},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author and admittedly I came close to putting it down, but don't. It's attention to finance detail nearly bored me to tears and made for a tough start in the begininning of the story. It's worth pushing through, although the author is giving you a bit of a finance lesson, he's setting you up for the rest of the story, though that seems unclear at first. But he finally weaves it together and the story takes off like one of the characters jets. A bit formula, Russia bad, America good theme, and I agree with another reviewer that this could easily be a movie, it reads like one.It does have some good surprises, there are no wimpy women and the authors knowledge of Switzerland and some of their customs adds a realistic touch to a fun to this entertaining but rather convoluted story. I would rate this as a great airport or vacation read. A light and easy read."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"This book from Christopher Reich is outstanding. In this book Jett Gavalan and his investment banking firm Black Jet Securitiesare prepared to take a Russian company Mercury public with a twobillion dollar offering.The CEO of Mercury is a Russian oligarchnamed Konstantin Kirov.An internet columnist named Private Eye.POis bashing the offering and the Russian company.Jett's girlfriend is not who she appears to be.This book has assassinsat work trying to frame Jett for murder.Jett has to resort tohis commando training to escape some of the situations that hefinds himself in.Mix in Wall Street with this plot and you have another good read from Reich.This is my third Reich book and Ihave yet to get a bad book."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"The First Billion was the first novel I've read by Reich. It was different that I had expected, but I came away with a very favorable impression of the author. Reich presents a story with the financial underpinnings that I had expected. More than that, however, the story is one of greed, ruthlessness, limitless ego, and geopolitical intrigue. Reich was able to grab the reader's attention at the very beginning and keep it throughout. There is an abundance of suspense, plot twists and non-stop action. Character development is strong, with some very interesting emotional ties among the characters. I am definitely going back for more of Reich's works."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"This is a book that I found difficult to put down. For someone very interested in finance fiction (my favourite movie is Wall Street), and having just finished a spy novel involving old Russia and USA, not only is this book very well-written, but its attention to detail and at times quite wild plot twists sure stole a lot of spare time from me. The story is very imaginative, and even though some of the side-plots catches the reader a bit off-guard and thinking that they're very irrelevant, they do serve brilliantly as suspense-builders, forcing me to turn the pages even more eagerly.The portrayal of Russia is very clich&eacute;d, yes. And the characters are not difficult to understand. But that also makes the novel very accessible. I would accept the popular opinion that this book has to be made into a movie at some point; the descriptions are so precise one can easily visualize what is going on."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"This book slogged along the first half (that is why I didn't give 5 stars) and then took off at jet speed (the main character's name is Jett). It is about an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for a Russian Internet Service Provider that is about to come off in a few days. If all goes well, more than a billion is to be made.The company looks like a sure fire winner and the due diligence confirms it. However, an Internet poster is claiming that the company is a sham. What makes him credible is that he has been right on about several other companies he reported on.Concerned about the impending deal, Jett sends his associate to Moscow to investigate. What he finds is that the Internet poster may be right but he falls into the hands of the bad guys that want to make the deal happen. It is up to Jett to unravel all the details, save his friend, and keep the FBI from putting himself away for a long time if a fradulent deal takes place.Reich seems to have a good grasp of the workings of international business. The other book that I read, Numbered Account was phenomenal and gave a good insight to what happens behind the scenes at a Swiss bank."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"In my opinion, this novel started out entertaining but got a little boring page 300 -400. but got much better after."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"The first half of the book had promised far more than was delivered. In the latter stages Christopher Reich resorted to stereotypes and it was almost as if he was writing to a publisher's deadline or had lost interest in developing the plot and just made do with a big ending.Towards the end there is so much murder and mayhem that the story loses any suspense, the plot stumbles along a predictable path with no twists or turns. The plan to blow up the Alaskan pipeline is an attempt at a plot twist, but it could have been left out of the plot completely.The MIG escape from Russia and the engine fire and near crash were another totally pointless diversion, so badly written that there was no suspense to it at all.The most believable character is Grafton Byrnes, the hero's sidekick and his escape from custody was one of the climaxes.The hero and heroine, Jett Gavallan and Cate Magnus, are so over the top that one loses empathy with the characters quite quickly. I found myself rooting for the villain, Konstantin Kirov, because he had a more believable character and emotions I could identify with."},{"Title":"The First Billion","review":"Reading books by Christopher Reich is becoming a habit. His first book, NUMBERED ACCOUNT was nominated for an Edgar Award. This is actually a very rare feat for a thriller novel. THE RUNNER also is a very well written thriller and now Christopher Reich returns to the world of high finance with another well received and highly publicized novel.John &quot;Jett&quot; Gavallan is the CEO of Black Jet Securities, a firm of investment bankers. He senses a lucrative deal with a Russian businessman, Konstantin Kirov. Mr. Kirov wants to bring his internet company, Mercury Broadband public. The profits for Jett's company could go into the hundreds of millions. Kirov, of course can earn many billions. After the proper due diligence, everything looks good until a mysterious net columnist begins pointing out hidden problems with the company that Jett is not aware of. Things turn ominous when Grafton Byrnes, a friend of Jett's goes to Russia to investigate the company and disappears. As Jett investigates, he realizes he and his company are definitely in trouble.The world of high finance is where Christopher Reich feels most comfortable. He is was an international banker in Europe and utilized that knowledge in his first book, as well as, this current volume. What is especially impressive about Mr. Reich's work is that, in spite of the complexity of the topic he is discussing (in this case IPOs) he is never heavy-handed in his approach to the subject. The reader will not feel overwhelmed while being swept up into the action of the story. All of the stock thriller elements are here-- the hero with a military background adept at the use of firearms, the tough heroine to team up with him, a villain with grandiose ideas of world domination and exotic locales. The breakneck speed Reich eventually builds up to makes the very long book appear much shorter. Reich is quickly establishing himself as a superior writer of financial thrillers.

Of excellent 60# satin paper quality, even those who have only a passing interest in the fabled monument will find enjoyment here, as depictions of the time-honored edifice range from the first 1853 images to the near-present. More knowledgeable students will find the chronicled accounts of the three major Restorations fascinating, as these had not been widely published previously.Ultimately a book of captions, Dr. Richards has used his long expertise with Stonehenge to flavor passages with anecdotal tales which might otherwise be forgotten. Pictures from the 1930's and '40's for example are a lovely wander down a more rural English Memory Lane.While not exactly lighthearted, the presentation steers a middle course when areas of controversy come near, such as the devastation rendered to the monument by William Hawley in the 1920's -- and with no reference at all to the more recent so-called \`Bean Field War' of the mid-1980's. These incidental omissions no doubt stem from his close association with English Heritage, the watchdog entity which oversees the care and public presentation of Stonehenge and the myriad other ancient sites thereabout. Understandably, \\"PC\\" is King.Editorially, some captions are marginally repetitious, though only here and there, and on the whole I recommend this book to both curious browser and armchair student alike.ND Wiseman"},{"Title":"Stonehenge: A History in Photographs","review":"Julian Richards, in his new book, Stonehenge, A History in Photographs, has brought life to Stonehenge.

He read in today's newspaper that the Berlin Wall crumbled and informs his psychiatrist Dr. Wilhelm Ryle that he must return there. Ryle is stunned as this is the first full sentence uttered by his patient in the two years he has resided at the clinic.Chiavetta walks away from the clinic shocking Ryle further as the man was a notch above comatose until the article. Ryle looks at what his patient left behind for clues and finds a document titled Berlin on Chiavetta's computer. The full title turns out to be Berlin: A Novel in Three Parts in which Professor Antonio Serratura is in West Berlin attending a conference as President Reagan demands Gorbachev tear down the wall. What Ryle finds makes no sense as Chiavetta was mostly incoherent while here and does not match up with what is known about the missing mental patient; yet there is a weird ring of truth underneath the words as Giulio begins an adventure in a convergence of the future and the past.This is a well written but weird character study that turns transcendental philosophy upside down as Michael Mirolla pays homage to Kant and Kafka. Not easy to read, fans and Ryle are hooked trying to understand who Chiavetta is; why the Wall falling down awakened him and sent him on his odyssey; and what he needs to accomplish in the seedier parts of West Berlin. Eerie yet fascinating, readers who relish something entirely different will want to travel to the underbelly of West Berlin circa 1989 with on a magical mystery tour guided by an escape mental patient.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Berlin: A Novel","review":"Berlin is a writer's melting pot of detail, experience and imagination.

Berlin is an idea, or a set of ideas, subject to constant shifts that are stacked up like Chinese boxes, like Borges' stories within stories. Just at the moment that you believe you grasp what Mirolla is getting it, that moment is gone, often in a shocking manner, and some allusion or trick takes you elsewhere. Every stereotype, ever moral certainty, is questioned in a book that is by turns playful, teasing, and outrageous. Nothing escapes Mirolla's philosophical scrutiny. Don't worry, though - he shows you that everything you think is real is just what is happening in your mind. Take this challenging journey in spite of your self and learn to see Berlin in many different lights."},{"Title":"Berlin: A Novel","review":"Mirolla's writing takes you into the dark and terrifying world of truth. It may come at you obliquely, but it will eventually get you right between the eyes - maybe even in that third eye winking knowingly. The power of his imagination is a thing to behold - like being the first one to arrive at an accident scene - broken glass reflecting prisms of time that expand and collapse following the fractured rules of some unknown cosmic physics flowing in language and blood."},{"Title":"Berlin: A Novel","review":"In 1989, the Berlin Wall comes crashing down, returning a semblance of sanity to the formerly schizophrenic metropolis. Simultaneously, half a world away, a patient in a mental hospital on the outskirts of Montreal regains his senses and escapes, pursuing a flight that seems to have been planned before his entry into the institution. After the breakout, a hospital psychiatrist discovers a novel on the patient's computer; the doctor hopes the book will help reveal a diagnosis and cure for his patient, but we read the novel to find clues to his past exploits and his current destination.The novel-within-the-novel starts out simply enough: two years earlier, when Reagan gave his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate, philosophy professor Anthony Serratura, whose marriage seems to be falling apart, is flying to an academic conference in Berlin. As the embedded novel progresses through its three parts, from third-person to second-person to first-person perspectives, the narrative flow--its very chronology--breaks down. The academic tourist's new circle of acquaintances in Berlin undergoes surreal adventures of exotic sex, torture, murder, and suicide that seem to unhappen as soon as they happen. \\"The universal sorting machinery has missed a slot\\"; it seems only Serratura can see the incongruities, but he's \\"helpless to change that structure, to alter its ongoing shape, to repair the damage.\\"I've never read anything quite like \\"Berlin.\\" There are perhaps inevitable comparisons to Borges, Calvino, Kafka, and Vonnegut, but its realist underpinnings remind me of other works: the cabaret demimonde of Christopher Isherwood's \\"Berlin Stories,\\" the philosophical hijinks in Iris Murdoch's \\"Under the Net,\\" the increasingly addled scholars who populate the novels of John Gardner (not to mention the meta-fictional frameworks of \\"October Light\\" and \\"Freddy's Book\\"), and the weird and irresolvable circularities of David Lynch's \\"Mulholland Drive.\\" Mirolla's novel is funny and fascinating, baffling and exasperating, but in the end the fractured worlds of its central characters--both the person of Serratura and the city of Berlin--come together to make a sort of wild, incoherent sense that you might expect to find in a universe of parallel worlds. This is a book to read twice: first for its mesmerizing storytelling, then to tease out the meaning of it all."},{"Title":"Berlin: A Novel","review":"This book is a treat. Fine writing in a novel that plays with reality as though it were a new toy. Mirolla's cast of characters are extremely well drawn with a bias toward the off-beat, quirky, in-and-out of the shadow type people you wouldn't normally invite for a sleep-over. All are part of the puzzle that Berlin offers in its story line. The novel was a two-reader for me as the first reading left me...well, puzzled. And like an itch you have to scratch... In short, this novel is great fun for the mind - I was hooked after the first sentence."},{"Title":"Berlin: A Novel","review":"[Note: Nearly a hundred of my fiction reviews by great literary artists and others not so well known are now available in my book, \\"Novels and other Fictions.\\" Get it at Amazon.]It's the height of the Cold War. US President Ronald Reagan is about to speak in Berlin and demand that the Berlin Wall come down. But none of that matters. The Berlin that novelist Michael Mirolla writes about is more like the corrupt and degenerate Berlin of George Grocz from the 1920s. Many of Mirolla's characters are in fact gross caricatures of people just as George Grocz's drawings were. Seen through the eyes of Mirolla's unreliable and schizophrenic narrator/protagonist, logical (positivist?) philosopher Antonio G. Serratura, these Berliners are morphed by his delusions into dark Dada depictions of a depraved humanity filled with sexual perversions and Quixotic behaviors.Mirolla begins with a third person narrative introducing Serratura's creator (or perhaps alter ego), Giulio A. Chiavetta, an \\"ex-stationary engineer by trade and self-styled freelance circus mime\\" who has apparently gone insane and is living in a clinic in Montreal while being treated by Dr. Wilhelm \\"Billy\\" Ryle, a psychiatrist. As the story begins, Chiavetta has apparently escaped from the institution and as the authorities look for this putatively harmless nutcase, Dr. Ryle gets access to Chiavetta's computer and discovers a document written by Chiavetta entitled \\"Berlin: A Novel in Three Parts.\\" Thus we have a novel within a novel.Ryle begins reading the first person singular novel, the contents of which are set in quotation marks--at least for a while they are. After a few pages the document becomes a third person narrative. This may seem complicated or abrupt or even unnecessary, but Mirolla writes so well and so engagingly that we don't care about the niceties of narrative construction. It seems that Chiavetta's protagonist, Serratura is on his way to Berlin to participate in the \\"Wittgenstein World Symposium on the Realism/Anti-Realism Debate in Contemporary Philosophy.\\"So. We have the makings of a satirical novel about modern philosophy and philosophers seen from the vantage point of the mentally disturbed. Naturally this is interesting to avant-garde writers and effete intellectuals such as myself, and so I read on. It doesn't take a lot of keen discernment to see that somehow Giulio A. Chiavetta and Antonio G. Serratura are more connected than as author and author's character.All goes interestingly introspective as Serratura reveals his thoughts and meets and converses on the plane with a seller of restaurant supplies named Singer. It appears that a novel of ideas is developing. Perhaps a contrast between the airy, abstract world of philosophy and the practical world of business is being set up for some thematic development.Serratura himself seems a down to earth and unpretentious philosopher, a man with a wife and daughter back in Montreal who has obviously achieved some success as a philosopher since he has been invited to speak at the symposium. Yet, something seems a bit amiss or a bit quirky. Serratura's wife has threatened to leave him, and has probably taken on a lover, \\"one of the plumbers or other handymen who'd swarmed their house as it underwent renovation,\\" Serratura muses, although he believes that her leaving is just a threat. And there is something a bit too eager about this traveling salesman that is also a bit off.As Serratura arrives in Berlin and secures his lodging at the weird Pension Aryana away from the campus where the symposium is being held, we begin to have forebodings of danger. There are riots in the streets to protest \\"the cowboy\\" Reagan's visit, youths throwing rocks and such; and at the pension Fritz, the proprietor and his sister Frieda, (\\"nutty as a breadfruit,\\" Fritz informs Serratura) seem a bit odd. Furthermore, Serratura seems somewhat adrift and ends up that first evening at...Well, enough of the plot. Mustn't give away too much. Suffice it to say that things turn quirky and odd and then bizarre and then something beyond bizarre. Mirolla's structure has the narrative return to Dr. Ryle who continues to read from Serratura's novel as the search for Chiavetta continues, so that we go back and forth from one reality to another.In the end it is not entirely clear what is real and what is not. Much of what Serratura experiences did not or could not have happened outside his increasingly deranged mind, yet what is described in the final scene may be the truth about what happened to the author Chiavetta himself. Clearly Mirolla's intent is to play with reality just as philosophers play with reality, philosophers who, in the postmodern interpretation, cannot decide what is real and what is not real, or whether we can ever know, or even whether a question about reality even makes sense. A quote from the comedian Robin Williams as Mork in the old TV sitcom \\"Mork and Mindy\\" might be appropriate. What he said most profoundly was simply, \\"Reality, what a concept!\\"Judging from the reality/unreality of this very interesting novel, I think that Mirolla would identify with that point of view, as do I.Bottom line: a diabolic, rough-edged, violent and decidedly unPC black comedy of a novel with a few loose ends, well and humorously rendered."},{"Title":"The Origins of Music (Bradford Books)","review":"\\"The Origins of Music\\" derives from a 1997 international workshop of the Swedish Institute for Biomusicology. The result is a fascinating journey into a vast world of ideas, with interplay, disagreement and contradiction abounding. Few readers will have the background to move easily through all these articles. However, wading through the quagmire of scientific writing rewards the reader with some remarkable insights. Little is actually proven, and the editors could have done more to reconcile or enumerate the contradictions between some of the approaches. But for the most part, the writers are sufficiently aware of the difficulties involved in applying their specific research results to general theories about the origins of music.An introductory chapter discusses the comparatively new field of biomusicology, with its tripartite subdivision into evolutionary musicology, neuromusicology, and comparative musicology. The issue, which will command much of the book, of whether certain features of music are biological or cultural is raised. Unfortunately, all too often the weight is given to the biological answer without overwhelming evidence.Another significant question is the relevance of animal \\"song\\". Only those working directly in the field of animal song approach this with caution--none argue anything stronger than a \\"convergent evolution\\" between animal and human music. To apply the terms \\"song\\" and \\"music\\" to aural animal communications is to raise a whole host of related but probably irrelevant associations--those of art, aesthetics, etc. Where music is so broadly defined as to include animal sounds (which can indeed be \\"musical\\" and quite lovely for us to listen to without being classified as \\"music\\") these associations muddy the water, and all too often the contributors simply accept these problematic issues. One writer even wallows in them--in the book's final article, composer Mache absurdly claims that birdsong can ONLY be explained as an aesthetic act. We unquestionably have very limited understanding of how even the human brain processes our own music; that we have even less understanding of how animals perceive their own sounds and how their brains process them makes any statement about any complicated animal response speculative at best. Slater's chapter is noteworthy as he addresses this very issue of relevance with commendable caution: \\"Considering only songbirds...there are close to 4,000 species....It would thus not be surprising if almost any characteristic found in human music were discovered in one or a few of them. But such similarities are likely to be coincidental...\\"Articles on human evolution of musical potential are fascinating explorations of real evidence. Although of course music does not fossilize, these scientists have taken various ingenious approaches from the thorough examination of a Paleolithic bone flute to the casting of brains inside fossil skulls to examine their gross anatomy, and the results are couched in appropriate language. Richman, in his wildly speculative theory of music origins, resorts to quite poor reasoning (\\"...complexity always comes from previous, but different complexity.\\" and \\"...language always comes from previous language.\\"). Similar points are articulated more thoughtfully in the subsequent chapter by Merker. Equally intriguing is Miller's, in which he argues convincingly that a Darwinian approach to the issue of musical evolution allows only the single explanation of sexual selection. His colleague Todd supports this hypothesis in his article on computer modeling of musical behavior. In perhaps the most interesting contradiction in the book, Dissanayake takes a totally different approach, arguing equally convincingly (although smothered in jargon) that musical evolution most likely occurred as an outgrowth of mother-infant interaction. Finally, Freeman suggests that music evolved to fulfil a sociological role of group bonding. These four articles, by Freeman, Dissanayake, Todd, and Merker are superbly argued and maintain the highest standards of intellectual rigor; curiously they come to wildly different but equally reasonable conclusions on the origins of music, thereby highlighting the difficulties of the issues.In the final section, the musicians get their turn, and as a composer myself I'm sorry to say that my colleagues' results are relatively disappointing. Trehub attempts to find musical universals by studying the behavior of infants. This leads her to the conclusion that \\"small-integer frequency ratios\\" are \\"preferable\\" (such as 2:1 and 3:2--the perfect octave and fifth) to large-integer ratios (the ONLY example she gives is 45:32--the tritone). She concludes that \\"dissonances\\" are not naturally a part of an inherent universal musicality, but her argument shows no apparent understanding of the issues. Imberty's contribution is largely a defense of Lerdahl and Jackendoff's Generative Theory of Tonal Music, and although he makes some excellent points, especially about atonal music, the reader unfamiliar with Lerdahl and Jackendoff's work will find little of value here. The eminent ethnomusicologist Nettl suggests a number of likely musical universals, some of which I must contend against: among them are the presence of an undefined cadential element (as music exists in time and must end, this seems to me inevitable and inconsequential unless further defined), and, that music exists only as particular songs, compositions, etc--that \\"one does not ever just sing or play, as for example, one may simply dance, without performing a particular dance composition.\\" (wildly incorrect, as any jazzer, mother or Deadhead will attest!) However, Nettl raises valid concerns about the concept of musical universals--I regretted that his contribution wasn't much earlier in the book as it seemed so appropriate to so many of the claims made within. Finally, composer Mache provides what is surely the least intellectually rigorous, most romantically speculative chapter. Mache based much of his workshop contribution on recorded comparisons between various human and animal musics to which the reader has no exposure. It is a real pity that for this article and several others no CD was included. Regardless, Mache's concept of a truly universal biological music including an aesthetic sense ignores historical fact and convergent evolution in favor of an interspecies brotherhood of musicians. However attractive the idea, the International Federation of Musicians is unlikely to start issuing cards to avian and simian members any time soon"},{"Title":"The Origins of Music (Bradford Books)","review":"Cognitive science has put an evolutionary spin on everything from language to spatial reasoning, and now it is time for music to take its turn. What is it about the human brain that makes us musical and where did it come from? These are two of the central questions of The Origins of Music and the emerging field of evolutionary musicology. Readers interested in cognitive evolution will no doubt be intrigued by such a timely volume, but they should also be aware of the book's flaws.In the first section, the authors take a comparative ethological approach, spotlighting their own research in birdsong or primate vocal behavior and usually summing up with an extremely speculative and/or vague connection with the supposed homologies and analogies in human cognition. The larger issue of what kinds of information such comparative approaches can tell us about the evolution of human cognition is barely scratched.The next two sections move the focus specifically to the evolution of music in humans, its adaptive value, and its relationship with language and social behavior. Although the topics are closer to what I had envisioned in an evolutionary musicology book than were those of the earlier chapters, the rigor of argument declines into a unique combination of cognitive imprecision and evolutionary storytelling that would give both Noam Chomsky and Stephen Jay Gould nightmares. To be fair, much of this is not a fault of the authors but is rather a reflection of a field in its infancy.The final section on innate musical competencies and modularity contained some of the kinds of argument that I had been expecting to find throughout the book. Just as Steven Pinker's arguments in the Language Instinct would not be worth considering without the prior arguments of Chomsky for specialized innate mechanisms for language, it is hard to take seriously the claims about music's adaptive value made in the middle portion of the book without first considering what kinds of nativist arguments can be made for music. Sadly, the most comprehensive work on this subject to date, Lerdahl and Jackendoff's A Generative Theory of Tonal Music is cited only by two contributors and applied relevantly only by one.All of these criticisms do not alter the fact that this book is a welcome first step in a fascinating new subdiscipline of cognitive science. The Origins of Music will no doubt be a catalyst for more research in evolutionary musicology, but don't prepare yourself for an intellectual tour de force just yet."},{"Title":"The Origins of Music (Bradford Books)","review":"The number of books devoted to language evolution could now fill many bookshelves. So it is very exciting to see the first book ever devoted to the question of music evolution. This book is unquestionably a landmark and will be discussed for many years to come. Evolutionary musicologists will certainly have a lot to learn from their cousins in the language field but they will also get the chance to explore important new ground not covered by them. The book deals with animal song, general issues in human evolution, different proposals for the evolution of music and a final section about universals in music. I was pleased to see renowned thinkers like Derek Bickerton, Peter Marler and Dean Falk writing about music for the first time, and doing it so cogently. That, in itself, is worth the cover price. The book fulfills its promise of opening up an interdisciplinary dialog on the subject of music origins. The editors can be congratulated for bringing together an international group of contributors; no fewer than 8 countries are represented in the contributors list-a rare occurrence in such edited volumes. Despite this, the writing style is consistently high and with the exception of a few typos, the book was quite easy to navigate. Some of the chapters, like Miller's chapter on sexual selection reflect current \\"hot\\" topic in evolutionary psychology, and will no doubt lead to lots of discussions. Other chapters, such as those on universals, touch on topics that have been dormant or forgotten in musicology. It is exciting for me to see musical universals being discussed again after so many years of silence. The section called Theories of Music Origins will, no doubt, spur future thinking on the topic. This book is a strong beginning and I highly recommend this book to people who really want to delve into something completely fresh and new. They will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Origins of Music (Bradford Books)","review":"It is a measure of the pioneering nature of this book that its contributions lack any synergy. What we have here are specialists from a wide variety of fields attempting to apply their expertise to a new and undeveloped field. The results are all over the map. Some of the papers strain to be relevant; a few are major steps forward. Some of the papers are badly written; I had to re-read every sentence in one of them. I do not recommend this book to any reader seeking cogent answers to the problem of the origin of music; the truth is, we don't have those answers yet. This is a book for readers willing to accept the uncertainties at the edge of our knowledge, willing to plow through indirect approaches and early clumsy efforts. It is a purely academic book, with all the strengths and weaknesses implicit to that style of writing.

No one ever said this would be easy, and I am by no means equipped to do it properly even yet. Let me be honest: Christianity seems unalterably silly to me, the more so as I read more about it. The only thing that seems likely to rescue it for me, as an intellectual pursuit, is if I read some modern thinkers who were born into the Western scientific inheritance after the Protestant Reformation had a chance to shake itself out, and who completely absorb those teachings into their religious writings. I have a couple pointers to works that might fit this bill (The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza and The Philosophy of Spinoza), but in the meantime I can't help reading all of this with a smirk.McGiffert does his very best to treat these great thinkers seriously and concisely. We move briskly from the medival background to the Reformation -- namely Augustine -- through Luther and Calvin and Zwingli and Luther's student Philip Melanchthon. From there we get all manner of new Christians: we get Anabaptists and Socinians, Puritans and Pietists and evangelicals. They loathed each other. They viewed Christ differently. They viewed the relation between civil and spiritual government differently. Some took the Bible more literaly, some more symbolically. Some -- most -- of them viewed man as bottomlessly depraved, salvageable only by divine intervention. One sect's optimism forced its opponents to adopt an even more reactionary position. And so the whole mess spun out of control. (Well, that's one way to frame it. Another way is that the ambiguities in the Bible and in the life of Jesus, combined with new print technologies and wider literacy, led naturally to a flowering of divergent ideas. This is the kind of flowering where people kill one another. Death flowers.)One outcome of all of this was Rationalism -- making peace with the scientific and mathematical changes being wrought all around them and trying to justify Christianity on the basis of objectively obvious axioms. These didn't work out. One proof (described on p. 227) is based on the rightness of Christian ethics: since the outcome of Christianity is right living, clearly Christianity is right and true. Naturally one has to then argue that no other system of ethics could possibly produce right outcomes. The only way one can really cling to such a belief is by ignoring the non-Christian world altogether. This the British, among others, did.Maybe Christianity is totally incompatible with argument. This would conflict with a few hundred years during which Christians did feverishly try to make their religion mesh with reason, but why not? Late in the game, then, we get books with titles like Dodwell's: Christianity Not Founded on Argument: And the True Principle of Gospel-Evidence Assigned, counseling us that \\"Religion will not admit of the least alliance with reason,\\" that \\"The only power to bring us to religious faith is the Holy Spirit,\\" and that we should \\"trust ... in the Lord with all [our] heart[s], and lean not unto [our] own understanding.\\" This has a certain kind of honesty, but it sounds suspiciously like the terrified ravings of someone who's been backed into a corner: not only is he not scared, he's happy to be in the corner. He cannot explain why standards of argument that apply everywhere else do not apply to his own favored religion, so he pretends that he's not obliged to argue.Protestant Thought Before Kant is sort of the dual of Diarmaid MacCulloch's sweeping epic, \\"The Reformation.\\" Where MacCulloch was expansive and detailed, McGiffert is tightly focused and content to paint arcs. Where MacCulloch methodically covers the history with only enough theology to fill in some gaping holes, McGiffert's book is a little gem of theology with virtually no history surrounding it. The Thirty Years' War merits only a peep from McGiffert, whereas the first half or two-thirds of MacCulloch's book teased us toward the War's final convulsion.McGiffert could use more history; its absence means that he has to fall back to metaphysical handwaving. He tells us that liberalism, with its new feelings of optimism about man's place in the world and his ultimate redemption, emerged from some vague \\"modern spirit\\" (p. 176) or \\"general spirit of the modern age\\" (p. 187). As someone who respects historical materialism of the Guns, Germs, and Steel vein, this just won't do. But I can't blame McGiffert for cutting out almost all history: he wanted to pack all of Reformation theology into a couple hundred pages. I'll cut the guy some slack."},{"Title":"The Story Of The Dancing Frog (Dragonfly Books)","review":"This children's story by Quentin Blake captured my heart as a child and still does.

I myself am a literalist, in that I feel the Bible is a literal message of God to us written throughout Genesis through Revelation. But I am humble enough to admit that even I get lost in the shuffle of books that surround me, especially those dealing with the Old Testament. That is why I wish to tell anyone and everyone that if you need one book on Genesis, this book by Kline is the best one out there IMO (I would also suggest How to Read Genesis, which is also an A+ book, but should be read after Kline's). Kline goes into detail not in terms of whether or not it was 24 hours, or whatnot, but instead explores the meaning and the theology and (redemptive) history behind Genesis. You could say that Kline helps one to look at it through the eyes of the entire Bible, along with the culture at the time of Moses' writings of Genesis and the other books that make up the Torah. We must realize that the Bible was not written to battle Evolution, which I believe is false but that is beside the point, nor was it written in the eyes of how we today in the 21st century view historical writing. Instead, you might say, Kline helps you study and understand Genesis in such a way that you are given the understanding (and much much more) of Genesis through the eyes of those that Moses would have read it to, along with later generations of those Jews who would hold faith in God, leading up to Jesus Christ, the very image of God. If you want a better understanding of Genesis, if you want something that will help you through seminary studies and in the long run, you must find this book and keep it and treasure it."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Although this book is available for free online in .pdf format, books are forever.

I had him as a hermeneutics professor 20 years ago in Seminary, and am extremely gratified to find the manuscript texts I lost some years back (during a move between cities), here.Kline's best work came with the first 6 chapters of Genesis. Even in 1988, he had spent some 30 years of his life studying the first chapters of Genesis in great detail--in the original ancient Hebrew (etc).Though his wording can be thick and \\"theologically stilted\\" (ie. tough to wade through and brainy), it also provides an illuminating view of the foundational truths of the one, living, Creator-God, and His dealings with His Creation--especially man.While some have posted negative reviews, it is unlikely that they have spent 30-50 years of their lives studying such texts in their original languages, and teaching in so much depth--as Kline did. Nor have they known his instruction first-hand, as I have.Kline is a true conservative, and strictly orthodox in his approach to Scripture. Some here, have accused him of fitting his interpretation of Scripture to his own mental framework (eisegesis), rather than building a framework from his deep knowledge of the original texts (exegesis). They'd be wrong.[Geerhardus Vos, himself, called Kline: \\"The Prince of Exegetes\\" (and that's no small thing), but Kline played such things down, pouring himself, instead, into God's Word.]I can't say that I agree(d) with Dr. Kline in all respects, but I did always respect him. He made me think, and question what I believe in relation to the text--God's words. So, I am glad to purchase this this text, and wade through it again.When I knew him, his best & favorite work (by his own admission) had been through Genesis chapter 6, though his treatment through Abram/Abraham is also thought-provoking.So, if you're up to wading through some thick, but thought-provoking material, have a go at this. Your time won't be wasted.[Oh, and the thought that Kline was not reformed or a Calvinist (or even a heretic, as proposed by some leaving reviews) is laughable. Kline was so reformed/such a Calvinist, he squeeked.]"},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"This book by Kline is a wonderful commentary on the first chanpters of Genesis. Kline's background in Ancient Near Eastern Studies gives him special insight into the meaning of many of the peculiar phrasings in Genesis. Read this book if you want to be edified in your faith, or just want to learn more about the God of the Bible."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Kline's understanding of biblical theology is top. Get ready for a volume that is packed with helpful insight into the covenantal structure of Genesis - and beyond. Be warned, however, if you are expecting a simple introduction to covenant theology, Kline's vocabulary and grasp are very extensive and specialized. For a wonderful introduction, check out Chris Caughey's \\"A Tale of Two Adams\\", which is a great distillation of much of Kline's work.While the subtitle of Kingdom Prologue - \\"Genesis foundations for a covenantal worldview\\" - suggests a limited scope of Genesis, the reader will find out that Kline explores the whole canon, from Genesis to Revelation, to help paint the picture of the unity of history and Scripture by God's divinely administered covenants."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Both as a book on biblical theology and covenant theology this is indispensable. It is one of the best exegetical treatments of covenant around and also demonstrates lucidly that Genesis 1-12 provides a real seed bed for the rest of the Bible's story line."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Without a doubt, this book is one of the best (if not the best) books I have read on Genesis. If you're planning on preaching or teaching through Genesis, you cannot afford to be ignorant of Kline's work. You'll find vast amounts of material here not even touched in other commentaries of equal or larger size. Kline doesn't waste your time with giving you information that is accessible elsewhere. Instead, he blazes trails that others don't even think of going down. His conclusions are creative (but orthodox!), to say the least.If you're planning on preaching through Genesis and looking for suggestions for other commentaries, the following should be helpful:1. Preaching Christ from Genesis by Sydney Greidanus (my personal favorite)2. Unlocking Genesis 1-3 with the Christ of Eschatology by J.V. Fesko (Only covers the first 3 chapters, but is immensely helpful)3. Creation and Blessing by Allen Ross (Good, solid commentary that gets straight to the point)4. Genesis 1-17 in the NICNT by Victor Hamilton (painfully dry but good information)5. Kingdom Prologue by Meredith Kline6. Images of the Spirit by Meredith Kline (this book is frequently referred to in Kingdom Prologue, and often goes into more detail)If you're on a tight budget, this book is actually available as a pdf file on Monergism's website (just google \\"monergism classic resources\\" and search there). If you don't have a lot of time, then Hamilton, Fesko, and Greidanus should get the job done pretty easily."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Meredith Kline is at times difficult to understand and difficult to follow. This work would have benefited from an editor or coauthor. With that said, if you take the time to understand Meredith Kline then you will be rewarded for your effort. Many of the idea's that you encounter in this work you will also find validated in more recent works. One recent example of this is G. K. Beale's A New Testament Biblical Theology. While not following Kline on every point it would be difficult to miss Kline's influence.There are many good resources available for free on the internet that aide in better understanding the thought of Meredith Kline. For those beginning to approach Biblical Theology I recommend Lee Iron's Introduction to Kline mp3 series that can be accessed The Upper Register.Many readers will perhaps be turned off my Kline's Framework approach to Genesis 1. This approach doesn't discount the possibility of a six day creation but instead focuses on the theological and literary meaning of the text. Kline's use of comparative ANE studies sets an example for those who desire to understand the Old Testament in its original context. This isn't some novel concept. A similar approach is taken in New Testament studies when second temple literature is analyzed in order to understand the conceptual thought world of the day. While these works are not equal to scripture they are invaluable in helping us understand the competing ideas that would set themselves up against God's revelation. When you understand some of the ideas that existed in regards to creation in the ancient Near East you see with greater clarity the theological claims made in not only Genesis 1 but the rest of Genesis.The author is a reformed and covenantal theologian. This will be strange to many readers, both those unfamiliar with reformed theology and those unfamiliar with Covenant theology. The benefit of the covenantal approach is that it weds systematic to biblical theology. Reformed theology that is abstracted from God's unfolding covenantal relation is a hard thing.Kline takes \\"the unfolding of God's Covenantal Kingdom\\" as his approach to the grand theme of scripture. This is a helpful approach and will need to be incorporated in any future attempt to discern questions of central storyline."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"As a person who is fond of Calvin, Turretin, Bavinck, Murray, Lloyd-Jones, C.S. Lewis, Schaeffer, Poythress, et. al, I found Kline is only one step to heresy.For example,\\"Let us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness...\\" (Gen. 1:26)Who are \\"us\\" here? Kline says \\"angels\\" (see also p.242 in The Genesis Debate, ISBN-13: 978-0970224507)This is directly against the next verse, Gen. 1:27, \\"So God created man in his own image, in the image of GOD he created him, male and female he created them.\\"There are numerous other instances that Kline shows his tendency to New Age instead of Biblical, Christian, and Reformed Thoughts. Kline is wordy and equivocating. His arguments are circular, tricky, and frequently self-contradictory. Although this book is filled with \\"orthodox\\" terminologies, its incoherence reduces his arguments to worthless words.If you want to empty your church, read Kline!"},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Waste of money if you buy it;Waste of time if you read it;A perfect example of \\"eisgesis\\": Kline read-in his theological presupposition into biblical texts, instead of read-out (exegesis) what the Bible teaches.Preposterous: Kline is full of inconsistencies in his writing and argument. He writes something first, and then nullifies what he just said in the next paragraph or page.Very bad arguments: Kline does not know how to argue consistently; he frequently changes subject during argument. (Fallacy pointed out by Aristotle)Confusing: Kline uses many Christian and theological terminologies, but he add his own definitions/interpretations to them. For example, he says that it is God's \\"judgments\\" when God 'saw' it was very good (Genesis 1). The book is full of this kind of confusion. Should we confuse 'see' with 'judge'? Should we say God is 'judging' Jesus Christ when he \\"says\\" 'this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased'? Should we say Jesus Christ is 'judging' God when he \\"says\\" 'God alone is good'?Overloads biblical texts: This is a typical book of the \\"Emperor's New Cloth.\\" While some celebrate Kline's \\"creative\\" thinking, the fact is that he overloads the biblical texts without warrant.A responsible reader should say, \\"STOP! This is NOT biblical exegesis! This is personal eisgesis. The emperor has no cloth on!\\""},{"Title":"Memory Wax","review":"Alan Singer's novel focuses on what it means to have a body and what it means to have a consciousness and what it means to have a memory at a very involved philosophical level. These ideas are more dramatized than explained, which makes it a little hard to understand. Plus, he filters all these dramatized theories through his own complex theories about prose and fiction, which focus on rhetorical complexity in lieu of plot complexity and things of this nature.If you're absolutely blown away by the concept that people think, that people really, actually cogitate despite the fact that their consciousnesses are located in bodies, then you may just love this work. If not, that is, you believe in an eternal soul and/or otherwise think that the mind and body are not the same thing (or if you don't care one way or the other)you may want to take a pass because this work's philosophical underpinnings may not resonate much with you."},{"Title":"The Lives Of A Bengal Lancer","review":"What a great book. Yeats-Brown is an upper-class officer in a colonial regiment in India, and his writing style is reminiscent of Sassoon, Manning and Fussell, although not quite on their level. However, his story of life in a colonial regiment is very familiar to those officers serving in England...the lifestyle (pre WWI) of polo, hunting and life at the mess is very consistent.Where I found this book intriguing is Yeats-Brown's mobilization for WWI. The book takes interesting turns as he is sent to Europe, then back to Mesopotamia, but not as a Lancer but as an observer for the newly formed Royal Flying Corps.I believe Yeats-Brown has written other books about his captivity with the Turks, but this book has a good narrative of his time as a prisoner in wartime Turkey.THe book concludes with Yeats-Brown discovering the religions of India, and his eagerness to learn their secrets. Very interesting account of colonial India by someone who was a bit more observant of local customs than the average British officer.Easy to read...highly recommended"},{"Title":"No coffin for the corpse (Collier mystery)","review":"The Great Merlini tackles locked rooms and murderers who are themselves already dead in this Golden Age mystery featuring an ex-magician who runs a shop selling illusions to others while explaining other's illusions that hide murder.

Therefore, this book stuck out in my mind as one he definitely had. All that said, it was pretty great. I liked the jungle setting, which reminded me a lot of the island setting from the Tiki Island one. There were a lot of third parties in this book including Amazon Warrior Women, some big-game hunters, a jungle tribe, and a troll. The two storylines involve either turning into a fish-creature or getting lost and encountering all the above parties. A decent, if not terribly awesome, GYG book."},{"Title":"Deep in the Jungle of Doom (Give Yourself Goosebumps, No 11)","review":"As i did with most of the books in the Give Yourself Goosebumps series, I really enjoyed this one. There are two distinct storylines in this book. #1 is you eat a pear that turns into a fish monster and you have to turn human again, and #2 is you have to find three pieces of gold in a certain ammount of time OR ELSE you get turned into a gremlin.BY THE WAY: When I first looked at this book on amazon, I was annoyed that I there were no images of the back of the book, so I couldnt read the full synopsis. So here it is: You're headed to a South American jungle with your nature study class. Everythin seems pretty cool at first, but then you start to get bored. Wheres the beach? Wheres the excitement? So you and your friend decide to do a little exploring of your own. That's when you see something so freaky, all you want do do is get out of there! If you run screaming down one trail, you'll up at a waterfall with a creepy underground cave. If you choose the other trail, you'll eat some fruit that turns you into a crazy-looking fish monster.

This is, quite simply, a fabulous recording. I can't imagine anyone being dissappointed in it. The only thing I wished for when it was over was that it had been longer. It is two cds in length and is positively crammed with Keats' letters and poetry. It is a lovely blending between the two, in chronological order, the poetry spaced throughout. One of the best things about this recording is the reader' voice, tone, and interpretation. Samuel West reads Keats like he was born for it. I've heard other readings but his is by far the best. Very sensitive. I know I will return to this audio book again and again. It would make a perfect gift for someone you are trying to entice into reading Keats, or for someone who already adores Keats' work. You can't go wrong. I now look for other Naxos recordings read by Samuel West, his reading is that good."},{"Title":"Realms of Gold: The Letters and Poems of John Keats (Poetry)","review":"This is a very sympathetic record of Keats' letters and poems, and anyone interested in his thoughts/personality is likely to find themselves pleased."},{"Title":"The Usborne Complete First Book of Nature (Usborne First Nature)","review":"My four year old daughter loves this book. I use it as our homeschooling text for science and nature study, but it is not like a textbook at all. It is a compilation of seven separate titles in the Usborne First Nature series: Birds, Trees, Flowers, Butterflies and Moths, Wild Animals, Fishes, and Creepy Crawlies. Each chapter contains games like hunt the bumblebee in the Butterflies and Moths chapter, and watch the leaf bud open (on the upper right corner of each page) of the Trees chapter. My daughter is fascinated by the fabulous illustrations, such as the giant beetle in the Creepy Crawlies chapter, and the sharp teeth of the Dragon Fish in the Fishes chapter.

Each picture and caption add to the overall topic with interesting facts, but there is not really any story being told. Although the book has a few fun activities such as searching for hidden pictures, it does not contain any nature experiments, outdoor activity suggestions, or the like.My 6 year old enjoyed this book, but my 4 year old did not.

Even a mushroom like the moose, ultimate or not, was fascinated enough to eat this book in one gulp with no water. If you have a daughter, especially anywhere in-between 8-13 years old, this is a perfect gift guaranteed to have your child reading madly, with her cheeks flushed and mouth slightly agape. For just a few pennies, \\"Zillah & Me\\" gave the old mushroom of a moose so much sunshine... You sure you wouldn't like to share a mysterious ride back into the times when you were a young, small mushroom?Katie and her mom have to leave their house London and travel to Cornwall. A new fish in the pond, Katie half-expects to be a stranger, the new one, which everyone stares at much like a raven at a bone. However, with her sunny character, she does not give it much thought, as at present there are things that worry her much more:\\"If you need the toilet you have to go downstairs, out of the back door, then down the path to the outside toilet at the bottom of the garden. Can you believe that we've come to live for a whole year in a cottage without an inside toilet? In fact there is no bathroom at all. There's a sink in the kitchen where we can wash, and a tin bath that Mom says we can fill with hot water from the stove.'We'll light a fire, and have our baths in front of it. It'll be really cozy. Just imagine, Katie, a bath by firelight.'Hmm. I can see that we won't be having baths too often. I think of the power-shower in our house in London and feel a pang of homesickness. My friends would kill me if they knew that the first thing I missed was the shower. But at least we've got running water, and electricity, so I can read in bed. Imagine if we only had candles... But the outside toilet is going to be a problem. The spider angle was the first thing I checked out. My findings were:1. an exceptionally large black spider crouched on top of the toilet door, ready to zoom down as soon as anyone got comfortable;2. a nest of spidelings in the corner, waiting to turn into large spiders and join their mom on top of the door;3. (last-minute discovery) a small brown spider with very hairy legs crouched inside the toilet roll, waiting for me.\\"Katie meets Zillah, a local girl, daughter of her mom's good old friend. Initially, the girl seems to be very unpleasant, closed in her own shell, but our goodhearted Katie does not give up, being more mystified than offended, and so begins the uneasy acquintance, which over time transforms into a great friendship, cemented by a great secret the two of them share. Yes, says the old mushroom of a moose (when I was at Katie and Zillah's age, I thought the age of 30 was much like being a prehistoric fossil. Well, didn't you?), yes - that's exactly what one can expect from girls. Secrets! Always secrets, haha. The old mushroom of a moose is smiling as he writes these words, being as far from serious as he can get, for due to this lovely little book he was just transformed into a little boy, feeling the unmistakable scent of the world, the scent of childhood. Moose is an old grump - by golly, almost thirty years old, but he sure can enjoy a good, bright story like \\"Zillah & Me\\", and can only wish he had his own children to tell these stories to, or read aloud much like Katie's mom in the Cornwall cottage, by the fireplace..."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Anyone who has lived in a city will recognise the stories narrated in this book even if he's never come to direct contact with the type of characters depicted in them.It's an instinctive recognition though. I grew up part of my life in Queens N.Y and while reading through this book i felt that these were stories i heard as a kid being screamed through my window.Shelby is not using any imagination in the \\"Last exit...\\" but this isn't his talent to begin with. His talent is being an impeccable \\"watcher\\", he has watched the world around him and he's been able to describe it with brutal accuracy, much like a camera filming riots or the daily life of anyone. You cant argue much with a camera and Shelby functions very much like a human one, simply or \\"simply\\" reproducing the reality we all love to ignore on paper.It's certainly a world with very lil love or compassion to offer, the one Shelby describes, but for anyone who thinks this might be somewhat exaggerated i'd have to say this: look again and this time with your eyes open.He chooses unmistakebly dark characters for his stories: prostitutes, dark dealers, cryptohomosexuals who lead the \\"normal\\" life on the surface and the such, but his knife cuts way deeper when he opts for the \\"guy next door\\" character, the one who lives in -again- \\"normal hell\\", the one who spends his life in an agony of pointless routine, who lives but doesnt live, who is there but he might've just as well (for his/her) sake not existed.....This is what the \\"Last exit...\\" is all about.The schemes, the vanities, the shortcomings of the many different characters involved in Shelby's stories are maybe nothing you havent at least heard before, but do trust me, they do make up for one massive horror story.Now, speaking of a horror story, horror film [fans] on reality. This applies spot on with this book.It's a dark world out there, and no matter what your personal situation might be (even if it coincidentally is a lil better than the next guy's) there's no need painting it with rosy colors. It's what it is, and Shelby comes through with a disarming honesty about it. His first intention might not be honesty itself but you'll find it hard to fault him for what he chooses to bring to the surface.The narrative style of this book is nothing short of genius, especially considering the time it was written. In a sense, picking your narrative style when writting a bok is very much like casting actors for a film. Cast the wrong ppl and the film goes down the drain, choose the wrong narrative technique and there goes your whole book being self-trashed.Overall, if you like dark literature, if hi-fidelity reproduction of reality on paper is your thing you will be more than well served here. A true classic beyond any question."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I had always heard people speak of Selby's, \\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\\", yet it was not until recently that I picked it up.

More coherent than Burroughs,he sweeps the reader along in a stream of theurban colloquial language of the 1950's.He is also a far more pessimistic writer thanBurroughs. His characters spin in a tight downwardspiral to their own destruction. Considerationsof empathy with the characters are beside thepoint-the relentless urge to self-destructionis the center of all these stories.This combination of a single theme and beautifulwriting could make for a book that's hard toput down. In fact, the effect is often the opposite.The constant ugliness makes it hard for a readerto see a bit of herself in these characters andin spite of the beauty, the ultimate feeling isone of repulsion.It's easy to see why this book attracted so muchattention when first published and it's worth readngtoday as a milestone.

I'm saying that this novel was taboo, Transgressional fiction, brilliantly portraying the weirdness, the violence, the sickness that always plagued society. It's not exactly timeless, but it does have it's moments."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Hubert Selby Jr. first caught my eye with Requiem for a Dream. His disjointed, stream-of-consiousness narrative fits perfectly with his subject matter, lending a simultaniously manic and insightful voice to his myriad characters.As Selby's premier novel, one critic aptly described Last Exit to Brooklyn as an \\"urgent ticker tape from hell\\". This book will grab you by the throat and drag you, willingly or otherwise, into Selby's Brooklyn.The first story, \\"Another Day Another Dollar\\" is a short tale of the violent exploits of a street gang that resides within the Brooklyn neighborhood. This group shows up again in a few of the following stories, and functions as a sort of metaphorical and physical dark angel, a manifestation of the backlash of the characters' vices.The second story, \\"The Queen is Dead\\" details the exploits of Georgette, a drag queen, and her friends. Georgette is one of the most pure characters, in a sense, because she searches for true love, while the others would have physical satisfaction.In \\"Tralala\\", a young, hateful prostitute seeks attention and gets it, dying as she lived: in a dirty back alley, covered in the shame of her customers. Lacking the ability to understand the love shown to her, she continues to seek the only approval she has ever known: men's appreciation of her body.The fourth short story, \\"Strike\\" involves Harry Black, a union official running a strike at a manufacturing company. His struggles at home, at work, and with his own sexuality allow the reader to simultaniously despise and hate him.The final short story, a coda titled \\"Landsend\\", about what the possible fate of the gang members could be once they marry and settle into a government housing complex.Selby's ability to write these otherwise dispicpable characters with compassion is what makes his novels so intriguing. If you were a fan of Requiem for a Dream, this will more than satisfy any craving for Selby's unique cocktail of American naturalism and European existentialsm."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"When you start \\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\\", you're suddenly struck with the notion that you, yourself have gotten off on an unfamiliar exit. The writing itself is odd - paragraphs that are nothing more than drops down to the next line, a lack of quotation marks and apostrophes, and the subject matter - drugs, transvestites, and violence - they all give you this feeling that you're someplace different, someplace that maybe isn't quite safe. Yet it is exactly the danger of what Selby puts in front of you, the reader, that keeps you drawn to the story.Selby's prose, while unconventional, gives the whole book the notion and feeling of a fever dream. Selby may not use traditional grammar, but he is a master at communicating through the shattering of grammar's conventions. His content makes you wonder what kind of a person could or even would, lay the ugliness of the human condition so clearly to bare.This isn't a book for the squeamish. Some of the images will cause even the most hardened reader to squirm and try to look away. Those images include gang rape, spousal abuse, a man defecating in an elevator, and much more. Yet the most disturbing image is the subtle nuance behind each of the 6 intertwined story/chapters - it is the disturbing image of what happens when we cease to treat one another as humans, and begin to treat one another as objects.As a Christian reviewer, I can't say enough about the clear image of sin that this book offers. Augustine wrote that sin is \\"homo curvatus en se\\", that is, man turned in on himself. Selby offers us six stories of men and women who turn in on themselves, perhaps in the hope that we will turn and live for others."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I'll be honest: I was scared to read this book. I swore Selby Jr. off after watching \\"Requiem for a Dream\\". I couldn't take anything that brutal ever again. But, I found that Hubert Selby, Jr. is impossible to ignore. Obsessing over this book after hearing so much of its notoriety, I caved. I finished it in a little less than two days.What made this book so amazing to me, was that it worked on two levels. First, the book itself is just beautiful. Each story, violent and tragic, was spared no detail. You, the reader, could easily picture everything, and I mean everything happening. And Selby's style, though a high school english teacher's worst nightmare, was so powerful. The devices he used were so effective, if unorthodox. For example, writing certain passages in all caps, making a sentence last for four pages, and simulating a \\"bad trip\\" without even mentioning any sort of hint as to what was going on are just some of the brilliant elements of this book.The second level came after finishing the book. I spent a long time reflecting on what I had just read. A lot of inner dialogue played out: I know this book is fiction, but I wonder how much this actually happens... Why so much misery? If one wanted to show how ugly life was in Brooklyn, why didn't he just make a nonfiction book?That went on for some time. To conclude, this is a gripping, brutally honest depiction of, as Selby put it, \\"losing control\\". I think this was/is a major social statement on life in grinding poverty, a desolate environment, and an absence of humanity. This book will change your life."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I am a senior in high school, but I first read this book as a sophmore. It was mentioned as greatly influential to Henry Rollins in one of his interviews. So, I decided to give Selby a shot. He didn't shock me or disgust me (I guess that says something for my cynical generation) but, he has talent and he write a good book. I have only read a few that I have thoroughly enjoyed more that Last Exit. What am I saying... this guy is amazing... just get this book!"},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This is my first book review so please excuse the format. After reading this book I felt dirty... like a peeping tom or like I just read someone's diary. That is a credit to Selby's writing style. It flows like real conversation and real thoughts. I live a very sheltered, somewhat isolated life. I'm lucky in a sense but the downside is that I don't have much \\"life experience\\" which is mostly self-imposed. I've never dealt with drug or physical abuse or seen street life first hand so the voyeur in me likes to watch from a distance. I kinda hate that I have the urge to watch shows like Intervention and that a sick part of me enjoyed the movie Requiem of a Dream. That movie really disturbed me but I still researched it and found out that Selby was a well regarded author. After reading the reviews I decided to read the book even though the reviewers gave ample warning. So, after reading it, would I recommend it? The answer is no unless you want to torture yourself. It's really painful to read. I know that life is hard and horrible things happen in the world but this book really takes you to a dark place mentally. The world the book speaks of does exist which is the scariest part of all. I'm pretty sure that this book has a place in the world because it's so real but I think I'll stick to Stephen King. I'm giving it a 3 because Selby's writing style is very unique...Lots of run-on sentences and the brooklyn accent is literally spelled out so that you can understand what the characters sound like."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"After reading 'Requiem for a Dream' I was enthusiastic about reading this highly rated book. Like 'Requiem for ...', all of the characters in this novel do not do any introspection and are either unable or unwilling to see themselves objectively largely because of their environment. Basically this book takes us into the minds of the powerless; those who live on the fringes of society; the people looked down on by society at large. We see things from their eyes, we walk in their shoes and experience what they experience.The idea that the playing field is level and anyone can do what they want if they just work hard is just plain .... Although I didn't grow up in the inner city, I was not completely sheltered and hence can understand how a person's environment shapes who they are and their opportunities in life. After reading this book, I became even more educated about life on the fringes in the inner city. I've met people from the inner city who've told me that I can't understand where they are coming from since I haven't 'experienced' what they have 'experienced'. Regardless of what people say, I think reading Last Exit brings one closer to experiencing life in 'the other america' and forces us to really appreciate our lives more.The sad thing about books like this is that the people who really need a dose of it turn their noses up and ignore the message."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I know this is considered a breakthrough literary classic of some kind, and I gave it my best shot. I stuck with it as long as I could, but no thank you. I was expecting a great story about Brooklyn .... don't laugh at me ! The book is dated, disturbing, sad and so awfully vicious. It's quite a sinkhole in fact.The gratuitous cruelty of the characters to each other was too much for me. I bailed out after the first long section. I didn't need my nose stuck in this mess. Somebody tell me there was one glimmer of human spirit in there, later, and I just didn't get to it."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Okay, I got the kindle edition of this book - which was fine. I didn't have any problem with navigation or anything like that, but I'm not a big fan of digital books, I like the traditional version better.I gave it five stars because of the book itself. I love the stories. I love that it takes place in Brooklyn, because I'm a native New Yorker from NYC, and I lived on the border of Brooklyn and Queens for a good portion of my life, and hung out in Brooklyn for a number of years.Again, I can't give any details about the print edition because I didn't get that one; and the kindle edition had no navigation problems or viewing problems."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This book was refered to me by a high school student where it was required reading. They could not bring it home. I think their parents would be shocked by its content. And they banned Catcher in the Rye? It does serve to free up ones mind to write anything in ones imagination."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I was on the fence about this book for a long time after reading it. I wasn't overly offended by the content and I don't think I made some sort of gross misinterpretation of it's message. (Indeed, it is arguable if there even is one.) All in all, I just wasn't impressed by this book.Now, granted, I was born in 1990, but I realize that when this book was released back in the 60s, it was some pretty shocking stuff. The 50s, which had just ended, were an era in which the population at large (and powers that be) liked to pretend that everything in America was peachy-keen, and presented itself accordingly. So naturally, when someone publishes a book (I wonder how it even got published at the time?) about the dark underbelly of society and talks about things which were deemed socially unacceptable and uncouth to discuss, it's going to have a large impact. And because life in the real world IS tough, and tough issues are not something which should be ignored or \\"swept under the rug\\", so to speak, I give this novel credit where it's due. I found myself grappling with \\"morals\\" or \\"messages\\" in this book, and often I couldn't seem to find any, or the ones I did find were very weak. I, personally, came to the conclusion that the \\"message\\" was that there is really no message- that sometimes violence and injustice are senseless in this world, and that that is what Selby was attempting to expose. These realist \\"slap-in-the-face\\" expos&eacute;s are admirable, and account for one of my two stars.The other thing which I found at least moderately redeeming about this book was it's avant garde style. The lack of punctuation/correct grammar, the run-on sentences, the use of ALL CAPS are, for the most part, not frivolous and serve to highlight character pathos and rising action in fresh ways. (These rather bold stylistic risks account for my second star, although there were plenty of times when I thought Selby took this a bit far. I really didn't see the need for replacing a \\" ' \\" with a \\"/\\" in contractions, e.g. \\"don't\\" becoming \\"don/t\\".)So there you have what I appreciated about the book. Now let me tell you what I wasn't such a fan of.One thing that really bugged me about this book was the endings of it's stories. I was assigned to read this in my 'Studies for Writers' class, and every time we discussed endings it was as if I'd read a different book. Maybe I just have an odd way of interpreting things (which is entirely possible,) but I seem to have missed many main points towards the end of these stories. Good examples of this come at the end of \\"The Queen is Dead\\" (my favorite story in the book, by the way,) and at the end of \\"Tralala\\". If my teacher is correct (and I certainly feel that all literary interpretations are debatable,) Georgette dies in the end of \\"The Queen...\\", but Tralala lives at the end of her tale. I had thought that Georgette's death was a metaphorical one- the death of her denial and her realization that Vinnie doesn't (and never will) love her, and I had thought that the end of Tralala was pretty self-explanatory- that her lifestyle eventually kills her when she is literally raped to death. At the end of \\"Strike\\" there is also apparently some crucifixion symbolism I completely missed? Upon re-reading the end of that story I suppose that one sort of makes sense, yet it still seems a stretch to me, because I wouldn't have noticed it on my own. I guess you could argue that the writing is cinematic in it's vagueness, but if it was indeed intended to convey the things I'm told it was supposed to convey, it is a bit too vague in my opinion.It becomes exhausting (perhaps even boring) attempting to read this book at length because eventually it all starts to sound the same. It's extremely detailed to a flaw. Again, I can appreciate a cinematic quality, but give me some plot, please. If I wanted to read snuff film scripts, I'd do so. However, I don't, so it'd be nice if these stories started getting to the crux of the matter instead of beating around the (excessively violent) bush. Part of me feels like Selby is being violent simply for being violent's sake- attempting to be shocking. Frankly, it's annoying. I feel condescended upon. I understand that the world is an exceedingly violent place, but I don't want to read about it for 300 pages. I get enough bad news from the newspaper. But, again, we come back to the whole fact that this book was written nearly 50 years ago.At the end of the day, this book is commendable for it's efforts in realism and stylistic risks, but doesn't deliver in the \\"satisfaction\\" department, and one without the other in a novel, in my humble opinion, is \\"nothing to write home about\\", as the saying goes."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I read this many years ago. When asked, I still say it is one of the two best books I've read. The \\"I\\" is significant here, because I too grew up in a housing project much like the one depicted. And life really was that way, brutal and sexual in a highly convoluted fashion. Think of \\"connection\\" being purely sexual in an environment that knew no other way. It is that way in which intimacy is convoluted into a form that always borders on aggression; psychopathic behavior is the norm. Gangs bang, so much so, that it feels queer being on the outs. For those who have the stomach, it is that juxtaposition that is the fodder of this gifted writer and his novel."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Selby's \\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\\" is surely one of the most violent, explicit, and sickening novels of our time--however, it conveys a sense of the life lived by people in the underworld of American society. To be honest, this has been only book that has interested me in over five years."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Hubert Selby's novel Last Exit To Brooklyn is a harrowing and a sprawling portrait of underachievers in Brooklyn. A lot of it has to do with homosexuality, drag queens, drugs, financial and relationship problems, and living in bad neighborhoods. It was hard to read, due to lack of punctuation, and Selby's scatterbrain style of writing (he himself said in an interview that he had some sort of mental problem, so I can see that), but overall it was a good book and if you're willing to take an adventure into the underworld of Brooklyn and disillusionment, read this book."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I'm a big fan of Darren Aronofsky, which is what turned me on to this book. After seeing Requiem for a Dream, I read that Aronofsky started reading Selby with this book, so I figured I should start reading him with this book as well.I was surprised to find out what it was about, if that's even possible to determine. It was fantastically written, which is the only thing that kept me turning the pages at first. As for the subject matter, I couldn't really connect with what was being said... for the first 2/3 of the book, it was mostly about drag-queens, homosexuallity, things of that sort. With Requiem, I connected with the characters on a level because of my personal experience with drugs, but with Last Exit, I connected with the characters because of Selby's amazing writing techniques.I have to admit, though, that as much as I liked this book, I found it hard to follow with his use of the same names in different stories... and the last 1/3 of the book seemed too scatter-brained for my taste, and seemed way off the rocker with the rest of the book... I'm not complaining, just something I wasn't prepared for I guess.All-in-all, though, this guy is an amazing author."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Selby takes the english language and scrambles it with a typewriter. This is a very TASTY book but hard to stomach for some because of gut wrenching subject matter; it's about hatred, poverty, gangs, violence, unions, alcoholism, drug addiction, abusive marriages- being torn apart from the inside and doing nothing about it except to look in the mirror. It is not for the squeamish or the literarely faint. And forget everything you ever learned in school about prose- this is the real thing- tough and razor blade sharp"},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This book is a remarkable act of love and courage. Selby practicaly invented modern American fiction with this novel, an intense, honest look at life on the edge in the Brooklyn of the 1960's, when Charlie Parker and drag queens and benzendrine were just starting to signal the end of the 1950's and the start life as we know it today. There is also an excellent movie of the same name, but there is no substitute for the original. I wish this book was required reading in every American high school, though our nation is too narrow and frightened and dishonest to let a book like this into a high school library. Brief, intense, and violent, it stands with the best American classics. If you are serious about literature, or culture, or the human heart, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I first read this book in the 60's. It exposed me to a world I couldnever have imagined. The picture of Selby on the back cover showed anintensity seldom seen. The stories could have been in a horror anthology.Shocking does not adaquetly describe what the unwary reader has in store.95% of the people I know could not make it through the first storie.Be advised!"},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This is the second book of Selby's I've enjoyed, Requiem of a Dream was the first. I will continue to order his works, as I consider him one of the best American writers, The Room more than likely will be next. He is a very talented writer who prefers writing about characters with major character flaws, yet instead of condesending them, he allows us to see what drives them to do the things that ultimately destroy their lives, thus allowing the reader to see the tragedy and feel empathy towards them. He writes in a musical fashion, something of a cross between poetry and a typist's prose with minimal punctuation to get in the way (although that takes some getting used to).Last Exit concerns itself with the downward spiraling lives of various \\"lowlifes\\" in NYC during the 50's. There's a transvestite drug abuser named Georgette who is in love with Vinnie, a street thug who only uses him for drugs and money. Tralala is a vain street hustler and hooker who blows her chance at a decent life, and wastes away in bars searching for the next john that will make her feel like she is as beautiful as she imagines herself again, and Harry is an unhappily married and disturbed union strike leader. During the story he discovers he is a homosexual and finds happiness in various relationships with the drag queens of a local bar. However, after the strike is over and he is broke, he is shunned by the group and destroys himself by doing a terrible thing trying to regain his lost fulfillment. Also there are quite a few short stories at the end, following various characters through their daily routines, personally my favorite part of the novel.The stories intertwine at times, and are very graphic in language, sex, and violence, not allowing the reader to look away even in the darkest sections of the novel. It was released in 1964, and was banned in Britian for a couple of years, labeled by the government as \\"obscene\\". However, if you can look past the subject matter and read this book, I can pretty much guarantee you will grow as a person. And anyone who enjoys classic American literature and/or a good story, albeit not always with a happy ending, will find much to love here."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Hubert Selby, Jr. delivered the goods when he wrote this book. Unflinchingly honest, at times extremely brutal, Last Exit To Brooklyn gives the reader the literary equivalent of a hand grenade with the pin missing. Selby does not give readers of the book an easy time, as he brilliantly details the nonsensical minutiae, the surges of emotion and the sometimes inane nature of humanity that reside within the characters of the book, and, more importantly, within ourselves. What I'm saying is this: READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Brutal, unsparing and unflinching look into the lives of the unloved and unloving. Full of hard truths and repellent characters, but it's like a car accident that you can't look away from. Written by Selby with a brilliant sense of immediacy and accuracy. A tragic, angry masterpiece."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"of all the children of william burroughs, i thought this book in my youth was the most substantial and risk-taking, and i wondered now that we see how sleazy kerouac really became, if this book held up, after well, a lifetime in which i lived a profesional totally boring family life, and i think it does. i was heartened to reread it."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Good read. Selby reminds me of Richard Price. A gloomy portrait of Brooklyn/s poor post WWII. Not for the faint of heart. I have gone on a reading kick the past two weeks with Selby and Price and am mentally exhausted. What/s the message? Society sucks? We need to help poor people more? I/m not sure, but what I have taken from these books is a tremendous respect for both authors sharp writing style. Like their subject matter their writing is raw and intense."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"The book is a testament to struggle and what a human being can not only manage but come to know as normal everyday life. I highly recommend it to anyone who has never been poor or believe that if the unforunate would only work harder they could somehow change fate."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Loved it, I understand its standing as a classic and will continue to read the rest of Selby's works. I'm usually not the type to NEED to read a book to see what's going to happen... I needed to read this one every night until I couldn't keep ky eyes open any longer. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This is a powerful work. Selby draws a picture, in several related short stories, of poverty, corruption, prostitution and moral bankruptcy (and I'm not referring to the depictions of homosexuality). I think Selby's diction is a bit inconsistent (even within each individual story), but it's a remarkable achievement. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Controversy has always surrounded Selby, Jr.'s writing. From the start, with Last Exit (being his first novel), his original UK publisher Calder and Boyers, faced prosecution in the UK in 1967, under the 1959 Obscene Publications Act. It was a major trial, especially because while it was originally found guilty of being \`obscene', the Appeal in 1968 overturned that decision and paved way for a much more open-minded interpretation of literature as to merit.In some interviews, and in one introduction to the novel that he wrote, Selby himself said that he when he was writing this novel (six years in the making), he \`was only aware of the rage and anger within' (quoted from the QPB edition in 1994). He also acknowledged that, while he has no favourite among his novels, he singles out The Room, and then this novel, notably, because through it he \`truly did learn how to write' (quote from same QPB edition).Set in New York in the late 1950s, the story grabs you from the start, conveying an incredibly raw, visceral, yet always disturbingly poetic quality throughout. It is superb for its genuine grittiness, horribly grim reality and ugliness of modern inner city life - of thought, attitude, action and feeling - both projected outwards, as well as internalised, all of which is captured through numerous voices of the dispossessed, alienated, disenfranchised. Selby is in the tradition of naturalist/realist fiction, but he goes a significant step further, in that, often through his first-person character narratives/viewpoints, he achieves an hallucinatory quality whose intensity strengthens the realities he conveys.One critic, James R. Giles, in his excellent study of Selby's works,Understanding Hubert Selby, Jr. (Understanding Contemporary American Literature), wrote \`It is true that, while all the characters in the novel are victimized by a brutal environment, they are guilty of moral failures that make their victimization complete and irrevocable', and this is done by Selby's exploring without fear or judgement powerful themes that resonant as much today as they did on first publication in 1964 in the US: drug addiction, misogyny, violence of rape and beatings, prostitution, the relentless drudgery and alienation of most jobs as well as unemployment, without value or meaning and life in general that is suffused with hate and a distressingly dark, twisted humour (when not expressed through seething resentment or explosive anger).I reckon, Dante would have regarded Last Exit as a worthy match to his own vision of Hell - especially through characters who represent the sick underbelly of the city: self-deluding, beaten-up prostitutes, incredibly violent youths and gangs, a desperately lonely, elderly woman who has no life other than pathetic memories of her dead husband and son, among others. As for disturbing, truly dark humour, one such example will give you a powerful sense of it: at one point, two women sitting chatting on a bench in a miserable New York housing project, joke about and look forward with sick, twisted glee to the prospect of a baby - crawling on an upper-storey tenement window-ledge - falling to its death: they're disappointed that it is saved in the nick of time).In particular, the lives of a handful of individuals are portrayed with great psychological depth, narrated most often from the first-person viewpoint, in a stream-of-consciousness fashion that remains clear, coherent and compelling. These viewpoints capture their desperation, self-loathing, hatred and confusion about themselves and their environments: defiant yet self-deluding Georgette, a hig drag queen who is pathetically in love with Vinnie and convinced she can change him for the better and that he will truly love her; while he himself is a psychopathic and sociopathic gang leader interested in only in sadistic and often instant gratification; Tralala, a violently angry, predatory prostitute who ultimately is destroyed in the most horrifying way imaginable; Harry - interestingly, that name is ubiquitous among male characters in Selby's fiction, acting as a synonym for the type of man who is misogynistic, dispossessed, angry, self-loathing, and self-deluding - who is a trade union leader, loathsome, selfish, arrogant and boring, who is despised or at best tolerated by his co-workers - and, worse, whose misogyny is so genuinely convincing and disturbing, which we hear, being \`inside his head', listening trapped to his banal voice, desperation, loathing and perspective, such that it makes Bateman's misogyny inAmerican Psychoappear not only over the top, but utterly unreal (and never mind Ellis' darkly satirical intentions).Selby has been described as a \`clinician of violence ... whose novels have the immediacy of art' (Josephine Hendin,Vulnerable People: A View of American Fiction Since 1945 (A Galaxy book)), which I think is true; likewise, he is a literary master of demonstrating through his characters a moral ugliness, misogyny and despair whose power as a novelist is unmatched and unprecedented in fiction. He is a truly remarkable writer, and, while he wrote six novels in his lifetime, I believe the most powerful and compelling (while not the darkest), remains Last Exit. I cannot recommend it highly enough - it is a genuine work of art, but its power is dark and troubling, so I would likewise highly recommend you stay clear of this novel if you find yourself in a depressed frame of mind!"},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"this was one book that i couldnt put down. its still disturbing at times &lt;read Strike&gt; but it flows beautifully and is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Don't expect this book to be a moral mouthpiece. Don't expect this book to be light-hearted entertainment. And whatever notion you have of it teaching you a lesson, should be shuffled aside.The only difference between the rich lady from Uptown Manhattan the junkie from the Lower East Side is money. That's it. And whatever you need to do to close the gap, is your business.If you need to peddle yourself off to sailors and steal their wallets, if you need to change out of briefs and into some panties to get green while you walk the streets and if you need to drill horse in your veins as an after-work hobby, so be it.Everyone gets desperate for what is lacking in life--they get desperate for what they need and can't have. And even if they think it's just money while it's really something much more human and simpler than that, that onus is on the reader to develop as s/he watches the characters weave in and out of degrading situations.Selby's job as novelist is not to make you socially aware or engage your moraliy as some have suggested. And the quality of this book certainly has nothing to do with how well Requiem For A Dream did in the theatres in comparison.This book's elegance rests on its narrative. It's ability to give voice to different people, of different socio-economic backgrounds, dwelling in different pockets of NY trying to survive. And the only thing shocking in this book is not the drug use, the sexuality, or even the colourful cussing. What remains with the reader long after the pages have been digested is that overwhelming sense of unsettled nausea--no human being ever escapes their vices without it taking a toll on them. Last Exit to Brooklyn, read it."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"... who was a phenomenal writer. Algren did it before and did it better than Selby (especially in this book) which is similar to 'Never Come Morning' and several other titles of his."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"No, I'm not being sarcastic, the prose here might be hard to penetrate at first, but it's very deep and moving. I'll admit, I had a hella hard time getting through this book at first, I actually put it down after reading the first story! Then I read up some on Mr Selby, and things became more clear to me.Yes, there really isn't any punctuation, or any clues who's speaking at the moment, but that's part of the point. A lot of these stories are totally self contained, coming from the point of view of the character. And though the changes the characters go though might not be explicitly stated, you can tell their changes by the way the rhythm of their speech patterns changes.All in all, it might take two readings before you get on to these things, but once you do, there's no going back. This is one helluva book, and got me into Selby's work, and I'm very thankful for that. He has a way to get under your skin, to know what YOU are thinking and feeling.And as many others have already pointed out, these are not the usual types of people most would like to be around. In fact, I'm sure a good many of us would try to avoid them at all costs. But the way Selby portrays them here, you genuinely feel compassion and love for them.This book certainly isn't for everybody, though not really sexually explicit or particularly violent, there are some scenes that could upset many more weak stomached readers, and the dialog is VERY profane.

This book showed how absolutley lifeless people can be, the immidiate thrill. A very well written book, Hubert Selby was a genius. I'm from Iowa and I can still relate to the problems addressed in this book. Like in \\"The Outsiders\\" when cherry said \\"It's rough all over....\\" very very true.

Urban decay and the rough times of just getting by are incredibly documented in this fantastic novel. It will make you laugh and cry at the same time.

Touted as being both gritty and shocking, I found that it fell flat simply because of Selby's writing style. The surrealistic prose that added delirium to \`Requiem For A Dream' only provides detachment when Selby paints his \`Brooklyn' characters.Perhaps in the 50's this book was a bold play on drugs, prostitution, homosexuality, and futility, but it hasn't stood the test of time, in my own humble opinion, like \`Requiem For A Dream' has.Divided into almost separate stories that document different characters from the neighborhood, \`Brooklyn' is a choppy and difficult story to follow. Larry Brown has painted horrid characters that still compel me to read more about them, but I simply could not get around the surreal angle to a group of misfits with no depth to them.We meet a gang of thugs at a diner in a squalid neighborhood in the chapter \`Another Day, Another Dollar', a drag queen named Georgette who dances around and pops bennies like gumdrops in \`The Queen Is Dead', an uninteresting short about Tommy, his baby, and a motorcycle in \`And Baby Makes Three', follow a service-for-substance prostitute in \`Tra-La-La', meet a lazy and stupefying ignorant machine worker who falls in love with a drag queen during his union's strike in \`Strike', and wind through the dull and primitive lives of the tenants in a low rent project in \`Landsend'. That's it.Of all the tales, \`Strike' was the only one that kept any cohesiveness to it, the rest just drifted in and out of focus on a long, meandering path to nowhere. It's not that the characters in the book weren't vulgar and course, but I felt all the while like I was just peeking at them through a scummy window, not involved, no pain or despair leaking through to me. I want to be able to feel the grit between my teeth, to taste the exquisite flavors of misery, human disintegration, and worthlessness, and smell the tangy aroma of demoralized failure. \`Brooklyn' simply doesn't satisfy the palate.If you want to pick up a good Selby novel, then grab Requiem For A Dream instead of Last Exit To Brooklyn."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"*hubert selby jr. is my favorite writer of all-time, specifically for his brutal honesty-all of selby's work will be regarded in my eyes as genius,but l.e.t.b. just was not his best work in my opinon+ + +what i liked*several short installments (good for readers who dislike selby's quick, non-stop pace)* \\"Tralala\\"-my favorite section of the novel, not too short, not too long, despicable yet intriguing character- - - Dislikes* \\"The Strike\\"-agonizing at times and quite tedious, an overdose of selby's trouncing darkness"},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I first read LAST EXIT when I was in junior high school, having discovered it mixed in with a cache of other books in my mother's library. I read it twice in a week, then a few more times, more slowly, over the following months. Selby crashed into my life like a meteor smacking into the earth -- literally, like someone from another world, which was what he was reporting to me. He wrote about the life in the city around him, which ruined many and forced some to ruin others, and starved people for love and made them turn to hateful substitutes. He also wrote unflinchingly about sexual agony, something I hadn't seen addressed honestly in any fiction at all until I'd read him. He also wrote with great empathy; he didn't hate any of his characters, even the vilest ones, but wanted to give them all a clear moment in the sun for us to see. I've gone on to recommend this book to others that I know will be moved and stunned by it, and they've in turn done the same to others they know. A lot of people will reflexively dismiss the book as disgusting or depressing, but I'll say this: what's more depressing? Reading an honest depiction of the worst and the best in us, or reading something that chooses to ignore the whole question in the first place? Selby will be remembered and loved for a long time after the louder, shallower, more immediate authors of our age are left to rot."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This is a work of sheer genius by anyone's standards. Yes, it's raw, it's shocking even to those of us who thought nothing in modern fiction could shock us but it's one brilliantly sustained song of the brutal, the outcast, the desperate, and at times the cruel who exist inside all of us. I read it over and over again hearing it in my head aloud. I lose it for a few years, then grab it up again. The rhythm of the sentences is perfection. It's for all the time, and the movie -- though a different entity altogether -- was pretty damned fine too. Of course it couldn't be the book. No. It couldn't be quite that dark. Yet it had its own magnificently wrought violence. Selby sings! Here's to him from another writer!"},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Selby's first book was published in the late 1950s. It was subject to an obscenity trial in England although it escaped U.S. censors unscathed. The book was reissued in 1988, coinciding with the release of a movie loosely based upon it. The book's dark vision remains with the passage of time. Not a book for the squeamish, faint-hearted, or for the conventional.The book is a series of loosely related stories of varying length taking place in the tenements of Brooklyn. Many of the incidents center around an odius local bar known as &quot;the Greeks&quot; and its patrons. The longest story, &quot;Strike&quot; is about a long and ugly labor dispute and its effect on Harry, a worker and the strike organizer, on his marriage and on his sense of sexual identity. The story is detailed, sordid, violent, and fascinating. Other stories explore the world of cheap hookers, transvestites, drug users, petty crooks and drunks. The stories are raw told in a crude language of the streets appropriate to their subject matter.The book reminded me of the early work of probably my favorite novelist, the Victorian writer George Gissing, in its concentration of the underlife in our cities. There is little of the express vulgarity and sexual crudity in the Victorian writer, but I think Gissing and Selby would have understood each other nonetheless.This book is a disturbing picture of low life, partly written in the language and mores of its times but transcending that. There is little in the way of hope or love in the book and I think that the author wants to show us the consequences of a lack or hope and love. It is a book that in a materialist age can teach compassion in a language and style that pulls for attention. It is very sad, but the book invites and demands reflection. It shows us what is missing. This is probably a book that will be remembered in the literary history of America."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"The mind simply boggles at the thought that &quot;Last Exit To Brooklyn&quot; should have been published in the 50s. It isn't hard to imagine the storm of controversy it created by its flagrant use of overtly sexual and lewd language. Its undeniable shock value notwithstanding, the novel is still regarded today as a classic for its blistering account of life on the other side of the tracks. The novel is full of unsavoury characters consisting of brutes, louts, pimps and whores. They inhabit a world where the sun never shines. They are all doomed. Georgette, the transvetite, Tralala, the town whore and most fascinatingly Harry, the union leader with a terrible secret even he doesn't know and pays for it when he does. Told through a series of loosely connected vignettes, Hubert Selby Junior's pitiless account of these wretched lives is so brutally honest it hurts to read. His prose is unconventional, utilising a combination of vernacular and &quot;speak write&quot; that has the dizzy immediacy of a screenplay. He switches between the first and third person with hardly the skip of a beat. As a novel, it's a mesmerising and compelling read. I couldn't put it down. Its cinematic possibilities have also been exploited and mined to the fullest some years back in a film version that is remarkably faithful to and captures brilliantly the essence of Selby's novel. The film has deservedly become a cult classic. I am only amazed the director didn't take advantage of the cinematic potential of Selby's last chapter, in which he indulges his voyeuristic licence to its fullest. Robert Altman would have had his camera cutting across the skyline and zooming in turns on the developing chaos within each household in the Brooklyn neighbourhood. &quot;Last Exit To Brooklyn&quot; may still be an uncomfortable read for some today. It's strong stuff, but those with the stomach for it will find it a wonderful read. A true modern classic."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I don't know whether it was deliberate or not, but Hubert Selby, Jr.'s LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN is a window into the hidden side of America's supposed banner years during the Eisenhower administration. Movies and television of this period depicted squeaky clean families in their squeaky clean houses (with the notable exception of I Love Lucy and The Honeymooners whose families lived in apartments). In this Father Knows Best world, no one worried about poverty, minorities, or women's rights, and the only evil was on the other side of the hemisphere in the USSR.And then there's the world of LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN. This is the underclass of citizens that the nation preferred to ignore: pimps, hookers, thieves, junkies, drag queens, wife-beaters, and the thousands upon thousands of working class stiffs at the mercy of their union officials or their bosses, neither of which seem to have their best interests in mind. But this is no 'pity the poor' sort of the book, no HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES (although I do wonder what kind of effect this book had upon its release). These characters, and they are fascinating, are not sentimentalized. Selby portrays most of them as brutal, unsympathetic, and as cruel to their own kind as anyone else. Even the drag queens, whom you would think would be a little understanding of each other, turn vicious at their best friends over the slightest insult. While very uneven in terms of pacing and tone, this is still a ferocious book which deserves reading.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I read this book about 9 years ago, and I can stiil remember the raw power of this novel. It is a brutal account of an assorted cast of characters who are basically human garbage. If they are not misanthropic or misogynistic, then they are poorly guided souls looking for love or meaning in a vile enviorment. This novel reminds me of my old neighborhhood in South Philadelphia, where the only true emotions shown are ones of angry, lust and gluttony. Reading this book should show the reader the evil of men, and what not to do in this world. The language is powerful, the atomosphere is heavy, and the vision is dismal. No other book, with the exception of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; or &quot;City of Night&quot;, shows the strength of great writing style and content.

One day I stumbled on to Last Exit To Brooklyn at a used book store in Venice.I believe it was Kafka who said that a good novel should have the same effect as a blow to the head. Last Exit To Brooklyn had that impact on me. I was never the same after the first page.Said plainly, Selby is a master at exposing his guts. His truth and the truth of the human condition screams and bleeds from every page. Every endless sentence.Last Exit is the finest thing of its kind I have ever read. Maybe the best novel in the last 50 years. It tore my heart out and made me beg God to be a writer.Today, when I look in the mirror, I still see the same two heads looking back but I know for certain that there's at least one other whackjob like me witnessing a similar event. I owe the end of my isolation from the human race and my birth as a writer and my love of books to Hubert Selby Jr.Great stuff. Thanks Cubby."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Last Exit to Brooklyn, Selby's full-length literary debut, is structured more like a collection of stories than a novel. It consists of several episodes that involve completely different characters, have nothing to do with each other, and are structured pretty much the same way - a brief one-page exposition, followed by a buildup of violence all the way to some kind of unspeakably terrifying crescendo whose onset and cessation resolves absolutely no conflict but merely serves to mercilessly cut off the narrative. The last chapter is a series of short, disconnected vignettes that take place in one apartment complex; though they aren't as frightening, the events depicted in them are so uniformly grotesque as to be even more hopeless, even if they're completely banal. For instance, Selby's Naturalistic depiction of the time-honoured pastime of picking one's nose while gossiping is liable to turn one's stomach inside out. You can imagine, based on this example, that Last Exit to Brooklyn is not the most accessible (or even readable) book ever written.Selby's own voice is not present in the writing; for the most part, the author functions only as a dispassionate chronicler of events that, for the most part, are all completely believable. There are no asides, no motivations, no interpretations - what one sees is very much what one gets, and so one is forced to confront what one sees. It isn't very pretty. However relentless his 1979 masterpiece Requiem for a Dream is, it's much more readable than Last Exit to Brooklyn, mainly because it at least features a \\"Dream\\" of some kind. The hapless characters of Last Exit to Brooklyn, however, have no dreams (unless, like Harry Black's, they're about evisceration). Selby himself once characterized this book as an attempt to describe \\"a world without love,\\" and I think that this appraisal is absolutely accurate. Even the \\"love\\" felt by \\"Georgette\\" in the first big episode of the book (following a brief introduction that serves to establish what kind of world this is) is a grotesque parody of same. There is no human interaction in this book that does not feature some sort of casual brutality - even the striking workers, who are supposed to stand together in solidarity, in fact have no solidarity or togetherness whatsoever. This lack of love extends to every single member of society - the union leaders and the corporate officials are equally corrupt, the homosexual men and heterosexual women equally selfish, the police and the thugs equally violent, the black people and the white people equally isolated, and no one seems to ever sleep well. Sex is not only just another instrument of violence, it's almost always the instrument of choice. And while people who do bad things very often do get their comeuppance (in truly horrible ways - the robber/prostitute is raped to death, the closet homosexual beaten beyond recognition, et cetera), there is no sense of justice served since everyone is guilty.Why read it, then? Well, Selby does harbour compassion towards these so-called human beings, but that's more visible in his later books; here, his own choice to recede into the shadows doesn't really show it. Only in the last chapter is it somewhat visible, when he describes a doddering old widow who wonders why no one seems to smile and who is probably a precursor to Sara Goldfarb in Requiem for a Dream. Still, his silence must not be confused with approval, since not only does he not sneer in the book, but his silence seems due to his being overwhelmed by grief. Another reason is that it, assuming the mantle of Naturalism, claims to depict a kind of truth - people can argue about how true it is, but they owe it to themselves to learn it first. But then again, one might quite legitimately ask if there is any value to a truth that is so grimly non-human. Third, one might want to appreciate this book simply based on the writing, and the writing is powerful indeed, but hardly refined enough to place Selby among the stylistic masters. In the end, what it comes down is this: if outright war between reader and writer is what you like, you'll never find a better book; otherwise, you'll have a hard time getting through it once. Also, in either case I would advise you not to eat before reading it."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"With a journalistic clarity which has not been seen in the last 50 years or perhaps ever, Selby fictionally documents the lives and life of various natives in post-war Brooklyn. Like Burgess (&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;) Selby is one of only a few authors who can use the rhythm and energy of pure language, either imagined or otherwise, to ignite the senses and open the mind.Staggering across a desolate landscape, the denizens of each short story are gripped in depravity, violence and any variety of desire/panic that is described in all its painful detail. The impact of which can scarcely be conceived within English words.These gruesome urban yarns are not presented as shock for the sake of itself. At the beginning of each vignette is a quote from the Bible (King James). Perhaps, at the time and within the context of something undeniably pertinent, Selby was re-telling some older stories. To be human in an inhumane world. Behind our excesses, no matter how grotesque or extreme, there is a frailty and tenderness that borderlines the spiritual. These tales caution that the death of spirituality and of dreams in general is a slow and painful one. Never in a flash of self-sacrificial glory but a long and agonizing descent. The personal loss of everything, starting with human dignity. The one hope is that life, in all its imperfect forms and circumstances, crawls, copes, pleads and hangs on through its course. Cold comfort, but a constant throughout.These stories were recommended to me and as I pass on its recommendation to others, its odd that I see the same impact repeated time and again."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"If you're looking for a novel that adheres to the book club check list that so many people rely on these days to gauge the value of a novel--\\"does it have likeable sympathetic characters that I can care about?\\" \\"is there a well constructed plot line?\\" \\"is there strong, plausible character development?\\" etc, --this is probably not the book for you. In Last Exit to Brooklyn Selby purposefully transgressed mainstream writing conventions to create one of the most unique and powerful visions of American life in the history of American literature.Selby comes out of the tradition of the American Naturalist/Realist school of writers like Upton Sinclair and Stephen Crane who wrote about the marginalized and disenfranchised and depicted their world not as it should have been but as it was. The characters here are not pretty nor is the world in which they live, which is marked by mechanical sex, violence, pervasive ignorance, callousness, complete lack of spirituality and a survival of the fittest mentality. This is the ugly flip side of the American Dream and only those who don't read the newspaper could say that this book is outdated and irrelevant.Yes, the narrative is episodic and there is no overarching plot line that ties it all together. A lot like real life, no? There is a sense of chaos, randomness and unpredictability although all the characters are limited by their own narrow consciousness and circumstances as well as the stultifying environment in which they live. Most are emotional cripples who express any sort of tender impulse in the only way they know how-- through crude sex or violence or anger. Accordingly, there is little sentimentality here and the little there is usually marks the character in its grip as doomed.Selby didn't write this book to measure up to conventional standards of what a novel should be in terms of form. In much great art, form follows function and that's the case here. The fact that he doesn't develop an engaging, easy to read plotline or punctuate his sentences is about as meaningful a criticism as saying that the cover of the book isn't a nice colour. Great artists always break rules in their attempts to find the best way to narrate their vision and Selby is a great artist. Read this book on its own terms because it's one of those rare books that created its own standards. Having said that, this book does what great writing always does: shows us some aspect of the human condition in a light that is as harsh and difficult to face as it is illuminating and truthful."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This novel is an extremely powerful novel that portrays Brooklyn the way it really was \\"back in the day\\". The book contains a series of short stories which are vaguely connected and which paint a picture of a crime ridden 1970s Brooklyn which was really nothing more that a hell hole. I gave the book 4 stars because the stories that were good, were powerful and phenominal, while the ones that werent so good were simply boring, but with this book the good clearly outshines the bad. Just as a warning, this book is extremely graphic and violent. The author writes in a very gritty style and parts of it are extremely intense. This book can certainly be upsetting to those who are not desensitized to graphic violence. The story breakdown is as follows:Another Day, Another Dollar (5/5)- Portrays a street gang who causes trouble by robbing military personal staioned in Brooklyn. The story is a powerful view of the level of violence and the lawlessness of Brooklyn at the time. This story is quite violent, and is very gritty and dark, it also shows the level of police corruption and apathy inherent in Brooklyn at the time.The Queen is Dead (5/5) - portrays the life of a transvestite prostitute and his life mingeling with the tough street punks of Brooklyn. It is an interesting almost darkly comical view of how the most macho men in Brooklyn were more attracted to transvestite prostites than they were to their own women. It also protrays the distorted and horrific family life of a homosexual in the 1970s and the the level of disdain and unacceptance at the time. Finally this story gives a glimpse of a perscription drug party an the associated consequences.And baby makes three (1/5) - This story is about a girl who was impregnanted by a motorcycle mechanic. It portrays her alcholoic father and how he tries to force himself to accept her and her decisions. This one was pretty slow and really went nowhere, I truthfully feel it did not belong.Tralala (5/5) - The story of a young Brooklyn prostitute and her life picking up military sailors and than robbing them. The story is about her own rapid downward spiral and her deeply depressing life. This story is very violent and the end is extremely notorious, graphic and intense. This story should be avoided if you are unable to handle horrific, upsetting details.Strike (5/5) - My favorite story in the book. It follows a factory worker who later becomes a union official during a strike. It portrays his corruption, his wild use of union funds, his excessive drinking and partying with his punk and his attraction to the transvestite prostitute from the second story. In this story, he also hates his wife, and has an absolute disdain for her, looking to hurt her physically and emotionally in any way possible. At the end he makes the biggest mistake of his life and he pays in a fitting way. Phenominal ending on this one!Landsend (1/5) - Random intertwined stories from a specific housing project in Brooklyn. This section is pointless, unnecessary and consists of nothing more than random arguing, yelling and general idiocy. It is a day's view of a Brooklyn housing project from the eyes of an insider."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Enjoyed Selby's prose...Tried to pick up another book after finishing &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and couldn't concentrate.

And have had first hand experience of the kind of characters that are found here in this remarkable piece of writing. (One of the characters was based upon my landlord at the time). I was born and raised in Brooklyn and can personally testify that what you will read in these pages are as true to life back then as you'll find in any piece of American literature. Herbert Selby Jr. has given us a savage glimpse into a world possessed by demons in human form.

This is a compelling read if only for a peek at pre-Stonewall gay life in Brooklyn. I, like one of the other reviewers, felt that the drag queens were a little to &quot;out&quot; for the early 1960's, even if it was Brooklyn. I had trouble identifying with any of the characters, they were all such a mess. I don't know a lot about recreational drug use, but in the story &quot;Queens&quot;, the titular queens were popping &quot;bennies&quot; like M&amp;M's...is that possible, or wouldn't you OD on them.I really wasn't sure what to make of Harry in &quot;Strike&quot;, Selby alternated between making you feel sorry for this poor closeted schmo and then made you hate him for various acts of brutality and/or cowardice. The violent ending didn't make sense in the context of Harry's character, it also reflected the homophobic myth that gays are also child molesters. This was probably function of the times in which it was written.Those who have seen the movie, the book is quite different. Not so much a story as a pastiche of different scenes, none of which are really contected.The best of the bunch is the last story which follows a slew of housing project denizens through their various dreary lives. Some of the passages are funny, some are heartbreaking, and all are engrossing. I liked the rhythm of the narrative and the way Selby portrayed each character from his or her own point-of-view."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I heard about this book from a small obit in \\"The New York Times\\". I bought it ASAP from the glowing reviews I had read about it, and at first I thought I had made a mistake, because I could barely stand to read it and it seemed kind of boring. PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU ARE READING THIS BOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME, SKIP DIRECTLY TO \\"STRIKE\\" AND START READING FROM THERE. Otherwise you might put the book down out of sheer frustration and confusion and miss out on an amazing literary experience.My first impression was wrong -- the book is far from boring. It is actually one of the best books ever written. However, I think Selby was just getting warmed up until he wrote \\"Strike\\", which will slam into the middle of your head like a fast-moving train. The first few stories didn't do much for me, which is why I suggest skipping them and reading them AFTER you have read \\"Strike\\".Just think of the first few stories as being the same as the first few minutes of David Lean's \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" when you first saw it. You can't really appreciate these first few stories until after the fact, much like you can't really enjoy the first few minutes of \\"Lawrence\\" until after you've seen the whole movie.This is not an expensive book, and you'll do nothing but gain from buying it. Read it -- you'll be a better person for it! You honestly won't believe how well this guy could write!"},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"No, I'm not being sarcastic, the prose here might be hard to penetrate at first, but it's very deep and moving. I'll admit, I had a hella hard time getting through this book at first, I actually put it down after reading the first story! Then I read up some on Mr Selby, and things became more clear to me.Yes, there really isn't any punctuation, or any clues who's speaking at the moment, but that's part of the point. A lot of these stories are totally self contained, coming from the point of view of the character. And though the changes the characters go though might not be explicitly stated, you can tell their changes by the way the rhythm of their speech patterns changes.All in all, it might take two readings before you get on to these things, but once you do, there's no going back. This is one helluva book, and got me into Selby's work, and I'm very thankful for that. He has a way to get under your skin, to know what YOU are thinking and feeling.And as many others have already pointed out, these are not the usual types of people most would like to be around. In fact, I'm sure a good many of us would try to avoid them at all costs. But the way Selby portrays them here, you genuinely feel compassion and love for them.This book certainly isn't for everybody, though not really sexually explicit or particularly violent, there are some scenes that could upset many more weak stomached readers, and the dialog is VERY profane. But it never seem out of place, or put in for the sake of shock value. You can imagine these characters speaking and acting this way.The last story is the most brilliant to me.

I picked up this book being an enormous fan (like some other reviewers here) of Darren Aronofsky's movie version of Selby's Requiem for a Dream (which is, by the way, the best title of a novel. Ever.).Normally I can't get into prose written this way; it's very dense because its cadences are not like anything else out there. But, like an album that grows on you to become one of your favorites, the novel takes off into a swirl of rage that explodes off the page, which, even in the nicer parts, is seething with the darkest parts of the human heart. If you ever wanted to see the monster you could become in worse circumstances, read this book. It's well worth the time it takes to penetrate the prose and get down to its bones. Selby doesn't use proper punctuation, apostrophes, or anything but raw, conversational language that gets you right inside the characters' heads and doesn't let you out. And that's its genius: not letting you out. I've finished the book, and I'm still not out."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"If you like requiem for a dream the movie or the novel this book should be right up your alley. Simillar to Ellis' nove &quot;The Informers&quot; this novel is told through the eyes of several differant narratives and characters.

Like &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; once the characters seem like they are at their highest they are quickly brought back to reality, realities that couldnt be any more devestating. The individual stories work well as a whole novel where the story isnt the driving factor, its the observation of the big city and the lives lived their. Totally disturbing and as dark as any writer has ever wanted to get; Selby's first novel &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; is a wonderful piece of work and lays the ground work that was later put in full focus with works such as &quot;The Demon&quot;Beautifully tragic and dark this novel will aim to please. Selby IS A GENIUS, take a look inside."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"No two ways about it, Selby is one of the best writers in the English language, forget what pussy top100 lists say. Selby's tales will pierce your soul and make it bleed, that is the kind of power his language has. Selby literally creates this euphoria through his language that inserts the reader into the character's mind and soul. Hence, we pity the depraved, the drug addled, the whores who populate this work. Even Ken Starr would let these characters off the hook, that's how humane and brilliant Selby's depiction is of these otherwise unsympathetic characters."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"That was my attempt at writing like Hubert Selby, Jr. I don't understand how anyone can write like that. There are NO periods. There are NO commas. There are NO quotation marks. My English teacher Mr. McKee once told me that the reader has to be given clear, accurate instructions about the plot and whatever. The author has to metaphorically hold the reader's hand throughout the whole story. I feel that Mr. Selby kidnapped me in his car and dropped me off in the middle of a rather large, rather confusing, city. I had to reread the first story thing in order to really grasp what the hell was going on and to understand this absolutely confusing writing style. Maybe every single English teacher should force his or her class to read this book so that kids might start appreciating punctuation. I know I love it. I love punctuation more than I love my (insert important thing here).And as far as being the most disturbing thing ever: No, it simply wasn't. Homosexuals and transvestites really don't scare the living hell out of me. The whole book is about transvestites! EVERYONE IS A SHEMALE! That's probably the best part about the book. The shemales. But there were FAR TOO MANY of them to make it special. This book simply didn't shock, disturb or frighten me. And personally, I don't care about Harry's job at the factory. Who cares about his stupid strike? I know I don't. If you want to read a disturbing book, read American Psycho. It beats the pants off of this. It's funnier, easier to read, more disturbing, and a HELL of a lot more interesting.I did like the first story about the sailor and the one about that girl who had so much sex it killed her. I did feel sympathy towards her... just a little, though. And I thought it was funny. That's why it received two stars.That is all."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read.Half extreme right wing ideology and half hackneyed pornography, this is one real piece of garbage.Now at first I thought the point of the book was to show how bad these people's lives really were. But if you read it through you'll see that it's anti-union, anti-semitic, anti-gay, and anti any number of other things that might offend the reader.For christ sake there's a story about a gay union activist who ends up becoming a pedophile because he is dumped by his lover...There's an Anti-Semetic story that makes fun of a poor Jewish widow.There's a story about a girl getting gangraped to death.There's a story about some young hooligans (I think poor Greek kids, in any case I am pretty sure they were immigrant) killing a sailor or beating him half to death (can't remember). And these hooligans are basically the heroes of the whole book.Oh yeah then there's another story where these hooligans go and take drugs with some really stereotyped gay people, and they rape one of the \\"Queens\\" under the influence of the drugs.Read it and you will realise that it is a shameless piece of propaganda. You won't find a book that pushes ideology any stronger than this. There were a lot of really horrendous books written in the soviet union, praising the communist spirit and so on. This book is exactly the same except it's right wing propaganda.This is often the case with books or movies in the United States, just because a work deals with \\"hell\\" people think it's underground or anti-establishment or alternative.The people in this story aren't real people. There are no poor working class americans here. All we see is one prejudiced cliche after another."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Do not read this book because you liked Requiem for a Dream the movie. It is totally dissimilar. For that matter, don't read this book if you like a novel to have a plot. Last Exit to Brooklyn is made up of several unrelated stories that constantly switch back and forth throughout the book. The result is that you find yourself no more involved on the last few pages than you were on the first few. The stories go nowhere and could just as easily been arranged in a different order. Specifically, the stories are comprised of transexual and homosexual activities, drug use, spousal abuse, and child abuse. None of the characters are likeable. If you're looking for something contemporary, try anything by Chuck Palahniuk instead."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This was the worst thing I have ever had the displeasure of slogging through. Not since high school have I ever labored to finish a book like I did with this one. I don't understand the appeal of this style of writing and the seemingly pointLESS &quot;stories&quot; in this book. By the end there are characters just yelling at one another in ALL CAPS for pages and pages. I don't get this book at all. Maybe it's just one of those supposedly *cool* things, like William Burroughs, that I don't get at all. Whatever the case, I don't understand at all why this book is so revered as some sort of 20th century classic.This has put me off Hubert Selby, Jr.. This is the first book of his I ever read and it seems highly unlikely I would read one of his books again."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"The story seems decent but I found this book to be absolutely unreadable. The authors &#34;style&#34; is to never use quotation marks. This makes for huge confusing paragraphs where you're never sure if a character is talking thinking or narrating. I read the first chapter and put it down and will probably never finish it."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I can only imagine how shocking this book looked when it was first written. It still appears to be shocking to me now, 50-some years after its creation. Yet, when you take away all the filth, gang rapes and knife fights descriptions, there's little left. That's not to say that there's no talent on display here, its just that its buried under descriptions of filth and degradation. While its not a complete throwaway/garbage, its not a claimed masterpiece either, at least in my opinion.Still, a lot can forgiven when you know that this was his debut novel. One can only hope that his subsequent works were more focused than \\"Last Exit\\"."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Selby is a talented fiction writer. Even in the lackluster stuff, that talent shines through. Unfortunately, the lackluster stuff is the majority of the book, viz., \\"The Strike\\", \\"The Queen is Dead\\", \\"Another Day, Another Dollar\\", and \\"And Baby Makes Three.\\" There is one good story--actually a series of interweaving character vignettes--called \\"Landsend\\", and one story that I'll probably never forget: \\"Tralala.\\" The latter is remarkable: Selby creates a completely unsympathetic character, who suffers the apotheosis of human degradation...and becomes sympathetic in a transcendent way. There is no volte-face, there is no redemption, but there is the underlying humanity--good, bad, evil, whatever--that is undeserving of such a fate.I recommend the book on the basis of this one story--only about twenty pages. Skip the rest and you won't be missing much--a lot of faggotry and proletarian filler."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"started reading it, was not what i expected, could not get into it, had to stop reading because got very boring"},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Few books have aroused so much strong feeling as Last Exit to Brooklyn, with reactions ranging from the highest admiration, through horror, pity and disgust, to the blind fury of those who are opposed to the exposure of social evil. Its merits, challenged first by private and then by public prosecution, have been tested in the courts. Those who have spoken for it, both as an original work of modern fiction and as a true documentary account of life in a section of Brooklyn, leave us without a doubt that it is one of the most important books of the post-war period.The characters who inhabit the book are unforgettable: Harry, the strike leader, who during his weeks of power discovers something of his true nature; Tralala, who rejects the only love she is offered and sinks swiftly to the lowest level of prostitution; Georgette, the 'hip queer' with pathetic aspirations to culture; Abraham, the 'cool ass' black stud, with his girls, his 'bigass' Cadillac, and his undernourished family; the debris of American civilisation, for whom the author ultimately makes us feel a profound compassion.Last Exit to Brooklyn was found obscene at the Old Bailey in November 1967, a decision which was reversed by a historic Appeal Court judgement in July 1968. Now this 'honest and terrible book', as Anthony Burgess descrbes it in his Introduction to this new edition, can take its rightful place as one of the major books of our time.A friend of mine gave me this book to read, you never really borrow books unless the lender threatens you that your life depends upon its return. I believe Mr. Selby first published this book in 1964 so its a little dated but for the time it was shere madness which even today you have to admire how much profanity can be fit into so few sentences. I enjoyed the book, it kinda makes ya feel dirty but, ya can always take a bath if ya want, unlike many of the characters.Read the book it stands the test of time, Mr. Selby does not understand the concept of built in obsolescence. It reminds me of the time when I lived in Lizton Indiana and my brother Charles Chadwick and our buddy big John, Roscoe and Joe, all gathered to watch Charles pogo stick over the creek behind our house.We had taken some scaffolding left over from our new home construction and laid it across the creek, it was about twelve inches wide and reinforced with 2 x 4's on each edge. 5/8\\" plywood and 2x 4 's...Charles as I recall had the most confused look on his face when he made it about two hops across the bridge and then fell about five feet into a gravel creek bed, a great look, I think he said \\"Wha happen\\"? He laid in the gravel, pogo stick still in position and at that moment I think he realized that not everything works out as planned.He lost interest in this stunt real fast, unlike you will in Huberts great Novel.About this time we were reaching an age when my folks felt we were old enough to be left alone for short periods of time while they went to Air-Way and such, these opportunities we seized carpe diem style! Empty the two car garage and stage indoor short track races on our dirt bikes, sure we would leave tire tracks on the concrete, sure the nobby tire marks on the walls were tell tale signs of mischief but my folks where young and inexperienced and did not suspect that we would race motorcycles in a two car garage.We would put the garage back together and other than the lingering two stroke haze, and the above mentioned clues, none was the wiser. Best I can remember I always won these races because I was the superior rider. How we managed not to hit the water heater and tear it from the wall proves there is a divine being watching over us. Which also reminds me of how my da showed me the hot water release valve on the water heater for what reason I dont know, but I retained this knowledge. Unfortunately for Elmo and Myrtle our beagles I had just enough knowledge to cause them great pain. You see Elmo was a walk up dog who adopted us as was myrtle, the two quickly became lovers and engaged in Hubert Selby style liaisons as often as myrtle was in heat.They often became stuck and we all know the best way to separate two beast who are stuck is to throw cold or is it hot water on them? At the time I thought it was hot so one evening while my folks were at Air-Way our two beagles became stuck and were in obvious pain, one faced north the other south and like a compass in a tempest they changed directions in a passionate union. I went to the water heater and filled up a glass with water directly from the unit just like me da showed me and threw it on the two lovers, and contrary to my expectations the two just yelped like scalded wild animals. Eventually they separated on their own.They were fine no burns and such but shortly there after Mrytle took up with the neighbors German Shepherd and Elmo hit the road, never to be seen again. Kinda like a Hubert Selby character. I miss my dogs and I miss dominating the two door garage indoor short track circuit. Enough for now, read the book its dirty."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I have read many books, some the best or most thought provoking ever to be put to paper. Others were found to be the worst waste of tree bark that one could imagine. But in all the books I have read, never have I questioned ones reason for being. I am a firm believer of the need of books that awake ones mind to the less then perfect American picture of life. I had never read or heard of Mr. Selby before this book. His constant pounding on the Homosexual theme I found tiresome. I thought he had something in his story called, \\"Strike\\", but found it also dragged down into the mire of dogma.Even in the darkest of stories taken from life there is some hope. Selby writes one of the most brutal, hateful novels I have ever read. I may not agree with a homosexual lifestyle, but I have found them to be people who live, their lives in the dignity of their choice.If this book was meant to do anything but degrade them I guess I missed it."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I emphatically believe in the reading and writing of honest truth. As a reader, I much prefer the harsh, brutal and basic version of a story rather than it's rose-colored fantasy. 'Last Exit' Certainly belongs in that category; But, there is a fine line between the telling of the truth and the exploitation of it, and in his first novel, Selby crosses that line.The book is a collection of short stories about a variety of people coexisting in the ghettos of Brooklyn post WWII. Homosexuals, Drug users, drag queens, a gang of thugs that steal, beat, rape and murder, child molesting union officers, Nazi-like tenants, baby killers, rednecks and white trash; this book has it all. I liked the fact that it was realistic and gave you a perspective from very different parts of this sub-culture. The author did an excellent job of conveying the energy and anger that everyone who lived in these projects must have felt on a daily basis. I think that JR. Selby shows the potential for becoming an excellent writer on society as it exists, but I don&#65533;t think he has perfected the craft in his first novel. Controversial subjects and explicit details were rehashed and drawn out simply for shock value, which is where this novel falls short. &#65533;Last Exit&#65533; was so constantly sadistic that it became a little boring, I felt like he was trying to hard to disgust his readers and show people that he had the guts to write this way, and not enough time perfecting his talent as a writer. Although I wouldn&#65533;t put this on my list of favorites, I still look forward to reading other works by Selby."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This is the only book of the last fifty or so I have read that I just wanted to give up on. It was a distorted didactical load of the usual religious dogma. Yes, after 3 chapters I climbed out of my stupor to realize that each chapter (7 in all, of course) was unrelated other than that each was a relation of a christian sin to a world we are more familiar with. After that, I was able to entertain myself by seeing how quickly I could guess which sin was next as I started each chapter. I know what this book is &quot;supposed&quot; to represent, however, it is not worth reading unless you enjoy repetition and weak imaginations. My apologies for all the bitterness."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Clearly this book was written to shock and disgust the reader. It largely succeeeds.The overriding weakness of the book is that all the characters basically act, sound and view life in the same way. After reading a couple dozen pages I noiticed that you could simply insert the name of one male charater into the place of another and not really notice any difference.All the men are ignorant, physically abusive and shiftless drunks (of somewhat varying degrees). (...)I wonder if this work would have been more interesting if Selby took one of the stories in LEB (...say...\\"Strike\\"...) and provided more depth about the character's history and motivations.This work suffesrs from the same fatal flaw as Richard Wright's \\"Native Son\\" (although a much different work): the main character(s) is (are) simply unlikeable and repellant; the reader has no reason to care what happens to them."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"Having grown up on the very streets of Brooklyn (albeit a decade and a half later) where Mr. Selby's storys take place, I am puzzled as to why drag queens populate every chapter of this book. You would think from this book that every adult male in Brooklyn wants to sleep with drag queens. Mr Selby took me in with his believabilty in each chapter only to lose me with his harping on gay lust. As I said, I grew up on the streets of Brooklyn in the late 60's and early 70's and with the exception of characters like Georgette and Alberta and Goldie all of the characters are REAL to me. He ruined a perfectly good book with his sexual obesessions. I wish he had written more about a greater cross-section of characters. This could have been a GREAT book, and alas, is only mildly interesting."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"LikeThe Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation by Dante Alighieri, Robert Pinsky (Translator), Hubert Selby Jr, in this seminal classic, explores the various hellish lives in post-WWII Brooklyn. While admittedly there are occasional flaws in characterization typical of a writer's first book, the positives of this novel far outweigh the negatives. First, it is a book that--with no shortage of genius--captures the post-war angst felt by a generation of young men for whom the entire world dramatically shifted in the aftermath of a massive war that took so many lives and upended American society--in particular gender roles in the home and the workplace. That being said, where this book also excels is in its literary capacity as a book of judgement. Like Dante's Inferno, this book is, at its core, NOT advocating the acts that it depicts. Instead (and this can be confirmed by reading the Bible scriptures that serve as epigraphs to each of the book's chapters and thematically sets the stage for what follows), this book condemns the same seven deadly sins that Dante did in his masterpiece. Selby simply updated the same literary conceit, and then came out swinging. Inevitably, some readers will get clipped on the chin along the way, but you still should not flinch. See the world through Selby's eyes, and you see the world that many of us choose to ignore.My second point is that Selby's writing style--a purposely stylized form of sparse punctuation/capitalization and occasional sprawling run-on sentences--was also groundbreaking in many ways and had a great effect on many writers since then. Best examples (and good reads, if you like Selby) would include Irvine Welsh'sTrainspotting, Don Ray Pollock'sKnockemstiff, Harry Crews'sCelebration, Aaron Michael Morales'sDrowning Tucson, Bret Easton Ellis'sAmerican Psycho, or even Chuck Palahnuik'sFight Club: A Novel. All are brilliant and engaging masculine reads. And as you read these men, you realize that without Selby, there's a good chance these writers wouldn't exist. Or, if they did, they'd still be trying to make headway in a genre that Hubert Selby Jr broke wide open. He was a true gift to American literature."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"First published in Great Britain in 1966 this a series of short stories rather than a novel set in a New York neighbourhood.The subjects covered in these stories are among other things, gang rape, domestic violence and prostitution - all real world stuff. We have gangsters, transvestites, alcoholics and worst of all a union shop steward.Anthony Burgess in the Introduction calls this book \\" ..honest and terrible.\\"...It is brilliantly written, absolutely beautifully written but as stated most of the characters are quite repulsive. Words like gritty and realistic don't quite do enough to describe how raw this is in places. It sucks you in (no puns) and certainly gets emotional involvement, a sign that the author has achieved what he set out to do.The book was the subject of an obscenity trial through 1967 to 1968 in the UK. In the edition I have the Foreword by the publishers post the Court case is a great read in itself. Its incredible how certain members of our society think they can make decisions for the rest of us pretending that its for our own good, when in fact its just a controlling mechanism - i.e. censorship .The Prosecution attempted to prove that the book was obscene . The definition of obscene in this case being if it had a tendency to deprave and corrupt those into whose hands it was likely to fall. He defined to deprave - as to make people do wrong acts.Now, this a very good book but after reading it, I have yet to join a gang, a union or have a same sex liaison. But then these things may take time, I suppose...One prosecution witness , Sir Basil Blackwell , actually stated that the book had depraved him, but it was never established whether it was really the book or the fact that he may have attended a Public School.The case was eventually won for the publisher by John Mortimer QC. Who later got the magazine OZ or its publishers acquitted after they were went to prison for obscenity as well. Evidently this is getting made into a movie Hippie Hippie Shake .But that is another issue, this is about Last Exit to Brooklyn, it is a great book, just don't expect to feel warm and cuddly after finishing it."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"it is greatly unfortunate that those who gave this book a 1 are merely judging it in this fashion because they have an inability to relate. One such person said \\"none of the characters are likable\\", Oh, im sorry i didnt know the appeal to reading a novel was to find it relevant and or the characters likable. It is this sort of judgmental banter that tends to convince others to not partake in certain experiences. Hopefully those wanting to read this book will not subject their motivations to buy it to be swayed by this pointless propaganda. These stories are blunt, they are real, and they are written in a fashion that doesnt displace its agenda, an agenda to explore the darkest of the dark. It does have some violent issues, and i think they many of those giving this book a low mark find it offensive because it holds some relevance to their own lives. It will upset... but in some ways every novel tends to upset us in one way or another.. just hold this book for what it is... dont try to relate to it... and dont read it if you dont want to..."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"This thing is relentless. You think you can't possibly empathize with these people. You can't possibly feel for them. These aren't your 'Titanic' poor; people who don't have any money, but gosh, they truly know how to live life. These aren't those cliche 1-dimensional cut-outs that move like props along an obvious arc. These people are the gutter.And you start reading and from the beginning you think these people are disgusting and depraved and unredeemable. But as you read on, Selby reveals their humanity and vulnerability. Somehow you start to relate and see how their lives - though so entirely disconnected and different from yours - are driven by the same needs and forces that yours is. To look down upon these people is to trivialize life itself.Overall, this is a raw, yet very beautiful, glimpse of life. Selby's gift is compassion.

Urban decay and the rough times of just getting by, are incredibly documented in this fantastic novel. It will make you laugh and cry at the same time. I know that sounds cliche but it's more true with this book than most others.Every story chronicled resonates with a gritty street authenticity that I've yet to see duplicated in any other novel; except for perhaps Richard Price's, Clockers.The Modern Library recently came out with their opinion of the top 100 novels of the last century, the crime of the century was for them to exclude LETB. It's surely the most under rated book I've yet to come across.

Their lives are drowned in booze, bennies, and debaucherie. As worlds collide, things spiral out of control. Emotions run high. Paranoia. Violence. Degradation.

Interesting case study in human nature."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"I picked up Selby on the recommendation of Henry Rollins. It was a wise move on my part!

Written and set in the 1950s, this book is still shocking in the 1990s. However, Last Exit has a great deal more to offer than mere shock value. Selby's stories are vivid, sometimes touching, and his characters, though they often behave disgracefully, are real people. Additionally, his writing style, which uses as little punctuation as possible, is well suited the frenetic pace of the novel. Forget all those nauseatingly boring literary atrocities you were forced to read in high school. Last Exit to Brooklyn is a true American classic."},{"Title":"LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN","review":"this is an icredible book that tells in a no holds barred fashion the life are various sordid low lifes living in the brooklyn waterfront.

Disneyland is constantly changing, so some of the things in this book may be different from when I visitied. I had to ask a cast member in Indiana Jones to show me Eyeore. Many of the Hidden Mickeys, the tributes to people or things past, are really hidden--otehrs are hidden in plain sight.

However, these 101 things you never knew were 101 things even my child knew. Aside from the \\"101 things\\" listed are already in many Disney books, the book is poorly written. It reminds me of high school where when assigned an essay that had to 101 pages, every effort was used to double space, use the widest ruled paper available and write r e a l l y w i d e so you'd fill your assignment.

In this book they have presented 31 articles of academic journal quality in a manner that is accessbile to students with little or no IPE knowledge. Having some fundamental knowledge of micro-economics, specifically comparative advantage (the underlying rationale as to why globalization is occuring and what it really is), can be helpful in understanding some of the subject matter. The book is divided into seven main sections: 1)Contending Perspectives on IPE, 2) Historical Perspectives, 3)Production, 4) Money and Finance, 5) Trade, 6) Economies in Development and Transition, and 7) Current Problems in IPE. As is evident from the sections in the book, this is a fairly thorough look at IPE, what it was, is, as well as what it could be in the future. Would be five stars but some of the articles were quite redundant (as is oft the case with books dealing with economic subject matter)."},{"Title":"International Political Economy","review":"A dense but fascinating series of essays covering a multitude of the most important issues of international political economy.

Packed with classic articles from a variety of well regarded political scientists and fantastically edited with useful divisions made by topic and ideology, this reader is essential for any course at the university level in IPE. I would even recommend that international economics classes take a look at adding this text, as the political economy of free trade, the WTO, Transnational Corporations, etc. is discussed at length."},{"Title":"International Political Economy","review":"This is the best and most widely respected collection of essays in international political economy (IPE).

What's not in question is that things really WERE this way in 1953 when the book was published - what is in question is whether the average reader understood what Michener was trying to do in pointing it out. Given that racism (and chauvinism)are still problems in American society today, 45 years later, I'd say they didn't."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"I picked up this book at a garage sale a few weeks ago because the title sparked my interest (one of my friends just left to teach English in Japan). I honestly didn't have any opinion of the book at first, although I have heard praise for Michener's novels. When reading this book, I was surprised that most of the American characters seemed to be racist. But my mother commented that this was what the world thought of Japan after the war.I liked how the author portrayed Major Gruver. At first, he was showed ignorance towards anything and anyone Japanese, but after he met Hana-Ogi, his views changed. And it was particularly nice that he realized that what was important in a person was what was on the inside (e.g. Katsumi).I thought this book was great :) but the ending was so sad.(f.y.i.

It tells the story of Major Lloyd Gruver, who falls in love with the beautiful Takarazuka girl, Hana-ogi. Through his relationship with her, he begins to see past the darkened skin and slanted eyes of the Japanese into their hearts. The ending was very sad. I reccomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"I purchased this for my sister who was looking for it. She and her husband lived in Japan when he was in the military. I thought I was ordering a hard back copy. Anyway she was glad to have it."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"This is a somewhat interesting story, though highly anachronistic in its perspective, indicative of the social mores of the time in which it was written. It is almost hard to believe that it was just about sixty years ago that it was first published, as so much in the world has changed.The story revolves around Major Lloyd Gruver, the son of a general, and an ace pilot in the Korean War. Now, stationed in Japan, where it is expected that he will marry Ellen, an All-American girl next door and his commanding General's daughter, he has some second thoughts about the way his future is shaping up. Then, before he knows it, he finds himself embroiled in an affair with Hana-ogi, a beautiful Japanese woman, and his whole world changes.The story provides an intriguing look at how the Japanese were viewed post World War II by some Americans, and the views held are not pretty in light of the world in which we live in today. In fact, parts of the book are really an indictment of those views and certainly give new meaning to the phrase, \\"The Ugly American\\". It definitely gave me pause.Still, though not his best work, hampered as it is by some ridiculous dialogue, the author manages to create a love story that is somewhat engaging and that manages to bloom despite the obstacles placed before it. There is also a sub-plot involving a second love story between another enlisted man and a Japanese woman. Does either love story have a happy ending? In fact, is it really even a love story? There are some pretty sexist views underlying that supposition in the book. Read the book and decide for yourself. Fans of the author will get a modicum of enjoyment from reading this dated book, if only for a chance to ascertain how far the author has come in terms of skill, since this book, one of his earlier works, was first published."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"For Michener fans who depend on pre-history facts, this will disappoint, as it is brief in historic description. However, the story reveals the cultural mindset of the Army, Americans, and Asians during, and shortly after WWII, in Japan. It is a love story, but with the twists that come with an American/Asian mix during that era. It is worth what will be a short read, but is unlike Michener's later more in depth work. I bought it in paperback, and was glad I did not invest more. The movie with Marlon Brando and Red Buttons is better, if you can find it."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"This is more of a love story than anything else. We see a story about the type of racism that existed during that time (World War II). It is ironic that Michener tells the other side of the story, letting you know that the Japanese were also scared of losing their identity and heritage (so they acted in some racist ways). The Americans; I guess they were afraid of anybody who wasn't white. But in the end we find how tragic it can be when people are not tolerant."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"I honestly thought this book is one of the best books I have ever read, at least for a school assignment. Truthfully, it is probably in the top ten of my favorite books now. I never thought a book that even remotely had to do with war would interest me. Apparently I was wrong since Sayonara has affected me in the way that I am interested in reading more books about topics like this love story and also more books by James Michener since I have enjoyed his style of writing. It flows well and is easy to read and I enjoy books written with that style."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"Sayonara is constructed around the juxtaposition of stereotypes and values of the time (50 years ago). Value conflicts between military life, civilian life, Americans, and Japanese, and the breaking out of emotions across these boundaries made compelling reading for me. Private fears, private loves, and the rule of mightier forces beyond single systems of human communities pulled one towards a perhaps slightly transparent conclusion. Despite this inevitability I devoured the book and quite frankly I could not put the book down until reached the final page. The insights into the Japanese way are revealing, but not in the masterly way in such masterpieces as John David Morley's &quot;Pictures From The Water Trade&quot;. But after reading Sayonara, as I put the book down,I could not help but admire and respect Michener's talent."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"While I have not read the book (looking forward to it) I have the movie (first VHS and now DVD) and have seen it many times. So I rated the book at 5 stars based on the movie.Just wanted to add some comments from someone who has spent 2 years in Korea and 16 plus years in Japan serving in the military and with the US government -- and has a wonderful Japanese wife.- As recently as the 80's, commanders were encouraged to discourage marriage to foreign nationals. I know this first hand -- from both sides of the situation.- It is interesting to note that In the days of occupational Japan up through sometime in the late 60's I believe, it was forbidden to even consort with the Japanese. A friend of mine, whom passed away two years ago, required congressional approval to get married. I actually saw the document. It was a regular bill/law (forgot the topic) with a rider that had the names of personnel authorized to marry a Japanese foreign national. His name was there along with 20 or so other names. Pretty cool document if I might say so. Wish that I had a copy. I asked him one time how he just got married without dating. He just grinned. It seemed that as an engineer his was allowed to have lunches with local engineering folks to conduct business meetings. She was his preferred translator for the meetings. Never mind that there was only three of them, and it was a picnic style meeting! He was lucky that his commander overlooked this issue.- As for the dual suicide in the movie, I have another very close friend whom knows of occurrences of this happening. He actually had to handle the bodies and next of kin notification.- As for the cutting of the eyes. I saw this first hand in Korea. Girls would attempt to make themselves more appealing to Americans by doing this. There were legitimate places that did this, and there were your roadside sleazy operations as well. This was so sad to see. None of my American friends wanted their GF or wives to do this. But the ladies nonetheless thought that it would make them more accepable and beautiful.- The transformation into understanding this culture is not based on time, but rather the pealing of the onion. It happens to different folks at different rates. It is possible to live in Japan for a long time, but never peal the onion. After you peal a few layers, it becomes almost impossible to explain to a newbie what you know.I am so glad that this movie was made. It has provided a wonderful reference to what happened from occupational Japan through the early 80's (and some would say still happening today to a lesser extent) concerning attitudes and racial views."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"I had many problems with Michener's love story, and biggest one is that everything that the racists in the novel said about the protagonist Lloyd Gruver is true.Think about it. Isn't Gruver and Hana-ogi's relationship incredibly shallow considering they couldn't communicate (he spoke no Japanese, she no English). Is Hana-ogi's character a complete blank, a mere cipher? She truly has no personality to speak of (unlike Gruver's American girlfriend Eileen)!How then did Lloyd \\"fall in love?\\" He didn't. He fell in lust with Hana-ogi, and ran away from American women precisely because they were headstrong, just like what the racists in the novel said. The characters of Joe Kelly and Katsumi are even worse: a dumb American who marries an even dumber Japanese woman (consider her eye operation). This is supposed to be the \\"ideal\\" relationship in Lloyd's mind? He gives the example how after Katsumi would scrub Joe's back after a hard day's work, and how an American woman would never do that, and because of this, Lloyd thinks Japanese women are better. This is a ridiculous idea which can only be made by an extremely insecure man. Essentially, what Lloyd Gruver wants is an exotic and brainless woman who'll worship him and scrub his back; the last thing he wants a woman who challenges him intellectually (like Eileen does). Likewise, the racists in the novel say Joe Kelly only married Katsumi because he couldn't find a woman back in America, and you can't help but nod your head, especially considering how Kelly and Katsumi wound up.In the end, Sayonara is a Western man's fantasy of an exotic interracial relationship and nothing more. A white American would go to a foreign land and somehow, without speaking the language or shelling out the dough (which is how most Western men get foreign women in the real world), the most beautiful woman in that land would swoon and worship him. Meanwhile, the white man would be criticized by racists for involving himself with a non-white woman, and he would defend his and the woman's honor, thereby making himself a martyr and receiving all the warm and cuddly feelings that go along with that title. But what about the relationship itself? And how are the Japanese characters treated? They aren't, and they need not be since it's unimportant who Hana-ogi or Katsumi are since WHAT they are (non-white, the exotic other) is a LOT more important than WHO they are (their personalities) in the novel's plot.In the end, Michener's Sayonara is a very shallow book about Japan and a even shallower relationship."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"When reading this book, I was surprised that most of the American characters seemed to be racist.

He was rummaging through my desk at a newspaper that I once worked. I thought he was some old snoop and treated him as such until advised this was THE AUTHOR. So I told him that I thought Sayonara was by far his best book - - and he looked at me like I had reached in his chest cavity and was holding his heart.

After the read I actually think I feel in love with my Japanese wife all over again."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"Lloyd Gruver, a jet pilot ace in Korea, is sent back to Japan on a new assignment. The son of a General, his fiancee Eileen is the daughter of General Webster. There is a problem with Airman Kelly, who wants to marry a Japanese girl even though she would not be allowed to come to America. General Webster's wife disapproves of American soldiers accompanying Japanese girls; and the General's wife commands the General. Eileen wants a regular marriage, not spending years of loneliness as a stateside Officer's wife.At Airman Kelly's wedding, Major Gruver learns the secret of Japanese women: they make their men feel important. Sometimes a Congressman will get a special bill passed to allow an American to bring his Japanese wife stateside. But American officialdom did everything to prevent these marriages. The story continues with Major Gruver learning more about Japanese culture - and a Japanese girl! [Little hints point to an oncoming tragedy.] Michener paints word-pictures of Japan that match his descriptions of islands in the South Pacific. In the end tradition and duty win out over love, for both Lloyd and Hana-ogi. The reader gets a brief glimpse into Japanese culture. This is one of Michener's earlier works, and not as good as his later books. But it explains the importance for Congress to control the budget.What is the significance of the suicides? Gun Prohibitionists bray &quot;America has the highest murder rate (qualifications)&quot;. Yet the rate of Violent Death in America is lower than Japan and other Western Industrialized Nations. The oppression and lack of freedom in those countries creates higher suicide rates, even with &quot;socialized medicine&quot;. Beware of half truths!"},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"I love Michener's work, and have read most of his material, but this one has escaped me for years, as I tend to pick up his books at garage sales and library sales whenever I find them. While this book was written nearly 50 years ago, it is still a good read today. Yes, the racism shown in the book by nearly all the american characters is very prominant, but that's the way it was. I was born in 1957, and I've seen American society change, from the 60's of my earliest memories, to today. I certainly would not say that racism is gone, but I think few people could read Sayonara today and not be offended by the views of the American characters..and the rules &amp; regulations of the military. If it happened today, somebody would definately be getting sued. After reading Shogun (several times, a great book ) and this one, I'm seriously considering heading to Japan for a wife. When I was younger I always wanted a happy ending, but with the years I realize life just isn't so. The double suicide (sepuku) was not only predictable, but accurate and, in my more aged &amp; cynical eyes, &quot;right&quot;. Michener can touch you with stories that seem so real you can't believe they're fiction. This was a good one. I highly reccommend it. I won't forget Joe Kelly, his little round-faced bride, or Hana-Ogi soon."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"This is not my Japan - I was stationed there a generation later. Michener's prose describes Japan as it was during the Korean war. I still remember the vendors selling roasted chestnuts or skewers of yakitori beside the street. Today we have, God forbid, MacDonalds and Starbucks on the streets of Hiroshima.These are not my girls - most of the Japanese women I met, outside of the bar scene, were students in English classes. Their reasons for speaking with gaijin (foreigners) were varied. Some wanted to learn English for work. Some expected to travel. One had a sister who was married to an American. The girl who is now my wife of 25 years was a rebel who just did not want to conform to the strictures of Japanese society. I have to admit, I was first attracted because she was the cutest girl I had ever seen. She's still is, for me. Were there communication problems? Yes, at first. Now, probably no different from any other couple. Could Gruver's attraction to Hana Ogi have been purely physical? Maybe. Probably not.Sayonara isn't history - but the \\"tea ceremony\\" I saw in Kyoto last week wasn't real either.Enjoy this book - it's a window on a different time and a different place and a different people. It's a wonderful read if you can shift your perspecive and accept things as they were."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"To me, Sayonara is an amazing story of a very unlikely couple. Maybe it is simply the woman in me that enjoys reading of a great love tale, but this novel truly hit me. In the beginning Lloyd is a man that would not think twice about dating a Japanese woman simply because of her race. But as time goes on, and the storyline progresses, his perspective begins to shift. He sees Hana-ogi not as a JAPANESE woman, but as a warm-hearted, loving human being. And although both of their careers forbid their relationship, neither one of them is willing to give up the bond they share. Their friends Joe Kelly and Katsumi are only another example of how love conquers, or rather, should conquer, all. Sayonara is not just a sappy love story. It is a tale of struggle and the overcoming of obstacles merely to be with the one you were meant to be with."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"In a supposed small world intent on globalization, reading a novellike James A. Michener's, \\"Sayonara\\", although set in 1950s Japan,suggests that in spite of each human's desire for the basicnecessities of life, racial and cultural differences may foreverdivide and inhibit an ultimate understanding of another person interms of their all important concept of self-identity.In the novel, Major Lloyd Gruver speaks, in first person prose of his prominent position in a post WW2 world. Symbolic of the Americaof that time period, he scintillates with all the sparkling promiseof the American dream. Educated at West Point like hisdistinguished father, and touted as an ace Air Force pilot forshooting down MIGS in the Korean War, he appears to have it all,especially since he is engaged to the beautiful socially acceptabledaughter of a general. A cushy conventional existence looms in hisfuture, but the routine and boring familiarity of this supposedperfect life perturbs him. He finds himself immobilized anduncertain of moving towards what he thinks of as a repeat of hisparents' lives. He finds himself asking why embrace a mindset and lifestyle for which he has little passion?From the moment he sets foot in Japan, Gruver, defends his shakybrand of the American dream; he has little understanding for thecountless GIs romancing \\"indigenous personnel.\\" When one of hismen, Airman Joe Kelly asks him to stand up for him at his marriageto a Japanese girl, Gruver is appalled. Rather than thestereotypical Oriental doll expected, Katsumi, Kelly's bride,borders on dowdy, the big gold tooth in the front of her mouthwreaks havoc on Gruver's idea of beauty. The comparison betweenthis girl and Eileen, his fianc&eacute;e, epitomizes for him the differencesbetween the East and the West.Ironically, when Gruver meets and falls in love with Hana-Ogi, hisimpressions of the Japanese change, as do his thoughts for his ownfuture. Ultimately, Gruver is faced with a few of the big questions--can he forgo the life for which he was groomed for an existencethat at that time would have been thought racially and sociallyunacceptable? Would the erotic sense of unconditional love that hefeels for this girl, circumvent the problems he would encounterbecause of the sensibilities of the day?Bottom line: Published in 1953, and supposedly (according to \\"Outof an Obscure Place: Japanese War Brides and Cultural Pluralism inthe 1950s\\" by Caroline Chung Simpson) reflective of Michener'smindset regarding the survival rate of such interracial marriages,this novel presages the author's growing interest in Japanese warbrides and his own change of heart regarding their success. In 1955he married Japanese American Mari Yoriko Sabusawa. Hisnovel, \\"Sayonara,\\" then magnificently details his personal struggleto understand a culture much different from his own as he tests hisown self-identity. Recommended to read over and over again.Diana Faillace Von Behren\\"reneofc@mindspring.com\\""},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"Let's get one thing straight: the Marlon Brando film, while largely remaining true to the book, failed to stay faithful to the most important scene in the latter: the ending. If Brando and the film's producers had maintained the ending, it would have been a much better, more believable movie, even with Brando's horrible, whiny Southern accent.Back to the book: a surprisingly moving and (even more surprising) short novel from Michener, the king of historical epics. The characters are finely drawn, even the two primary Japanese women, Hana-ogi and Katsumi. Tightly written, without the lush hypersentimentality of the film. The bittersweet ending isn't surprising, but it still catches your throat and makes you wish things had been different then, both in the book and in real life. Ace Gruver is a more complex character than the standard issue romance novel hero, and his relationship with the enigmatic Hana-ogi is given delicate treatment. You could imagine this book being longer, giving more depth to the affair and the marriage between Katsumi and Joe Kelly, but it probably wouldn't have improved on the story. Michener excels in creating those lush, heavily researched, sweeping doorstoppers, but in this, one of his earlier novels, his gift as a storyteller really shines.MRA"},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"I have just began to read Michener's novels, but have enjoyed none more than Sayonara. It varies from his typical writing style... he writes with passionate human emotion to describe racism, love, and culture. This is an amazing and important novel for Americans.

Awww, it's just a little interracial action. The Korean War is on, and the Ugly American is overrunning Japan. Air Force flying ace Lloyd Gruver is pretty disgusted by the way his fellow servicemen are fraternizing with the former enemy and even, ugh, marrying Japanese girls. Then he sees a stage performance by Hana-ogi, an actress who specializes in playing male roles, and he falls immediately hopelessly obsessively in love (I'll leave the psychosexual ramifications of that for someone else to ponder). Hana-ogi wants nothing to do with him, but Lloyd Lloyd all null and void confronts her with a truth that she cannot avoid, Lloyd. He will not be refused. In the '50s, they called this love at first sight. Today, we call it stalking. Persistence pays off for Lloyd. Without so much as a single conversation in a common language, the happy couple move in together, and Lloyd learns the important lesson that Japanese people are just as good as Americans despite their wacky heathen customs. \\"Sayonara\\" was written in the '50s, and it might have been daring and controversial stuff when World War II was fresh in readers' memories, but it has aged horribly. Michener's condescending and smugly superior attitude toward Asian culture is gratingly ignorant, and he perpetuates stereotypes while preaching tolerance. The Japanese women are praised for being so docile and demure and subservient. \\"Golden\\" and \\"yellow\\" are Michener's favorite go-to adjectives, and there's this tender bit of loveplay: \\"She caught me in her arms and cried, 'Oh, Rroyd, I rub you berry sweet.' I was unprepared both for her emotion and her pronunciation and for one dreadful moment I almost laughed and then I looked down at her dear sweet slanted eyes and saw that they were filled with tears.\\" Yea, he's a roid, all right. Maybe I should cut Michener some slack. I'm sure his intentions were good, and he's not alone in literature's long history of clueless/racist portraits. But even if it had been properly sensitive, \\"Sayonara\\" would be a lousy and dated novel. The only reasons I finished it were that it's short and I wanted to see how it compared with the movie (Marlon Brando looks sleepy and vaguely irritated to be starring in it)."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"This is a fine story. The book moves along at a steady pace and has plenty of interesting moments. A couple of these: when the hero hides in a cupboard from the Military Police and has a breakthrough in his thinking (freedom from the fear of the heavy boot steps in the middle of the night), and when he is reprimanded by his father and forced to realize that there are all sorts of people needed in this world to make it go 'round. The characters are diverse though the Japanese community seems weakly done. This book is recommended for those interested in the Korean war, Japan, love, or sad endings."},{"Title":"Sayonara/Audio Cassette","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. Although the ending was very sad, the message was a very important one. The book was intriguing from the first page. It was not dull or boring at any moment. Major Gruver was a very accomplished and intelligent man. In the book it was interesting to see the changes he underwent; at first, this man would not even acknowledge a Japanese woman in public but after he opened up and gave these women a second look, he not only talked to them, but he fell in love. More people need to make that change in life because so many times people get overlooked and pushed aside because they are of a different race. In this book it was not only individuals who did not agree with the entangling of people from two totally different cultures, but the United States Air Force as a group did not agree with it either; they did not understand the strength that love has on mankind. Sayonara is a truly amazing love story who's message and lessons should be known world-wide."},{"Title":"Urban Oracles","review":"This collection of short stories ia on of the best I've ever read.

As a child of the North I simply didn't know that such conditions existed.

This story of how the unbreakable love of a family overcomes all odds will warm your soul and tickle your funnybone. I thought the reading was very much like Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. This book is very very hard to put down. Once you begin, you are swept off into the South to feel the fear that was caused by the cold grip of the Klu Klux Klan and how good honest folk of Jonesboro thwarted their schemes to keep as much peace in the town alive as possible. If you are in need of an uplifting experience, this is the book for you. True family love will always rise above all that opposes it, and True friends will always be there when you least expect it.

It presented good ideas, but I hated the writing style. It seemed preachy and bland. However, the issues that were adressed made up for its dryness."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"Pa Chin's \\"Family\\" is an excellent, absorbing account of one family in early 20th century China; through the conflicts between the generations, we see the larger conflicts about to engulf the entire country. The family is the Kao clan, five generations living in one complex headed by the Venerable Master Kao, the ultimate autocrat, monarch of all he surveys within his walls, unwilling and unable to admit that his country and his family are changing before his eyes. The story centers around three brothers in the younger generation; Chueh-Hsin, married against his will to a woman chosen for him by his family, stuck in a job he hates, also chosen by his family, trying to navigate through life with his \\"compliant bow\\" philosophy which dictates that he must not oppose his elders under any circumstances; Chueh-Min, the second brother, determined to marry the girl he loves despite his family's opposition, and the youngest brother, Chueh-Hui, who sees his family as a ball and chain, loathes everything they represent, and is chafing to break free and live his own life. Pa Chin clearly identifies with Chueh-Hui; he rails against the stifling conformity of Chinese family life, which determines that everyone subordinate their will to the family elders; but in this reviewer's opinion, he doesn't give enough credit to the strengths in the same family life that held Chinese society together for thousands of years. However, this is a minor caveat. \\"Family\\" is a totally absorbing account of a family in crisis; on the one hand we sympathize with the bind Chueh-Hsin is caught up in as the oldest son, able to please neither his elders who demand his total compliance with the family traditions nor his younger brothers who need his assistance in their efforts to break free of the confines of those traditions, and on the other hand we empathize with the youngsters' efforts to live their own lives and realize their own destinies. \\"Family is the classic struggle of the individual vs. the collective good, and the outcome, as seen in the unfolding story of China, is still in doubt."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"I read this book for a college class on East Asian History. I don't often enjoy required books, but this was an exception. &quot;Family&quot; filled me with many emotions; while reading it I cried (or would have if I hadn't been in a public library), I was overjoyed, hopeful, despondent. Pa Chin is especially good at showing how his characters influence and are influenced by society. He makes you really care about his characters and believe what they believe. &quot;Family&quot; is a good choice if you like novels that focus on society; for example, &quot;Middlemarch&quot;,&quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;The Jungle&quot;, &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;. It is indeed a classic."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"Pa Chin's Family is a remarkable portrayal of the inter-generational struggles in pre-Communist China.

First published in 1931, its message still has vital importance. It tells people, young or old, male or female, not to suppress themselves due to external influences, including their own family.

After entering Irish politics he discovered that the ultimate power in Ireland lay not with elected politicians but with the bishops of the Catholic church, whose opulent lifestyle contrasted poignantly with the terrible hardships of the masses, and whose actions to prevent free medical care for mothers and children and to demonise him from the pulpit left him disillusioned with the religion and the Irish Parliament.Further medical training brought him into the psychiatric field, where he found barriers as high as ever. He could have had an easier life in England or the USA, however he choose to stay and help Ireland develop in spite of itself and at a considerable personal cost.There is anger and bitterness, but never is Dr.Browne understated about his own inadequacies.

They are stitched beautifully on linen and Aida, in bright complementary colors, suited for beginning to advanced stitchers. Samplers are well displayed, framed and matted using inspirational methods and materials. Charts are in color, and black and white, and are very easy to follow. There is an added assortment of 10 alphabets for personalizing samplers with initials and dates.

The sampler called for DMC 3021 thread which was identified in the pattern in the book as mid-green and was mid-green in the picture of the finished product. However DMC 3021 is not mid-green in fact it is a dark brown color. I ended up using DMC 3051 for the color which was a green color.The second sampler I worked on was the Edwardian Style Birth Sampler (pgs 118-121). The first typo was in the Alphabet border (they list A-Z twice around the border) the letter \\"G\\" on the left side is different from the letter \\"G\\" at the top. They should both be the same and the left \\"G\\" should be like the top \\"G\\". The other typo is the omission of a warm brown border (DMC 434) around the basket of the hot-air balloon. The warm brown border appears in the picture of the finished product but is not in the pattern.As I really liked having the patterns in the book, I would have loved to give this book a 5-star review but with mistakes like these in the 2 samplers I completed I felt as though the author or copy editor didn't really pay enough attention to the details.

If you have any interest in early American exploration, U.S. Army expeditions, or just great stories, then this is one book you should read. The author, U.S. Army Major Randolph Marcy was assigned to explore the Red River Valley which divided the Indian Territory and the Republic of Texas in 1852. With a small detachment of soldiers, Maj. Marcy maps and documents every mile of their journey. This book is a copy of the original report Major Marcy presented to the War Department upon completion of his assignment. The book has detailed accounts of the terrain, weather, animals, plants, rocks/minerals, water availability and quality...everything you would expect from an official government exploration. Major Marcy explains Native American encounters, feelings shared by his men and those of his Indian scouts, personal feelings, illnesses and basically every step of the expedition. Don't expect a glorified, novel type, story. This is a soldiers journal that was then written up as a factual account so those in Washington could have a true picture of part of our nations southern border as it was in 1852. Maps, diagrams, drawings of plants and animals, its all here just like Major Marcy presented it."},{"Title":"Poison Mind","review":"This book is well written and fast paced. It describes the death of Peggy Carr, and the subsequent conviction of George Trepal for that murder. The book is co-authored by the the Polk County, Florida Deputy Sherif who conducted the major investigation of the case. Her undercover work provided clues. While the book presents fully and fairly the eveidence in the case, it can be seen that the court system failed to carry out justice fairly. There is sufficient evidence and doubt raised by the evidence presented to legally acquit Mr. Trepal. Finally, the book hints that Dr. Diana Carr, Trepal's wife may have had a part in the crime, but presents no evidence to that end. This inuendo seems to be merely the officer/author's unfounded conclusions."},{"Title":"Poison Mind","review":"The \\"why\\" behind the murders in Poisoned Mind certainly is unique.Poisoned Mind is the story of a fantastic murder in Florida in 1988. George Trepal is a certified genius and member of Mensa - but he could never find a place in the conventional world. By the late-1980s, Trepal had married a surgeon and lived his life pursuing various hobbies while his wife earned a living.Things seemed to be going fairly well, until Trepal began to have conflicts with his working-class next-door neighbors - the Carrs. After the conflicts intensified, several of the Carrs became very sick and one member of the family died. Poisoned Mind is the story of police's attempts to bring Trepal to justice for the murders.The best thing about Poisoned Mind is that it is an interesting story. If someone wrote this as fiction, no one would believe it. As the story progresses, there are enough \\"hooks\\" to keep the pages turning.Police eventually decided to solve the murder by having a policewoman - Susan Goreck - go undercover and befriend the lonely Trepal. Goreck is one of the co-authors of Poisoned Mind and the book centers on her investigation. The material here isn't bad, but the reader wants to know more about George Trepal and the Carr family. Instead, the reader learns the details of Goreck's investigation, which - at times - just aren't that interesting. Another issue is that, at 370 pages, Poisoned Mind is about 100 pages too long.In short, Poisoned Mind is a solid, true crime book about a fantastic case from Florida. It's not great, but true crime fans will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Poison Mind","review":"Do you know who your neighbors are? This book is one of the reasons I don't like having neighbors. I was 14 years old when I first read this book; I am now 23. I have read this book over 100 times and I can pick it up and reread it. I love this book! Sissy was my Aunt at one time and the story of what had happened was true. This book goes inside the mind of George and show the true side of him, a cold blooded killer. I recommend this book for everyone to read as it shows you that you don't really know what your neighbors are capable of until it is too late."},{"Title":"Poison Mind","review":"A thorough, clear, well-written book of an unusual case. As a member of the same Mensa chapter, I have talked with people who knew him and something about the case, and there is some distortion - among other things, the victim's family caused neighbor problems well beyond just playing music loud, and Trepal's wife seemed just as suspicious - but the book accurately shows how courageous and Herculean efforts by police can bring people to justice for even superbly planned crimes."},{"Title":"Poison Mind","review":"True crime buffs will undoubtedly enjoy this book, particularly if you've seen the television programs devoted to this case. However, some of the authors' attempts to create suspense during Susan Goreck's undercover work seem a bit overblown. All of George Trepal's personality quirks, no matter how minor, are made to seem evil and malevolent. We are repeatedly told that Susan was risking her life throughout her surveillance, when it's abundantly obvious that she was in little (if any) danger from the geeky George.The authors also place unwarranted emphasis on George and Diana's interest in BDSM sex; their leather goods, sex toys, basement play dungeon, etc. are described in ominous detail. Only the most naive reader will think this has anything to do with Trepal's crimes.Some more in-depth information about Diana Carr would have been most welcome. Her role in the poisonings has never been fully explored.To their credit, the authors thoroughly debunk the popular image of Mensa as a lofty, serious organization with high ideals (it's more like a singles club for snooty, socially-dysfunctional geeks)."},{"Title":"Poison Mind","review":"This book does an very good job in detailing the events surrounding the most bizarre true murder case I can recall. The story is told by the police detective who went undercover- as a fellow mensa member- to crack this case. Since I do not want to give away any of the surprising twists and turns of this book (i.e., the case itself), let me just say that this story could very easily be described as a case study in moral evil. A must read."},{"Title":"Poison Mind","review":"I found this book interesting. It's worth of the money i spent.Firstly, it was very strange to see that a Mensa member ruined his life in such a way. It's a fact that the intelligence of a person doesn't guarantee his/her happiness or his/her success. This man could be a great scientist, like Albert Einstein or Nicola Tesla. He could have discovered the cure for cancer or AIDS. However, he succeded in drugs and death.Furthermore, this book shows the way of living of an undercover agent. Susan, faced a lethal danger being undercover near a dangerous killer. It was very hard to keep (and losing sometimes) balance between being hershelf and being somebody else.The man's mind will not ever be discovered. It's a great chaos. Susan discovered the attractive, intelligent and interesting side of the killer (fortunately, it was not hard for her partners to ....bring her back to normal).Finally, i found it very interesting. It doesn't show only facts, evidence and law enforcement. It shows the life and the emotions of all involved in this case."},{"Title":"Poison Mind","review":". . . but the doubts also remain.[...]If you were on trial for your life, accused of poisoning your neighbors, how would you feel if a government investigator who testified against you made the kinds of errors listed in the above report, prepared by the Office of the Inspector General?\\"In his work in 'Trepal,' Martz appeared to have a lower threshold of scientific proof than is generally accepted in forensic science and to lack appropriate scientific rigor in his approach to examinations. Martz did not conduct additional tests that were appropriate under the circumstances, and in reaching his conclusions, he did not consider analytical results of his tests other than the DPA and IC tests. His case notes and charts were inaccurate and incomplete, and he testified inaccurately on several points. He committed a serious error when, based on the same data, he rendered an opinion at trial that was stronger than the opinion in his dictation. Such conduct by an examiner is of concern whenever it is displayed in casework, and it is particularly disturbing in a matter such as 'Trepal' where the death penalty is a potential result.\\"All of these errors aside, Trepal may be guilty; my gut feeling after reading the book is that he is. But gut feelings do not constitute a legal or moral conviction. Should anyone in this country be executed without a fair trial? Between the report about Martz and the alleged remarks made by at least one of the jurors about seeing demons, I'm not convinced he got one."},{"Title":"Poison Mind","review":"This book started out interesting, and then became bogged down in an undercover officer wasting her time discovering NOTHING.

What bothers me about this book is also what bothered me about the investigation: that other people with motive, means and opportunities were not thoroughly investigated, and that the victims continued to be poisoned while in the hospital and not within George's so called reach. I do not know if George did the crime, but I do think this book is a reflection of the real crime here, and that is of professionals doing a poor job of examining all of the facts before rushing to judgment. I think an impartial review of the facts does not lead to guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. George may have indeed committed this crime, but I think he was falsely convicted of said. This book could have looked at that aspect better.

This is a must read book...really."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"Not many authors have the guts to write this kind of book- and probably no one else could write it like Clare Clark. To take the traditional Victorian-era murder mystery and lift it down into the squalid sewers of London is daring (see the opening sentence if you don't believe me). The Great Stink doesn't pull any punches, and readers should be forewarned that this book will provide you with an up-close view of the Thames sewer, from its stench to the feeling of its sludge lapping at your ankles. For some, this may prove to be uncomfortably close. But for those who can handle it, this is a first-class novel, rich in incredibly fine prose.

The author's use of metaphors drew me in...Beautifully dark -- comparisons to Dickens are warranted here. As a clinical counselor, I found the author's descriptions of May's self-injurious behavior (his cutting) to be rich, evocative and right on the mark. As a writer, I can't even imagine who emotionally draining it must have been to write some of these passages.One small, very minor thing that I struggled with as the British-isms in the book. I found myself distracted at times by wondering what some of the words meant.

Given to unaccountable rages and despair, May never imagines he will survive to be recalled to London. He has frozen into uncaring acceptance of his predicament, but recovers the will to live, the raw emotion so painful that he begins to cut himself, the self-mutilation a relief for his overburdened mental state.When May is hired in the rebuilding project of the London sewers, a huge and expensive undertaking, his prospects have changed radically for the better. Married, with one son and a baby on the way, William is a changed man, but still tormented by nightmares, unhinged by his experiences in the war. William, nicknamed \\"The Sultan of the Sewers\\", continues to disintegrate in this dark hell, where his psyche finds peace only in cutting, his wife purposefully oblivious to her husband's suffering. This is the landscape of 1880's London, with little opportunity for advancement, men desperate to carve out a niche that will keep their families from starvation.As gruesome and as poverty riddled as any Dickensian tale, this novel exposes the indigenous city poverty, personified by the denizens of the sewers, those who make a scant living collecting the mud-encrusted detritus of others. Vast numbers of poor people create income from the even the filthiest refuse, bought and sold for profit. The great rotting underground sewers are a metaphor for the class distinctions that leave the destitute to wallow in the most extreme conditions, soothed by cheap gin, while the Fancy, the rich, indulge in betting to alleviate their boredom, visiting the slums for sport. Even the bureaucracy is corrupt, the sewer project approved, while the funds are withheld by a bickering Parliament.As the project progresses, the sewers become less navigable, the flushers left to ever more ingenious ways in and out. Under the threat of exposure, agents supplying bricks attempt to force May to accept substandard materials, especially Alfred England, whose bricks have been contracted by May's superior. The stress of constant threats to his family should he not agree to the illegal contracts drive May deeper into the chaos of his own mind, thoughts of death and war merging with everyday reality. Indeed, in the face of murder, who better to blame than the insane, self-mutilating William May?With remarkable detail that requires a strong constitution, the author reveals the complex underpinnings of city management and graft. In a complex blend of murder, greed and madness, the London bureaucracy ripe for plundering by privateers, the protagonist becomes the unwitting victim of greedy villains. In this unhealthy mix, all are caught in the rude stew of city waste, men with their own personal demons and small enjoyments. Not an easy book to read, with its unflinching detail, The Great Stink is a timely reminder of the skeleton that must be maintained, a framework for civilization, where opportunity offers freedom from a life of discontent and distorted appetites. Luan Gaines/2005"},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"There's no doubt Clare Clark modeled THE GREAT STINK after Dickens. Readers will be surprised at how well she succeeded.Clark's acknowledgments tell us quite a bit about how she planned her novel and where she got the title. One of her sources was THE GREAT STINK OF LONDON by Stephen Halliday about the great engineer Joseph Bazalgette's attempt to completely overhaul the sewers of London. Another, Marilee Strong's study of self-injury, A BRIGHT RED SCREAM, provided motivation for one of the novel's main characters, William May. A primary source, LONDON LABOUR AND THE LONDON POOR, gave credibility to her other main character, Long Arm Tom.The story starts when a Russian soldier bayonets William May during the Crimean War. Robert Rawlinson, who was in charge of sanitary reforms during the war, took an interest in May and helped get him a job as a surveyor working on the Bazalgette's sewer project. The problem was that May was suffering from what sounds like battle fatigue or clinical depression. He began to cut himself to drive away the dark moods, and he used the sewers to do it. Despite his affliction, William May is a highly principled young man, and when a senior engineer solicits a bribe from one of the brick makers, May refuses to go along. The senior engineer sets out to ruin him.Clark shifts back and forth between May's dilemma and that of Long Arm Tom whose vocation will definitely remind you of Dickens. Long Arm Tom is a rat catcher. He sells them for a penny a piece to gin joints where \\"Fancies\\" bet on how many rats a ratter (a dog) can kill in two minutes. Tom adopts one of these ratters when her owner dies. She's one of the best ratters in the history of the sport. The fact that Tom makes a living in the sewer provides a tie to William May. Another Dickens character is the lawyer who takes William May's case when he is arrested for murder. Watch what she does with this guy's hands; she learned from the master.The scatological descriptions and the emphasis on cutting will bother some, but if you can get past this, this is a really entertaining read. You're never quite sure if William May will make it. Long Arm Tom and his dog Lady add a certain amount of warmth to a sometimes brutal novel."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"I am giving this book 5 stars, because I found the story and the history of the London sewers so fascinating. I appreciate wonderful fiction that educates me as well as entertains.Summary, no spoilers:The is the story of William May, a soldier from the Crimean War.May has been psychologically damaged from that war, and the horrible treatment he received at the hospital afterwards.He is married to a very sweet, optimistic woman, but it's is hard for her to keep her mental and emotional balance with someone as severely disturbed and depressed as William.William, back from the war, is now a surveyor who is assigned the task of helping to redo the decrepit sewer system under the streets of London.The story features the sights (and SMELLS!) of this amazing underground world, and the book features assorted sundry characters and a murder to boot.I guarantee you will learn a lot reading this book. And if you are like me, you will find the first 4/5 so depressing, that you may want to consider a Prozac drip.Saying that, when I was done with the book I was glad I had read it.I applaud the effort and research that went into this book.It is not a fast read, but a worthwhile one."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"What a disappointment. Although I love historical thrillers (Dan Simmons' \\"The Terror\\" grabbed me and never let go), I had to force myself to finish \\"The Great Stink.\\" Clare Clark may be a wonderful historian, but she doesn't seem to have any flair for story-telling. Her pacing is off: for a disproportionate chunk of the book she gives us interminable and repetitive descriptions of the sewers and her protagonist's cutting episodes (with a side order of dog-vs.-rat fights), and then rather hastily wraps up all the loose ends in an implausibly neat \\"happy\\" ending.Worse, I found it impossible to feel for the protagonist, William May, because Clark fails to bring him to life. He's nothing but a case study; she doesn't do an adequate job of building him as a character before and separate from his psychological problems. \\"When he's in his right mind, he likes to do botanical drawings\\" does not a convincing human being make.As another reviewer mentioned, the only character I was taken with was the dog."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"I didn't care for THE GREAT STINK, but not for the reasons many other readers here have given.

But oh, pleeeease, SO MUCH narrative and not nearly enough dialogue. The author only told us what was going on and rarely showed it. We were walked through what could have been truly engaging and interesting chapters, like being rushed through a guided tour. Delineated scenes were scant. Unless the book got better after page 90--when I gave up--I'm not sure what the hoopla is all about."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"What a refreshing change to read a mystery novel set in 1850's London which explores the underbelly of the centre of the British empire. Clare Clark has done a great amount of research on the London sewer system and the lives of middle and working class people. She cleverly provides details of the harsh lives many people endured in London around the 1850's and is able to combine it with an ambitious project to rebuild London's sewers and produce an enjoyable mystery novel with real characters.Clark provides a compelling cross-section of people and their lives from desperate, exploited soldiers in the Crimean War to engineers and surveyors working on a sewer project to the working class flushers, gangers and labourers desperately trying to eke out an existence to a lawyer trying to expose a corrupt boss to clear his client of a capital crime. The novel also explores the activity of rat baiting in a tough tavern to the routine of life in a harsh and brutal insane asylum. The author reveals the filth and pollution of 1850's London and the harsh and dirty environment that all people had to endure in every day life. The authorities were unsympathetic and it was every person for themselves and you could expect little help if you were in trouble.The novel is centred around two characters, the shell shocked, young Crimean War veteran and surveyor William May and old Long arm Tom, the tosh who makes an illegal living searching the sewers for valuables and catching rats to be killed by dogs in taverns for gambling purposes. Both are believable, sympathetic characters who are just trying to survive and make a living to support themselves and in May's case his family. Both end up being exploited and abused by forces more powerful than themselves. The author is able to convey an atmosphere such that you feel you are right beside these two characters as their lives entwine in unexpected and mysterious circumstances. Enough said, it is a wonderful book that took me on an enjoyable journey back in time."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"Excellent on so many levels: an important chapter in London's history, well-developed characters, insights into the dogfighting underground, the then-little-understood traumatizing effects of combat, and the unseen engineering marvels of the sewers...It's a good book to settle into, and the plot never lags. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction or, for that matter, just good fiction."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"The Great Stink is a mystery novel set in Victorian London. The main characters are William May, a sewer engineer suffering from shell shock brought on by combat in the Crimean War, and Long Arm Tom, who prowls the sewers for profit with his wonderful dog, Lady. Both get caught up in a corruption and murder scandel centered on the allocation of contracts for the building of the new sewer system. Author Clare Clark draws upon her historical expertise to paint the setting in rich detail. Instead of the usual aristocrats one gets in Regency and Victorian mysteries, her characters run the gamut from low to middle society, as the plot swings between the world of clerks and engineers at the sewer commission to that of the poor as they eke out an existence catching rats in the sewers for dog-baiting, drinking at taverns, and suffering in verminous tenements. Fortunately, Clark has the writing skills to turn her set piece into a taut, suspenseful mystery populated with compelling, believable characters and a story that draws the reader in and makes this novel hard to put down. This is a debut novel in which the author can take pride, and the reader much pleasure."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"The sewers of mid 1800s London does seem an odd subject, but Ms. Clark has used it as a window into the repugnant reality and the Dickensonian vernacular of the times. The plot of the story is secondary to the historical portrayal of the city and the denizens who's lives were shaped by the disgusting caverns beneath it.Ms. Clark should surely be congratulated for the most realistic and riveting dialogs and monologues which could not be improved upon by anyone since Dickens.

I felt the same way about the endless paragraphs describing the protagonist's urge to cut himself. With each page I, too felt an ever increasing urge, not to cut, but to skip these dull and repetitive sections. The main character was far too passive a victim to arouse much sympathy. In the end, I was far more interested in the sewer reconstruction than in any of the characters.

Will certainly read more books from Clare Clark."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"For those not afraid to get a little grimy in the sewers of Victorian London Clare Clark's The Great Stink is an intriguing read with a great atmospheric setting and well developed characters. Clark is painstaking in her detail and ever so slowly draws out the strands to develop her plot, which can take a patient reader.We learn about the putrid smell and ever present diseases of London in the 1850's and the desire to improve upon the sewer system without the expenditure. Clark is careful in setting the atmosphere of the time:\\"In the rotting and inadequate sewers, human excrement mixed with refuse from the slaughterhouses and knacker's yards and waste from the tanneries and factories. Every day it drained into the Thames. it was not long before the river itself became the great cesspool of the city. At low tide the effluvium clung to the pillars of bridges or piled itself into stinking mudbanks and fermented.London, the largest metropolis in the world, was poisoning itself. That was the consensus reached by doctors and scientists as the century passed its midpoint. As the filth pooled and putrefied in local sewers many of which were hardly more than open ditches it exhaled highly poisonous gases.\\"William May, an engineer returning from the Crimean War is hired to help to develop a new sewage system in London. May is a troubled individual subject to self-mutilation and suffering from what would be termed today as PTSD. Although greatly troubled, May seems to find relief in his work below the pavement of London. A diligent worker, May is unprepared to deal with the corrupt forces at hand.Clark has evolved The Great Stink into a mystery, but as such it is somewhat ponderous and not terribly difficult to solve. It is much better approached as a character study and historical fiction. May as a character although deeply troubled is sympathetic and appealing. Other of her characters, which Dickens himself could have developed are interesting and entertaining. May's wife Polly who gravitates toward happiness, Long Arm Tom who has spent a lifetime eeking out an existence from the sewers and the lawyer, Sydney Rose are all truly excellent characters.For my tastes the plot does drag a bit at the beginning of the book in setting up the story, setting and characters and at the end it wraps up just a bit to rapidly, but that may well be a matter of personal taste and I certainly enjoyed Clark's writing enough to want to read other fiction by her. The Great Stink isn't a book for those who want things sunny and light but rather for those who appreciate a bit of darkness."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"Loved it. Absolutely brilliant. Desperate for more high quality literature such as this. Loved the historical accuracy and the details. Felt the pain and joy characters were experiencing. Read it in one night. Interesting for students of the fin de si&egrave;cle and London approaching the modern era but still very much stuck in the dark."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"I really enjoyed this dirty, grimy, gritty novel set in London in 1855. Clare Clark takes her time familiarizing the reader with the polluted and overpopulated city and it's filthy and inadequate sewer system. She creates interesting characters set in a vivid and richly textured setting and takes her time laying this dark and sometimes disturbing ground work before creating the tension of conflict for her characters. She describes the many horrid smells of London in graphic detail and reveals the characters to us with story upon story, often transitioning from past to present with surprising ease.I really loved Clare Clark's writing. The following passage is about the main character William May and how he thinks about the sewers;'To his mind the odour was infinitely more tolerable down in the cold purity of the darkness than it was in the streets above him. In the sewers the smell was simple and direct. In the streets the stink of excrement was but one enemy in an ambush of torments. It knitted itself into the stench of fog and bodies and factories and refuse and the choked tangle of traffic and the never-ending racket and clatter to throttle the senses and make a man mad. In the sewers there was filth and the unpredictable anxieties of tide and the weather but within that there prevailed a kind of order. In the sewers a man might feel himself measured by heights and spans and gradients. A man who had never ventured down into the bowels of the capital, be he a man of London all his life, could surely not imagine such a place. For the man who was there, alone in the darkness, it was London that was impossible to imagine.'William May is a veteran of the Crimean War and suffers from post traumatic stress, his mental health plays an important roll in this story. He is employed as a surveyor to the Commission of Sewers under Joseph Bazalgette, the chief engineer responsible for reconstructing London's sewers. William is charged with murder and it looks certain that he'll hang for the crime.Long Arm Tom is a lonely old man who finds comfort in the company of an ugly dog. He makes his living collecting rats from the sewers and selling them to tavern owners like Frank Brassey who runs a rat pit for the Fancy in his parlor. William and Tom spend a fair amount of time in the sewers and eventually their paths cross.I really enjoyed these characters,especially Long Arm Tom and his relationship with Lady, the dog. I thought the details were wonderful, the intrigue or mystery part of the story was well done and I liked the resolution of the story. All in all I was very pleased with this book and I'm looking forward to reading more from Clare Clark.If you like reading about the plague I think you will like this book. If you are squeamish and can't stand the thought of reading about rats in sewers with floating human refuse clinging to the walls you might want to try something else."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"This book has an appropriate title in that it describes in icky detail the London sewer system of the mid-1800's. This is a historical novel about the replacement of that system. Although billed as a thriller, the mystery does not develop until about the halfway point. By then, you're accustomed to wrinkling your nose at the descriptions of the stench and of the filthy Thames River. The poverty and dinginess are reminiscent of Oliver Twist. The two main characters meet only once. One is William, an engineer working on the project, who suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome. The other is Long Arm Tom who scavenges for valuable trinkets in the sewers and, along with his friend Joe, catches rats that will be devoured by vicious dogs for sport. The advent of the new sewer will put him out of business. Fortunately, he happens upon a raggedy dog that turns out to be a very efficient rat destroyer. Tom plans to retire on the sale of Lady to a gentleman known as the Captain, who, not surprisingly, turns out to be a no-good-nik. The mystery is that of a murder that takes place underground and that William witnesses but can't be sure he didn't commit himself during one of his blackouts."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"I was eager to read this book because it is set in the same time period as a non-fiction work I had just finished, \\"Victorian London: The Tale of a City 1840-1870.\\" The author of \\"The Great Stink\\" is a historian who very capably evokes the seedier aspects of Victorian society: the labyrinthine sewer system and the official and unofficial sewer workers who spent their lives wading through the feces and filth; the dog-fighting circuit, which was the Victorian equivalent of our country's trashy pit bull-fighting except that the dogs killed rats instead of other dogs; prison ships; Victorian mental hospitals; public executions; and more.The main character is a man who is suffering from what modern psychiatrists would call PTSD. He had terrible experiences in the Crimea, resulting in an emotional breakdown and an obsession with self-injury. I find this implausible - that a veteran would start cutting - but that's a whole other issue. He likes to cut in the sewers, waist-deep in filth, but inexplicably never gets an infection. The cutting sequences are protracted and dramatic: the \\"cravings\\" become unbearable, he slithers down into the sewers, the tension and urge to cut build uncontrollably, he cuts, he sees the blood and experiences an orgasmic release...they really read like sex sequences, actually, except not as interesting. Each time he cuts, he is sated for a short period of time, but the cravings inevitably return. After a while, you start to get annoyed with this guy. Every time he gets upset about something, it's down to the sewers, and there's another long build-up to the \\"explosion.\\" Yawn. Eventually, he progresses to cutting himself with a meat cleaver.The other storylines are equally depressing: dogs killing rats, people killing rats, people collecting rats in the sewer to be killed by dogs, etc. Reading this book, I began thinking about the difference between a good writer and a good storyteller. The author of this book is a good writer: her descriptions of places are very detailed and interesting, individual sentences are well-wrought, and although her characters are somewhat wooden she describes their physical appearance well. However, a good storyteller would realize that grimness should be interspersed with something lighter or more hopeful or more emotionally engaging. Unrelenting grimness and unsympathetic characters do not hold a reader's interest. There are only two characters in this book I actually cared about, one of whom is a rat-killing dog. The protagonist, the cutter, just becomes so annoying. I was mentally comparing this book with Dumas' \\"The Black Tulip,\\" which I also read recently. Dumas was not the greatest writer or the greatest historian in the world; he churned the books out, often employing an assistant to do the historical research (much of the history is inaccurate), and his individual sentences are sometimes sloppy. However, the man was a great storyteller. You become utterly engrossed in his novels, and you care deeply about his characters. At the end of \\"The Great Stink,\\" the novel finally starts getting interesting, but by that point you really don't care that much about what happens to the cutter, so it never becomes all that exciting."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"The Bookschlepper recommends The Great Stink by Clark but be forewarned: you can't snack and read this book at the same time! Two men deal with the sewers of mid-19th C. London. One is an engineer with PTSD from the Crimean War. One is Long Arm Tom who raids the sewers of rats for pub entertainment. After a serious drought, the powers-that-be decide a new sewer system is needed and the monumental effort beneath the city is undertaken. In the old sewers, flushed by the tides into the Thames, murder occurs, corruption simmers. Life among the newly-formed middleclass and the huddled masses is shown in stark light and the ever-present smog. Slog through the descriptions; Clark sets up the story vividly. The resolution in quick and a bit serendipitous but this is fiction. Most memorable character: Lady, a pink-eyed ratter, duplicated by the pink-eyed lawyer."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"This marvelous book should have been kept to the issue on hand: the rank pollution and hideous odors of the River Thames, right in the middle of London. The source of their drinking water was 'ripe' with rotting animal and vegetable matter. The solution to the unbelievable horror of the contaminated river and drinking water would have filled this well researched novel. The murder mystery breaks the mood of the book. But, this history of the People and City of London in the 19th century is rich in the many fascinating details of life of all Londoners. A totally worthwhile read. If you read History, read this."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"It must be difficult for an author to write an interesting book whose basic plot revolves around the sewers of London in the mid 19th century. This book, however, shows what can be accomplished with very good writing and interesting characters. There's a sordid tale of murder, madness, bribery, and other assorted evils in this book, all handled quite well by the author. At the first part of the book it's a bit difficult to understand what's actually happening, but as the tale, and the action, picks up, everything becomes somewhat clearer. The depiction of the sewers is chilling, and the part of the book that deals with how the supposed insane were treated is absolutely horrifying. There were times when the tale seemed to drag a bit, but overall it was a book well worth reading, if only for gaining knowledge as to how London cleaned up the Thames, and removed the \\"great stink\\" from its air."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"In this debut novel, Clare Clark has combined historical fiction, suspense and a battle for sanity. From within three levels of darkness (experiences in the Crimean war, working in the sewers of London in the mid 19th century and fighting for his sanity because of his experiences of both) William May may seem an unlikely hero.Add to the mix a gritty portrayal of life amongst the London poor, the very real events of 'The Great Stink' in 1855 (which ultimately led to the rebuiding of London's sewers) and the stage is set for an interesting novel.Warning: William May's self destructive tendencies will be very confronting for many. The description, which lends it authenticity, is not for the faint-hearted. Many of us will recognise it and understand it immediately.I would not recommend this book to the squeamish. I would recommend it to those who like some factual underpinning for their fiction and who seek to descend into the Victorian underworld.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"Clare Clark has done a lot of \\"digging\\" in historical records in order to dramatize the way Londoners lived pre-sewer system. Many other events give us a peek into areas that may seem obscure nowadays, such as the Crimean War. She knows a lot of history, but she never imposes her knowledge on us to just show it off. Her ear for the inflections and vocabularies of the various classes of Londoners is flawless and exceptionally entertaining.I found myself identifying with several characters as well as a dog and \\"rooting\\" for them to live happily ever after. Like Dickens, the author of The Great Stink has a variety of voices and great control of her material. The reader feels satisfied at the end as if he had indeed read a Dickens novel."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"I was totally enraptured by Clark's depiction of the underbelly of ninteenth century London. She is incredibly gifted in the way she writes, and I found myself quite literally unable to put the book down.I was especially impressed with the way she so convincingly places us in the skins of the main two characters: the war ravaged, self-destructive technician, William May, and the poor alienated by product of the industrial revolution, \\"Long Arm Tom.\\"If you are looking for a feel good weekend read, this is most definitely not your book! If however, you are looking for a thoughtful historical analysis of one of the most horrid environmental disasters of the modern age---and how human beings relate to such momentous events---then, this is your book!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"The Great Stink has a fascinating character (William) at the center of the mystery who is portrayed with relentless, heart-wrenching honesty. From the first moments of the book which simply and elegantly describe William's every day task of walking through the London sewers, Clark lets us into this man's heart and mind and we have no choice but to follow him every step of the way with an urgent longing to know his fate. This is a deeply moving and timely story."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"London in the 1850's is a City slowly being poisoned. An inadequate and antiquated sewer system is failing to meet the needs of a rapidly expanding population. The sewers are indeed rotting, causing human excrement to mix with refuse from slaughterhouses and knackers' yards, and waste from tanneries and the factories, every day draining into the Thames, the river itself becoming the great cesspool of the city.The stench of industrial effluent, urban garbage, and the human waste of nearly two million people, becomes so utterly overwhelming, that Parliament agrees something desperately needs to be done. On one boiling summer in 1858 the smell becomes so bad that a vote is taken, and a multimillion-pound budget is allocated to Joseph Bazalgetter, Chief Engineer to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and his team of engineers, surveyors and draughtsman; they are given the job of constructing a completely new underground drainage system for the entire city.A new sewer system will be seen as a godsend to most of the City's inhabitants, but it is likely to be the death-knell for people like Long Arm Tom. Tom is a \\"tosh,\\" who together with his trusty colleague, Joe, makes a living by finding dropped valuables in the crumbling tunnels and by catching rats for dogfights in the local pubs. Tom even admits that, \\"bit by bit the sewers were shutting themselves up as tight as mussels and there was nothing could be done about it.\\"Tom maybe lamenting the fact that times are changing, but construction of the new system is seen as a godsend for surveyor and civil engineer William May. William, emotionally scarred from his tour of duty in the Crimean War, has obtained the backing of Mr. Hawke, who is in charge of awarding contracts for the new sewer system. Talented and brilliant, William is able to throw himself into this work with enthusiasm and his helped by the support of his wife Polly. It is through her love and devotion, and of course his new job, that he hopes to conquer the ghosts of his horrifying military adventure.Although William tries to be disciplined and focused, the terrors of his experiences on the battlefield constantly come back to haunt him. He slinks deep into the dark, dank, and rotting filth of the sewer - perhaps reminiscent of the battlefield - where he finds emotional solace in slashing his arms and thighs with a knife. The intensity of the cravings frighten and disgust him, but he cannot smother them, \\"they occupy him completely, obliterating all sense and feeling, his flesh on fire and screaming for a knife.\\"With his belly leaking the \\"thin sour of effluvia of elusive dreams and half-forgotten terrors,\\" William gradually begins to lose credibility with his wife, and then his coworkers, who are eager to discredit him as a freak for their own gain. As the nightmarish episodes deep in the bowels of the City gradually become worse, there are days that he \\"simply disappears, fragments, and disintegrates until he feels as though he is nothing but dry sand, trickling away between the floorboards.\\"After a particularly brutal episode, William awakens to discover that a man he fought with at work has been found brutally stabbed in the sewer. With no immediate suspects, William is automatically blamed for the crime, but he is so mixed up from the horrors of Crimea, the nightmares, and the blackouts that he can't remember what happened. It is only through Long Arm Tom, who innocently holds some vital information, and his rat-catching dog that the young surveyor can perhaps hope to achieve any flicker of deliverance.The Great Stink is a richly rewarding and meticulously researched historical romp. Author, Clare Clark writes with fine craftsmanship and an impressive command of idiom, capturing the bawdy and often duplicitous nature of the era and bringing the sights, sounds, and especially the smells of mid-nineteenth century London to life: \\"The taste of rancid lard, faintly powdered with the black flour of coal dust; the soap boilers with their stink, the sickly favour of boiling fat, and the reek of leather and dog sh*t from the tanneries. \\"This is historical fiction at its very best, a bawdy and stench-fuelled frolic though the Victorian underworld, involving murder, intrigue, and depravity, together with lots of rats and of course, human waste. Clark's London is historically accurate, as she skillfully explores the dark undercurrents of life beneath this great metropolis. The characters are as impulsive and self-indulgent as their fortunes allow, constantly bound to the rivers and canals that shudder beneath the city, as the smelly effluent \\"slithers through the city's ditch towards its lair beneath the open sea.\\" Mike Leonard November 05."},{"Title":"The Great Stink","review":"This is an excellent book. Clare Clark has done the homework. Takes you right into this period of time in London. I never knew until reading this book about the horrendous pollution to the Thames. You are transported back ...almost smelling the stench, experiencing through the gut wrenching prose, the atmosphere and the sewers. I was transfixed! I did not want the book to end. I realize this review does not even touch upon the plot, but I wanted to comment on what affected me about this book, not to say that the plot is not well thought out and executed. By the way, my daughter bought and shared Clark's subsequent novel, The Nature of Monsters, and it is another great, engrossing novel, back in the same period in London (I believe), dealing with the strange beliefs of the time regarding birth defects. I recommend it, as well as the Great Stink, to everyone. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of Celebrity Murder: Murder Played Out in the Spotlight of Maximum Publicity","review":"This book is good if you want a synopsis of different murder cases involving celebrities. My only disappointment with this book was the obvious inaccuracies in some of the stories. For instance, Ann Woodward shot her husband in their home in Nassau County, New York - NOT Nassau, in the Bahamas! Also, Tupac Shakur was murdered in 1996 - not 1994. In addition, the book refers to O.J. Simpson as a former football player with the LA Lakers team - anyone who follows sports knows that the Lakers is NOT a football, but a BASKETBALL team!Although these inaccuracies annoyed me a bit, it didn't stop me from reading it. I'd still recommend this book if you are a true crime buff."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of Celebrity Murder: Murder Played Out in the Spotlight of Maximum Publicity","review":"I'd like to know the story behind the publication of this book, if there is one. It is one of the most fascinating, engrossing books I have read, yet the editing/proofreading is just atrocious. It's as if the authors wrote their first draft and the copy person grabbed it from their hands and dashed it down to the typesetting office in an effort to make the 5:00 train. While much of the language is obviously British, and therefore some of the spellings are variations of American spellings, there are words that are just flat out wrong, including wrong meanings, verb tenses, spellings, etc. However, all of that doesn't negate the incredible fascination of the stories told and the details in the telling. The authors obviously know their stuff, and they provide much more of the facts than we ever got in the papers. Fun stuff."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of Celebrity Murder: Murder Played Out in the Spotlight of Maximum Publicity","review":"I found myself hardly able to put this huge book down once I started it.

The primary learning tool is the video. It allows the learner to listen to conversations in Spanish, but unlike audio cassettes, you have the aid of contextual clues provided by the scenes acted out on the video to help you understand the dialog. I found that to be an excellent learning tool. The chapters are designed to start with a basic vocabulary and add more with each chapter. Each chapter incorporates new vocabulary, and that vocabulary is tailored to include what a visitor to a Spanish-speaking country is most likely to use. The video is written in a soap-opera format, which &quot;hooks&quot; you into the story and characters, thus helping you to maintain interest and not quit the learning process. And the story introduces you to several different Spanish-speaking countries. The audio cassettes provide further listening practice, and the book provides the core of the grammatical curriculum.I think it's better for an intermediate student rather than a complete beginner.All in all a good way to improve listening comprehension and learn travelers vocabulary. For speaking, there's no substitute for live practice with a fluent teacher."},{"Title":"Destinos: An Introduction to Spanish (Student Edition)","review":"I'm using Destinos in a telecourse, and am having lots of fun with it, and even learning some Spanish.

This was used in a course I took at college, and it felt like we were all travelling along with the main character, Raquel, a lawyer who travels from her home in Los Angeles, to Mexico, Spain, Argentina and Puerto Rico, as part of her work with her clients, a family living in an estate in Mexico City.The format of this program is styled after the Latin American \\"novelas\\" (soap operas). In other words, you will need to carefully watch each episode, to keep up with plot details. But, not to worry, because Raquel reviews what happened with you, at the end of every episode. Each episode is entirely in Spanish, and it gets you thinking in the language, comprehending what is going on very quickly, as well as picking up interesting information specific to the cultures she is immersed in, during her travels. We learn about art, music, dance, food and slang. (Slang is also a very valuable thing to know about, when travelling in Spanish-speaking countries. Words that are acceptable in one country could get you shot in another country---this isn't addressed in the episodes, but that is really important to be aware of)I am pleased to say that the series is entertaining, educational and very beneficial to students.

Each section is formatted with specific tasks, a description of the topic at hand and a fill-in-the-blanks page for personal information with a quirky twist, encouraging playfulness and creativity.For example, in \\"my zany life\\", the book requests that its owner paste in baby pictures to track her life from birth to date, the opposite page (a clever and consistent feature) titled \\"mix-it-up\\", meant for pictures of famous people she admires, magazine clippings, stars born on the same day, etc., instructing the reader to draw, paste, collage... whatever strikes her fancy. Next there is a page for \\"my favorite crazy things\\", photos and drawings, magazine images, followed by a page for favorite foods. Then another mix-it-up for the weirdest foods (\\"a freaky food log\\"), followed by a page for family photographs and another mix-it-up... the kind of animal each family member might be, a holiday page and a mix-it-up.Created with the young girl in mind, this activity book speaks to family, friends, the developing self and the building of self-esteem, utilizing fanciful language and ideas to inspire an inner dialog that will both define and validate her personality and values. As silly as this book may look, much thought is given to the stimulation of the imagination and fostering of individuality so critical to girls of a certain age.

Most trails are some what long and require a whole day. I would not recommend it if you are looking for great 1-3 mile trails, as most of them are much longer."},{"Title":"50 Best Short Hikes in Yosemite and Sequoia/Kings Canyon","review":"The writing about the history, geology, and forests of the park is excellent. Although a short read, it covers the highlights well.There are many hikes in the book that sound great. We tried to do a couple of the hikes out of the book, and we had some issues with the layout of the book and trail descriptions.First of all, the maps of the trails are all at the back of the book. If you're on the trail looking at the directions in the description and want to check the map, you have to flip to the back to see the map, which is a little annoying.One of the routes we tried to do (Log Meadow Loop) seemed to be well described, but the actual trail did not correspond to the description in the book. The map helped us to figure out how to take an alternate route that was pretty good and took us past most of the sights we would have seen.Another hike (North Grove Loop) that was rated as easy (suitable for young children) turned out to be short but also a pretty steep climb, and I'm not sure that a 6 year old would have done well on this trail.Despite these disappointments, the other hikes we took in the park were excellent and well described in the book.I think the editor would have done better to put maps with the hikes instead of at the end.It is possible that some of the problems we had in the first hike were due to changes in the trail that had been made since the book was published. We met another lost couple who couldn't find the trail with a different Sequoia book."},{"Title":"50 Best Short Hikes in Yosemite and Sequoia/Kings Canyon","review":"I only visted Yosemite.

The history section on Yosemity was very good, but the hiking trail inforamtion is better presented in other books."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"I thought this book was really good. It's a little slow at the beginning, but it explains a lot about the rest of the book. I really never wanted to put this book down, but with only 15 minutes a day in class, it took a while to read. It was very suspenseful, but in a good, realistic way. Most books have severely dramatized situations, but with this one, it was a very descriptive scenario. The book kept me guessing the whole time. Just when I thought I had figured something out, it went a whole new direction with a whole new twist. In one part it gets a little gross, because the main character is pushed up against a dead body while she's caught in a whirlpool. But if you like suspenseful books, then I highly suggest this one."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"This book is based on a 1995 ferry accident that happened in Malaysia. By interjecting the main character, Emily, an American living in Malaysia on board, we get to see what it was like for the lucky ones- those who could swim. Emily, angry at her parents for bringing her around the world while they try to heal the sick children of third world countries, decides to go visit her uncle, who is visiting a nearby island. She never suspects the ferry ride won't make it to the other shore. The book will disgust you at times, thinking of all the time wasted to get to people like Elizabeth, or how people act in the face of living or dying. You can't be so sure with this one how the story will end."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"Everyone in my family enjoyed this book. With prose that is both beautiful and realistic, it interwines the story of the internal struggles of an adolescent girl with her struggle to survive in the sea. Over a couple of days, we watch Emily grow from a child to a brave and generous individual whose problem-solving, decisions, and courageousness are critical to her own life and the lives of others. From the moment she entered the water, we were constantly on the edge of our seats waiting to see what new challenges she would face at the next turn and whether she would survive. Along the way we learned so much about Indonesia (language, customs, and geography) and the Muslim religion. My 6th grader read this book on her own, while my 2nd grader and I read it together. It is a wonderful choice for a book club and a great gift idea."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"My daughter and I each read this book in one sitting. It is simply too good to put down. The plot, the imagery and the character development are extraordinary. What's more, this novel transmits wonderful values of tolerance and true heroics. When's the last time you read a book about a teenage girl that was at once realistic (her moodiness, dissatisfaction with life) and idealistic? I love that my daughter might easily identify with such a character and perceive altruism as a fact of life. Also, in this time of anti-immigrant sentiment, this book lovingly reminds us of the value of people quite different from ourselves. You'd never know right off that the book has these effects because it disguises all of this in ONE GREAT READ! It will be the birthday gift for all our friends this year!"},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"OVERBOARD is the kind of book that is relatively short, but goes on a little too long. It relates the story of a teenage girl who must figure out how to survive after an Indonesian ferry she's been traveling capsizes.The plotting in the first half is terrific -- with excellent middle school vocabulary; accurate characterization of the protagonist, and well-timed pacing of story. The second half seems to go on and on though with this girl swimming and swimming and swimming (more than she would if she were in an Ironman competition). The rising action and ensuing complications towards her finding safety eventually seem over-plotted and highly coincidental. In trying to write a nail-biter, I'm afraid the author took us too far; the mounting tension slowly becomes increasing frustration.The exposition at the top of the novel works, but by the end I believe the reader would have been hoping for more character development for Emily (the protagonist).On the positive side, Ms. Fama writes very well; her turn-of-phrase allows the reader the develop some real momentum. I enjoyed the book, however, I don't believe I'll come back for a second read.I do recommend this book with no reservations."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"Review On Over Board\\"It won't open. This is what it's like to die, but don't worry it will be quick.\\" That's the voice of Emily's (the main character) mind as she is trapped in a locker of a sinking boat. This book is called Over Board By Elizabeth Frame. This book is about Emily and a young boy she finds floating in the ocean. They go through so much like being attacked by sharks to escaping a whirlpool!\\"You may not have the strength to keep going but, a little voice inside you says to keep going even if you die trying.\\" That's not from the book, but it's my opinion that goes through my head as I read what Emily and Isman have to do to stay alive. So I think the theme is strength because they need the strength to keep on going. It may be hard, but just think of the ones who care.There are two main characters. Emily and Isman. Emily is eleven and she was crossing to Indonesian Sea to see family when the boat over flows with people and sinks. Isman is a six year old who Emily finds in the sea. His parents and sibling died. There are also Richard and Catherin who cared and watched over Emily when they were fighting for their live's. Then later in the book Emily finds Isman and they drift away from Richard and Catherin. They later find someone dies. I'm no going to tell you who dies because I want you to find out and read Over Board.There is not a place; the whole book is mainly in the Indonesian sea. Where Isman and Emily fight for their life.Finally, if you like sad, scary, adventure books this is for you."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"This book is worth anyone's time. You learn about culture and religon (*grin*). The main character sounds like a lot of teenagers today (I know because I am one). They often feel sorry for themselves and are selfish. The main character is like this but under all of that she's strong. Through this expierence she becomes mature.Very good book. I read it a long time ago but it is still fresh in my memory."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"Overboard is an excellent book. It is filled with suspense, it makes you want to never stop reading, and more! It is about a girl, Emily, who moves to Indonisia because her parents are doctors and came to help people in need. So Emily, one day gets a phone call from her Uncle, and after she hung up, she fell asleep, and in the morning couldn't find it because it was somewhere lost in her sleepng bag. So by the time her parents needed to answer an emergency call to save someones life, they couldn't fund it, so someone died because they didn't get the phone call on time. Then Emily's parents got mad at her, so she ran away and got on a fairy, because she was going to her uncles, which she was going to go in a few days anyway. On the fairy ride, Emily meets a newlywed couple, Catherine and Michael, who watch over her so she wont get lost, and to comfort her. Emily also meets a little indonision boy, Isman. Then, all of a sudden, the boat starts to tip, then sinks, and goes overboard, and everyone gets dumped in the water, and some die. Emily goes in the water, and has a hard time surviving, and goes through many obstacles. But you will have to read this book to find out what happens to her!"},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"It's easy to understand why Emily is angry at her parents and depressed, so her running away doesn't come as a big shock to the reader. What happens after she gets on the boat that's supposed to take her to meet her uncle is where things get tense. What this novel does is it shows the triumph of the human spirit while it puts into perspective just what the important things in life are."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"Emily lives in Sumatra with her do-gooder physician parents. She hates where she lives because she feels isolated and unwanted. After a tift with her parents she \\"runs away\\" to a nearby island to visit her uncle, but the boat she is on sinks.Emily is stuck in the warm water, fighting for her life. She comes across Ishman, a young Muslim boy who leaves his fate in the hands of Allah. Emily fights to save both of them, fighting against fatigue, exhaustion, dehydration, and starvation.This book is about hope and the fight to stay alive. It is a reminder why we should never give up...even when the cards are stacked against us."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"Overboard is a great book for young children and adults because it teaches all families a lesson about faith.In this story 14 year old Emily lives with her mom (Olivia) and her father (James) in Indonesia.The conflict is Emily almost drowns trying to swim back to land.The events are:Emily tries to teach a lady who is suffering how to swim,The lady drowns herself,Emily busts out of the locker."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"This story is a great book for children around 4 or 5 years old.It teaches children about faith.In this story 14 year old Emily lives with her mom(Olivia) and her father(James) in Indonesia.The problem is she gets locked in a locker on a ferry.She teaches a lady how to swim,the lady drowns, Emily gets out of the locker."},{"Title":"Overboard","review":"This story is a great book for children around 4 or 5 years old.It teaches children about faith.In this story 14 year old Emily lives with her mom(Olivia) and her father(James) in Indonesia.The problem is she gets locked in a locker on a ferry.She teaches a lady how to swim,the lady drowns, Emily gets out of the locker."},{"Title":"Clare and Francis","review":"This is one of the most beautifully illustrated children's books I've ever seen and I've been a librarian for over 30 years. Few books bring tears to my eyes and this did. A treasure!"},{"Title":"Clare and Francis","review":"This is the most gorgeous children's books I've ever seen--the illustrations are rendered like classic iconography. The text is decent as well, though the real reason to have this book is not to read it but to look at it."},{"Title":"Clare and Francis","review":"Clare And Francis by Guido Visconti is an incredible, beautifully illustrated picture book about the lives of both Francis and Clare, two people who were born in Assisi, Italy around the year 1200. Although both Francis and Clare were born into wealthy families, both of them deliberately chose to live lives of dedicated poverty. Francis preached to people throughout towns and villages, while Clare cared for the sick in the convent of San Damiano. Both Francis and Clare wholeheartedly embraced spirituality and Christian faith, and their lives set an example in the Middle Ages that is remembered down to this very day. Stunning, colorful illustrations by Bimba Landmann in an offshoot of medieval painting style help make Clare And Francis an unforgettable biographical portrait, one which is meant to be treasured and shared between readers of all ages and generations."},{"Title":"Clare and Francis","review":"I agree with all that has been said about the pictures in this book from the professional and reader reviews. The reading is easy and I am sure that children will enjoy having it read to them and third or fourth graders will enjoy reading it for themselves. But given the beauty of the pictures, even those older than 9 years will enjoy this book. It starts with a short summary of Francis' and Clare's lives told by 24 small pictures on two pages, each with one or two sentence explanations. Having read several other books on Saint Francis of Assisi, I read the book with the question in my mind, \\"What is the basic theme or message of Saint Francis life that the author is trying to convey in what she includes, emphasizes or minimizes?\\" I would say that it is this: that Saint Francis, who always gave to the poor even in his care free days, loved God and, as a result, the poor, the animals, those with little and those with much power in his day, and even his enemies in foreign lands. Francis loved them with God's love. And God's love revealed through Francis for others drew them: women, such Clare, his old neighbors, the poor and even the animals to God. It is not surprising to learn that the author of this wonderful story, while born in Italy, and after receiving a degree in Literature and Philosophy is now, with his wife, directing a village school in India."},{"Title":"Clare and Francis","review":"Agreed that this is probably the most beautiful children's book ever. For that alone, it's worth buying. There are many, many stories about St. Francis of Assisi (not so many about St. Clare) but this one stands heads and shoulders above the rest!"},{"Title":"Clare and Francis","review":"A beautiful children's book which I gave to my grandchildren at Christmas. I also showed them photos that we took of Assisi where Clare and Francis lived."},{"Title":"LIGHT AND THE DARK","review":"C.P. Snow (1905-1980) is probably best remembered for having postulated, in 1959, the existence of a growing gulf between the sciences and the humanities (\\"The Two Cultures\\"). A physicist who later successfully served in government, he also wrote a very interesting, albeit stylistically simple, sequence of self-contained novels (\\"Strangers and Brothers\\") roughly stretching from the 1920s to the 1960s, whose narrator, Lewis Eliot progresses from rather humble origins in an English provincial town to law school, a practice in law, a fellowship at Cambridge and government work during and after the second world war. Eliot is a decent, human and sympathetic character who is, at first, Snow\`s device for exploring for exploring more brilliant or outstanding characters -in this respect Eliot sometimes reminds one of a more intelligent and senstive version of Conan Doyles' Dr. Watson. Snow\`s novels quickly become more concerned with exploring routine struggles for power and influence in the changing English society of his time.\\"The Light and the Dark\\", written just after the second World War (1947), is a tale about one of Eliot\`s friends, Roy Calvert, a brilliant young linguist at Cambridge who suffers from maniac-depressive bouts. There are four parts to the novel. In the first part, set circa 1935, we meet Roy as a graceful and gifted graduate student and see how he moves through a slough of despondency, rises to a peak of reckless, destructive behaviour and then is impelled to a blindingly harsh and absoluteless cheerless intuition about reality. At the same time, Snow regales us with an excellent portrayal of the academic manoeuvres in the closed college world which culminate in a fellowship for Roy. In the second part, we watch as Roy\`s (and Eliot\`s) hopes that he can overcome his condition are dashed, how other of Roy\`s most intimate friends gradually become aware of his problem and their futile attempts to help him. This is set aginst a fascinating background of how torn and polarized pre-War Britain was on the subject of Nazi Germany, to the point of setting lifetime friends and members of the same family against each other. In the third part, Roy himself spends some time in Germany and, to the horror of his friends, is quite sympathetic to the nazi regime and even invites Eliot to Berlin in the forelorn hope of converting him. War breaks out, and we get a very interesting glimpse of how part of English academia was coopted into the war effort. Roy himself is initially drafted into Intelligence while Eliot is concerned with planning and becomes involved in fighting against a strategic decision to escalate air bombing. By this time, Roy has reached the end of his tether and when Eliot unsuspectingly and bitterly mentions that the highest casualty rates will be amongst airmen, Roy requests his own transfer and is killed on a bombing mission.The book tends more to the dark than to the light, as befits the years that are portrayed, but the author exercises a quiet control to prevent the novel from slipping into sentimentality or pampleteering and strives to presents some sort of balance between the light and the dark. Roy himself is a complex character who deeply marks those who know him, who know that they can never be or feel the same way after they have fallen under the spell of this gifted, charming, proud man unsuccessfully struggling to master his own illness."},{"Title":"LIGHT AND THE DARK","review":"A terribly bittersweet, hauntingly powerful novel about Roy Calvert, first seen in \\"Time of Hope\\". A manic-depressive, I think. Perhaps it was not so recognized in the 30's and early 40's when this takes place. A very memorable and sensitive portrait of the love and friendship that can exist between two heterosexual men, as it delicately portrays the compassion and caring they come to share, Roy, and Lewis Eliot, the narrator. Melancholic and sad, yet a wonderful book. Just as striking as two others, \\"Time of Hope\\" and \\"The Conscience of the Rich\\", but even more poignant. The last line could not be more perfect. Snow is a master of the human psyche and condition."},{"Title":"LIGHT AND THE DARK","review":"Perhaps the longest but not the best of the Strangers and Brothers cycle of novels, yet &#34;The Light and the Dark&#34; (1946) contains the initial germ of the idea for which Snow is best remembered, his &#34;Two Cultures&#34; observation on the gap between scientific and humanistic scholarship. One of Snow's key arguments in his original late-1950s lectures on the subject involved what he considered the scientific absurdity of WW II strategic mass bombing, supported by politicians and questioned by Britain's scientists. through his narrator, SNow tells the story of Roy Calvert, a brilliant Middle-Eastern scholar-researcher who, after flirting flagrantly with Nazi intellectuals in the late 1930a, immolates himself as a bomber pilot late in the war. His death, along with those of a disproportionate number of other air crewmen, brings the entire bombing strategy into question.One infers that like many of his characters, Calvert is based on a real person, in this case, one whom Snow apparently held in high affection. The problem with the book is that, while he keeps alluding to his charm, Snow actually describes Calvert as a cad and bounder in his relations with women and colleagues, plus a committed fascist up to the very outbreak of the war. Someone so despicable that you cannot begin to share the sorrow SNow's protagonist feels about his death in battle. It's a major failure of Snow's extraordinary narrative technique. Worth reading anyway, for its important place in the series and Snow's evolving views of society, as well as its vivid pictures of the back corridors of government in a nation absorbed in total war."},{"Title":"Best Bisexual Women's Erotica","review":"I was really surprised when I picked up this new collection of erotica. Sometims I've been disappointed by other &quot;Best Of&quot; collections. Some are great, but others I've found were fairly unspectacular and didn't feel like real collections. This one is different; the range of stories is surprising and the literary quality is well above the norm. Plus, most of the stories are unbelievably hot -- I had to read with one hand through most of it. Probably the best collection of erotica by women that I've read in a couple of years."},{"Title":"Best Bisexual Women's Erotica","review":"There are a few great stories in here, but the rest are quite mediocre, and I was surprised to find this after all the rave reviews here!

Case in point: Ally McBeal is bi-curious. I suppose thousands of men got off watching Ally tongue kiss her co-worker, Ling (soft g), and maybe a few thousand women wondered if they ought to try it, too. If this is where your interest in this book originates, I say your interest is healthy, but don't anticipate the authors within to expose their sex lives for curiosity alone. Bisexuality is not merely a fad to try on but a hot and satisfying endeavor that sticks. More importantly, the voices in this collection speak of bisexuality as normal; it's natural.

Well let's just say, we were quickly disappointed when we started reading it. We keep reading in the hope that one of the stories would be worth our while. I found most of them rather disturbing. There were several really just plain gross stories. I wouldn't even call many of them 'bisexual.' It was more like a collection of stories about gay people who either 'strayed' or cheated with someone of the opposite sex. There are several stories that mention rape, having sex in back rooms or porn theaters, or with hookers. If you want a gritty read, this could be the choice for you but if you're looking to read about steamy sex maybe you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Best Bisexual Women's Erotica","review":"My wife and I purchased this book and we weren't happy with it at all. I know that bisexual could mean guy-on-guy just as much as it could mean girl-on-girl, but we just weren't expecting it. Already, we found two stories in the book with this theme showing up and for people that have no interest in it at all, it really kills the story. Additionally, some stories are just plain boring. They work up to what could be an interesting climax, but then they just end. Some stories go into great depth setting the environment and mood, but cover the actual sexual acts in like two paragraphs. We were definitely not satisfied with the book and will have to be a lot more careful before spending money on other erotica books. I was very confused because so many people wrote positive reviews on this book. Oh well, to each their own."},{"Title":"Best Bisexual Women's Erotica","review":"It's a much needed book to show the spectrum of identities and fantasies that exist in the world.

Starting with the most basic introductory material such as &quot;how to hold the bass guitar&quot;, the book advances all the way down to things like &quot;Lydian Augmented scales in the 12th position&quot;. Besides the expected subjects (scales, modes, progressions, intervals, key signatures, etc.) there are even lessons on bass duets and general subjects like relative pitch training for your ears. The book indirectly teaches better sheet music reading by cleverly making each successive exercise more rhythmically complex as the book goes on. Of course, when you cram so much information into a single book, the material inevitably moves a bit fast (otherwise, you'd have to write the book twice as long). So my only complaint is that it's not very user-friendly as a beginner's total self-instruction book. And I know there are many who don't particulary like the typical Mel Bay methods of instruction. Still, the book is perfect if you have an instructor helping you along, or you're a moderate or advanced player who just wants to review certain sections and maybe pick up something new. I've been playing bass for over a dozen years, but I still like to occasionally review sections and play some of the exercises for practice. Despite its fast pace, the incredible span of information in this single book makes me give it 5 stars. If you had to buy just one bass book to last your whole lifetime, I recommend this one without a doubt."},{"Title":"Mel Bay's Deluxe Jazz & Rock Bass Method","review":"I've been playing for just over 20 years now.

Each section addresses an area of New Mexico and features a map and a cool old photograph. Each little chapter begins with the text of a specific sign, and then goes on to explain more about the historical background in detail. Usually there are photos included.I've kept this book in my bathroom for the last several months, and aside from the skipping around I've done with the book while travelling, I've also been reading it straight through. And it's good that way.If the book has any faults, it's that the author's style at times seems to be very similar to the style of the signs whose information he's expounding on. Also, because the entries are generally only a page or two or three long, there are sometimes more things that I'm left wanting to know. And finally, the author takes a very family-friendly tone--which is good if you're friendly, and have family, but not if you want to know about the cutting, knife-barbed belt the hermit of the Organ Mountains was wearing when he was found murdered, or if you want details on the whores of Old West-era New Mexico.Overall though, I really like this book. Keep this and Robert Julyan's \\"The Place Names of New Mexico\\" in your car on your next New Mexico roadtrip, and before too long all your friends and family will hate you and wish you'd stayed home.Seriously, they might.Or--as is often the case--they might learn something...and you might too."},{"Title":"Interpreting the Figure in Watercolor","review":"Don Andrews is reknowned for his incredible use of vibrant colors - he can mix a dozen colors together and never get mud!

One's senses are not quite peaked to the surrealistic atmosphere of battle but do have a take away of the scope of daily life. The common soldier endured more than the civilian populace realized and very few writers could convey the message of what they went through as this author.

Most of it takes place in the first few decades of the twentieth century. There is much anecdotal advice about the retail business and how it changed when chain stores arrived.

This gives a wonderful guideline for each step of the curriculum creation process. You'll get lots of advice on how to assess you students' needs, how to focus on their needs, and how to adapt textbooks to serve their learning need more effectively. I recommend this for every beginning language teacher if you haven't read this in your training already. I didn't read this until I was eight years into my career, and I wish I had been able to read it earlier."},{"Title":"Designing Language Courses: A Guide for Teachers","review":"I am not sure why English language teaching books have a penchant for boring cover designs, but sometimes they really live up to the old adage of never judging books by their covers. Kathleen Graves' \\"Designing Language Courses\\" is a case in point.The book has a clear organisation that is easily followed and takes you through a process that is clear and succinct. With a description of the framework Graves uses at the start, the rest of the book forms a logical and consistent whole with it. The chapters take you right through the whole gamut of course design from getting to your beliefs about teaching right up to evaluation. Each section is detailed, though not so much that it overloads you with it.Any unusual or specific terminology is explained throughout and there is a lot of reference to other authors and research. The book has a thorough approach to the subject, giving recommended reading suggestions at the end of each chapter.A real positive in this book is the use of sections Graves calls \\"Teachers' Voices\\". These are little sections within the chapters, (well, some are not so \\"little\\"), where working teachers give their experiences and thoughts on the aspect of course design at hand. These teachers come from a variety of professional and working backgrounds, and they provide rich input and insight. I found these to be especially valuable.One previous reviewer said they found it an unfriendly book for the user, and I have to disagree. I thought it was an immensely useful and easy to access book. I loved it and found it very interesting and very useful. I would even go so far as to say that anyone looking at course design should look at this book. Graves has done an excellent job."},{"Title":"Designing Language Courses: A Guide for Teachers","review":"I bought this book as a requirement for my Masters Program...TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language) and I was expecting to find another uninteresting textbook.

The book stresses the importance of how teachers need to take a students' needs into consideration in order to get the most out of your curriculum!

Its simple and practical and gives good insight into Jacks thought process and approach to golf shots. Given that it was first written in the 70s, it is a little bit dated but the more recently added section does give more insight into the mental aspects of golf. As ever Jack is direct, honest & assertive on his golf beliefs. Its simpler than Hogan's book which can be daunting for a beginner."},{"Title":"Golf My Way: The Instructional Classic, Revised and Updated","review":"I just loved this book and it comes straight from gut. Importance of physical endurance and how it helps long hours of golf is highlighted. Swing techniques are written reasonably well."},{"Title":"Golf My Way: The Instructional Classic, Revised and Updated","review":"If readers don't get anything else out of this book (and they surely will), they will learn that they need not hit a hook (or draw) to hit it long--and most especially accurate. Nicklaus clearly teaches that.I used to hit a \\"draw\\" myself because my teachers taught it. However, when the heat gets turned on, that \\"draw\\" will always turn into a damnedable hook, which cost me tournaments when I was young and later on money. I dumped it years ago and now use the draw only when necessary; otherwise I try to hit the ball with a fade or sometimes straight. I've lost no distance and the left side of the fairway is completely out of my game, unless I need it.Those of you just beginning to study golf will find that Hogan dumped his hook in 1946, and credits that with his great ball striking. Me too! Not by any means that I'm comparing myself to Hogan, but I say \\"me too\\" simply to second the fact that the fade is the far better shot to hit.This book is enjoyable and informative. You get the deepest insights from the greatest champion who ever drew a stick back. Take it seriously and take advantage of it."},{"Title":"Golf My Way: The Instructional Classic, Revised and Updated","review":"I thought this book was well written and gave some good insight as to why Jack played they way he did. For example, he talks about always playing approach shots with a cut opposed to a draw because if he missed he would miss less with a cut. His reasoning is well documented and described using pictures. Basically, he says that if you miss the flag 10' to the right with a cut the ball will land and stop. If you miss the flag 10' to the left with a draw the ball will continue to roll another 10' feet and you may have to get up and down depending on the size of the green.I like this book because you get logical explanations about \\"why\\" Jack did something. For example, he played tennis to strengthen his legs.There is no book in the world that will make you a great golfer over night. I think that you should read a lot of books to get different perspectives.I would also recommended:Hank Haney's Essentials of the Swing: A 7-Point Plan for Building a Better Swing and Shaping Your Shots,which give you a more mechanical perspective. For example, how your parts of your body should feel at all points of the golf swing the golf swing."},{"Title":"Golf My Way: The Instructional Classic, Revised and Updated","review":"I thought this book was well written and gave some good insight as to why Jack played they way he did.

And the chapter on what I call \\"Golf Speak\\" explained all the hook, slice, fade etc. Great book for beginner or advanced golfer. He talks my language."},{"Title":"Golf My Way: The Instructional Classic, Revised and Updated","review":"I used the original parts of this book as released by Golf Digest in the 70's and later. This book is updated and includes essential components covering all aspects of the basics and beyond. Nicklaus is excellent at describing the comprehensive components of the golf swing in general and with the various situations you'll find yourself in around the course.Jack Nicklaus isn't usually thought of as one of the all time great instructors, but his constant attention throughout his life to the game, the swing, the equipment and to instructors, means that he has a \\"Top 10\\" ability as an instructor to get the ideas across clearly, and to help you avoid pitfalls. Many instructors are just not so fully aware of the scope of the related issues. Jack had to. He had to play and his intention was to win. Nothing was left to guesswork.I find that Nicklaus' description of the full swing is essential to understanding the various points in the swing IN MOTION. He doesn't need gadgets, he uses diagrams and sketches to show you. He's always dealing with how one thing leads to another. The golf swing is not just the person, it's weight shift, the club in relation to the hands, the path of the club, and a few abstract concepts that Nicklaus is excellent at keeping clear and meaningful.I HIGHLY recommend this book to all golfers who have handicaps greater than about 2. Take these instructions, run them through 100 shots on the course and realize how a leading, proven, brilliant golfer and instructor can point out a few things that could help you. For anyone starting the game, for anyone who has reached a sticking point and can't seem to improve, and for those who want to have more fun and just hit the ball cleanly more and don't really worry about the score......all of you will gain a great deal by getting the information in this book.Women: Nicklaus deals with the game of golf and the swing from the basics onward. I've seen plenty of women golf and an really happy with the LPGA quality. Get this book and take it to the practice range and then take notes onto the course. Nicklaus has a well-balanced approach to the entire game and he communicates brilliantly. If you find something that he says doesn't quite match how you swing or something like that, at least you have bounced an idea of the all-time greatest player, and then when you talk to another instructor who can deal with you personally, you have a FAR CLEARER idea of some issues you can improve and how to deal with them. So, no, Nicklaus' book, for women, isn't 100% applicable, but I'd bet it's at least 95% applicable! His approach is so time-tested and he is very well informed about all aspects of the swing, the clubs, the variety of people's swing styles, builds, the equipment and the situations on the course that you can't go wrong here."},{"Title":"Golf My Way: The Instructional Classic, Revised and Updated","review":"I started golfing last summer with the aid of a co-worker to help get me started. Once school started back up I found myself going to the driving range much more often the he could meet me there for guidance; I knew that if I wanted my game to progress I would either need to find another trainer or turn to a book. Concidering this book is less then 20$ and a trainer can be around 100$ a session, I opted for the book.Immediatley after taking suggestions from grip, stance, swingplane, and posture my game improved immensley. My slice is now undercontrol and I get an extra 20 yrds out of my irons. The book has helpfull illustrations that really put some of the dynamics of this game into perspective.I recomend this to anyone who is trying to either start golfing or even for avid golfers who are trying to tweak there play styles and shake some bad golf habits. This book has truly been a golf blessing."},{"Title":"Golf My Way: The Instructional Classic, Revised and Updated","review":"Jack does a great job in going through his swing, and it provides quite some interesting and thought-provoking suggestions on why he did things a certain way. Nevertheless, the book is quite long to read, and in my opinion, requires already some understanding about how a golf swing works. For this, I would suggest golf newcomers to start with Ben Hogan's \\"Five lessons\\" first. Building on that one, Jack's book offers an array of options to adapt and improve your swing, doubtless."},{"Title":"Golf My Way: The Instructional Classic, Revised and Updated","review":"The reason I purchased \\"Golf my Way\\" by Jack Nicklaus--was because it was mentioned by pro golfer and recent Player's champ K.J.

When i found that our tour leader had written 'Turkish Odyssey', i immediately got a copy and used it exclusively on tour, never referring to the two i brought with me. The latter are fine if you are touring on your own and need hotel, car rental, restaurant info, etc., but 'TO' is a must if you are part of a guided tour. Most of the tour guides here use it. it answers questions tourists typically ask: education system healthcare, military service, politics, etc., besides extensive explanation and pictures of sites on the tour. Example: the guide i brought from home had two pages devoted to Ephesus, 'TO' has nineteen. if you are planning a trip to Turkey, which i highly recommend, drop a copy in your Amazon shopping cart.

The history Mr. Yenen (who I met in Cappadocia) gives was more than adequate for a casual tourist. This is in contrast to a couple of the books I bought in which I got lost. It is SO much more than a guide book -- it may be a little short on recent historical issues, but it more than makes up for with its key words and phrases in Turkish, its historical information, and its cultural information. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Turkish Odyssey: A Cultural Guide to Turkey (4th Printing)","review":"My husband and I found this book invaluable preparing for and during our recent trip to Turkey. The historical and cultural perspective provided by this book increased our enjoyment of this extraordinary country. The author's detailed overview of Turkey, past and present, gives the reader first hand knowledge that would be difficult to obtain elsewhere. The book includes many special discoveries (eg.small towns off the beaten track but near often over crowded tourist destinations to capture the essence of the warm and welcoming people). In addition, Serif Yenen is a highly regarded guide of his country (for 18 years), leads an organiztion of 1100 licensed guides, and writes a weekly column for a Turkish newspaper. I also recommend the CD - it's very useful and easy to use."},{"Title":"Turkish Odyssey: A Cultural Guide to Turkey (4th Printing)","review":"This book is well written and easy to read with ample photos and documentation.

Great overview/background book."},{"Title":"Turkish Odyssey: A Cultural Guide to Turkey (4th Printing)","review":"Serif Yenen has created an invaluable guide for anyone who wants to learn about the history and culture of this fascinating country. While he provides the reader a thorough introduction to the long history of Turkey and an intimate orientation to the life and culture of modern-day Turks, the greatest value the author contributes is his palpable love for his country. The in-depth descriptions of the many interesting sites in Turkey would be an asset to any tourist who wishes to learn as much as possible from a visit to Turkey.

Guide Books tell you where to go to see what has been.This book shares with the reader what Turkey and her Peoples are today and maybe why.

I found the insights to the Government helpful in better understanding Turkey. The geographical descriptions help me understand the issues and beauty of the the Turkish landscape. The cultural issues for rural and cities, economic challenges, religious tolerances are presented and provided me with a perspective that not all the People of Turkey are of one mind, but that all are People of Turkey.Nothing is better than visiting to achieving understanding and this book is a primer for understanding, accepting and really enjoying Turkey and the Turkish People."},{"Title":"Turkish Odyssey: A Cultural Guide to Turkey (4th Printing)","review":"I have been to Turkey and enjoy reading about it.

It is well written and complex, in plot and detail. However, I have only read about half, so the following opinion may change. I have just this to say at the moment - WHAT IS THIS WOMAN'S PROBLEM WITH THE IRISH? If the subjects of this acrimony were African-American or Jewish the book would never have made it to print!

However, I gave up reading Accordion Crimes at page 140. This book is essentially a collection of short, ethnic vignettes about successive owners of a green accordion.

And yet it had rave reviews on the back cover. Far too much info on accordions, their types, history, etc. I don't care.

We like to believe that if we work hard and have good intentions, then essentially good things will happen to us and our loved ones. Annie Proulx's masterful cultural history of America challenges such a sense of security. By following the travails of an accordian from its 18th century Italian creator through a succession of owners in different parts of the United States and Canada, Proulx forces us to rethink our value of hard work and success. She effectively removes the myth that good things happen to the industrious and good of heart. With this understanding, Proulz confronts her readers with developing a new understanding of behavior. If one is not rewarded with health, wealth or love by their hard work, why bother. The answer becomes simply work for work itself. The satisfying moments of Proulx's world are those brief flickering moments when hard work displays its self in its own grandeur, appreciated by its creator for his own enjoyment. &quot;Accordian Crimes&quot; is a prime example of such workmanship. The finely crafted prose and carefully researched scenes are a joy to read, even as its message is unsettling"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Eggs fried in motor oil and cases of increasingly stupid vegetable matter with a taste for battery acid masquerading as humanity...all of who own and variously misuse the green accordion over a hundred years. A nihilistic attitude combine with a misanthropic view of the human condition to give a realistic Greek tragedy as a set of serial short stories. When you are done reading it , you feel like you have been run over by a truck. I'd call it great original shock writing."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I am stunned that so many people don't see what a jewel this book is. I found it breathtaking, masterful, moving, and far superior to most contemporary American fiction. It's tremendously demanding, not simple entertainment (though it is entertaining in parts), and an important commentary on American ethnic life during a very turbulent century. Most writers to this page have objected to the weirdness, the sadness, the misfortunes that seem to pile up . . . But I think the author meant all of this more metaphorically than literally (though it must be true in part that Proulx enjoys a twisted tale for its own sake). Notice how their actions and characters and situations sometimes invite their fates, how their pride and avarice destroy them, how their believe in the &quot;American dream&quot; undoes them. There's so much to think about here--the story is smaller than the ideas behind it. And even if you don't care to do that, there's enough brilliant historical detail, perfect rendering of place and time, exquisite portrayal of emotion (the pain of losing one's homeland and the complete entropy that surrounds the immigrant to this nutty country rings so true--remember the Polish woman who cried into the soup pot, it had been so many years since she'd had the ingredients to make her beloved traditional soup? In one short phrase, Proulx created this entire scene in all its significance.) It reminds me a little of the surrealism in books like &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&quot; whose unlucky characters suffer all sorts of strange twists of fate, but the sense of place and history and personality transcends the facts. These are the things I loved about this book, and I hope that those who expect just a story will go back and read it for much more than that--the rewards are there."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I cannot understand not loving this book. It is a series of short-stories centering on a green accordian. Each story is excellent standing alone, but you find that it is weaved into a whole, as we follow the green accordian from Italy, France, to America. The research that went into the music (the names of musicians and bands she uses are not fictional, i.e., in the Tejano music genre for example) is extraordinary. The meticulous and spot on characterization, and description of mundane things that really make up our lives - these are hallmarks of Proulx. Yes, these are lives which are often sad, but hey guys, life is sad. Annie Proulx always writes exactly the way life is, the way she sees it, but nevertheless, it still has beauty, still has worth, as does her writing. If you are looking for a fairy-tale, you should never read Annie Proulx, because you won't find it here. Instead, you will find the best novelist currently in America. Always carefully researched, factual, down-to-earth, her characters are never glorified, but just like you see everywhere. Oh, excuse me, you think you are not like this. Probably right, but then you are incapable of judging great fiction if you do not give this a 5 star review."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"This beautiful and haunting novel, told with lyrical language, follows the fortunes of an accordion, focusing on each character for as long as they have the accordion in their possession. It is \\"the instrument of unsuccessful men, of poor immigrants and failures\\" and passes through the hands of a cast of unlucky characters. Even the incidental characters have drama; one man's wife is killed by inhaling a shrimp while laughing.Brought to America by its Sicilian maker in 1890, the accordion survives a century and traverses a continent. The instrument travels from Italy to New York, the Midwest (in the hands of Germans), Texas (Mexicans), Maine/Canada (French), Louisiana (black slaves from Nantes) and Chicago (Poles). It plays a central role in folk music all over the world, but the novel is not so much about accordions as a tale of the migrants and the dispossessed. There is a need to record the history and stories of those whose history is not part of the established cannon and this is done through their music which evokes memories and fills the resentful silence just as it fills the pages of the novel.As the migrants struggle to fit in with the American culture, they are tempted to deny their own ethnicity. Taunted for their roots, accents, language and custom, they reject their heritage. One character laments that \\"to be foreign, to be Polish, not to be American, was a terrible thing and all that could be done about it was to change one's name and talk about baseball.\\" The Americans treat the Italians (and Sicilians whom they consider the same) \\"like cheap shoes. They buy cheap, they walk long and hard, when the shoes are worn out they throw them aside and get others. Shiploads of these shoes come every day.\\" This racism continues through the migrants themselves so that the question is asked, have they learned nothing by their experience? Cultures combine and evolve, which should lead to a great sumptuousness and ethnical diversity. This cultural wealth is reflected in the vibrant prose, but often the points of distinction are \`watered down' to blandness, however, which is evident in everything, even cooking.There is a suggestion that it is hard to recall roots and connections after leaving home; \\"Wasn't that the old evil thing, brothers and sisters losing each other? Wasn't it the old, old thing, families torn up like scrap paper, the home place left and lost forever?\\" It is hard to trace people's roots, especially if they kept no records.The music belongs to certain people - those who brought it with them. One man wants to play the music because he is infected by it, but feels that he can never be as good as those who have learned it from birth. To others, ethnicity is a commodity to be exploited. One musician is told how to play to a crowd. \\"Most people don't understand it, but one song gives a nice ethnic flavor. That's what we want to stress, ethnic flavor. Ethnic music is not that old-time stuff anymore. These days everybody is ethnic, might as well make money on it.\\"The narrative device echoes a musical composition, frequently jumping forward to tell how someone's story turns out in quick sentences, and then returning to the story. Chapters are punctuated with pictures of different styles of accordion. The music is the story, just as jazz is \\"confused music, the melody, if there was one, deliberately hidden in braided skeins of rhythm.\\" And as things are turned around, this is the nature of American where \\"the natural order of the world is reversed and the old learn from children.\\"Annie Proulx raises issues of displacement and belonging, examining the sacrifices that are made in the name of progress. She has some hard-hitting points to make, asking what progress has been made since the Civil Rights Movement of the \`60s.Accordion Crimes is a collection of sad stories of migrants trying to overcome adversity. They are linked by economical, deceptively metaphor-laden prose which forms precise images. It is a rich and detailed novel; noisy, huge, energetic, seething and idiosyncratic, which demands immediate re-reading."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Salty, ethnic, real, are words I read in reviews of this book. They are all true. Superbly researched, as is usual with all of Annie Proulx's work. This is a book of short stories, with interesting ethnic characters at different periods in the end of the nineteenth and twentieth century.This is largely a sad tale of the futility of life, or if you wish you may call it a book on the persistence of the human spirit despite of the futility of life and therefor its triumph. You will have to look hard and reflect quiet a bit till you get to the triumph bit thoughAnnie Proulx is wonderful storyteller, she sets the scene beautifully through her excellent research of the background material. Her characters are very skillfully developed, and there is always an element of suspense, even when she does tell us up front what eventually happens. Best of all is Annie Proulx's use of language and words to weave vivid images of people, places and situations."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Enjoyed \`The Shipping News' and so thought I would try more of E. Annie Proulx's work. Te idea behind this book, tracing the history of an accordion through the lives of its owners was a really interesting one and, in particular, seemed to allow Ms. Proulx to comment on the immigrant experience in America. Particularly telling is a passage not far from the end when, after we have seen much prejudice against all sorts of cultural groups during the novel, we read &quot;it's not the same as when our grandparents come over; they were white, they had guts, a good work ethic&quot;. Unfortunately, it seems people will always find reasons to justify prejudice against another group.While the depictions of the lives of the people in this novel are quite vividly drawn, and often incredibly depressing as they try to adjust to the culture and circumstances around them, it does drag occasionally. Indeed, there are times when the accordion itself seems to go missing, which is frustrating. However, waiting for the revelation to occur which concludes the book kept me interested. I am glad I finished because, while it is a hard read, the ideas and the lives of the characters challenged me to think about my own life and attitudes. It will take some time, but ultimately it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I thought that this was much better than The Shipping News. Much more complex."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Once again, Ms. Proulx has created an extraordinary American tale using an inanimate object (inthis case, a hand-made green accordion instead of sailor's knots) to tie her characters together. It isnecessary to pay close attention while reading this book, as the characters change each time theaccordion takes on new ownership. Although the story starts in Italy, where the instrument is made,it makes its way across the sea to New Orleans on to Maine and Quebec, Mississippi, Chicago andelsewhere. The owners are a multitude of immigrants as diversified as the places to which theaccordion goes. Reading this book is a cultural (and geographical!) learning experience-a forayinto the darker, aspects of how America mistreats its foreign &eacute;migr&eacute;s and how they, in turn, mistreatone another"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Annie Proulx is as master craftsman (craftsperson?) with words. Her sentences are magnificant and her dialog intricate and effective. This book, however, lacks a certain plot &quot;glue&quot; which it needs to hold it together. In &quot;The Shipping News&quot;, one really comes to know the characters. This is not the case here. While each of the book's short stories is interesting, one finishes the book with the sense of leaving the table before dinner was complete"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I just couldn't finish this one. Life is too short and there are too many other deserving books out there. This was a book club choice and the members of the club that finished it thought it was a real downer By reading the other reviews on this book I feel good I'm not the only one who couldn't finish it. After giving up on Accordian Crimes I was going to give up on Annie Proulx but it sounds like from the reviews I should read Shipping News."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Like &quot;berniebo2&quot; (last critic), I have enjoyed Proulx's past writing immensely. The Shipping News and Postcards were wonderful novels. The premise of this book has promise- tracing an accordian's journeys through time and owners, giving the reader a sense of the many cultures within American life. But the bottom line was that the book was too wordy, too long, and not very compelling. I couldn't identify well with the characters even in the abstract. If you want to be exposed to a story with this same fascinating theme- only much cleaner- see &quot;The Red Violin&quot; in VHS or DVD. It, too, traces the path of a musical instrument (a violin)though many owners and countries. However, the pace is much swifter and the characters are more engaging."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"This book was so disjointed that I quit halfway through. The concept of the accordion through time was interesting, but I cared nothing about any of the characters except the original owner of the accordion. I had to make myself read the book, so I quit. The Shipping News was much better."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"After reading The Shipping News for our book club, and reading a synopsis of Accordian Crimes, our book club was enthusiastic about another of Ms. Proulz's books. While Shipping News carried off its story line with beautifully written prose, interesting and well developed characters, and a plot, I felt that Accordion Crimes had little fluid writing, you never got to know or feel anything for her characters, and her story line was very disjointed and choppy.I started this book enthused about the idea that it was written like a series of connected short stories, with an interconnecting theme of following the accordian through it's life. This was a VERY DISAPPOINTING NOVEL that I never would have finished had I not been reading it for a book club. There is too much good literature to waste time on something this mediocre.However, I'd highly recommend Shipping News to anyone who did not like this book. They are very different, and what this book lacks, Shipping News has in abundance."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"The premise sounded interesting: following the accordian through a series of owners from all walks of life. But the characters were extremely uninteresting. I didn't mind the book's darkness, as other reviewers did, because I really didn't care at all what happened to any of the characters, tragic or otherwise. But it's not enough that it's boring... Proulx' writing style is so frustrating. One paragraph might be a single sentence, going on and on, through myriad descriptive phrases, punctuated with endless commas, so that, by the end of the sentence, you have completely lost the point. Then the next paragaph is a collection of short thoughts. Single phrases. Broken into sentences.

Her frequent asides hint at the fullness of the story but each scene is so quick, so flitting that I found it difficult to engage any of the characters, save for the builder of the accordion. Each of these 50 page chapters could easily have been expanded into a separate novel making for a series of novels about the Accordion but I'm sure that her publisher wouldn't have wanted to take that much of a risk on a series of books about a musical instrument."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"First, let me say that I probably can't come up with 5 books in my life that I didn't finish once I started (I'm a finisher).

The problem as noted by those that gave it a few stars was \\"who cares?\\" I didn't care for the accordians, people or anything else as everything was so forgettable - as I plodded along I'm asking myself \\"why am I wasting my time here?\\" and then eventually I must have picked up something else and truly did forget about it.

Unfortunately, this novel was so different in style that it was a complete disappointment.The story follows the history of an accordian as it changes ownership over the years. The concept is a tried and true one(as illustrated in &quot;Hitty, Her First Hundred Years&quot; by Fields), but this book does it no justice. Each of the owners meet their demise or a disaster in horrible ways. I, personally, was not ready for such violence and would not have finished this novel if it wasn't for the book group.

None of us had any idea that her mother loved Lawrence Welk so much that she insisted that her two daughters learn to play in order to entertain family and friends."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Accordian Crimes is a wildly complex concoction by Annie Proulx that starts off amazingly strong, but starts to lag severely in the second half. When I first finished with the book, I was more than a little impressed, but as I've reflected on it for a week or so, my admiration has diminished somewhat. Reading much like a collection of short stories, the book is comprised of vigettes that are loosely tied together by an accordian that appears in each. The first 3 stories are like firecrackers going off in your ear. The struggles and tough breaks of the immigrants featured in these tales are startling and very compelling. The book's main focus is on examing how the ethnicities of immigrants play a part in the their new lives in America. However, the further we get into the book, the smaller the role of ethnicity and the more bland the storytelling. Of course the author is hinting at the idea that ethnicity dissipates over time, but that does not change the fact that the last few stories are quite difficult to get through. I think most readers will find their enthusiasm for the novel dissipating along with the the character's ethnicities."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"&#34;Accordion Crimes&#34; This is a funny book, although some of the events are gruesome they are presented in a humorous way.

The quotation, \\"More inhumanity has been done by man himself than any other of nature's causes.\\" I gave it four stars, because I found the human suffering in the book difficult to read."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Someone gave me &quot;Accordion Crimes&quot; for a gift because I play the accordion. After reading the nasty and brutal first chapter I put the book down, but the person who gave it to me asked me how I liked it, so I had to pick it up again. On second reading I reversed my judgement-- It's a wonderful book. The trick is that the people aren't the characters, the accordions are. The flawed and prejudiced human characters are merely vehicles for transmitting accordion music. The people never quite understand the nature of the treasure they are holding (like the thousand dollar bills hidden inside the little green buttonbox), because they let their own prejudices get tangled up in their music even though the music itself transcends human constructed boundaries. &quot;Accordion Crimes&quot; together with the recording &quot;Planet Squeezebox&quot; would make a nice set since it would give the reader a chance to actually hear the amazing music this book is about"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Take heart, undecided readers. There are paragraphs and scenarios in this book that you will go back to again and again because they are so marvelous, so rich. I literally laughed for 20 minutes at the fool who gave his wife a surprise party when she was pre-menstrual and looking like hell. Her subtle chiding of him and the fire brigade leaving in the middle of the night were some of the funniest truths to be written in a long time.The travails of the accordian's disparate owners were sad. And all the while, I thought of a most appropro notion: if only the instrument could talk!A wonderful read, one that makes me glad of my own life."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I had been encouraged to read work by Annie P, and this, unfortunately, was my first attempt. Really horrific novel, and truly mediocre writing. The plot meandered and the characters were barely sketched with a thin pencil. I would have enjoyed a thorough description of each person, say the three Germans in the beginning, for instance, and for her to stay with them and develop them a little. Instead she flits from character to character like a mosquito grabbing an evening meal in a teensy bit of blood and then flits along to the next victim of her characterization. I won't bother with anything further by this author, as I felt this booked was a half - witted attempt at giving a literary view of an accordion's life, but instead it was a mish-mash of heathens, misfits, murderers, thieves, liars, adulterers, poor victims. She seems to enjoy picking on many races - italians, germans, creole negroes, texans ... it is really awful. Don't waste your time, much less your money or your gray matter on this very, very, very bad novel."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Recommended by my daughter; wonderful book.

The people who own and love accordians all come across as losers. This made me depressed."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"This book is quite long,over 400 pages. It's not that good, but neither is it that bad. This writer is more than a bit morbid and seeme to like writing about rough, coarse characters, the outcasts of society. She seems to like to offend the sensibilities. However, there is some beauty, some joy, some nobility in this existance. This writer doesn't seem to think so.The book is in parts very comical, fun, other sections are boring and repetitious. The book is divided into eight chapters set in different states among differemt ethnic groups. The time period is from the late 1800s until shortly before the present, a period of about 100 years. The green accordion ties the book and its characters together. In a way this book reminds me somewhat of \\"Montana Gothic.\\"The story begins when a man from Sicily builds the green accordion with the best materials he can find. He plans to move from this poor island to America where he feels he will do well, teaching and making accordions, working as a musician or work in that field. His wife gets very sick, can't go so he leaves with his eleven year old son. Instead of going to New York as he had planned, he allows a friend to talk him into moving to New Orleans. Bad mistake. He is arrested and killed with a group of other Italians. His young son drifts away and is killed in South America. An Indian shoots him in the throat. Most of the characters die in different ways. This author seems to be obsessed with death. Macabre. As the books on the characters deteriorate more and more.A black man, who ends up with the accordian, is murdered by another black man for some gold he had on his person. The murderer also takes the accordion.The second story is about three Germans who land in Iowa to become farmers and do o.k. Two die at age 64. The last living one decides to regain his youth and manhood by having an operation done by a quack doctor; he dies from blood poisoning. Along comes the depression and sons and daughters lose money and land. A grandson is born, a good businessman, gets back all the land, goes on a vacation to Yellowstone and falls into a hot spring. A Mexican who buys the accordion is bit by a black widow spider.The writer goes through the pedigrees of these characters, their backgrounds, as much about them as she feels the reader should know, plus how some of their lives turn out in coming years. The book is interesting in part but most die such horrible deaths.One character runs away from France to get away from a night club fire where two women he has made pregnant are burned to death. He arrives in Quebec, marries, has six kids, deserts, the kids are dumped into a childrens home.Another chapters tells about a teen age girl whose arms are cut off due to a freak accident. This book is also filled up with this type of incidents. A baby girl, born the child of a married man, her half sister is 31 years old, falls from a bar counter, is hospitalized, then dies. A sheepherder, far up in the mountains, obtains the green accordion, puts it aside to fix it, comes back to it, a snake is under the accordion, bites the man, the man dies alone, he is found turned black months after his death. The green accordion drifts through many lives.So goes it. Ghastly.As I said before, the writing is good in parts, flows well, but this is not the type of book for the squeamish or those who like happy endings and uplifting stories. But for those who like deep, dark, depressing stories that are very weird will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"This is an ambitious novel of Americana told through the device of an accordion brought to New Orleans in 1890 by a Sicilian immigrant.The book is peopled with a huge variety of colorful characters, and the immigrant experience of Italians, Africans, Germans, Mexicans, French, Polish and Irish people are depicted with her skillful social perception, outstanding dialog and overflowing images of the absurdities, chance circumstances and cruelties of their lives.Each of her people die grim and violent deaths, and live small and hate-full lives.

ACCORDION CRIMES, by any other author, would have been cited an unqualified success, but Proulx has spoiled her legion of fans with her other books that intensively dissect characters whose lives she unravels in an inimitable way. In ACCORDION CRIMES all her gifts as a writer are intact but we lack a set of characters about whom we care. This book is more of a Canterbury Tales or a Thousand and One Nights with the unifying presence being that of an accordian passing from hand to hand among a fascinating but essentially unrelated group of emigrants. Proulx's immensely satisfying ability to inform us in detail about the most obscure subjects (such as the making and functioning of an accordion) alone satisfies the reader to stay with her journey from century to century. If there is a unifying element here it is the very heartbeat of the Americanization of foreign emigrants. And after all, we all are just that, at varying lengths of living here! A good read, if not up to Proulx's own high standards."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"In Accordion Crimes, Proulx wonderfully pulls together a cross-section of America for a hundred years to the present in interwoven short stories about the people whose lives intersect with a handmade accordion brought from Sicily to make its creator's fortune. The stories often end in the death of the current accordion owner which gives us in a dramatic way a sense that our own death will be as distinctively our own and as inevitable as the deaths of her characters. Instead of a great sentimentalized abstraction, Proulx shows that death is as ever-present as life, is the architect of life. In this book, even the accordion dies, slipping gracefully through its ages of usefulness, to disuse, to abandonment. This is a wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone who has been starved for REAL fiction as I have. Proulx is the real thing on a large scale. To those who were depressed by the book, I suggest taking a close look at their own lives because it seems to me they are wasting their time looking for meretricious comforts and have allowed their sensibilities to be lulled by too many soothing professional lies."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I, like many readers, came to Ms. Proulx after reading her much-acclaimed \\"Shipping News,\\" and was delightfully surprised that she switches gears completely and successfully with each new novel. The plot of Accordian Crimes, if you can call it that, is written within the same vein as several other films and novels of the nineties. The premice: the author follows a single object through its lifespan--proving that the lives of our possessions are oftentimes more interesting than our own.The green accordian of the title comes to the New World in the hands of an Italian musician. Both find themselves in New Orleans, itself an interesting melting-pot backdrop and initial setting. Proulx then follows the instrument through generation of immigrants: Italian, German, French-Canadian, Polish. Her prose is astounding and her language and history well-researched and authentic.Most of the immigrant groups come across as very unrefined, but all are linked through their desire to preserve their cultural heritage through music. And the accordian--one of the most ridiculed of all instruments--is the desired musical means.There is a twist to the ending which I found unnecessary, but all in all I found this book very engaging. I particularly recommend it to those interested in glimpsing a bit of the various groups that would leave their footprints across America, or what the United States was like before mass culture became the norm."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"It is my favourite Annie Proulx trait: her brief asides in which the life story of a minor, passing character is summed up to its often funny end. And of these asides, Accordion Crimes is rife. A sweeping, relentless cascade of characters, all of which you care for and identify with, populate this book which is my favourite by Proulx. Annie is &quot;baroque&quot; in the good sense of the word, as every page of hers is rich with multi-layered threads and numerous directions to the story."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"...from E. Annie Proulx. At turns funny, tragic and horrifying, \\"Accordion Crimes\\" tells the story of a small, green accordion as it passes through America from one immigrant or minority to another between 1891 and 1991. Through vibrant character sketches and textured historical context, Proulx exposes the similarities among and the prejudices experienced by Italians, Franco-Canadians, Mexicans, Poles, African-Americans, Irish-Scots and many other racial and ethnic groups throughout our history."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"This novel is certainly not an easy read, but I think those who shrug it off as depressing and dreary are really missing a great deal of the meaining it has to offer. It may be true that many of the characters come to unpleasant ends, but they often also achieve some measure of happiness along the way. Proulx's message seems to be one of niether hope nor dispair, but rather of life-affirmation; for life is made of equal measures of both, and these characters, who experience so much of both, are vibrantly, powerfully alive. The accordian (which is a brilliant metaphor for America, since it is one common element among so many different ethnicities) is both a blessing and a curse; as the image with which the novel leaves you so beautifully suggests, it is a fountain of possibilities, good and bad."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Sadly, I have to agree with the naysayers on this one.The stories of the accordion owners are all monotonously similar: they live hard lives and die horrible deaths, and they all seem perpetually conscious of the \\"issues\\" of ethnicity and assimilation (as we might term them today). This strikes me as overly simplistic to the point of being insulting, though I am sure Proulx did not intend this. As the daughter of an immigrant, I can tell you for certain that my mother did not spend all her days obsessing about whether her loyalties were to her country of birth or to America; nor did she hate every other race; nor was her life endlessly miserable and gruelingly arduous; nor could her story possibly be representative of her ethnic group as a whole.Of course, it's very wrong to assume that a writer intends a portrait of a single character to represent ALL members of a particular \\"group.\\" Obviously Proulx does not think that all immigrants are exactly like the ones in this book. But again, because all of the stories conform to the theme I've described, Proulx gives the impression that this is her book's \\"thesis.\\" Whether she intended this or not, it's not a thesis with any depth or realism or empathy. It makes for a book that, as other reviewers have pointed out, appears to be full of stereotypes and flat, unbelievable characters."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I, too, loved The Shipping News and began this book eager to see where Proulx would take me next. Wow. Accordion Crimes has a certain bizarrerie that reminds me of Cien a&ntilde;os de soledad, as well as displaying Proulx's dazzling command of the English language and encyclopedic knowledge of all sorts of interesting things (unlike more than one reviewer on this site, I found most of the technical descriptions fascinating). As the grandchild of immigrants, I found it salutary to be reminded that not every immigrant family adapted as successfully as mine. I'm sure everyone will be shocked when I reveal that I know little about jazz music and am not particularly fond of the accordion, except as part of a klezmer band; what's impressive about this novel is that, despite this fact, I found this particular accordion's life story a real page-turner. As for the almost uniformly unlikeable characters ... well, unfortunately there are a lot of people in this world who aren't very nice, and it's about time someone wrote a novel about some of them!"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I have to admit that after reading this book I asked myself what might have happened to E. Annie Proulx between the time she wrote the wonderful, life-affirming &quot;Shipping News&quot; and the relentlessly dark &quot;Accordian Crimes.&quot; Did some disaster befall her to change her view of the world and humanity?In &quot;Shipping News&quot; we met all kinds of people, both good and bad--some good but full of human foibles, some not so likable. They hurt each other; they make true human connections. Not so for most of the characters in &quot;Accordian Crimes.&quot;Though of course to some extent the American Dream is a myth, I believe the true story of American immigration is much more complex and varied than the ugly tale that Proulx tells in &quot;Accordian Crimes.&quot;I just read the positive review of Proulx's new book of short stories in The Washington Post. I think I'll wait and get the book out of the library rather than spend my money until I find out which Annie Proulx wrote this one."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Every kind of tragedy is crammed into this novel. Written for movie rights maybe? The concept of following an accordian could have been interesting. The one star I gave it was for the descriptions of accordians - a subject with which I was unfamiliar. If you want to know about accordians, go to an encyclopedia; don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I have never written a review for a web site before, but this book SO annoyed me that I felt I had to. I only just read &quot;The Shipping News,&quot; and was delightfully suprised -- and somewhat bewildered by some of the amazon.com reader-reviewers (granted, a minority) who hadn't liked the book. And then I read &quot;Accordion Crimes&quot;! Despite the occasional textual fireworks and clever turns-of-phrase, this is a mean-spirited, condescending book. I don't think that an author can be expected to &quot;like&quot; all of his or her characters (and what boring reading it would make if they did!), but he or she should at least &quot;respect&quot; them. E. Annie Proulx, in this book, treats her characters like animals in a zoo, or in some nature film. She describes them, their habits and foibles, and, almost without exception, their awful ends -- but as if she was somehow above them, looking down on them. As if she thinks that she is somehow superior to them. There is no attempt to uncover their humanity, no respect for the human condition. Just a smug, condescending tone. Even her little gimmick, her little plot device, is offensive. In &quot;The Shipping News,&quot; she used the little headlines that Quoyle would make up in his head as a way of helping us get to the character's emotional heart, as a way of making us understand what makes him tick. The fact that most of them were funny, or at least worth a chuckle, was a bonus. In &quot;Accordion Crimes,&quot; she often ends a vignette with a synopsis, enclosed in parenthesis, that sums up the rest of a character's life, once they are &quot;off stage&quot; as far as the novel is concerned. While some of these are funny, too, they are always funny at the expense of the character. Reducing him or her to a punch line in a joke. In &quot;The Shipping News,&quot; the only real, multidimensional character was Quoyle. Like Daphne DuMaurier's nameless lead character in &quot;Rebecca,&quot; we learned more about the character by how he/she perceives events around him/her, using other characters as a mirror. In &quot;Accordion Crimes,&quot; there are no characters, only caricatures. In a sweeping novel like this, with a simple plot device (the famous little green accordion) to lead us to new characters and new situations, one would have hoped for a rich tapestry of humanity. Instead, we get a couple of hundred pages of ethnic stereotypes and jokes. Think of what an author like Steinbeck or Dickens or Victor Hugo could have done with a scenario like this. There would have been characters whom we loved, characters whom we hated, but, most of all, characters who helped us to understand our common humanity. The whole point of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; was that we, the readers, had no right to feel superior, to think ourselves better than a bunch of illiterate migrant farm workers. Their struggle was our struggle. Their humanity was our humanity. Read &quot;Accodion Crimes&quot; if you suffer from such low self-esteeem that you need to feel superior to every single character, if human foibles and frailty give you a smug sense of superiority. If you want to read about human beings, if you want to learn more about the human condition and what we can learn from one another, use the amazon-com search engine to find another book!"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"The stories of the accordion owners get somewhat monotonous after a while. What keeps the reader engaged is the series of Hitchcockian scenes when he thinks this owner will discover the $14,000 secreted in the accordion. Sometimes she seems to paint herself into a corner where the only way to keep the story going is to kill the character, as happens to one would-be accordion repairman. As the accordion makes its way, it gradually decreases in value, ultimately becoming trash. This was disappointing to me and somewhat unrealistic, to think that no one would recognize the unusual work that had gone into its making, as poorly functioning and as tattered as it had become. As the book ends, the accordion gets smashed by a truck and we still don't know what will happen to the pieces nor who will find $13,000 of the $14,000."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I once crossed the Atlantic on a freighter which stopped in New Foundland. A friend begged me to read The Shipping News which opened my mind to fiction after years of reading theory.Perhaps every author has one great novel and readers will continue to be disappointed by their inability to grasp another tale, not a sequel to the one they last finished. It is no surprise to me that Americans are a bit disappointed by the tragic lives depicted in Accordian Crimes. I have to admit that I found it refreshing.I did find one detail alarming given the careful attention paid to historic details. On p. 204 of the first edition(hard cover), Proulx refers to whalers as &quot;whale killers&quot; which continues to distract me. Men who hunted whales and the men who continue to hunt them are not &quot;whale killers&quot; but simply &quot;whalers.&quot; Perhaps this will change in future editions...."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"With great expectations, our reading group, all fans of Annie Proulx, took up Accordion Crimes. Alas, we were unanimous in our profound disappointmen. Nowhere in the book did there appear a shred of hopefulness, a bit of redemption, any glimmer of relief from the relentless pessimism and heavyhanded grimness. The characters themselves were unlikable, for the most part, and the view of humanity in this book is worthy of the most confirmed misanthrope. None of us in the reading group could understand what the point of this whole exercise was. A waste of time."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Some gray, murky metaphors, adjectives, etc. happen in this book, but I found the WHOLE thing completely inaffective.Let's just say it's the only book in my entire life that I returned to the bookstore AFTER I had read it, just because I didn't want it the book as a physical object in my house."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I thought I was a fan of Proulx' work until I put down Accordion Crimes and decided not to punish myself any longer. I have soldiered through many a mediocre book, but either I'm valuing my time more highly or Accordion Crimes just wore me down.Accordion Crimes is America's story, seen in narrow focus as an accordion passes from hand to hand. Lovingly crafted by a man in Sicily and infused with his hopes for a better life in America, likeThe Red Violinit saps the life energies of its creator's wife. When the Italian immigrant meets a violent end at the hands of an anti-Italian, anti-immigrant mob, the accordion changes hands. Its new owner, a black riverboat hand, meets a violent end, and so on. Certainly Proulx turns an unflinching eye on all that was unromantic and disturbing about our country's past: racism, sexism, poverty, no health care, harsh families with no social safety net, you name it, it's a cause of death of one of the accordion's owners. The accordion isn't cursed; we are just to believe that these things were happening on a daily basis. The writing is skilful as always, but the sadness at becoming attached to one of the many characters only to witness their defeated dreams and ugly outcome gets depressing and makes the reader withdraw from the story. As a friend of mine would have said, \\"She sets you up to knock you down\\". I can appreciate a well-written story without a happy ending, but by page 250 I was ready to cut my losses.Readers who enjoy well-written, well-researched historical fiction and don't mind or even relish nonstop tragedy will enjoy Accordion Crimes, but the rest of you should give it a miss."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"If Diane Arbus, Sylvia Plath, Edgar Allen Poe, and Ambrose Bierce had a baby, it would be indistinguishable from Doris Day when compared to E. Annie Proulx, America's most disturbed and disturbing writer. If you can read Accordion Crimes without becoming ill then sticking your head in a bag of ravenous ferrets would be a stroll in the park for you.I love great writing and am willing to forgive a lot if an author really uses the language beautifully. I followed Proulx from Postcards through Shipping News, turning a blind eye to her unpalatable perspective, admiring the sheer muscularity of the prose. But technical skill without soul simply isn't enough. After all, Jeffrey Dahmer was handy with power tools and John Wayne Gacy was a talented clown. If Postcards and Shipping News suggested a moral compass with its magnetic North in the center of hell, Accordion Crimes flatly declared a worldview that made the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch look like a Hallmark greeting card.A writer as gifted as Proulx can lie convincingly, and the greatest of her literary crimes is a portrait of immigrant life predicated on wave after wave not of people but of class hatred and warfare. Her vision is so bizarre, extreme, bleak, and unsupported as to be unique - the fabrication of some ghastly quarter-truth that satisfies her belief in the irredeemable depravity of humanity. That there is enough fact in this fantastic construction to lure readers into believing all of it is Ms. Proulx's blackest sin, a crime of bad faith, deception, and sensationalistic manipulation.One good way to judge a writer's moral fiber is by observing how s/he treats his or her characters. Rest assured that no matter how difficult your life may seem, you can take comfort in the knowledge that you do not live in one of Ms. Proulx's novels. No writer has ever despised her protagonists more, finding increasingly ghoulish, twisted, and sadistic ways to hurt them, maim them, torture them, until at last she kills them. If you can find one drop of compassion, hope, joy, or even soul in this book you've read it more carefully than I have. It is one thing to hear Coltrane practicing scales, quite another to listen as his solos summon the spirits. Proulx writes well but pointlessly, gleefully pouring salt into a self-administered wound."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I totally agreed with most of the negative reviews of this book I read on this site before adding mine. After &quot;The Shipping News&quot; one would expect much more. Just a few notes. Why do all the characters have to end in a gruesome, unlikely way? Why are they all losers, mostly paranoid? Why does the reader have to go through the pain of reading all the details of widely researched material on accordions, horses, whatever becomes the fixation of the writer in a certain page? In this book there are paragraphs and paragraphs listing singers, players, records, horse breeds... It seems like the writer was more concerned in making sure to include every single bit of information she researched like an undescerning teen-ager closed in a library than to interest the reader in the subject. No doubt she has no knowledge of (or passion for) the instruments she describes other than an academic one. In the same way she has poor knowledge of most of the ethnic communities she describes. Just lots of stereotypes, which the green accordion does not manage to unify: starting a new chapter is always a struggle. I am not sure I will pick up her next book."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"After The Shipping News, I couldn't wait to read Annie Proulx's latest. She had been able to grasp a unique Canadian culture of Newfoundland so well, I expected more of the same or better in Accordian Crimes. This is not a book, just a weak collection of depressing and unsatisfying short stories that do nothing to create empathy with the characters. Not a character here you would want to meet. The theme: the American dream unmasked is a good one. No plot, no unifying idea other than the little green accordian which moves along as each owner dies or loses it. I had to force myself to finish it. If this had been Annie Proulx's first book, no one would buy the next."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"it's amazing to me that a literate novel, as this one certainly is, could receive negative reviews. it's totally absorbing and epic in the journey. and, naturally from annie, very well written. i can only assume that some amazon readers are crepuscular."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"The drawings of different types of the accordion throughout the different sections of the book, make it more readable. Actually, the title is misleading as the accordions don't commit crimes, though some are pepetrated on the owners at the time.The accordion maker and his eleven-yr-old son arrived in New Orleans where he is killed by an anti-Italian lynching mob (one of a group of eleven). The boy brings with him a green accordion from Sicily which does a bit of traving back and forth across America. The people and places along the way make up the stories, which are disjointed.The green one is traced over a century as it end up with various ethnic groups. Some of the characters are unsavory. At the trailer park, Abelardo (who later dies from a poisonous spider bite) makes up this ditty as he played the accordion after watching the black exhaust of twenty buses a day as it billowed in front of the trailer:\\"O you filthy bus,I was dreaming of love and riches,I was dreaming of happinessWhen you brrrt! like ten elephantsLike a smokestack blowing up,When you gnashed your gearsAnd destroyed my fragile reverie.\\"I ride the buses and the diesel is still there, not as prevalent as in the Fifties, but still deadly toxic. The experiment with bio-diesel (soybean waste mixed in with the gas) proved not so attractive as it was damaging the engines of the old buses. We have a flock of \\"borrowed\\" buses from Worchester, Mass., ancient and hard to ride in, but all of the new buses purchased by TDOT are in the college area getting worn out by pampering the out-of-town (state) students by being available almost around the clock. This is called subcontracting, and not the intention of the government aid for 'public' transit.The accordion evolves in many versions. My dad had one like that played on the Lawrence Welk show (think it was called the piano accordion). He wouldn't let me take piano lessons as a child, as he could not afford a piano, but he bought all kinds of musical instruments for himself until he died.Welk was a German from the old country and a master player. There was another accordion player on his show, but I can't remember his name. My dad was part Cherokee from the mountains of East Tennessee. He sold his to the son of his sister, Molly, who lived in Heiskell.You'd think that by passing the green one around and all the back-and-forth constant moving from Louisiana to Maine, from Iowa to Texas and places in between, it would simply wear out. It was destroyed by being run over by a car after a fast and furious life with all kinds of people who loved music.She gives the history of the instrument from development and explains beautifully the sound it makes, like no other music except perhaps the modern synthethizer which can sound like a lot of different instruments. It was never my favorite, as it would have been too heavy for me to carry. Oh, the old movies had a form of a smaller one, but it was just a toy. The real accordion was a masterpiece and could be played by anybody with any kind of music in him. It is loud but, if played right, stirring and invigorating to the listener.Ms Proulx had a Pulitizer prize winner with her first novel, SHIPPING NEWS, which caused quite a stir. This one, however, has much to be desired to come up to the standards of first class."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"This book describes the life of a single accordion and all the people who came to own and play it over the years. At the end of the Nineteenth Century, an Italian accordion maker fashioned the accordion with his own hands. He brought it to the US when he immigrated in search of the good life. In the years that follow, the accordion becomes the property of musicians from a wide variety of ethnic groups, including African Americans, Germans, Mexicans, Poles, French Canadians, Cajuns, and Basques. Each episode in the life of the accordion is treated in a free-standing short-story or novella.In this book, Proulx works with character-development. She builds from the stereotype of each ethnic group, filling out the details to make a character and story. Unfortunately, none of the characters (with the exception of the accordion itself) are very sympathetic, and it can be a relief in some cases to see them meet their demise. And the details of the demise can be overly gruesome. Her musical descriptions, on the other hand, are very engaging."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Accordian Crimes is a wonderous book. Proulx's writing style never disappoints; at one moment it is lush with description, at another, it is stark and yearning. The story is epic, tracing snapshots of the lives of curious characters through the passing-on of an accordian. People who have seen the film the Red Violin have remark that this book has a &quot;Red Violin thing&quot; going for it. In fact, the Red Violin has an Accordion Crimes thing going for IT. What is it that is so fascinating about objects passing from person to person, life to life? Films like the Red Violin, the well-attempted Twenty Bucks and even Night on Earth remind us that once something leaves our hands, it continues on a journey that may enlighten and delight us. Take another look at this book and really think about it."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"The reviews were so good that I couldn't wait to read this book...and my expectations were high after the wonderful &quot;Shipping News&quot;. The idea behind &quot;Accordian Crimes&quot; was brilliant; the result, a momumental disappointment. Proulx presented flat undeveloped characters, a choppy story line, and an unbelievable denouement. I keep reading only in hope that I would find a point to the whole thing."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"While the beginning of E. Annie Proulx's novel, Accordion Crimes starts off well, the reader is quickly lost as the accordion moves from one miserable owner to another. I truly was bored by this book, but did finish it."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"After all the hype around this novelist's last effort, I decided to take a run at &quot;Accordion Crimes&quot;. By the end of this exhausting novel (or more correctly, series of short stories connected by a plot device), I have sworn to myself never to read the follow-up to a successful novel.First, as always, the good. Proulx is imaginative and writes well-crafted sentences, especially her dialogue. She certainly has no shortage of gumption for creating a book so sprawling in time, space and variety of characters. A for effort, A for technical expertise.Now, the rest of the grade. F for emotion, F for excessive use of cliches, F for believability and depth of characterization, F for the silly parenthetical asides regarding character's &quot;fate&quot;, F for the trite use of &quot;mother tongue&quot; words by ethnic characters, F for the tiresome lists that lie like roadkill throughout the book.The truest sign of failure must surely be a reader's pity for an inanimate plot device. If I had been the poor little green accordion and known what a bunch of shallow, bland, and otherwise uninteresting series of persons were to press upon my keys, I would have jumped off the ship from Italy before it ever reached New Orleans."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I have been reading this book for months, am almost done with it, and I still don't know if I'll ever finish it, it is that uninteresting. This author writes marvelous prose and I loved &quot;The Shipping News&quot;, however, I have been totally unable to develop an interest in the characters, the accordion, the crimes; the total absence of humanity in any of these characters is remarkable. Should one become slightly interested in the fate of one of these families, it is too late, as they will be devastated by a weird calamity and that will be the end of them. This book was eminently putdownable."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"After reading all the raves about Shipping News (which I have not read), I found Accordian Crimes in the bargain bin of the local bookstore, so I thought I would give it a try. The book is readable, but it is essentially a collection of depressing (and troubling) short stories. I was expecting an actual NOVEL. The characters seem to be either horrendously unlucky or incredibly stupid. The plot would come to a conclusion just when I feel I am getting into the storyline. In short, I do not much care for it."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Annie Proulx is not for everyone. Readers who expect quick, easy reads will be challenged by Proulx's style. It's a rich, complex style best read with care, almost word-by-word. Those who give her rhythmic structure the attention it demands will be rewarded many times over with a view of American life reminiscent of Steinbeck at his best. \\"Accordian Crimes\\" is a beautiful, detailed look at the joy and pain of life in the working class sub-culture of America. She uses a hand-crafted accordian, brought by an emigrating Sicilian craftsman to America in the late 19th century, as the vehicle for her look at ordinary people. She weaves an intricate tale spanning generations. She mixes fine detail from the real world (for instance, her references to the country singer Betty Cody, a real woman from Maine who recorded in the 50s and 60s, and mother of current bluesman Denny Breau) with a deeply evocative fictional world that is as honest as any I've read. Proulx understands the people her characters represent better than almost any current American author. She understands the devil is in the details of life, and she offers us an unsparing yet poignant look at how these details impact so many disparate people. Read with care, with a feeling for Proulx resonant style, \\"Accordian Crimes\\" is a powerful look at a much ignored and often denigrated part of the American landscape. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"E. Annie Proulx is one of the finest wrtiers of her generation. She is a master storyteller who can bring the unlikeliest of characters to life and make the ordinary seem extraordinary. \\"Accordion Crimes\\" is unlike her other novels and stories, which seem to happen within a particular corner of society, since it roams across the entire United States following the fate of one green accordion. A strange premise for a novel perhaps, but Proulx's barebone idea is fleshed out with a vivid portrait of American life over the past century.The tale begins in Sicily, with the maker of the accordion, trading in his lack of fortune for a chance at prosperity in America. But his experiences in Lousiana are far from what he dreamed they would be. When his story ends, the accordion changes hands, inermingling with the fate of a wide variety of characters. \\"Accordion Crimes\\" is not so much a novel perhaps, but a series of short novellas detailing the everyday lives of immigrants to this country. It falls into the hands of a band of Germans settling in North Dakota, a Mexican waiter who dies an unusual death, a dysfunctional family of French Canadians, third generation Polish polka players, Montana horse ranchers, and small-town Minnesota farmers. Each tale is marked by dreams that are seldom achieved and an almost unbearable sadness, yet these characters and their lives will haunt you long after you have finished reading.\\"Accordion Crimes\\" could be a difficult read - there is little connection between each section beyond the passage of the accordion, and I can understand why other reviewers might dislike this. But one cannot discount the sheer lyrical beauty of Proulx's storytelling and her ability to recreate the pain and suffering and joy of people who have come to America in search of a better life and the weight that the second and third generations carry in belonging to different worlds. Proulx's writing is raw, concealing nothing from the reader, laying bare the souls of her multitude of characters whose stories have only partially been told. It is an epic novel of the American immigrant experience."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I've just returned to this book for a 2nd reading after 10 years. In short, I enjoyed it much more than the first read, mostly for the rich savor of her prose, though the things that bothered me then still do.The unrelenting bleak outlook of the book commented on by others is not a problem for me, though I sympathize with that criticism. Maybe because the sadness of her stories does not smack of the contrived, TV drama mentality of many pop authors. It is frighteningly real. I get the distinct, uneasy feeling that she does not make this stuff up. And there is just a tinge of the sardonic, a brush stroke of wry humor that cuts into the mix. That sort of thing does not set well with a lot of readers. Understandably. But EAP's ability to do bring it off is one of the things that makes her best work. -- And overdoing it makes some of her worst.It's rich. Anne Proulx can condense two hundred years of a family history into two pages of selected detail and leave you with a sense of understanding the present character. Her sense of family and place runs deep. Accordion Crimes is dense with character and place. Any one chapter would stand on it's own as a novella. Spun together they make (at least for my 2nd reading) one of her best long works.If she occasionally pushes her prose just a tad too far (those parenthetical sidebars get in the way after while) it's not enough to take the reader out of the story.If you haven't gone back to this one in a while, try it again."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I enjoyed this book much more than \\"Ace in the Hole.\\" Though I don't know that it was well received by reviewers, and I don't believe that it was one of her best sellers, it is nonetheless a very good book.The book follows a green accordion. It begins in a small Sicilian village in the late 19th century. It then travels through nearly every major immigrant group in the United States that has ever played folk music on the accordion. Proulx's writing in this book is wicked. She is funny and tragic--sometimes in the same paragraph. The lives of the characters in this book are drawn fully. Sometimes she gives their family history reaching back several generations. We are even at times given glimpses into family futures. The characters are connected only through the green accordion--and their shared American experience.Proulx creates these characters through something that is more than anecdote, but also less than story. She often begins by painting with a broad brush the landscape and history of a person, she then settles into a particular moment or moments in that person's life. These anecdotes reveal the character within the context of his or her time and place. Any single story, if read on its own, would amount to very little. But when taken collectively they give a unique perspective on history.\\"Accordion Crimes\\" and \\"News from Paraguay\\" are very different books, but they are somewhat similar in their structure. But at the end of the day, Proux is more successful in the use of the form. Her anecdotes are fully drawn; the characters feel much more like characters and less like writerly composites. Proulx has a real feel for the place and the people in her stories. Tuck may give one or two details to create her character and their particular anecdote. Proulx gives a bushel basket full. And though these are different approaches, in the end I feel emotionally engaged on the character level in Proulx's book. I feel farther away in Tuck's book, as though I am looking down upon rather than living with or within her characters.One of the things that kept me reading \\"Accordion Crimes\\" was her imagination and the writing itself. Where as the other books I read this month often felt heavy on literary devices--techniques to compel the reader forward--Proulx relied simply on damn good writing. I can easily see why this book is not a popular read. With its scores of characters it would not make for good book group discussions. And even after I had spent a few hours with the book it was difficult for me to say exactly what happened. But I do know they were hours well spent.The thing I liked most about the book, aside from the writing, was Proulx's willingness to look at the ugliest parts of America--and then make us look at them. The themes are big, and any single event in the life of any single character could have been the stuff of a novel in itself."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Annie Proulx is one of my favorite living writers, and I found \\"Accordion Crimes\\" compulsively readable, even if sometimes in this book she veers dangerously close to self-parody. The titular button accordion, handcrafted by a Sicilian immigrant in the old country and brought over on the boat to New Orleans, is our speechless but not silent tour guide across the length and breadth of the United States and a full century of American immigrant history, covering Italian, German, Mexican, French-Canadian, Cajun, African-American, Polish, Irish and Norwegian ethnicity (with forays, of course, into cowboy country) inside its 400-odd breathless pages. As time goes on and the various old countries are forgotten, the accordion becomes a more and more minor player in the successive stories, until--relegated at last to a garbage truck--it spills its final secret, a secret alluded to hundreds of pages earlier and not mentioned again until the very last page. Proulx is one of the greatest storytellers writing today, and she's incapable of writing (or at least publishing) a bad sentence; yet in \\"Accordion Crimes\\" she gets too carried away in her ability to find new, horrific ways to kill, maim, mutilate, disfigure, sicken, torture, assault, burn, freeze, imprison, enslave, rape, harass, abandon, brutalize and humiliate her characters. Philip Larkin's phrase, \\"Man hands on misery to man,\\" could be the epigraph for Proulx's entire body of work; she's as profligate with her characters' lives as Larry McMurtry and nearly as exuberant in depicting the gory details as Cormac McCarthy. (If the producers of the \\"Saw\\" and \\"Final Destination\\" movies ever run out of ideas, they only need to hire Proulx as a consultant.) Personally, I prefer her work when it's leavened with hope (\\"The Shipping News,\\" a masterpiece) or when its finely chiseled brevity allows the full tragedy to sink in (\\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" a super-masterpiece). Yet parts of \\"Accordion Crimes\\" are so wonderful that you're always aware you're in the hands of a master novelist. On page 268 of \\"Accordion Crimes,\\" there is a one-page section, \\"The girl he left behind him,\\" which briefly sums up the long, unhappy life of Zephyr, an ex-slave, banjo player and sharecropper in the Jim Crow Depression South. Zephyr doesn't appear anywhere else in the book, and nothing Proulx says about him suggests he is in any way out of the ordinary; yet I will never forget Zephyr, and his tragic life--all too emblematic--of too much sorrow and too little hope. \\"Accordion Crimes,\\" excessive as it may be, is a pointed reminder that the story of Columbus really is written in blood."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"\\"Accordion Crimes\\" is an imaginative and well written book. Readers who first encountered Proulx through \\"The Shipping News\\" will be pleased to discover that the author's knack for writing provocative and moving prose is alive and well in this 1996 novel. The central theme--the struggle of immigrants to assimilate themselves into American society while maintaining ties with their native culture--will strike a chord with many readers. The device used to explore this theme is a hand-made green accordion, brought to the US by an Italian immigrant in the 19th century. The accordion changes hands numerous times, with each new owner spotlighted in a separate chapter of the book.Fans of good writing will surely enjoy \\"Accordion Crimes.\\" Most of the stories are dark and troubling. And only a handful of the characters are meant to be likeable. But the vivid storytelling will keep you turning the pages, as will the suspense of discovering the ultimate fate of the little green accordion ... and the treasure hidden inside of it. Those who are squeamish may be put off by Proulx's gruesome means of killing off her characters: suicide by chainsaw, electrocution by worm probe, being crushed under a collapsing cinder-block wall. It's enough to make Stephen King blush. In addition, the book is labeled as \\"a novel,\\" but it's perhaps more apt to consider it a collection of short stories. As a result, character development and story lines are not as deep as they are in other Proulx novels. Nonetheless, those who read this book will likely enjoy enough of the chapters to make the experience worthwhile."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I agree with the reader from Salt Lake City that the characters in this book are primarily vehicles for the accordion music that is at the heart of the story. As one who has loved all forms of American traditional music from the other end of the world, I was transported by this book. Ms Proulx's stories give each type of music a new life and meaning and offer a new perspective on the history of America's immigrants and races. The chapter in which the accordion is played in a zydeco band is absolutely wonderful - Clifton Chenier even makes an appearance (put on the Chenier collection &quot;Zydeco Dynamite&quot; while you read this chapter). This book serves as a timely counter to the shopping mall homogenization of music - use it as an opportunity to go back and discover real American music and understand its origins. Although many of the characters are seen as unpleasant by many readers, my reading was that they are neither good or bad, merely the victims of difficult curcumstances who are driven to find their true voice in music. And that is how each form of music began.The bonus is that Annie Proulx's descriptions are as drop-dead perfect as in all her books - the sense of place in each story is spot-on. If you like good American literature, read this and all Annie Proulx's books."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I must admit it did take me a few weeks to actually get around to finnishing ACCORDIAN CRIMES but once I did complete it- I was definitly left with a feeling of satisfaction. It is indeed a difficult novel to get through. The lives of some of the characters are left incomplete and some of their stories become tedious and drawn out at points. However- Ms. Proulx is a master of description and her flowing sentences and unbelievable use of the English language kept me from giving up. Some may say that there wasn't a real plot and that the accordian didn't really hold the interest for too many- but I know that for me- I was wondering all along &quot;Who the heck is ever going to find the $14,000.00?????&quot;. I loved the ending because it wasn't meant to really resolve anything. The world keeps revolving but nothing lasts forever...people die, money is lost, happiness isn't inevitable, tragedy is a reality, objects are destroyed, and accordians change hands. Ms. Proulx s! ucceeded in showing the reader that no person or object is truly timeless and that everything good/bad, alive/inanimate must come to an end."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I have to confess this isn't a book that I enjoyed reading--parts of it were so painful that I found myself wincing as I read it. But, man, do those stories linger in the psyche. If you've read this page you have the basic gist of the story--what I'll add is that for me this little green accordian took on a life of its own. It started to seem like a little green gremlin, bringing bad luck and tragedy to the unlucky folk who possessed it. When I started to think about it that way, the idea that the energy with which it was &quot;birthed&quot; would linger to touch the lives of the people around it, all of the bad things that happened seemed to make a little more sense. Otherwise, what a pack of brawling, unlovable folk!I particularly enjoyed the quirky, parenthetical asides that followed a person's life, sometimes to the final moments. I think in a novel like this one, where you are following an inanimate object rather than a person, not giving some sort of follow-through about these people with whom you've spent some time getting to know would just be too frustrating. And they were satisfying in a strange way--wouldn't it be nice to get those little blips on your mental screen about those people who pass through your own life? (Paul S., former high school sweetheart, goes on to become an accountant, is moderately successful, but has a midlife crisis and joins the Church of the New Beginning, rises to power as a priest, is kicked out for having sex with the disciples, and spends his old age selling Super Blue-Green Algea products over the internet.)"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I must admit I agree with the less-favorable of the reviews listed here, even though I tried hard to like this book. The synopsis sounded interesting to me--one hundred years in the life of a hand-made accordion, passed on from generation to generation, ethnicity to ethnicity. A grand idea, mini-series material. My curiosity was piqued. I had to admire any author who had the guts to tackle such a project.Unfortunately, this was not a book that gripped me. It did not make me want to stay up late to read it or go out and recommend it to everyone I know; it did not give me any new and interesting insights into the human condition. Basically, it did not make me *feel* much.What I did like about the book was Proulx's command of the language. Every once in a while, I would read a sentence and think, &quot;wow,&quot; which does make me optimistic enough to want to try Proulx's other novels.Throughout the book, Proulx finishes with a character by summarizing the rest of his or her life in one paranthetical paragraph. Each of the characters that are discarded in this way inevitably end up living a bizarre and unbelievably unlucky life and dying a strange death. I felt these were unnecessary and did not add anything to the book, except perhaps a feeling of triteness. These afterthoughts could have been written by anyone called upon to create a weird story; they didn't make me feel like I was getting to know a character any better.As a final note, I, too, felt that &quot;Accordion Crimes&quot; is not a novel but a series of short stories linked by a common element. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but I don't feel that it was the intention"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I loved this book! I hated to see it end, and will probably read it again and again. I was captured by the wonderful descriptions of each ethnic experience. I often felt like I was right there, going through everything with these characters. I kept visualizing movie scenes. Great American history lessons. It is so nice to read such rich literature! Like the money hidden in the accordion, the treasure inside each ethnic person was often undiscovered."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"This one's heavy. We see the 20th century through the eyes of a series of underpriviledged, bigoted people who each come in contact with a green accordian (this is nothing like The Red Violin). Nobody lives well or dies happy. The structure of the book gives us at most a couple chapters on a character, so we don't end up caring very much about anybody. Yet Proulx's style is engaging, and early in the book she tosses a plot element into the mix that keeps you going to the satisfying end (which was good enough to turn a 2-star rating into a 3-star)."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Despite the sheer awfulness of much that befalls the characters in this book, it is ultimately about the optimism and resilience that are the necessary attributes of the brave souls who take on the burden of settling in a heartbreakingly foreign land. It is 'Newfoundland' writ large."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"The whole basis of this book, allowing us glimpses into the lives of the various immigrants that successively own an accordion, was a great idea and could have been absolutely brilliant. Parts of the story shone, but then it just seemed to deteriorate and get so weird that I was barely able to finish it. It could have been wonderful. For anyone who hasn't read The Shipping News, don't let this stop you - you would never know they were written by the same writer."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Pulitzer Prize winning author Annie Proulx disappoints us with her new novel, &quot;Accordion Crimes.&quot; Certainly she does nothing to dispel the idea that she is one of the most assured craftsmen of the language, but whereas in &quot;The Shipping News&quot; she built a world and a plot to carry her poetic language, here she gives us very little beside it. This is not enough.&quot;Accordion Crimes&quot; is a book with a premise that doubles as a plot device, but never gets beyond this stricture into a satisfying work of fiction. The accordion in question is made by a Sicilian immigrant, sent to American to make enough money so that his family might join him. Lynched in anti-immigrant riots in New Orleans, the accordion passes into the hands of itinerant river-men, so beginning its picaresque train through the lives of another seven immigrant families. One of the great problems with this conceit is the tenuous link between all of the sections. Proulx seems to consider that the possession of the accordion makes each family worthy of a section in her book. In all honesty it is frequently far less than enough. Few of the sections reveal her full range of talents, and the role of the accordion is arbitrary at best in many of the stories.And here is another problem with the book: these episodes are stories. Despite the claims that &quot;Accordion Crimes&quot; is a novel there is a mechanical dullness to the procession of sections that breaks up the flow of any overall narrative thread, and threatens to lose the reader in more than one place. For example, once one realizes that each section of the book is fifty pages in length one starts to check how many pages to go before there is a switch to another, hopefully more interesting, section. Sadly, it too often feels like Proulx is doing the same thing. She has characters here, but no characterization. This denies our engagement and, having witnessed her success with characterization in &quot;The Shipping News&quot; and &quot;Postcards&quot;, it is puzzling that she should have so completely abandoned her strength. Ending the lives of many of her characters in bizarre and ghoulish ways does not give their lives any extra depth, yet this device is tried in many of the sections. Annie Proulx knows better than most that characters are interesting when they are alive, but these characters are flat puppets, tormented then dumped by the omniscient narrative voice.During the planning stages of this novel the structure and the thread of the passed-on accordion must have looked very satisfying, but in execution it is not. The instrument cannot hold the attention necessary for the novel to work, and the characters through whose hands it passes are never given a chance to interest us. As a patchwork of the immigrant population of the United States this book is a sadly disappointing failure. In her foreword, Annie Proulx proudly thanks those who helped her research the accordion and its cultural influence. She thanks those who read the manuscript for accordion detail errors. It is a pity that she didn't have someone to point out that detail, fine language, and a scheme would not make a satisfying work of fiction. For this book Annie Proulx has shelved what she does best: using her incredible powers of language to create real characters who stay with us long after we finish reading. There is no Loyal Blood nor Owen Quoyle here, and we miss them. Instead we are given an accordion that is, by the end of the book, battered to destruction. Unfortunately many readers may not reach that far, and those who do may simply fail to care."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"This is the most bloody Annie Proulx novel yet, with very little redeeming social value. After the fourth &quot;crime&quot; which only took me through about one-third of the book, I just gave up, not being attracted by any continuity which were present in Annie Proulx's other novels, &quot;Shipping News,&quot; and &quot;Postcards.&quot; In the case of &quot;Accordion Crimes&quot; the attempt at continuity is provided by the accordion of the title, which witnesses the various crimes of murder, lynching, adultery, drug trafficing, etc. In &quot;Postcards,&quot; despite the gimmick of the hand printed or typewritten postcards which precede many chapters, it is the vitality of Loyal Blood, the main character, which compels us onward and maintains our interest. Similarly, Quoyle, in &quot;Shipping News&quot; compels us with his dogged and tender nature. The accordion of the present novel just does not have such a compelling personality. However, if you like a challenge, I dare you to finish this book."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I have read everything that Annie Proulx has written. At her best, as in \\"The Shipping News\\" and \\"Close Range: Wyoming Stories,\\" Proulx is unlike any author I've encoutered; her characters and landscapes burn with rage, passion, hardship and survival. However, in \\"Accordion Crimes,\\" Proulx violates her readers' trust with implausible stories of gratuitous gore. The pretext for her lurid vignettes is a green accordion that passes to various immigrant families, whose members are dismembered in gruesome detail. While these stories may entertain a few execrable sociopaths, Proulx risks the alienation of her enthusiasts. One can only hope that this work is the aberrant creation of an otherwise unique and remarkable talent."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I am always skeptical when a writer creates characters of other ethnic groups than her own: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Annie Proulx clearly did her research on this one, but while the stories seem factually plausible, none of her cast of immigrant characters ever really rises above the level of stereotype. It is as though the writer understands the facts behind them, but not the feelings. The result is like a lite, sixth-grade-social-studies trip through the history of immigration in America, with the accordion (and the unrelenting bad luck that goes with it) as a flimsy plot device.I loved Proulx's first novel, The Shipping News. But I wish I hadn't bought this book or spent the time it took to read it. My advice: save your money."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"The premise sounded really promising -- an accordian ends up in the hands of very different people in succession and bears witness to a part of each of their lives. But none of the characters were worth witnessing. Worse than that, however, was the annoying style in which the book was written. One paragraph might be made up of one unbelievably long run-on sentence, separated by lots of commas, while the next might be twenty short little sentences. It was too distracting -- particularly for a weak book that could not hold up under any distraction. Pass on this one."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"A disappoininting, depressing book, chock full of every imaginable form of death and dismemberment. Proulx's fascination with the grotesque is numbing at first, but by book's end it is merely laughable. The accordion is really not much more than a clever gimmick to &quot;link&quot; what might have worked as independent short stories. It is is hard to defend a novel about the immigrant expreince which is so devoid of humanity, love and faith. Proulx's version of American history is so drenched in blood, that all else, with the notable exception of some brilliant passages about the joy of music,is obscured. While it could be argued that it is refreshing not to encounter soft-hearted, sentimental ethnic stereotypes, it is disheartening that she still manages to paint the Poles as hard drinkers, the Mexicans as somewhat lazy and the Norweigans as repressed and cruel. The book's redeeming feature is her wonderful, lean prose. Proulx has described her writing as &quot;muscular&quot; and that it is. Better off reading the The Shipping News and call it a day."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and fell into the spell of its darkness. Annie Proulx is one of the greatest writers we are lucky enough to have; her intelligence demolishes illusions, the beauty of her prose burrows into the soft flesh of the heart, and I am frankly astonished to find that this book did not get stellar reviews all around from Amazon's readers."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I just finished Accordion Crimes and while I enjoyed it, I could not rank it with The Shipping News. In some ways TSN is an elongated short story rather than a novel but it is long enough to develop the characters, particularly the character of Quoyle, which is what makes the book so endearing. Accordion Crimes, on the other hand, is clearly a series of short stories bound together by the rather weak thread of a single accordion filled with thousand dollar bills traversing history. We see a progression of characters in possession of the accordion that are bound together by virtue of an interest in music, being in the USA as an immigrant and, inevitably for this book, tragedy. Because of the page constraints for each character, there is very little Proulx can do in the way of character development although I did laugh out loud during one of the late chapters at the character Fay McGettigan where he says \\"They didn't have no pissproof watches then.\\" Proulx could have written a novel around any of several of the characters she does not develop in the book but, it wouldn't have been the book she envisioned. Perhaps her initial idea wasn't bad but, generally, I think Proulx got lost several times in what she apparently most likes to do, research arcane subjects. We are either treated or subjected, depending upon your point of view, to the results of many of these researches in Accordion Crimes. I generally like a good bit of description in a novel, but she got so carried away it detracted from the story, but then, unfortunately, she didn't have that much story to work with, which may be why she chose to fill the pages with her research.Having said all of this, the book is worth reading to get the occasional sentence or paragraph nugget which may be the main reason for reading Proulx in the first place. The woman can string words together in ways where noone has gone before. Any serious student of contemporary literature must read every word Proulx writes."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Annie Proulx's &quot;The Shipping News&quot; is one of my favorite books. A story so sharply written that I've held simple phrases in my head for years - unforgettable. I was thrilled to hear about &quot;Accordian Crimes&quot; and even broke my wait-until-it's-in-paperback rule. Forked over the bucks for the hardcover and took an afternoon off from work to dive in. Well - such a laborious, dry, unengaging read that I put it down after about 100 (or was it 1000?) pages. Tried again weeks later, thinking I wasn't in the right frame of mind the first time. Again - that wall of boredom. Either I just wasn't getting it, or there isn't anything to get. Got FABULOUS reviews in my area papers - maybe it's just me! (Try her others: Heartsongs, Postcards, Close Range - all very good.) I'm so sorry, Ms. Proulx, but I gave it my best!"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"Reading Annie Proulx's ACCORDIAN CRIMES is like taking a bath in Chival Regal. It's not for everyone but it is oh so elegant. The prose is elegant, the violence is elegant, and the characters are elegance in the raw. The images, the details, and the power of her writing are often overwhelming causing the reader to stop and take a breath. And she writes with wit, a trait not often found in today's writers.ACCORDIAN CRIMES uses an Italian made, green accordian as a device to explore the underbelly of the immigrant experience. Not pretty for many, the antithesis of I REMEMBER MAMA. We follow the accordian and its owners from 1893 to 1993. A hundred years of struggle, despair, and isolation experienced by blacks, Italians, Germans, Poles, French, Mexicans from New Orleans, Chicago, Minnesota, Iowa, Montana, Mississippi, Texas. Unforgiving country inhabited by Proulx's relentless, unforgiving characters. Again, not pretty, not for everyone, but an American masterpiece."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"One of the greatest books IN and ABOUT American history"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"The depth and breadth of Proulx's writing ability is marvelously realized in this cleverly conceived anthology of lives tied together by a small green accordion. Far from the iconoclastic Northeast which bounded The Shipping News, this novel spans the time and geography beginning in late-19th Century Italy and ending in 1996 Texas, making one feel throughout that the author is a native of each of the regions and cultures. Her beauty of description and originality of metaphor is stunning for contemporary fiction, and her use of dialect is rich, diverse, and squarely places the reader within each culture. One does not read this book -- one experiences it.

I hope I will not be repetitive.Proulx did not disappoint me with &quot;Accordian Crimes,&quot; but she didn't convince me that this is close to her best work. That obviously is yet to come.It's interesting the Southern Chester County, Penn., reader rated the book with five stars, having been initiated to the text via a book-on-tape. I had read portions aloud from this book to my teenage daughter, and the difference created by hearing the words aloud was startling. Proulx is a magician with the meanings and sounds of words and with her for gift for creative, definitive description and detail. I found myself many times re-reading sentences and marveling at Proulx's craft, much more so than with any other book I've read in recent years.I was also impressed with the random brutality of the green accordian's journey, running helter skelter from generation to generation in America's heartland. Proulx has so many great gifts just waiting to tackle a truly great project.What will separate great craft from a masterpiece in a future Proulx project will be whether she develops the &quot;fire in the belly&quot; to say something that she feels is really important. I know she has all of the writing tools and depth to deliver a truly powerful and meaningful book."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I started Accordian Crimes as a book-on-tape. After listening to Side 1 of the first cassette, I pulled it from the tape player. THIS was a book to be read--and savored. I got a hold of the hardcover and found it hard to put down. Proulx is a fabulous writer whose research and talent allows her writing to go all over the place emotionally, geographically, historically, and ethnically. I think my favorite part was the chapter on the Germans in Iowa. Out of nothing they built a town; their grandson years later is beat up during WWI due to anti-German sentiment. The oversexed German and his obliging wife are great characters. I think this book could be required reading for any American history or sociology college-level class. The prejudice the characters face would make for an interesting discussion. This book though is LITERATURE, and it is just as good, just as American as anything the overrated Hemingway ever published."},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"I must admit I agree with the less-favorable of the reviews listed here, even though I tried hard to like this book. The synopsis sounded interesting to me--one hundred years in the life of a hand-made accordion, passed on from generation to generation, ethnicity to ethnicity. A grand idea, mini-series material. My curiosity was piqued. I had to admire any author who had the guts to tackle such a project.Unfortunately, this was not a book that gripped me. It did not make me want to stay up late to read it or go out and recommend it to everyone I know; it did not give me any new and interesting insights into the human condition. Basically, it did not make me *feel* much.What I did like about the book was Proulx's command of the language. Every once in a while, I would read a sentence and think, &quot;wow,&quot; which does make me optimistic enough to want to try Proulx's other novels.Throughout the book, Proulx finishes with a character by summarizing the rest of his or her life in one paranthetical paragraph. Each of the characters that are discarded in this way inevitably end up living a bizarre and unbelievably unlucky life and dying a strange death. I felt these were unnecessary and did not add anything to the book, except perhaps a feeling of triteness. These afterthoughts could have been written by anyone called upon to create a weird story; they didn't make me feel like I was getting to know a character any better.As a final note, I, too, felt that &quot;Accordion Crimes&quot; is not a novel but a series of short stories linked by a common element. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but I don't feel that it was the intention"},{"Title":"Accordion Crimes","review":"This book held me mesmerized throughout with its incredible prose descriptions that captured and held me in its grip. It exposes the reader to a multitude of cultures down to the most minute details. I kept reading it aloud, savoring it. A must read."},{"Title":"Go: A novel ([Classic reprint series])","review":"&quot;Go,&quot; generally acknoweldged as the first of the Beat Generation novels, was Holmes' first novel and it shows many of the typical flaws of the first major work of a talented artist. The tone is incosistent, the plot tends to wander, and the first half the book has a tendency to drag. That said, &quot;Go&quot; is still a worthwhile novel. Much as his friend Jack Kerouac would later do, Holmes essentially records his life as an aspiring writer living on the fringes of the postwar New York underground. Under various aliases, such familiar characters as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Neal Cassady wander through the book. In its loose, episodic fashion, &quot;Go&quot; tells the story of a young writer who, while desperately trying to complete his first novel, watches his friends and wife dance through a decadent society, fueled by their own desire to say something original in a world that seems to fear and despise anything less than the purely conventional. Its a familiar plot but Holmes truly manages to capture both the excitement and the fear that goes with being both young and undiscovered. This a book that will be easily understood by anyone who has ever been convinced that they, for whatever reason, have been blessed with the ability to see both the beauties and the horrors of modern life that the rest of the world seems to safely ignore. As well, the book serves as a sad lament for both the promise and the ultimate fate of the original members of the Beat Generation. Though Holmes couldn't have realized it at the time, some of the book's most powerful scenes comes from having the knowledge of the ignominous fates that await characters like Gene Pasternak (Jack Kerouac) and Hart Kennedy (Neal Cassady) once they find the success that they are so desperately seeking. Even if uneven, it makes for an exhilirating read that, in the wonderful final chapter, truly does leave the reader feeling as if he has -- for a moment -- been transported back to the New York of the 1950s, when it truly seemed that these fatally flawed geniuses held the future and the salvation of American literature in their hands.Though he is usually credited with both coining the much maligned term &quot;Beat Generation&quot; as well as writing &quot;Go,&quot; the first truly Beat novel, John Clellon Holmes has long been overshadowed by more experimental contemporaries like Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs. As Holmes himself acknowledged in personal interviews and this autobiographical novel, he was always on the fringe of the main Beat group -- i.e., a somewhat conservative, responsible intellectual trying to make a name for himself amongst a group that prided itself on being neither conservative nor responsible. Holmes is one of the few important Beat figures to never figure importantly into any of Kerouac's novels and his writing style was far more conventional than those of the better known Beats. As a result, &quot;Go&quot; has too often been unjustly ignored by modern-day adherents to the Beat Generation. This is unfair because &quot;Go,&quot; though certainly imperfect, is still a valuable look at these future mythological figures before they become legends and is an entertaining work on its own."},{"Title":"Go: A novel ([Classic reprint series])","review":"Holmes is generally considered to be a Beat novelist, but that label creates unfair expectations for those who have not read his work. In truth, Holmes' writing is a narrow bridge between writer's of the 30's and early 40's and the Beats. His style is reminiscent of Thomas Wolfe to an extreme--something Kerouac was guilty of in 'The Town and the City.' The problem with this novel is that Holmes wants so badly to chronicle the activities and attitudes of the Beats, but he can't pull it off stylistically. Kerouac's spontaneous prose was better suited for the subject matter and themes. This is why Kerouac, not Holmes, is generally considered the King of the Beats. Holmes' prose is dense with word illustrations and bland dialogue. Compare this with Kerouac's economy of words and beat-laiden dialogue, and you'll see why Kerouac's chronicles of the Beat Generation more fully capture the essence and spirit of the movement. If you truly enjoy Thomas Wolfe, you'll like Holmes. But if you're thinking 'Go' is anything like 'On the Road,' think again."},{"Title":"Go: A novel ([Classic reprint series])","review":"Whenever the immortal giants are discussed and associated with The Beat Generation the trinity of Kerouac, Ginsberg and Cassady top the list. After reading &quot;Go&quot; by John Clellon Holmes I feel he deserves some recognition. His story follows 4 major characters that howl through early 50's New York along with a cast of minor junkies, addicts and Hobbes' wife who can't decide what she wants. From smoky jazz clubs like The Go Hole and all night &quot;tea&quot; parties Hobbes(holmes), Pasternak(kerouac), Stofsky(ginsberg) and Kennedy(cassady) face life's situations and decisions with actions and reactions that portrayed most everyone who would become what is known as &quot;The Beat Generation.&quot; And, as we all know, that was really the beginning of all that is hip, cool, far-out and trendy."},{"Title":"Go: A novel ([Classic reprint series])","review":"An Extremely Important Book In The Beat CanonWe all know that Jack Kerouac was a more important writer than J C Holmes. More poetic, more rhythmic, more original, more driven by his passion, but was he more aware of the situation, and the relationships, and insightful? That's what I'm left wondering after returning to Holmes' book Go after I put it down 30 years ago, (I'm reading the 1959 British version The Beat Boys). I didn't finish it the first time, probably got less than a quarter of the way through it because it didn't seem to contain Kerouac's dream I found it too conventional, literate, dense with detail, dry?Now having read all of the Kerouac canon and having searched volumes' of letters of such for further knowledge of The Beat Generation I happen back on Go and having a heavy bout of flu have the time to settle back by the fire with cat on lap and re-discover it - and by God it's all here, everything I ever wanted to know about the early days. You know how you wish you could have a time machine and travel back to be at a beat party in, say, 1949 and see Jack, and Neal, Luanne and Allen as they really were through the eyes of (yourself or) someone else - well now you can, it's incredible!And not written in retrospect by someone putting the record straight or playing to an audience, satisfying a fandom, but Holmes is writing about them before he even knew that they would ever become famous (why?). Why would you do that? They must have been an extraordinary group of people or just I suppose living life in a wild way that didn't go on in the war years. Do you write books about your groups of friends? Documenting their every move? Yet Holmes does, and it's lucky for us he did. And the insight he shows on what those guys were like! Wow! and not just a couple of paragraphs or a soundbite that you might get from a friend talking on a video documentary but page after page of observing their lives. Point made.This book is such a gift to Beat fans. As I say I attempted reading it about 30 years ago after reading Kerouac's euphoric hypnotic first person accounts of the Beatosphere and found 'Go' formal/dry/dense/ and not knowing the characters, gave up a quarter way through.If I say that this book is as good a book as On the Road you know I'm not spoofing, because I'm one of Jack's biggest, long standing, fans and I wouldn't say such a thing lightly. The difference being, probably, that whereas OTR appeals to everybody with no background knowledge of the beat scene of the late fourties with Go a little prior knowledge of that scene and it's characters helps.If Kerouac is the poet. Holmes is the realist. He lives with them, travels with them, enters into their 'experiences', but never judges, lets you draw your own conclusions. In fact it's questionable, was John a Beat? I think he'd say he was, he certainly loved them and was one of Jack's best friends.With the film (American: movie) of On the Road finally being released to cinemas (American: theatres) near you the biographies of the Beats will abound, but Go which came out before any of the beat books will probably in the end prove to be the best biography to get. The others will almost certainly be judgemental, the biographers will be running their moral slide rules across the Beats, like an investigator entering a monastery and saying \\"this is all very well but these men are shirking their responsibility to support a woman and procreate\\". The said investigator not questioning his morals that society these days helps him support the woman to procreate with tax breaks and such and the children he procreates will be put through a school system which he himself hated, a work system which he himself hated and maybe made to inflict suffering on others by joining the armed forces.This is a very long book.I started out reading it to gain insight into Kerouac and Cassady and ended getting insight into Holmes and even myself. Outside of the Beats there are some marvellous passages and character observations. Take this page for instance -Google: \\"Amazon\\"Then: \\"Go by John Clellon Holmes\\"Then: \\"Click to Look Inside\\" the book and search for the words:\\"cool, laughing couples\\"- how's that for wandering through a lonely city?orTake for, instance, this short passage:After a nights heavy party, the host Hobbes (Clellon Holmes) having seen Kerouac, Cassady and attendant girlfriends and others out, goes to the bathroom:\\"Hobbes was dizzy and nauseated from the beer and the marijuana and, leaving Dinah to arrange the spare blankets, he went into the bathroom to make himself vomit as was his habit whenever he was too drunk or sick to sleep.\\"While leaning over the toilet getting up his nerve, he thought that the moment before making yourself throw up must be very like the instant before suicide. You are almost content to bear the sickening headache and the torment in your stomach rather than go through that moment. But the prospect of relief made you fool-hardy and you jammed your finger down your throat.\\"Do you get many passages in Kerouac as self-realising and insightful as that?Was a time when I though that I'd discovered/read the whole Beat oeuvre: three quarters of Jack's books, Junky and Naked Lunch, Howl. That was about the lot I thought. Now I include Holmes' Go which I think can stand head and shoulders high with that group. Go, buy it!It's time to take Go from the back of the bookcase, dust the cobwebs off of it, and put it up front between On the Road and Junky where it belongs. When's the film of Go being made?But nothing I've told you so far prepares you for Part 2 Chapter 8 when Luanne and Neal fight this is some kind of crescendo but we're nowhere near the end of the book yet. It's so man/woman as they really are. So much deeper into male/female relationships than anything Kerouac attempted (or could accomplish) in his books. (From what I've read of him anyway.) This is probably because Holmes being a long-time married man could empathise with male/female entwinement better than Jack who was always on the retreat from it.I've got to Page 147 (three quarters of the way through) and I'm feeling emotionally drained. I've been to a beatnik party (O.K. a Beat party) with Jack Kerouac, John Clellon Holmes, Allen Ginsberg, Holmes' wife, Neal Cassady, Luanne Henderson, (all under their stage names, or pseudonyms to be precise), find out what their pseudonyms in the book are by Googling:>GO by John Clellon Holmes (Scribner's, 1952) Character name:&lt;This cast list thanks to the Beat scholar Dave Moore, of Bristol, U.K. on his website >beatbookcovers&lt;But as I was saying courtesy of this book I've been to a Beat party, I've scoured New York city with Neal Cassady for marijuana, I've frequented several cold water walk ups (which I take to be the American way of saying bed-sits in tenement blocks where you have to boil your own water (no heating), this is the late \`forties after all). Listened to hot bop jazz on the radio with those self-same Beats as I recovered from a hangover (\\"Turn it down!\\") in one of the walk-ups. But most importantly, lived through (or observed at close quarters) the emotionally wrenching warm blooded relationships of the people concerned. Only a married man or a man who had a great rapport with women could write about personal relationships with the opposite sex so un-flinchingly, and in this book John Clellon Holmes delivers the goods.This might seem like an over-long rave review but this book is a revelation. Holmes pokes into every corner of the Beat experience leaving no roach unexamined whether he's bathing Herbert Huncke's ulcerated feet while the exhausted engenderer undergoes cold turkey or attending a post war jazz fuelled jump-joint rave he's there, recording it for posterity."},{"Title":"Go: A novel ([Classic reprint series])","review":"At the moment of writing I have not finished John Clellon Holmes' novel yet. My reason for writing a review now is not to discuss the book (which seems to be quite eloquent and insightful thus far), but to warn potential buyers about the e-book.

Although Go was published in 1952,5 years before On The Road, by Jack Kerouac, Kerouac had actually written On The Road in 1950 and it took him 7 years to get it published. Part of the problem was he had to get signed releases from everyone in the book, himself. Also, he had to change the names of towns, etc. There was a bit of tension between Holmes and Kerouac, but for the Beat scholar, Kerouac's novel can't be touched. On The Road stands alone.

Excellent."},{"Title":"Medieval people,","review":"Eileen Power's Medieval People sets out to study the Middle Ages not from the viewpoint of an Historical abstraction, but rather from that of the people who lived during the age. It is an account of six individuals who lived during the MA's; Bodo, a Frankish Peasant; Marco Polo, the famous Venetian merchant; Madame Eglentyne, prioress of Chaucer; an anonymous middle-class Parisian housewife; and two English merchants, one engaged in the wool trade and the other a clothier in Essex. The author has illustrated various aspects of social life of the era by drawing on such sources as account books, diaries, letters, records, and wills. She starts the work with a previously unpublished essay entitled &quot;The Precursors,&quot; which describes the barbarian conquest of Rome. In this, she describes the lives of three men, Ausonius, Sidonius and Fortunatus and uses them to foreshadow the life that would re-emerge in the Middle Ages.She starts by imagining a day in the life of the Peasant Bodo, in the time of Charlemagne. From her study of primarily economic documents from the Middle Ages of this time, she not only extrapolates but truly brings to life Bodo and his wife Ermentrude. From there, she goes on to the better documented life of Marco Polo, and also describes how he served as an inspiration for Columbus. Madam Eglentyne is next. Here, Power humorously details the inner workings of a gossipy nunnery and how Eglentyne would have gone about her life as an aristocratic women of God. She next details the life of a middle class Parisian housewife by studying the contents of the Menagier's Wife and validating many of it's points by citing other documents. She concludes by detailing the lives of the two Thomases; Betson and Paycocke of Coggeshall. Both are merchants and provide a chance for Power to really show off her grasp of medieval economics as well as an ability to compile disparate correspondences into a story of a life. This is a rare scholarly work that truly entertains while being read. One of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Medieval people,","review":"Eileen Power studies the Middle Ages, not from an abstract historical point of view but from simple and real people and what we can know about them. I particularly like her study of Marco Polo, from his notes and diaries, which gives us a materialistic and realistic vision of what they saw of the world, and not what we want to see of what they saw. I also loved Madame Eglentyne, a prioress taken from Chaucer but at once identified to one particular prioress through real life archives and descriptions. A very interesting and useful book to enable us to capture the density of everyday life in the Middle Ages.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Medieval people,","review":"Wonderful scholarship in a most readable written style. Goes beyond institutions to discover real people of the &quot;middle&quot; ages."},{"Title":"Medieval people,","review":"A Medieval Home Companion: Housekeeping in the Fourteenth CenturySadly, what medieval history is taught in our high schools concentrates only on what the aristocracy did in England, with the occasional nod to Charlemagne. \\"Medieval People\\" succeeds in giving the reader a more balanced look, with sections on France, Italy, China, the Levant, in addition to Merrie Olde. I particularly enjoyed the section on Bodo and Ermentrude, peasants on an estate owned by a French monastery; and the section on The Householder of Paris. Instead of showing peasant life as merely nasty, brutish, and short, the author gives 3 dimensions to Bodo as he works for himself and the monks, how he and his wife spend their respective days (note: Ermentrude did NOT merely stay home and \\"raise the children\\"), their enjoyment of festivals and fairs, their relationships with other peasants and landlords, etc. The author's summary of the Householder of Paris' treatise on marriage to his young wife was concise and entertaining. Suggestion: If this section piques your interest, have a look at Tania Bayard's outstanding translation, \\"A Medieval Home Companion\\"."},{"Title":"Medieval people,","review":"Since this book attempts to describe the daily lives and lifestyles of people living during the Medieval period, the concept behind it is brilliant, so I had high expectations. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably in its execution.I read the first chapter, the one on Bodo. It was OK, so I thought the book had potential. The next person was Marco Polo. After pages and pages in English, and also in Latin and French too (which I do not know), describing places, people, rulers, dates, trade-routes, and exotic merchandise connected with Venice (and still no mention of Marco Polo), it became difficult to decipher what she was saying since it was all so unfamiliar to me.The author's narrative is difficult to follow, unless you are an academic scholar already well versed in the historical and literary events, people, and places she refers to in her work. The positive reviewers are most likely more learned and read than I, and could therefore follow the storyline and enjoy the book. However, for me, it became a chore to plow through the seemingly endless and unfamiliar references that form the basis of this book. I had to skip all the Latin and French parts, which are not translated into English. In the end, I gave up. Even though I did not enjoy the book, I gave it two stars because the Kindle edition is free, if you want to try.If you are knowledgeable about the Medieval Period and its history then you might enjoy this narrative. If you want more down-to-earth descriptions about the people and lifestyle of the Medieval period, I suggest you search for a book that is easier to read."},{"Title":"Medieval people,","review":"I cannot say more than what the other reviewers have said in their positive reviews about this book. The Middle Ages have always fascinated me, and I would recommend this little book highly to anyone who wants an introduction to that time period, without having to worry about Kings and Queens and dates of battles. While those are important--of course--the author emphasizes the lives of several people at different time periods during the Medieval era.Thinking of how long the Medieval era lasted, depending on what source is followed, it could be from the fall of Rome to the Renaissance...this was not a static time period. Just like our own era there was constant change and a steady growth in science, and in rediscovering what had been lost during the worst of the \\"Dark Ages\\". This book, while short, gives the feel of the movement, the forward progression that was occuring during this era.Her chapter on Marco Polo is one of the most interesting ones; it is not quite in keeping with all the others, in that he is someone famous then and now, and his discoveries changed beliefs in his own time and after. She ends that chapter with a little known sailor, Christopher Columbus, referring to Marco Polo's books and maps while planning his voyage to India...Otherwise the majority of the five individuals profiled are average people of their time. Certainly the author could have chosen any differnt five to make similar points, but overall the book gives a good look at that era and whets the appetite for more."},{"Title":"Medieval people,","review":"I very much enjoyed this book on my MP3, but I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is not (as I am) fluent in the subtleties of the mores, language and customs of Medieval times, as well as Latin and French.Eileen Power (the author) frequently uses terms with which the modern reader will not be familiar without explanation. For example, she speaks at length about the cloth industry, and repeatedly mentions fullers and fulling without once explaining the duties of the fuller. Wikipedia defines fulling as a step in woolen clothmaking which involves the cleansing of cloth (particularly wool) to eliminate oils, dirt, and other impurities, and making it thicker. Few modern readers would know (without continually resorting to another reference) many of the terms frequently used which are important for following the stories told in this book. The rare definitions she does provide tend to be for terms which are not essential to the stories and are notable by their very rarity.Long sections of the book are written in Latin french (I have no idea if it is modern or Medieval french) with no translation. As someone who knows little to no french or Latin, this was quite frustrating. An occasional french phrase might be puzzled out in a similar book, but entire pages are not within the grasp of the average reader, even the average well educated (American) reader.The author dropped names from literature with which she expected the reader to be immediately familiar. She expected an immediate familiarity with each of the characters from Chaucer, and their habits and stories, as well as other literary and historical figures. I can not quote other examples as I have to admit to not being familiar enough with some of them to have remembered them, and as I tend to listen to my MP3 while driving I could not take notes for later reference.A note specific to the audio listener - the reader had one of the best voices. It was smooth and melodic, an absolute joy to the ear!Although I enjoyed this book quite a bit, I could not help but wish the author had written it for the common man, not to impress her fellow scholars. One would expect her editor to see this problem and tell her to define her terms, and to translate the foreign passages. This small change would have made this book go from a book which now would confuse most people to a medieval primer, suitable to introduce the masses to social history."},{"Title":"Medieval people,","review":"This book gave me some good insight to those who lived in Medieval times. Much better than I had before. Yes people lived on Manors with a lord, and serfs who took care of the land for them by planting, caring for animals, barrel making, housekeeping and the like but life in the middle ages was so much more. Residents of Venice worked in trading and shipping with Asian goods. Marco Polo spent years in China with Kubla Khan. People were well connected to the church and many lived as priests and nuns. They were all called to their vocation and the rules were so strict that many lived to defy them. The lives of husbands and wives were not usually love matches but arranged and the power of the woman was much less of a man's. But in the excerpt chosen we see a much older husband provide valuable advice to his young wife. England grows in power near the end of the middle ages bringing increase contact with the outside world and into what would be called its Renaissance. Interesting book."},{"Title":"Medieval people,","review":"It is an interesting summary of the lives of people in early times.

Code's books are obtuse and difficult to read and this is simple and direct from one of the most talented roadracers ever. It covers set-up, training, bike prep, testing and more. All more from the perspective of what Roberts did when he raced rather than a step by step process of &quot;how to&quot;. The book is ghost written in the first person and is a little cocky (which you'd expect) and dated (since it was written in the 80's) but none of this really detracts as it's a fantastic insight into one of the greatest racers of our time. If you race motorcycles you must have this in your library."},{"Title":"Techniques of Motor Cycle Road Racing","review":"Great book from Kenny Roberts point of view.

He chats away with you on little tips like how to make your bean salad ever stronger tasting, on episodes from his childhood, on the Tuscan way of life in the old days. With the polenta recipe you read about the &quot;heartbreaking imagination&quot; of the poor people who made endless varieties of polenta dishes for all three meals. He makes you laugh throughout the book with tales like his first kiss with his face among the stinging nettles--just before the grilled vegetable recipe. A full of life book!

For the most part these are dishes you eat in the homes of Tuscany, not the restaurants. The ingredients are authentic, the recipes honest and simple. Of all the cookbooks I own this one has the most bookmarks; a sure sign that it holds a disproportionate number of favorite recipes. That it contains gentle reminiscences of life, Tuscany, family, and food is a bonus.As to the lack of precise measurements for some of the ingredients, no self-respecting nonna is going to measure much of anything with tools more precise than eyes, hands and a convenient spoon.

This book not only helped me overcome my diffidence, but also provided me with a very thorough understanding of the basics of the subject.It is extremely difficult to criticize this book in any way. The language is plain English, not the technical jargon which other \\"introductory\\" books use. The book does not assume that the reader has a thorough understanding of linear algebra. Only a course in differential and integral calculus will do. The book provides several primers on a lot of topics- matrices, analysis, vectors etc., so that you do not have to interrupt your optimization studies and digress into these subjects.There are three full chapters where the author provides real-life examples of mathematical modeling. Again, these are built up step-by-step, and not shoved down your throat.The different approach to the Simplex Method is more intuitive than the traditional approach and more logical. The basic discussions on integer programming and non-linear programming are also worth mentioning. The numerous exercises and the presence of solutions to a number of them in the end make the text even more helpful.The only somewhat weak point of the text is the chapter on interior point methods, where the book only provides the formulae and states that the derivations are \\"beyond the scope of the book\\". But, this is negligible and I recommend the book wholeheartedly"},{"Title":"Optimization in Operations Research","review":"In my work I needed to find the shortest path from a single point to a set of points. This book really helped me to find the suitable method: the Dijkstra algorithm. I began reading Chapter 9, which is &quot;Shortest Paths and Discrete Dynamic Programming&quot;.

I haven't read the other chapters since they are not required for my work at this moment and I don't have ample time to make a full review; however, I can say this: My many years in research in several fields have often put me in a position of transfering mathematical algorithms in one field to another or to search for an effecient one.

I've bought seven of her books, and the one I usually revisit first is \\"One's Company.\\" Living alone can give you some serious things to think about. It hadn't occurred to me, for instance, that I might ever want to change a lock; here was an older sister taking my situation in hand and walking me through it with details I'd need to know: which way does the keyhole fit? What are all those scored lines and why do I need to pay attention to them? If you've ever had to ask someone where a certain tool is, and then endure their doing the project for you (possibly damaging something upon installation, which you will have to look at a dozen times a day for years), you are relieved at that point to take over and find your own way with the necessary tasks of life.Okay, it must be obvious that I'm three books into the Holland-fest; my language is taking on a tinge, isn't it? But I love the way she writes as much as I love the way she thinks. Oh, ask me about \\"Endangered Pleasures\\" or \\"Wasn't the Grass Greener?\\" I'm wallowing in Holland's books right now, and just wish I could thank her heartily for writing them. I like to think we'd sit at the table for hours."},{"Title":"One's Company : Reflections on Living Alone","review":"Barbara Holland died on September 19, 2010. She was an acquaintance and lived in our area, but not very close to us. Barbara was a guest speaker at our small neighborhood book club meetings several times, twice in my home. She had authored about 15 books on a variety of subjects. Her writing was very unique.Our small group loved having her attend our meetings. She spoke about her books and enlightened us about what she was thinking when she wrote the particular book under discussion. She enjoyed her cigarettes and a glass of something good to drink, she favored scotch. She was witty, very bright and kept us entertained with her many stories. She would autograph our books and sometimes bring extra copies of her other titles which we could buy. Her visits made for some of our most memorable meetings. I ran into her occasionally, but had no other contact with her.I was thinking about her recently and decided to read One's Company, Reflections on Living Alone. Barbara had written the book in 1992. I was overwhelmed by what she had written. The book is all about dealing with living alone. Who will fix the broken appliances, bring you hot tea when you have a cold, or just care about you? How sad it would be to go home to a lonely house and wished someone you loved was there to greet you. Yes, you will find the amusing quips which Barbara delivered so well, but you'll also feel her loneliness. It made me think of so many people that live a solitary lifestyle. It never occurred to me until now that we should have invited Barbara to all of our book club meetings. Maybe she wouldn't have come, but maybe she would have been pleased, and accepted the invitation. I guess I'll never know.Her story is entertaining and sad, but I learned a lot and I'm so glad that I took the time to remember Barbara and read ONE'S COMPANY."},{"Title":"One's Company : Reflections on Living Alone","review":"I bought this book because for over 15 years I've had one of Ms. Holland's short articles hanging on my refrigerator. It was a piece entitled \\"The Man of My Dreams\\" and it always seemed to be read by bows and the men in my life. If only they had taken it more seriously....This book is a great collection of advice giving in the good spirit of literature that Barbara Holland always provides. It makes you think, makes you pause, and makes you laugh out loud. I recommend this book and any of her books highly. She is really a good writer and deals with her subject matter honestly."},{"Title":"One's Company : Reflections on Living Alone","review":"Having found this book, I let it sit for awhile, reluctant to open it, expecting to read yet another painful book on how to conduct my life. Instead, I was surprised to find a book that resonated with my life experience, putting into words that which I could not describe. What relief!Through keen observation & wit, Ms. Holland does an excellent job of describing the difference between voluntary & involuntary loneliness and the results of such imprisonment.The chapter on food and shelter is so astute, I've been quoting passages from it: explaining to others (who also insist that they are lonely) of the kind of loneliness that comes from dining alone vs. ordering takeout & sitting in the safe confines of my small space, preparing a meal for one, and food that tastes of sadness. Finally! Someone who understands what I've known for a long time!I also enjoyed Ms. Holland's perceptive humor re. fears of food that may cause or prevent illness, as determined by the fickle watchdog groups: \\"They keep changing the rules. We have to stay alert, and read the papers daily to update our food phobias.\\" Ain't it the truth, tho'? Gave me a good chuckle.As much as I love her philosophical musings, I did not really connect with the chapter on anxiety, trivializing all fear to fear of the criminal out there. The illusion of safety in numbers can provide a false sense of security. So I disagree with Ms. Holland's assessment here.And the chapter on fixing doorknobs is a waste of paper. Skip over it. It felt like Ms. Holland had a sudden urge to turn her book into a \\"how-to\\" manual.I felt like Ms. Holland really understood some of the visceral pain of loneliness (which is Not the same as Solitude), and put into words that which is usually undefinable.One could choose to be alone on Thanksgiving, if they don't want to deal with their relatives, & feel satisfaction in finding something to do to nurture their soul. But when One finds themselves alone, when all those relatives are no longer alive, it's a very different kettle of fish.

First I turned to my primary care physician. He had nothing to offer but sleeping pills. Then I went to the sleep clinic at St. Peter's Hospital in New Brunswick. A resident took my history and the doctor handed me a yellow sheet with sleep hygiene items on it. It appears that unless one has sleep apnea, there is nothing that an insomniac can do. Unless one is a millionaire, and the cost of a doctor is not an issue, there is no where to go. John Weidman's book gives the average person who is an insomniac hope and discrete actions that can be taken. I recommend the book highly. In addition, John is available via email and will respond very quickly. Other authors, especially the one in Harvard, refuse to answer emails. Buy John's book...you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"I am a former insomniac that has been to two sleep clinics. I found John Wiedman's book tremendously helpful. The book is a commmon sense approach for dealing with a sleep problem that is behavioral based. I found the advise easy to follow.

I would encourage ohers who suffer from insomnia to give it a try."},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' is by far the best book I've read about insomnia. Unlike other books written on insomnia, this book leaves you feeling like there is hope and control over your sleep disorder.It's about time someone who has actually suffered from long term, cronic insomnia, and has overcome it, has written a book about the subject. Other books are written by people with no first hand experiential knowledge of the subject. They seem to be oblivious as to the devastation insomnia can inflict upon someones life and have a one size fits all approach in dealing with the problem, rather then an individualized plan of treatment, which is available in the book. This is a refreshing approach to a serious condition.The book is well written, compationate, positive, humorous and powerful. This is a book every insomnia sufferer should read. There is hope and this book is the key to unlocking that potential."},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"John Weidman has been a dear friend of mine for many years, and I have watched him suffer with insomnia throughout our friendship. Determined to lick this problem without the use of drugs, he researched and experimented with different approaches until he found one that worked for him--and it does work. His behavior modification approach makes so much sense and is so simple to incorporate into anyone's lifestyle. Do yourself a favor by investigating his recommendations.

After years of suffering from insomnia, I was able to teach my body to sleep again. I no longer take medication to sleep at night or suffer from sleep deprivation. I have fully rejoined the ranks of those people who enjoy the benefits of a good night's sleep. John's book gave me a clear step by step approach for successfully overcoming my insomnia.

I am totally adverse to taking prescription medications of any kind.Since I had not suffered from sleep deprivation my entire life, I believed that there was something that had caused this chronic problem beginning in 1992. John's dry wit and style of writing made for easy as well as enjoyable reading. Since John is not a clinician, his book is written in layman terms which makes it very easy to understand.His methodical approach to identifying the cause of the sleep deprivation and then outlining the necessary steps to correct the situation is classic problem management applied to what would typically be considered a medical problem. John's techniques work. Within two months of starting John's program my chronic problem was reduced to an occasional restless night.This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"I read Desperately Seeking Snoozin over the Christmas holidays after just experiencing three long grueling months of not being able to sleep. I have read a lot of books on sleeping in the past and this is the first book I have read that actually helped. I have tried everything that is suggested in the book and it has really made a world of difference. I go to bed later than I was going to bed before and I get up at the same time each and every morning. I have a hot bath before bed and I try the relaxation exercises in bed. The book really changed my life. My sleeping difficulties were hindering my performance at work and it was affecting my marriage. I have also started exercising on a regular basis which has a made a tremendous difference in my life. I am in the process of recommending this book to all my friends and colleagues who are also experiencing sleep problems."},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"&quot;Desperately Seeking Snoozin&quot; is a book that depicts the experience of insomnia and the road to recovery. It is filled with accurate analysis and treatments of the many possible constituents that can contribute to the origin of insomnia. The author gives an authentic portrayal of his experience of insomnia and the approach he takes to cure this most toublesome disorder. The reader can feel the author's passion as he provides a comprehensive review of the many causes and treatment approaches to insomnia. He also has a way of conveying to the reader the importance of maintaining an intense dedication to adhering with his treatment program. He uses humor, self revealing stories, current professional sources and accounts from other people suffering from insomnia to convey the importance of identifying the contributing factors. He accurately reminds the reader that these contributing factors may be different for each individual sleep problem, and helps the reader to discover for themselves what works and what doesn't. Mr. Wiedman shows how important it is for the person who has insomnia to continually monitor the treatment approach and ongoing sleep habits. It is clear that Mr. Wiedman has put a lot of work and research into this subject. I believe that anyone suffering from insomnia can be helped by reading this book. I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with insomnia. Richard G.

All doctors want to do is throw pills at you or tell you to go for therapy. Neither is a cure! I have been through insomnia many times before. What the author describes in the book as conditioned insomnia & also restless legs syndrome is EXACTLY what I had. I read this book entirely & did what he says to do. I actually slept for a couple of hours the very first night! I don't believe in sleeping pills even though I did try them out of exhaustion & they didn't work! This book works!

Miss five or six nights, and you begin to wonder lots of things about the quality of life. This book fills a large, gaping hole in the area of insomnia treatments. The insomnia sufferer knows like few others what the problem is like, what solutions work, which ones don't, and what to do when all else fails. I work in a sleep lab and have monitored sleep for nearly two decades, and I will honestly say that my clinical and technical insight into insomnia was severely limited--until John's book happened. I am pleased to report that my professional life, as well as those of our patients, have benefitted. Charles Dickens reported sleep apnea a long time ago, too (see the PICKWICK PAPERS). Great book!"},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"While the author is not a health professional, he nonetheless offers comfort and ideas for those suffering from sleeplessness.

The book provided the encouraging pep talks I needed to take a constructive, proactive approach to the sleep problem. The combination of John Weidman's friendly, caring approach and learning about the basics of sleep took away the worry that I'd never find good sleep again. I followed his suggested techniques and am happy to report that I'm sleeping well again. I highly recommend this book if you want to help yourself deal with your sleep problem in a sensible way.

Frustrated because you're constantly exhausted, but every time you try to get to bed early, collapse into sleep and get the rest you crave, something keeps your eyes peeled open for hours, tense and edgy. You might get one, two, four hours a night, but that's it. All you can think about day and night is sleep, or your lack thereof. Maybe you've been this way so long that you can't remember the last time you fell into bed without worrying about whether or not you'd be able to relax. Even sleeping pills don't work anymore.Well, John Wiedman has been there and knows exactly how you're feeling. Desperately Seekin' Snoozin isn't an easy cure, but insomnia isn't a simple problem: it's a learned habit that requires time to break, and you've got to follow his steps if you want to get out of your personal cycle of sleep deprivation. Wiedman's words are comforting because he knows what insomnia is all about; his writing is accessible for everyone, and although his cure will initially have you wondering how on earth you'll be able to get up in the morning, it really works. If you can't sleep, get ths book and follow the instructions to the letter. Don't deviate one iota from the steps! It's painful at first, but I followed his plan, broke my bad habits, and I've been sleeping peacefully for months now. Sweet dreams!"},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"Mr. Wiedman's book has really helped me in achieveing a good night's sleep, period. Quite honestly, that's all he ever aimed to achieve by writing this book. I don't think he's here to say that he's the only one to have found a way to beat insomnia. Rather, I feel he's writing a book to reach out to a lot of people who haven't gotten the help from sleep clinics in a practical and straight forward manner. Most importantly, he's a strong voice for getting people off of this whole roller coaster of pills and &quot;quick fixes&quot;, which too often the medical industry pushes on people, and that tends to threaten individuals in that cartel. He's achieved that goal with myself and that's quite important for me. That's a success, and if it can work for me, then it can quite possibly work for anyone with a problem sleeping. It's really no more difficult than that. I think that if more &quot;professionals&quot; in this sleep industry could feel more secure and keep their egos at bay they could see that his book has helped many overcome an often devastating problem."},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"This is the best of the several books I've read on this topic.

John Weidman has put together a common-sense program that truly works. After many years of suffering from insomnia, of taking medications to put myself to sleep and trying every &quot;cure&quot; known to man, I read this book and what the author had to say made so much sense to me. I put the principles to work and I now am able to get to sleep without medications or any other &quot;cures&quot;.

John Weidman is a tried and true author who shares his insomnia research. After trying several sleeping medications, I discovered the book on the internet and decided to read because I had nothing to lose. The author makes basic suggestions for getting some sleep and they really work. I was able to get some sleep after one week! The book also discusses possible reverse affects of sleeping medications.

The info is not new, not helpful, not... well, let's just say I saw it a conventional (offline, independent) bookstore, thought it was a cute title, and, being as short on time that day as I almost always am short on sleep, I didn't leaf through it before buying it. MISTAKE!I really resented paying money for this piece of self-congratulatory-ness. I'm glad the author found something that worked for him, I'm glad he suffered and then interrupted the cycle: hooray for anyone who does that, in any area of life. But it sure didn't do anything for me, and didn't tell me anything I didn't know.Aggravating waste of trees."},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"Unbelievably poorly written but does have some good ideas.In the appendix there is a comment from someone who claims they're a literary agent and that the writing is superb. I would surmise the person is not a successful literary agent."},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"Mr. Wiedman's collection and re-packaging of the original thinking of others would still pass for a decent book - kind of a \\"Dummy's Guide to Insomnia\\" or \\"Why Bubba Can't Sleep!\\" - were it not for the openly hostile attitude of the author to the whole of the mental health community, practitioners and patients alike. His book reinforces the stigma against mental illness so prevalent in our culture, a stigma that contributes to the gross under treatment of mental disorders across all segments of our society. Given that sleep disorders are highly concurrent with other neural problems Mr. Wiedman's attitudes perpetrate a grave disservice to a majority of insomniacs.Perhaps if Mr. Wiedman had not been so psycho-phobic and had pursued a program of behavioral and cognitive therapy with a good mental health provider he could have solved his sleep problems years ago. Instead he chooses to give the sleep clinic that knew this all along \\"two thumbs down\\" for not holding his hand and making sure he followed their advice. I'll try to be a bit fairer in my review and at least give the author one digit up!I urge you to pass this one by - there are better books from competent researchers on understanding sleep disorders and applying behavioral modification approaches for their treatment.

Mr. Wiedman does not make light of insomnia - to the contrary, he sincerely understands what you are going through. This man has been through some truly hard times and you can sense his compassion and desire to help others. This is what sets the book apart.I both laughed and cried while reading this book; it is very cathartic and reads like a novel at times. Although you may find other books containing more technical information, this book will give you that human touch that no other can provide.

The other books on sleep discuss medications to take, this book discusses how to change your behavior, and to get off medications, eat right, cut down on or stop caffeine, and to go to bed and wake up at the same time each night. It also discusses the following: info on sleep clinics, sleep cycles, self employment, night eating syndrome, restless legs syndrome, circadian rhythms disorders, conditionioned insomnia, sleep apnea. There are several chapters on sleep aids, medications, herbs, and the impact of medications on sleep stages. It goes into the long term use of sleeping pills, smoking, depression, excercise, and good health. The next part of the book looks into &quot;the solution&quot;, talk of a sleep diary, your medical history, a pre-sleep routine (like bathing before sleep induces sleep), relaxation techniques, trouble staying asleep (that was me along w/rls) and how much one should be committed to follow John Wiedman's book.

John gave me new hope and a new life. Following years of regular excercise, good diet, sleep clinics, sleep specialists, psychologists, pills, alcohol,and anything else I could imagine...finally, relief for me. After my last trip to the sleep clinic the diagnosis left me in tears. My doctor excitedly told me, &quot;I have great news for you, there's nothing wrong with you!&quot; I am thankful she suggested Desperately Seeking Snoozin'. I read John's book on vacation, Thanksgiving of 1998. This past Thanksgiving I celebrated 1 year of being cured. I have to remind myself of how miserable I used to be. My family still can't believe the new me! I don't want to forget that without this plain comman sense rescue, I would no longer be able to lead a normal life. I had been so sleep deprived I could no longer drive safely, I could no longer do my job! I had no energy to enjoy my family. This illness consumed my life.

You'll just become frustrated and even more wide awake. Get up at the same time but make going-to-bed time late enough so you'll be sure to be sleepy. If you still can't fall asleep go do something else until you are sleepy. The reason your cat doesn't suffer from sleeplessness is that she sleeps when she's sleepy and prowls when she's not. Insomnia is a byproduct of our civilization's insistence on schedules. You can't force yourself to sleep. Don't try.

Insomnia is kind of a personal problem and it was very interesting to read the various sleep disorders that others had.But the real benefit to the book is the practical guide to helping you address how to solve your sleeping problem.

The book will be particularly helpful for those that know there is no physical or mental problem keeping them from sleeping. In many cases, there is no physical or mental reason for the insomnia except for the fear of going to sleep. This book is perfect for helping you overcome the fear of bedtime and the anxiety that that comes with it. The book is a simple behavior modification technique that is easy to follow but produces results quickly. Best of all...it is drug free. I recommended this book to my family doctor and many friends that have struggled with insomnia. It can help you with not falling asleep, early awakenings, and trouble going back to sleep. I would also like to compliment Mr. John Wiedman. After reading the book, I was still struggling with sticking with the program. He supported me through email which motivated me to stick with it.

In addition to being an entertaining read, it supplies a firsthand account of dealing with insomnia along with essential information from sleep researchers and insomniacs. This alone makes this book one of the best ever written about insomnia (and I've read quite a few). I believe what makes this book special and more useful than other books is that John Weidman has identified the key discovery to falling asleep and staying asleep without use of drugs. Although I was skeptical about any &quot;cure&quot; for insomnia, this book has allowed me to overcome my 20 plus years of insomnia.Buying this book was a great investment.

Although at first blush, the advise almost seems overly simple, it works. I guess, like lots of good ideas and advise, sometimes simple is the best. I've suffered from insomnia on and off for about 25 years and I've tried most everything, including sleeping pills. I've been doing this program now for about 3 weeks and it has definitely improved my sleep. In those 3 weeks, I've had maybe 3 bad nights, and even those nights weren't as bad as what I used to consider bad. In addition to sleeping better, I have an extra hour or two at the end of the day because of how this program works. Over the years, I've read quite a bit about insomnia and sleep, like all of us insomniacs probably have, but I would say this book contains the most practical advise. While this program may not cure everyone's insomnia, at a minimum, it will certainly help everyone who has insomnia that is not related to some type of underlying physical condition."},{"Title":"Desperately Seeking Snoozin' : The Insomnia Cure from Awake to Zzzzz","review":"A book for the insomniac who has been there, done that!

Each and every book on bibical prophesy, I approach with an atheist's mindset. I have very high criteria for a book on prophesy before I'd consider recommending it to anyone. Each book I read on this topic has to prove to me several things...it has to be logical and forthright, the author has to back up his claims, and above all, it cannot be too preachy or heavy-handed as so to raise my hackles and put me on the defense.Hal Lindsey almost always fulfills that criteria in his writings, and &quot;Apocalypse Code&quot; is no exception. Not only does he explain why he thinks the way he does, and back up his interpretations with scriptural references, but he also gives examples and explainations of WHY he believes in the truth and validity of the Bible. Mr. Lindsey goes a step further in his interpretations. He interprets out of the GREEK LANGUAGE THE BIBLE WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN, in order to grasp the FULL context of what John was writing.Why Greek? Why not Hebrew? Because Greek was the language universally spoken in that general area at the time--a historic fact he illustrates through a brief discussion of the reign of Alexendander the Great--prophesised some 200 years earlier by Daniel, I think it was.Mr. Lindsey does not only do a remarkable, logical, calm and rational job of explaining the book of Revelation and other passages that refering to the times that are to come, but also does a wonderful job of covering the reasons WHY he believes this to be true.

It will also serve as a fantastic witnessing tool as it will appeal to even the most skeptical types. It clearly shows that we are most assuredly living in the last of the final days by comparing 'current events' with what has been prophecied. It also vividly and clearly explains and associated most of the 'symbolism' used in prophetic books with the objects, people and places being described by (1st century) the Biblical authors.

I also like the way the book explains how this generation is the likely generation that will see these things take place and I personally believe this. I recommend this book to anybody who is interested in Bible prophecy. Other books I would suggest are Grant R.

I have read many prophesy books by a variety of authors and this one stands out as the best. Well laid out and easy to follow. Good history lesson about Israel too.

This will apeal to believer and non-believer alike."},{"Title":"Apocalypse Code","review":"I'd give this book 100 stars, four thumbs up and many smiley faces, but since I can only give it 5,...My thoughts, unlike other's that have left reviews, are 100% on this writer. He is a very great teacher and anyone interested in the End Times and the decoding of Bible Prophecy should read this book.The Bible is NOT about \\"secret messages\\" as I read one other reviewer stating. It's about things written in one century's terms vs. our's now. (those are indeed codes that do need de-coding.) We now understand what was written in the Bible and what the meanings behind each symbol represents. (Bible Symbolism... that is why when you read John saw something \\"like this\\" or \\"like that\\". That is called symbols. This does indeed require interpretation. Decoding.)Another book I'd personally recommend reading if you have already read Apocalypse Code is The Antichrist and A Cup of Tea by Tim Cohen. These symbols in the books of Daniel and Revelation have many more meanings that what some of you give Hal or God, for that matter, credit for.Postmillennialists? Get you copy now!!!! This book might just change your views."},{"Title":"Apocalypse Code","review":"Anyone who has heard the terms &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Rapture&quot; or &quot;Antichrist&quot; but doesn't really know what they mean should own this book. Hal Lindsey is able to discuss and explain the Bible's Book of Revelations in a straightforward, easy to read manner. He takes the symbolic language of Revelations and demonstrates how they apply to the world today. Even experienced students of Bible prophecy will find new insights into the reasons for the current world state. DO NOT PASS UP THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Apocalypse Code","review":"Most if not all of the material in this book is to be found in earlier books by this same author and many others of the same genre. The only thing new is the author's claimed discovery that the book of Revelation was encoded and he has discovered the key to unlock the code.What the author proposes is that the book of Revelation is &quot;encoded&quot; because John could not have understood the things which he saw because they were to occur some 2000 years into the future or so. He supports this by giving to the term Apocalypse the meaning &quot;the disclosure of secrets belonging to the last days&quot;. Apocalypse Code p.33His claim of confirmation of this &quot;code&quot; is based upon Daniel 12:4, 8-10 in which Daniel is instructed to &quot;shut up [encode] the words and seal the scroll&quot;. Apocalypse Code p.38This reviewer however finds a fallacy in his reasoning based upon Revelation 22:10 in which John is instructed &quot;Do NOT seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near.&quot; Or according to Mr. Lindsey's interpretation, &quot;Do NOT ENCODE the words of the prophecy of this book&quot;. This same text also seems to discredit the author's assumption that these event would take place in the distant future.On a final note, many of Mr. Lindsey's claims regarding the &quot;signs&quot; of the end applying to the present time have adequately been shown to be without foundation in the book &quot;The &quot;Sign&quot; of the Last Days: When?&quot; by Carl Olaf Jonsson and Wolfgang Herbst."},{"Title":"Apocalypse Code","review":"I have read this as well as other Hal Lindsey books. I have never found Hal to predict the day or the hour that the end times are coming. But I have found him to do his best to recognize the seasons. Just as the Bible says that we can do.

It made begin to re-focus my life."},{"Title":"Apocalypse Code","review":"It seems to me that if Mr. Lindsey's predictions came true, he would have turned in his word processor and become a professional flying harp player, along with all of his followers, long ago. As one who was forced to read his &quot;Late Great Planet Earth&quot; in my public school English class, I beleive Mr. Lindsey is continuing to do what he did then. Tell everyone that the end is near and try and get them convert out of fear, not understanding. His evangelical method is to bring people to Christ through scaring them of the horrors that await them in just a few short days, months, years, if they are not &quot;saved&quot;.This book is just the same song, 25th verse. I believe that the passage in the bible to that reads &quot;You know not the hour at which I come&quot; applies to Mr. Lindsey as well as the rest of us. He has a good gimmick and until the end really does come, he appears to be able to keep predicting the end and selling books predicting the end again when the previous prediction doesn't come true.An interesting thing to know would be whether or not the profits from his books are invested in long term growth funds."},{"Title":"Apocalypse Code","review":"I have yet to finish this book, but so far I am very intrigued by it.

That book actually dealt with some sound theology apart from all Hal's prophetic nonsense.As for Hal's \\"codes,\\" they are no codes at all, but impositions of 20th century thought on 1st century imagery.And that's not even the worst part of Hal's writing. Hal (and those like him) based their entire interpretive procedures on an erronious \\"rapture\\" doctrine and a flawed \\"missing week\\" theory, neither of which hold water.In my own studies, I did indeed find a real \\"Bible Code,\\" one that people can live with. More important, this Bibile code is THE interpretive Code that is the foundation of all prophetic thought. This Bible Code deals with the one truth, the two decisions, the three counterbalances, the four traits, the five disciplines, and the seven plus one Spirits.If you are ready to leave the childish behind and grow in Christian maturity, knowing what you really need to do when confronted with the ultimate choice between death or hell, try reading \\"The Character Map: An Introduction to the Introductions in Revelation.\\" You'll never look at prophecy the same way again.Ike"},{"Title":"Apocalypse Code","review":"This book by Hal Lindsey is part of a bad trend of looking forsecret information in the Bible that is not there. The Bibleis not about secret messages. The things that matter in theBible are utterly clear. And the things that matter are thethings of God.It doesn't matter what weapons the enemies of God will havein the last days. The nature of the armies and the war in thosedays means nothing. What matters is the promises God has made,the prophecies with regard to his people and what God expectsof those people.The only way anyone can prepare for those days is to lead thebest life they can, keep the commanments, confess your sinsand accept God's grace. Trying to set out a timeline forthe end days, discussing the nature (or existance) of the raptureor making political plans for how to fight the enemy is bothfoolish and futile. The path to God isn't through the thingsof the world.Hal Lindsey in his arrogance claims that only he or one of hisgeneration could understand the visions of Revelations. He iswrong. People of God have always understood what mattered inthe book back to the beginning. The knowledge of other thingsin the prophecy has always been the domain of those who attemptto substitute their words for those of God.

While no one can know for sure what will happen or when, I believe Hal did an excellent job of describing what is very likely to happen. I never heard him predict when the end wil come, but he simply tried to describe what we can expect. Considering everything that is happening in the world even as I write this, I really don't see how anyone could accuse Mr. Lindsay of being far off the mark.

But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.&quot; (Matt. 24:35-36)If Jesus procalimed that message, and that this message is still supposed to have meaning for us today regarding the event of the second coming, why then do we have the audacity to even think that we may predict the end-time event with our limited minds?Scripture must interpret scripture and evidently Lindsey has misjudged, to a horrible extent, what interpretation is all about. If I were to take a survey of all of the people who have bought into Lindsey's misguided quest which he has built on a shoddy foundation of self-authenticating theories of biblical apocalypticism, it would not be surprising to me to find that the amount of cash flow going into Lindsey's books has outweighed the amount of money his supporters have spent on the hungry, the sick, and the lonely.The only integrity in his work is that our world is indeed fallen. But this is not anything new. That the world's fallenness is not new - which I believe to be self-evident if we were to take a short ride through history - asserts that the year 2000 has little significance for the second coming. People have been sinful before any one of us has been born. Thus this world has been fallen before any of us has been born. If this is true, and it is, then our technology, science, and cultural aesthetics should not be the mediums for judging whether or not Christ will indeed return in the next decade. In fact nothing in our capacity can predict that event. Scripture has even told us not to even try, but only to be faithful to the risen Christ.In short, Lindsey is not really promoting the Gospel of Jesus Christ who even now lives and reigns with the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit. If Jesus is alive to us today, why must we surrender His eternal grace to theories He has specifically told us not to surmise? Lindsey makes us miss out on Jesus Christ as He is alive even as you are reading this critique. And sadly, that is more akin to the Spirit of the Anti-Christ John spoke of in I John chapter 4 than what Lindsey's suppositions promote."},{"Title":"Apocalypse Code","review":"Apocalypse Code is probably the book you want to buy if your interested in the Book of Revelation and end-time prophecy. Lindsey describes the various aspects of the Book of Revelation in great detail and he writes in a way that is pretty easy to understand. He also relates many aspects to the world we live in today. By doing this he shows the reader that he has extensive knowledge of international affairs. This, in my opinion, gives the book more credibility. The book should appeal to any Christian who is interested in spreading the gospel to those that are lost.

I don't have to accept all of an author's viewpoints in order to get alot out of any book (excluding the Bible, of course.)

He is mearly trying to give you a better understanding of what the Book of Revelations means.I have read the Book of Revelations and understood very little. His interpretations are just that &quot;interpretations.&quot; He allows you to make the decision to believe or not.Whether or not you agree with him is irrelevant to this book. After reading this book I walked away with one thought. &quot;How prepared am I to enter the Kingdom of God?&quot;This book scared me to some degree and filled me with great joy.

As long as we are in tuned to the Lord at all times.Remember that we are all different, and we can't judge one another. If some come to Christ because they love puzzles and enjoy the challenge of finding God in those pieces they gather... then who are you to judge.I have been putting puzzle pieces together since since I was 18 and for 18 years... and believe me ...I see things that the average Christian doesn't. Yet the Christian that loves to worship sees things of Christ in the music she/he lifts in His name. The Christian that gives of his/her time to children sees Christ in the innocents of their faces.Don't put down another brother or sister in the Lord. We are to uplift one another. Gods word says to &quot;have peace one with another.&quot;So I say to those that are thinking of purchasing this book. If your hearts desire is to piece clues together like puzzles ... then buy this book ... and as you read it ... remember it is from one brother that isn't perfect like God, but seeks Him in the gift of writing that he has been given. I am sure there are some truths within this book that I am interested in reading, but always put your own clues together by going to the truth of the words of the Bible.

The authors draw upon surveys of general counsel of Fortune 1000 corporations, onsite interviews with over 700 executives, managers and attorneys in sixty firms and extensive interviews with individuals operating as neutral parties in the settlement of conflicts and disputes.Based upon their research, the authors conclude that \\"... there is a sea change in U.S. organizations that reflects an emergence of systems of conflict management and a new paradigm for organizations\\" (p.5). Their finding, they note, is independently confirmed in research conducted in 1999 by Bingham and Chachere who found that \\"about half of [U.S.] \`large' private employers ha[d] established some sort of formal dispute resolution procedure for their nonunion employees\\"(p. 81).With this major movement established, the authors proceed to explain the reasons for the shift to conflict management systems, the processes that have emerged to service that demand, how those systems were created and implemented and the challenges that lie ahead in the field.Importantly, the authors immediately focus on the corporate interests that drive the development and implementation of alternative systems for conflict management. Overwhelmingly, the primary driver in developing alternative systems to replace litigation procedures is the belief that dispute resolution can be accomplished at less cost in dollars and time.\\" (p.6).\\"In our survey of the Fortune 1000,\\" the authors write, \\"about 80 percent of the respondents told us that saving time or saving money was the primary reason the corporation had used ADR\\" (p.313). The implications of this finding are clear and reflected, as the authors point out, in the fact that \\"... the vast majority of corporations favor dispute management over conflict management\\" (p.313).Having presented us with the primary drivers as well as several other contributing factors, the authors move into a discussion of alternative management systems and their components. Readers will learn the pros and cons of the main features of these systems. It is truly a handbook of elements for both the decision-maker and the designer.The book explores who is eligible in most systems, the essential elements for judging the fairness of a system, the issues of who pays the costs, training requirements, the use of outside \\"neutral\\" parties and a host of other common design features in considerable detail. You will find the most common element, the Open Door, explored with its drawbacks and its contributions. Additionally, you will find a careful discussion of other features such as \\"hotlines,\\" ombudspersons, resolution facilitators, internal peer mediation and external \\"neutral\\" ad hoc personnel. Always, the authors present the pros and cons of each of the possible components.Professors Lipsky, Seeber and Fincher then lead the reader through the process of system design and implementation, citing key steps along the way. Always, their work is based on findings from major U.S. organizations that have engaged in the process.As they examine the process, the authors provide the reader with another very valuable part of their work by confronting the issues inherent in evaluating the systems. Their findings will be either a comfort or a source of devastation for the planner.The authors put the matter succinctly and critically. The frame for evaluation is necessarily couched in the key question: \\"As compared to what?\\" (p.269).Indeed, the answer is far from easy. Rather, it may be astonishingly elusive.The challenge of evaluation is one the authors explore in detail, showing various evaluation schemes in practice in American corporations today. Results, alas, yield data far from business case standards. \\"Leaders of organizations, even if they believe in conflict management,\\" they conclude, \\"are often faced with going forward in the absence of any hard evidence about the benefits of the system\\" (p.308).\\"There is in fact very little hard evidence that corporations actually do save time and money by using ADR ...,\\" they conclude (p. 313). \\"Furthermore,\\" they assert, \\"it is not clear to us that many corporations are even gathering the information necessary to make a cost benefit analysis\\" (p.313).As befits a work of this breadth and depth, the authors do not disappoint us as they turn their attention at the close of their work to the future of conflict management systems. Their work is insightful and thorough.\\"Contrary to much of the popular literature and perceptions regarding ADR and somewhat surprising to us,\\" the authors conclude \\"we do not believe that the ADR movement has achieved the critical mass necessary to institutionalize it within most large businesses and organizations\\" (p.315). And yet, the authors are confident that the future trend is toward the expansion of alternative dispute resolution procedures, but far less certain about the broad expansion of conflict management systems. It is an area with unresolved issues and significant promises. Readers will find thought provoking and useful discussion of these issues as the conclusion to the work.There is far more in this book than this review touches upon. Additionally, readers will find an extensive bibliography, current research statistics, informative footnotes and an eminently useable glossary.Highly recommended.John Baker, Ph.D.Editor, The Negotiator Magazine"},{"Title":"Emerging Systems for Managing Workplace Conflict: Lessons from American Corporations for Managers and Dispute Resolution Professionals","review":"For many years, scholars and academics have focused on the importance of conflict resolution in the workplace. This tradition goes back to studies that were done in the 1940s-50s. In more recent years, conflict in the workplace has become a major issue. No longer are workplaces those socially integrative, sometimes paternalistic, havens for lifetime security. They are now arenas for multiple conflicts. The issue therefore becomes how to deal with these conflicts in a non-ad hoc manner--how to put in place systems for managing conflict. American corporations have much to teach the world in this regard. The problem is that before this book, no one has systemized these lessons. Before this book, there was no central location where the tools, the methodologies, and the processes necessary for putting quality conflict resolution was readily available. Lipsky, Seeber, and Fincher have provided a critical service in having completed this volume. They have written the definitive reference volume on the specific issue of alternative dispute resolution techniques in American business. In this context, they have served the practitioner community well. Yet not only is this a well-written book for the practitioner, it is an informative book for the academic. The combined research record of these authors is impressive and it serves them well in putting this material together. Anyone interested in alternative dispute resolution in the workplace must have this well-written volume as a reference."},{"Title":"Emerging Systems for Managing Workplace Conflict: Lessons from American Corporations for Managers and Dispute Resolution Professionals","review":"ADR experts Lipsky, Seeber and Fincher have provided a comprehensive and practically written account of the evolution of corporate alternative dispute resolution (&quot;ADR&quot;)processes from the early days of collective action in the 1930's to the present-day use of conflict management programs to enhance the productivity and overall satisfaction of workers in companies seeking to compete in global markets. The book places today's corporate ADR programs in the context of labor history and the increasingly complex federal, state and local legislative scheme, thus providing an important frame of reference to those interested in introducing, designing, and implementing internal ADR systems. The authors' premise is that corporations that consider managing workplace conflict as a significant organizational goal have moved from a &quot;dispute resolution&quot; perspective to a &quot;conflict management&quot; paradigm. Whether a corporation will adopt any such system depends on a myriad of factors both internal (corporate culture and mission) and external (markets, regulations, litigation exposure). The authors note that the field of dispute resolution has depended on almost allegorical accounts of the cost-savings, efficiencies, and high satisfaction rate reported by participants in ADR systems. The field has not generated the empirical support for these oft-repeated benefits of dispute resolution processes, leaving corporations without the metric economic evidence needed to support new corporate initiatives. Recognizing the challenge of providing &quot;hard evidence that corporations actually do save time and money by using ADR, however&quot; (p.313), the authors &quot;conclude that the vast majority of corporations favor dispute management over conflict management.&quot; (id.)The authors use the building blocks of hundreds of interviews of corporate executives, human resources, employee relations and legal department officials throughout the country as well as government representatives to make their case that corporations that approach conflict management systematically and with a long-range perspective will ultimately embrace and benefit from successful systems. One of the most useful contributions made by the book is the extensive discussion in Part Two: The Extablishment of Conflict Management Systems, which provides -- excuse the expression-- a &quot;road-map&quot; for individuals within corporations seeking to introduce, design and implement a complete workplace conflict resolution system. The authors provide templates for deciding such important questions as composition of the design committee, eliciting support from various corporate constituencies, determining the scope of the process, common design features, and methods for evaluating success. The authors conclude the book with a clear-eyed discussion of the future of workplace conflict management systems, in a society still grappling with litigation prevention and reduction strategies. As a practitioner in the field, I highly recommend this to others interested in promoting alternative dispute resolution in the workplace."},{"Title":"Emerging Systems for Managing Workplace Conflict: Lessons from American Corporations for Managers and Dispute Resolution Professionals","review":"ADR experts Lipsky, Seeber and Fincher have provided a comprehensive and practically written account of the evolution of corporate alternative dispute resolution (&quot;ADR&quot;)processes from the early days of collective action in the 1930's to the present-day use of conflict management programs to enhance the productivity and overall satisfaction of workers in companies seeking to compete in global markets.

All of this is liberally seasoned with wit, detail and irresistable dialogue. The psychological suspense will keep you guessing what will happen next and there is just enough complexity to maintain interest without slowing the pace. Very moving, very satisfying and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Bad Samaritan","review":"When a member of the Church of England parish of St. Savior's is found murdered following a picnic, the crime investigation is undertaken by Detective Constable Charlie Peace and his boss Mike Oddie. Charlie is a likeable protagonist who prefers working alone. The dirty tricks and vicious maneuverings of the people of St. Savior's remind him of his own upbringing in a predominantly black parish in Brixton. Charlie plows ahead seeking answers to his questions as he interviews people repeatedly. When Charlie acts friendly, the wise suspect is on guard. Barnard's twenty-ninth novel has enough twists to keep it entertaining and the plot is very tight and believable."},{"Title":"The Bad Samaritan","review":"An engaging mystery of the British cozy variety, wherein a vicar's wife loses her faith and becomes the object of vicious parish political maneuvering that ends in homicide. I bought this book with the intention of reading it over the coming week. In reality, I stayed up reading it most of the night that I purchased it. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Bad Samaritan","review":"Rosemary Sheffield feels that she needs some time to find herself! The wife of a pastor, she has \\"lost\\" her faith; she has become quite disoriented. Off she goes on a seaside holiday to \\"find herself.\\" And , once again, veteran writer Robert Barnard maintains his true-to-form style in \\"The Bad Samaritan.\\" While at the resort, Rosemary meets--and befriends--a young Bosnian named Stanko, who's fled to England to escape the horrors of his homeland. Rosemary finally returns home and, anon, soon appears the young man, whom she helps to get a job in her town. Of course, it's not long before rumors begin. The rumors evolve into murder and Barnard's amiable pair Detective Constable Charlie Peace and his boss Mike Oddie are called in to find the murderer. Barnard's writing, full of dry wit, sharp dialogue, a viable plot, all combine to make \\"The Bad Samaritan\\" a excellent read. Barnard paces his novels with a brilliance that makes simply turning the pages worthwhile. Well-versed in literature and human nature, Barnard knows that \\"one good deed deserves another\\" and \\"love thy neighbor\\" are not always to be taken literally! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"Title":"The Bad Samaritan","review":"Known for the wit of his English mysteries, Barnard takes his time setting up the plot elements of &quot;The Bad Samaritan,&quot; which revolves around the back-biting congregation of St. Saviour's church.Rosemary Sheffield, the vicar's wife, has lost her faith, an event she finds liberating. Her husband's congregation does not share her sanguine view, however. Upon her return from a short holiday, which has made her acutely aware of the Bosnian war through her friendship with a refugee waiter, Rosemary finds plots afoot to oust her from her role in church activities.While not particularly attached to these activities, Rosemary resents the plotters' methods. And when her refugee friend turns up at the vicarage, she must aid him and thwart the tide of gossip as well. The murder, when it finally occurs, bringing in Barnard's black detective Charlie Peace, serves to force all the undercurrents out in the open. As much a witty novel of manners as a suspenseful mystery, &quot;Samaritan&quot; is distinguished by its crisp writing and wry perception of character."},{"Title":"Victor Six","review":"I had not read this book unitl I was lucky enough to meet Mr. Christian. I did not know of him until kids in class started talking about what he was known for. I am from a military family and I am around military people a lot, so I am used to how they are. As I said I knew nothing about him, but when he began to talk I was amazed at his life experiences. If one were to only look at a picture of him with his metals one would see that he lived a lifetime of memories, both good and bad, during his tours of Vietnam. It seems that Mr. Christian has lived a fascinating life and to hear and read about it is amazing. His life sounds almost unreal, but he was really apart of some of the most influential events that have taken place in the last 50 years. Not only was it a pleasure to read this book I felt honored as an American because this world does not have many heroes like Mr. Christian, but maybe the world would be a better place if his dedication and courage were more prevalent in others."},{"Title":"Victor Six","review":"David Christian is one of Americas Greatest War heros. He exemptlifies all the charecteristics of a hero. He is extremly couragous, calling in artillry on top of his position. And this is a very excellent book on a very couragous and heroic man."},{"Title":"Victor Six","review":"David Christian is \\"Real Hero\\". The book cover has recommendations by Senator John Kerry, Jan Scruggs, and Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig. I met David Christian and his wife in 1994 on a cruise to China (he was the celebrity guest lecturer) and a return trip to Viet Nam. He is a real person and I enjoyed the book and many conversations with David and his wife Peggy.Ralph Morehead"},{"Title":"Victor Six","review":"This book is entertaining, but not very believable. Mr. Christian does not tell a very convincing story. I found the book so ridiculous that I couldn't even finish it. I am sure Mr. Christian was a very good soldier, but he is not a good storyteller. If you have ever read any books by men who told the truth about the war, you will not be able to believe a word Mr. Christian has written. He comes across as being so conceited. Save yourself the time, and go read a truthful account of the Vietnam War. This book seems nothing but a fantasy."},{"Title":"Victor Six","review":"I certainly hope David Christian does not expect his readers to consider this book a truthful account. This book dishonors Vietnam veterans by painting an obviously false account of David Christian&#65533;s war experience. Most of his outrageous stories sound like they came from a B-movie about the Vietnam War. If David Christian wants to be a real war hero he should put away his ego and imagination and publish a truthful account of his war experience so that others can learn from such a tragic war. I would recommend virtually any other book about the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"The Artless Jew: Medieval and Modern Affirmations and Denials of the Visual.","review":"In this valuable and erudite study, Professor Kalman Bland examines the idea of \\"the artless Jew.\\" The strategy is to examine what is claimed about Jewish aesthetics in modernity, and then return to the medieval period to show how these claims are not only problematic but sometimes quite erroneous. This is an excellent interdisciplinary book covering a wealth of information and providing sharp insights into intellectual history, art history, philosophy, Jewish history, and religious studies in general."},{"Title":"The Artless Jew: Medieval and Modern Affirmations and Denials of the Visual.","review":"Bland does not adequately connect the medieval and the modern, leaving a gap between the two periods. Further, he is clearly more adept at analyzing the medieval period as his discussion of the modern lacks the same level of critical penetration. In sum, I found Bland's book to be bland."},{"Title":"Spam: The Cookbook","review":"This is a bold and imaginative cookery book. Eggers shows flair with a daring East/West fusion in her Thai influenced Spam with Mint and Brocoli: tender chunks of luncheon loaf stir-fried with fish sauce, chili, brown sugar and brocoli then topped with fresh mint. Look out too for her Spam en Croute - slab of reconstituted pork coated in a rich mushroom pate and wrapped in filo pastry. It's a triumph. That distinctive taste of the abbatoir floor you get with Spam comes through best, perhaps, in a simple yet delicious Spam Tartare - raw Spam, ground with anchovies, egg yolk, mustard, oil and Worcestershire Sauce. Mmmmmm. Heaven."},{"Title":"Spam: The Cookbook","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. I knew virtually nothing about Spam or how to prepare it. The book is great fun and always generates smiles from my friends. In fact, I'm in the restaurant business and have given the book to friends in both tbe catering and restaurant business. A couple of friend and I have bought the entire inventory from several local bookstores to give to all her staff. Who knows, this book just might make Spam as popular in the contiguous 48 states as it is in Hawaii.Great job, Ms. Eggers! What's next?"},{"Title":"Spam: The Cookbook","review":"SPAM was well known as a comfort food while I was growing up. Whenever my mother was feeling a touch of nostalgia, she would mix up a batch of SPAM victory buns and stick them in the oven. Her mother made them for her when she was a kid and fixing SPAM victory buns would bring back warm memories for my mom. Now, away from home, I have my own kitchen and the SPAM cookbook has made a nice addition. The recipes are quick and easy to make, which is a definite plus in my life. As a nursing student, I have little time for cooking large meals for myself, so many of the recipes within the SPAM cookbook are ideal for my lifestyle!

Die-cut in the size and shape of a Spam can, the gift book has over 40 traditional and new-use recipes from \\"Main Street\\" kitchens across the country.The book is divided into six U.S. regions - including four Hawaiian Spam recipes! - with enough Spam recipes for any Spam lover's taste. I haven't tried them all, but I particularly liked the taste of the nostalgic \\"Original Spam Luncheon Meat\\" recipe (from Hormel Foods, the current and original producer of Spam) and the \\"Toasted Spam &amp; Cheese Sandwich\\" recipe. Both bring back memories of growing up in Nebraska in the 1940s. New to me but especially tasty and satisfying was the \\"Spam &amp; Georgia Peach Bake\\" from, of course, Georgia.There's even a capsule history of Spam, with a timeline, tracing for us who are old enough to remember Spam's cozy, comfort-food marriage to Wonderbread and Victory Gardens of World War II.At this price I plan to buy several to give as gifts for Christmas - or before.

And the book is shaped like the can. What a good idea."},{"Title":"Spam: The Cookbook","review":"Thanks Ms. Eggers for such a nice little cookbook. SPAM is a great product for anywhere cooking with limited refrigeration like camping or college dorms--and for quick added zest to a meal. I like the chapter break down by regions. My oldest and I recently traveled much of the US for 11 months. I loved the meats baked into breads that we had in NJ and NYC. I had to try the SPAM bread recipe on page 9. I used homemade dough. The smell of fresh bread with cheese and SPAM is a shout out of \\"home\\".

We, with all our \\"ifs\\" and \\"whens\\" are the ones who handicap our own pursuit. Unless we choose to, we don't have to work or even wait for happiness for another minute. If we drop our conditions, we can have it right now.\\"A wise person once said that happiness is learning to accept the impossible, do without the indispensable, and bear the intolerable. If that definition seems unlikely - think again. What bars us from happiness as much as our interpretations of what is indispensable, impossible, or intolerable? What would happen if we were wise and mature enough to reconsider what we can't accept or do without? Then what would stand between us and happiness?\\"None of us can bend the mysterious rules of the universe. Just claims will often be denied, gifts will be distributed randomly, tragedy will strike the innocent. This is the world as it is. When we can accept that, we can stop quarreling with fate and learn to love life for its own sake. Thus we accept the happiness that was available all along.\\"I've found that even in prison, it's possible to be happy. As said above, it's about changing my interpretation of what is indispensable, impossible, and intolerable. I had to change my attitude about my predicament. I've found that if I can answer \\"yes\\" to the following questions each day, then I'm happy:Did I smile today?Did I laugh?Did I help someone?Did I learn something new?Do I have something to look forward to?Do I feel connected to a higher power?Tuesday, April 17, 2012:From Believing in Myself by Earnie Larsen & Carol Hegarty:\\"The search for greater self-knowledge is much like an archaeological dig. The farther down we go, the more surprises we're likely to find. Some are more fun than others. Often, one of our less-pleasing discoveries is our skill in using acceptable words to name our unacceptable character flaws.\\"The quality we used to call perseverance, for example, may turn out to be plain old stubbornness once we clean it off and take a good look. Our compassion and generosity may look an awful lot like codependent enabling and our straightforwardness, like crass insensitivity. Of course, we realized we had flaws, but who guessed they would be so serious - or that so many of them would be the so-called \\"virtues\\" that we were proud of!\\"But we shouldn't be too discouraged by our character flaws. They're not evidence of our depravity, but of our humanity. Even the spiritual giants of this world are not perfect. Flawlessness is not a condition that applies to human beings. To identify a character flaw is like naming a disease after the lab results come in. The lab report doesn't cause the disease. It simply tells what it is, so a remedy can be prescribed.\\"Written by David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"Believing In Myself: Self Esteem Daily Meditations","review":"As an ACOC there were many bad days in my life.

A quick read which never looses your interest. Now only one question remains... Where does Nick go from here? We need a sequel."},{"Title":"CIO Wisdom II: More Best Practices","review":"[Well, I haven't read \\"CIO Wisdom\\", so I can't compare it to this book.]The text spans a fairly wide variety of topics, all of which are germane to you if you are a CIO. Or CTO for that matter. Try not to take the title too literally. The book is worth reading even if you are not at a CIO or CTO rank. If you have any managerial responsibility for IT, then the material covered here has relevance.Having said this, not every chapter is likely to be of use to a given reader. There is a nice discussion on using RFID tags in a collaborative supply chain. RFID is certainly a hot topic in some circles. But if you are not involved with supply chain management, this chapter is moot.Overall, the chapters are fairly introductory about their topics. For instance, one chapter pertains to securing (protecting) an IT facility. But it is a short chapter that does not go into much detail. Another chapter talks about how to measure the return on investment on software development. It delineates various metrics like Earned Value Analysis and net present value. It differs from the rest of the book in that it is probably meant for a manager who hails from a technical background and is unfamiliar with financial terms. While the other chapters are likely targeted towards managers from nontechnical backgrounds.Perhaps it is best if you treat this book as an overview of its topics, and as a lead-in into more specialised and comprehensive texts."},{"Title":"CIO Wisdom II: More Best Practices","review":"Real-world CIOs working in IT leadership positions know best what works, and their collective wisdom in CIO Wisdom II: More Best Practices offers solutions not only for IT professionals, but for any involved in business systems management.

A highly recommended pick based on practical experience in the IT management world."},{"Title":"CIO Wisdom II: More Best Practices","review":"The book is written by a number of CIO's and is broken into a wide breath of topics, one per chapter. Not every chapter will be appropriate for everyone; the best read will come from picking the top five areas of interest and start there.The points made in the book are good; however, a narrowing of topics and more detailed examples of how to implement the suggestions / strategies would have added punch to the book's overall impact.For me, the best outcome was refining my list of the top ten metrics by which I judge my effectiveness."},{"Title":"CIO Wisdom II: More Best Practices","review":"This book basically contains discussions with various CIOs about their changing roles within organizations. The authors examine not only how their roles have changed, but also how they have remained the same, and how the importance of marketing or persuading management, subordinates, and board members has changed their roles. Of course they also examine hardware and software issues that CIOs face and issues like securing the IT facility, running applications over the Internet, information management, models for evaluating Return On Investment, making sure that technology is user-driven without becoming controlled by those users, outsourcing and architecture, and IT governance and procurement.

On one hand, they are a good way to get a broad view of many varying slants on a given topic. On the other hand, the quality and style of each chapter can be frustratingly erratic. A solid chapter on one aspect can be followed by one that leaves you scratching your head. In CIO Wisdom 2, we have a number of topics covered, some of which are specific to CIO effectiveness, and others of which seem to be \\"technology du jour 101\\" chapters. For instance, the 5 Ws of IT Outsourcing is pretty specific to issues that CIOs deal with now. But the RFID chapter seems to be more along the lines of introducing a technology for someone who doesn't know what it is. Granted, if you were a CIO looking to implement something like that, you'd find it timely and invaluable. But there's a good chance you'd end up skipping over that chapter because RFID isn't on your radar screen. Same with Internet applications... If you're doing that already, you probably already know the information. I guess I just found the range of information covered in this book a bit too broad to recommend it as a complete book. Maybe certain chapters...If you're a CIO or a high-level technologist and you see a chapter (or chapters) here that interests you, by all means get the book. You'll find value there.

It claims to have been written by CIOs and describe real life experiences but only 2 of the many authors have CIO titles or CIO experience, so how can this be?Most of book itself is pretty boring so it is best avoided.I think this is an attempt to cash in on the CIO Wisdom book which was written by actual CIOs and was interesting.Reviewed by a CIO"},{"Title":"Are You Experienced?: The Inside Story Of The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"The following pages are blank:91-92 106-107 98-99 94-95lots of picture pages are blank also.I had to return the book for this reason. Otherwise this book was a good inside view of the music business and the experience."},{"Title":"Are You Experienced?: The Inside Story Of The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"I picked this up as soon as it was released in the US (which I thought was '92 but Amazon lists as '96). The lasting impression from the first read was all about the bitterness and misfortune Noel Redding had endured during and after his tenure with the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Since that first read, I've occasionally used it as a reference, but only for the occasional spot-check.After reading the new and exceptional Jimi Hendrix: Musician by Keith Shadwick, I knew it was time to give this and other core Hendrix books a fresh look. I'm glad I did. The nearly continuous bitterness, which I found stifling on the first go round did not irritate as much during this re-read. Thus I managed to get past that aspect and see more of the less obvious side of the book. This really is essential reading for those wanting to know more about Jimi and his music.Noel was a dependable diary-keeper during his Experience days and thus has helped immensely to solidify the fact base for the groups lifetime. One one hand, you could argue that given the impressive record of substance abuse, how reliable are diary notes of the perpetually wasted and hung over but the answer is: more than historical comments made by those that weren't there. And therein lies the true value of this book: Noel was there. Although he may have had concerns about his treatment that added to the already mountainous stress endured by an overworked band, his perspectives, like those of Mitch and Jimi, have helped to frame the picture - to put the dirt on the soles of the work shoes as it were.So the bottom line is that I encourage anyone interested in the real Jimi Hendrix story to read this book (and others as well). Sure, there is bias, but so what? Everyone is entitled to their opinion, especially the people that were THERE.Rest in peace, Noel."},{"Title":"Are You Experienced?: The Inside Story Of The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"Although this is indeed not a particularly well written book, (and I thought Jessica's review was hilarious), you have to bear in mind that Noel was a bass player, not a writer. This is Noel's story and pretty essential reading for any Hendrix fan. Noel clearly, dearly loved Jimi and understood him well and had a good perspective and balance on his character, and events that happened. But obviously he had his opinon.What struck me most is that it's a real eye opener as to what being a successful musician is like. I also think any budding musician should read this-so they can find out exactly what they're letting themselves in for. It is so easy to imagine the life of a successful musician as glamourous when it's far from it. Even after The Experience were famous they were still going to gigs sitting in the back of a van on the top of the equipment, with their heads banging on the ceiling. Not the fur coat and limo people would perhaps envisage. Although it goes to show that despite no sleep, no time off, no money, and barely the chance of a decent meal, at least a man that looked like \\"Bob Dylan's grandmother\\" as Jimi called him, could get more action than Frank Sinatra probably ever did.Yes, it's full of these boring detailed lists that Redding liked to make of various expenses, but despite this it's still a very entertaining book and the man has a great sense of humour. It's very unfair that Noel never got his money, but if you read this you can see in the end he had what money could never buy-real friends away from the sharks of the music industry, and the love and support of his family. I personaly wouldn't begrudge him a single penny he made from this book. I was very saddened when I heard he died a while back. RIP Noel."},{"Title":"Are You Experienced?: The Inside Story Of The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"I put off reading this for years due to hearing from friends who were turned off by the problems the late Noel Redding had getting paid for his contributions to the music of the Experience band. It was worth the read and is a good companion piece to Mitch Mitchell's book about his Experience years. As mentioned in other reviews the writing isn't the best and the last third of the book does go into mind numbing detail of how he was denied royalties on music he helped create that appeared on the 3 albums of JHE.Noel is pretty honest about his over the top self medicating abuse but there is also there is some humor here in the life of a musican starting out. Some fascinating observations from someone who was there, such as his opinion that as much as everyone loved Jimi Hendrixes guitar playing; it was his intimate talk/singing vocal work that created an atmosphere that really drew people in. Noel probably weighed not a whole lot over 125 pounds and had a somewhat quiet and nasal singing and talking style, but here's a guy that took a bus to an audition as a very young man and was soon touring the world with 2 of the top musicians of the era and holding his own on bass with a dirty driving tone and plenty of inventive ideas of his own . If you like the intro to the song The Burning Of The Midnight Lamp, the title of the song Midnight Lightning or the guitar introduction to the song Freedom , they are just a few of the examples of the many things Noel brought to the party and did not receive credit for.Noels comments that it was the 3rd tour that finished the JHE group off explain why the 2 shows I saw them do in 1968 were unfortunately just not that memorable musically although the first one was exciting. Plus it was way better than going to the high school homecoming dance the same night"},{"Title":"Are You Experienced?: The Inside Story Of The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"This book focuses on what happened inside the Experience, musically and financially in a way that a non-member of the group could not know. Noel is at times obsessed with past injustices, but to not present it all in this manner would make it seem like &quot;whining&quot;. There is good advice to musicians, even today, of things to be careful of: drugs, contracts, agents, etc. I bought this at the same time as Mitch Mitchell's book. Mitch's book had better pictures, and certainly gave a glimpse of the time with Jimi after Noel left, but I liked this one just as well. I wish Noel the best, and now I'm going to order a CD or two, and hope he sees some royalty from that!!!"},{"Title":"Are You Experienced?: The Inside Story Of The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"This book is a must for in-depth Hendrix fans wanting to know everything about the group. One thing it is good for is illustrating a Folkestone-centered section of English rock 'n roll musical history of the late 1950's and early 60's. If you've read Philip Norman's 'John Lennon: The Life' you'll understand how interesting this nascent British rock 'n roll formative era was along with its fresh enthusiasm. Noel exposes an even more esoteric niche of this history in his encounters with the popular rock 'n rollers of the day and what they went through to try to make it. Interesting is the shear randomness of Noel turning-down a position with Manfred Mann shortly before being teamed with Hendrix. If Noel had taken the gig he would have joined those other modest forgotten names in British rock history he lists.The book suffers from the fact it was translated by Noel to his long-term companion Carol from years-old memories and could have been fleshed-out more with better-written and embellished accounts. Noel was an unassuming guitarist who happened by pure luck to be drafted into the greatest rock band in history. Noel's somewhat nerdy, gloomy, depressed personality actually aided the chemistry of the band by assuring his invisibility compared to the sensational Hendrix. The flip side of this was Noel's subordinate position in the band caused a building resentment that was only made worse by the dishonesty of the management - which, thanks to Noel's personality, was recorded by the diary-keeping bass player. In hindsight, Noel could have helped his situation by understanding what he was a part of and working with it. Redding actually helped aid the band's chemistry by being the unintrusive support behind the wizard guitarist whose style was enhanced by not having any competing bass interfering with the singular Hendrix sound.In the end Noel was another casualty of Hendrix manager Michael Jeffery's treachery. Despite the personal conflicts caused by the demands of the Experience, the real driving wedge between Noel and the band was Michael Jeffery's mis-management. Noel was asked to leave after he asked what exactly was becoming of the suitcases of cash Jeffery was smuggling to the Bahamas. Jimi didn't defend him because Noel had become a symbol of Michael Jeffery's money-making arrangement. By separating from Noel Jimi was making his first moves to separate from Jeffery. With all this in mind it was hard for already-subjected Noel to also accomodate being royally-screwed by Jeffery. While some see Noel as dwelling on the negative, truth is he experienced something that most people wouldn't bear. The fact he was expected to live up to this sensational Hendrix image as a member only accented the violation. Noel was part of a magic band and held up his end during the band's most creative period, for this he was rewarded by being insulted, ignored, and denied the credit and compensation he deserved. When Hendrix died others needed Noel to become even more invisible. Noel tries to express this in the sagely sarcastic title \\"Are You Experienced?\\" - well Noel tells us \\"Yes, he is!\\" lol.The book offers a rather limited and subdued version of the Experience years mostly because of the passage of time before the book's writing, but also because it was translated to Redding's defacto wife who couldn't really be told the worst of the details in the way they were experienced. Gentlemanly Noel, who was no prude and consumed the 60's as much as anyone, probably couldn't offer them too forthrightly as they happened, but also the memories were filtered by Noel's overall experience which wasn't a pleasant one. Never the less the insider memories of being in the Experience are there and worth hearing. After the book was published and shortly before his death Noel Redding was suing the Hendrix Company for 5 million dollars. If you read the book you'll realize he had a just claim and deserved every penny after being duped into settling for only $100,000 in 1974.While some criticize Noel for taking notes and emphasizing the business end, truth is if it wasn't for Noel and his pursuit of his rights, and thanks to his resentful grudging personality, we would never have the detailed accounts of Jeffery's trickery shown in this book. This book will appeal to a small group of dedicated Hendrix fans and researchers because it is one of the few sources for records of Jeffery's bastardly doings. In the end it is a rare source for a much-needed account of the unseen side of the Experience as experienced by one of its most inside sources. Too bad Noel succumbed to one of the downsides incurred by this 'experience' in 2003. Since then a lot has happened as far as Jeffery and how what Noel experienced led to Jimi's death."},{"Title":"Are You Experienced?: The Inside Story Of The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"This is a book written with a unique insiders perspective on a subject near and dear to many of us; the amazing and brief run of The Jimi Hendrix Experience. There are several chapters that go into detail about that aspect. The touring, recording and publicity (including drunken escapades) of the band from it's formation in '66 to it's demise (Redding's departure) in '69. The rest is an endless list of litigation as Noel and Mitch (seperatley)try to get an accounting of the proceeds due them from thier efforts. It IS a sad story and there is little doubt that they were all abused by management on several levels. Not to mention ripped off on a colossal scale. But it winds on and on, parallel in course to Reddings physical and mental decline as his resentment and bitterness over the sad state of his affairs joined forces with his evident and admitted alcoholic life style. It's hard not to feel for him but it goes on & on until I was just counting pages to the end. As a true believer, I found parts of the book entrertaining & informative but most of it bleak & depressing. If you're in the bizz, the message is clear, don't sign anything you do not understand!"},{"Title":"Are You Experienced?: The Inside Story Of The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"As always, when dealing with books on legendary people like Hendrix, you're better off with something written by someone who was actually *there*. And Noel Redding certainly was there.Certainly one of the best books I've read on Hendrix."},{"Title":"Are You Experienced?: The Inside Story Of The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"Noel Redding in his book \\"Are You Experienced\\" reveals what REALLY happened to three exceptionally talented young musicians, free from guile, cunning, or sham, who were encapsulated into a money-making machine by a business manager, whose modus operandi was (drumroll....) -- guile, cunning, and sham.Redding describes what happened to a naive 20 yr. old, essentially broke, who signed contracts thrust before him, believing that he would be party to profits from record sales and concert tours from the juggernaut which became known as the Jimi Hendrix Experience.But, what Redding eventually unfiltered through the gruel of constant tour schedules, endless haze of drugs, and frequent sexual diversion encounters with adoring female fans, was the realization that he was personally gaining very little, monetarily, from his involvement in the Jimi Hendrix Experience.It was not Jimi's fault, because he was caught in the whirlwind too and was not party to the \\"employee\\" musician contracts that were doled out to Redding and Mitch Mitchell by Jeffrey's cohorts. From the financial reach-out by Chas Chandler to Michael Jeffrey, who already had managed the Animals, -- Jeffrey worked the Jimi Hendrix Experience into the ground and siphoned off much of their earnings into off-shore bank accounts -- using the same formula template of moving band revenue into Bahamian bank accounts, as he did as manager of the Animals.What Redding reveals is what can happen, mentally and physically, after rock n' roll fame, playing before sell-out crowds that generated large sums of money, traveling the country by plane, being immersed in rock star treatment, helping to create \\"a sound\\" that resulted in millions of dollars in record sales, -- to realize, that you are not part of the pie and are left with nothing but difficult financial struggle and the ensuing frustration of trying to unravel, where the money went, who controlled it, and how to get a just share of the money that continued to pour in for decades from record sales and merchandise relating to the Jimi Hendrix Experience.There is great insight in Redding's book. While the last third of his book can appear to be mired in the mind numbing litigation in an attempt to be fairly compensated for his contribution as part of JHE, what you have to comprehend is THIS IS HOW BAD IT CAN GET.If you are cut of tour profits, percentage of record sale royalties, image licensing, and merchandising --- you find you are left with nothing. Only memories, that \\"gee, I was part of an extremely successful rock n' roll musical enterprise and have absolutely nothing to show for it -- because I was treated as a small cog in a wheel by a cheating manager, (Michael Jeffrey) who accumulated the band's profits in mysterious off-shore bank accounts, where he was the only check signer and could use the bands money as his own personal piggy bank with no accountability.\\"Unfortunately, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, did not have an Irving Azoff (manager of the Eagles), Andrew Loog Oldham (Rolling Stones), or Peter Grant(Led Zeppelin), who were going to see that the band members were protected and financially enriched and not channeling the band profits into a shell game of overseas bank accounts, where know one actually knows where the exact location of bank accounts or who is in control of them.The ultimate irony for bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell, is that they were part of the most creative and exciting rock and roll band in the world. A sound they were truly instrumental in creating quality songs that have stood the test of time. That they played with Jimi Hendrix, the greatest guitarist player in the world and still deemed as such more than 40 years after his death.Yet, Redding and Mitchell were treated shabbily when it came to remuneration. They were left to scrap financially, when they had played hundreds of standing room only concerts and helped to sell millions in records and merchandising. Both, Redding and Mitchell were left to live out their remaining years with their overseas accounts drained by Hendrix management, no percentage share of record sales, no share of merchandise or image licensing.Noel Redding eventually worked his way out of mental distress that he had to deal with for decades after the Jimi Hendrix Experience. But, his real message is that for any musician, any artist, to know what you are getting into, what you are signing, who is going to control finances, how you stand to be compensated, and who is going to monitor that all this is done accurately and fairly.Redding admitted that this is easier said than done, particularly when you are 20 years old, haven't got two shillings to your name, and need to work. But, the consequences of not knowing how you stand to contractually benefit can have lifelong in-your-face ramifications.I found it interesting that Noel noted an entry from his diary that he was visited by Hendrix in a dream on March 4, 1973. When he asked Hendrix, \\"what are you doing here?\\", Hendrix replied that he had some unfinished business to attend.

Or for those who remember Jimi Hendrix and his experience. However, Noel did get into way too much detail (which was hard to follow) on the legal & financial details - yes I know he was bitter about the lack of money getting to him & Mitch Mitchell but it makes about 25% of the book turgid and boring. Still worth reading though."},{"Title":"Are You Experienced?: The Inside Story Of The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"I had high hopes for this book. For the first 150 or so pages it met my expectations and occasionally exceeded them. It was pretty much downhill from there as Noel recedes into an extended explanation of the multitude of ways pretty much everyone in the world including management (which clearly they did but only because he let them), all of the lawyers including his own, Jimmy and then the Hendrix estate ripped him off. I'm sorry but I have little sympathy for Noel.An interesting book in the litany of Hendrix books but certainly not a primary read."},{"Title":"DORK TOWER V Understanding Gamers","review":"John Kovalic's Dork Tower has been one of my favorite comic books for some time now. He has managed to take Characters that could have easily been stupid and cliched and turned them into real people with real emotions and problems that any of us can relate to. Even the goofiest character in the book, Igor, is shown to have uncommon courage and compassion when called for, and an unwavering loyalty to his friends that some of us are never even lucky enough to find in the real world.This volume, like \\"Livin' La Vida Dorka\\" (volume 4) takes a break from the regular Dork Tower storyline to present \\"Understanding Gamers,\\" the brilliant one-issue special where Kovalic explained the mindset of those who live to game. It connects to even a non-gaming reader and shows that gamers aren't quite the freaks they get portrayed as, especially in comparison to even some \\"normal\\" folks. The rest of the book is full of other strips and specials, some that even a regular visitor of Kovalic's website such as myself may not have seen before.There is a little duplication from previous volumes with some of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" strips, but as Kovalic himself explains, that's because he reprinted the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" Dork Tower special in its entirety here in this volume.You don't need to have read the previous Dork Tower volumes to read this one, but you're cheating yourself if you don't. This is one of the funniest comic books on the stands today."},{"Title":"DORK TOWER V Understanding Gamers","review":"I love Dork Tower, it's my favorite comic strip HANDS DOWN. That said, and I don't want to make this review sound like a downer, but it did not continue the story of Gilly and Matt, it had too many strips that were recycled from the first three books, and ultimately felt like a bit of a let down. That said, John Kovalick still has some great strips in here but for the amount of repeated material I wish that I had gone ahead and bought books VI and VII."},{"Title":"DORK TOWER V Understanding Gamers","review":"I was very happy when this new Dork Tower collection came out in paperback. I was not as happy after reading it. Sure, it has the usual cast of characters and the same witty style as the others. Certainly the jokes and stories are as good in the other volumes.In fact, some of the stories and jokes ARE in the other volumes. A large section of this book reprints the Lord of The Rings stories from an earlier volume. One stip is even duplicated from this volume! That's right, one of the strips is included twice! It is almost as if the author is succumbing to his own jokes about variant covers.The new material was quite good but there just wasn't enough of it. I especially like the opening section that tries to explain what gaming is all about."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Real Estate Terms (4th ed) (Barron's Real Estate Guides)","review":"As I struggle with an on-line real estate salesperson course, I find myself referring to this little 500 page book more and more frequently for its concise non-recursive definitions and real world examples. Let's face it, even if you have owned property before and have gone through the loan process, the actual terms and topics could confuse even the most ambitious and diligent wordsmith, student and/or beginning real estate professional let alone the average Joe just starting out.

Abbreviations, Mortgage and Measurement Tables and Mathematical Formulas formulate the book's appendix. For me, the book's multitudinous examples using each term in a sentence or in a way that makes sense out of the concept are most valuable.

Ms. Coe's book was stunning in how it broadened my understanding of food. Every chapter is chock full of interesting research and conclusions. Even the index was remarkable for its detail. You will be informed and entertained by amazing stories about what was eaten, how it was eaten, and why it was eaten. You will learn the surprisingly interesting history of corn. You will learn the origins of the algae spirulina, recently come to our health food stores. The fascinating story behind the newly popular grain amaranth will interest you. Many old theories (eg, that certain Mesoamerican indians were cannibalistic), are in one stroke shown to be false. The cuisine of the western hemisphere *IS* the cuisine of the world. The staple foods of Europe and Asia are often Maya/Aztec/Inca in origin. The humble potato and tomato, for instance, DID NOT EXIST *ANYWHERE* in the Eastern hemisphere until they were brought back from the west. Makes me wonder WHAT, exactly, did the Italians eat before they had the tomato?"},{"Title":"Peasants and Communists: Politics and Ideology in the Yugoslav Countryside, 1941-1953 (Pitt Series in Russian and East European Studies)","review":"....This is the statement of the selection committee for the Barbara Jelavich Prize of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies in choosing Bokovoy's book for its 1999 award:The Selection Committee (John Fine [chair], Istvan Deak, and Dennison Rusinow) unanimously award the 1999 Barbara Jelavich Prize to Melissa K. Bokovoy for her excellent Peasants and Communists: Politics and Ideology in the Yugoslav Countryside. 1941-1953 published by the Pittsburgh University Press. Dr. Bokovoy has produced an outstanding study on Yugoslav agrarian policy focusing on the post-war years, and especially on the matter of Collectivization from its launching to its repeal. She shows how peasant resistance was the main cause for the policy's abandonment, but also that the response of party members (local, republic, and federal) whose debates and responses (often negative) to particular initiatives were instrumental to the policy reversal. She demonstrates that there were great variations of opinion within the party and doubts about the policy were expressed by some from the start. She shows that many party leaders had great sympathy for the peasants (key members of the Partisan forces during the War) and that the party hierarchy was not dogmatic, but responsive to conditions on the ground and in the long run was willing to be moderate and base their agrarian policy on actual conditions and not on Marxist theory. The material on local peasant and local party responses in the correspondence/reports from the local and republic party leaders to the higher echelons as well as articles in the party press that she presents both fascinate and support thoroughly her well-balanced conclusions. An outstanding study marked both by empathy and a thorough understanding of her subject and sources. Dr. Bokovoy's work shows once again (this time in agrarian policy) how different and flexible Tito and his party were when compared to Communist parties elsewhere."},{"Title":"Peasants and Communists: Politics and Ideology in the Yugoslav Countryside, 1941-1953 (Pitt Series in Russian and East European Studies)","review":"Typical of post-modern, post-freudian analyses of pre-modern, pre-freudian socieities, Peasants and Communists reads motives and relations into World War II Yugoslav society that simply were not there. While the writer paints a thick veneer of sophistication over the simple goings-on of peasant discontent, the resulting painting fails to convince. Peasant revolt and agitation reflect discontent not with the theory behind power relations in a feudal state, but with the lack of sticking to them sufficiently. Peasants in most Indo-European countries know their rights to be limited, but that very limitation leads to ferocity when those rights are ignored, in the name of tyranny (Louis XIV) or progress (the Shah of Iran). Peasants and Communists locates the neuroses of upper West Side liberals into the tradition-bound psyches of religious peasants. It spins off brilliantly unlikely economic motives for peasant discontent. It fails to understand the real history and sociology behind the Communist-peasant alliance or the movement of peasant revolt itself...."},{"Title":"The Emperor's Pearl","review":"More than half a century ago, Robert Van Gulik translated an ancient Chinese detective novel about a real-life Chinese magistrate named Dee Jen-Djieh who lived around 700 A.D.; evidently he had so much fun that he decided to write a few more Judge Dee mysteries of his own. &quot;The Emperor's Pearl&quot; is among his better ones. On the night of the dragon boat races in Poo-Yang district, the drummer of the boat favored to win the race collapses; turns out he's been poisoned. Judge Dee is called in to investigate, and finds out he has not one murder on his hands, but a whole string of deaths involving a missing domino, a malevolent river goddess, and the theft of the Emperor's Pearl, still unsolved after a hundred years. With the help of his trusty seargeant Hoong Liang and a lady wrestler named Violet Liang (no relation), Judge Dee unravels the tangled mess and puts everything to rights.Unlike the classic Chinese detective novel which reveals in the beginning whodunit and focuses instead on how the crime was solved, &quot;The Emperor's Pearl&quot; is more like a contemporary novel in which we have to wait for the end for the resolution. There are some interesting plot twists and turns and enough surprises to satisfy the most diehard mystery fan. It's too bad Van Gulik didn't bring back the formidable Violet Liang in a subsequent novel; she's a delightful invention who's worth a book all by herself."},{"Title":"The Emperor's Pearl","review":"Judge Dee, a magistate in 7th century China, is forced by the weather to stop at a remote mountain monastery. There, while the storm rages, Dee observes suspicious behavior and hears stories of ghosts and vague accusations of murder.The investigation shows the judge many secrets, some personal and some criminal, places him in danger of his life, and exposes to the reader the religions and manners of ancient China; surprisingly modern in some respects and almost unimaginable in others.In the end, Dee's perception of human motivations as well as his logical mind allow him to redress injustice, improve the lives of several young people, and give the reader a solid solution to intellectual puzzles.A mystery in the classical sense, this concentrates more on the plot than on characters, and gives a well-integrated lecture in history.--[...]"},{"Title":"The Emperor's Pearl","review":"This novel, written by the author both in English and in Dutch (\\"De Parel van de Keizer\\") is part of the second series of mystery books featuring Judge Dee as the sleuth.

Once again Judge Dee solves three unrelated mysteries, using his skills of observation and logical thinking, employing casual conversations with various protagonists as his main approach. However, in this book Judge Dee also surprises the reader by an unusual gambit that almost misfires.What I liked most about this book were hints of the supernatural that nonetheless stay within the limits of the traditional mystery novel.This novel makes great bedtime or vacation reading!"},{"Title":"The Emperor's Pearl","review":"I am a long time fan of Robert Hans van Gulik's Chinese Detective Judge Dee.The author, a diplomat, scholar, musician, artist and mystery novel writer has much to recommend him. Many of his scholarly publications are or were 30 years ago considered definitive studies.His scholarly works included topics from The Chinese lute, to Chinese sexual practices to Chinese art. He was a linguist and enough of an artist to illustrate his Judge Dee Books.Judge Dee, was an actual Judge or to quote the sources: Ti Jen-chieh (c. 630-c. 700), magistrate and statesman of the T'ang court. Van Guik came to know of him via a second hand book relating later stories that had grown up around the crime solving skills and market place story teller-tales that had collected in the name of Judge Dee.Von Gulik's first effort to translate the Chinese story into a more western version was a private edition. It became so popular that he would ultimately write 18 books in the series, including some short stories.Part of the attraction of these books was the ongoing problem of bridging the Chinese tradition of judge/detective stories with western traditions. For example in the Chinese traditions:Judges did much of their own investigations. It was believed that they could connect with the spiritual world in such a way that ghosts or spirits would be part of solving the crimes. Taken to extreme, it was believed that the judge could never be wrong, but a major part of his job was explaining to the people of the community how he had divined the answer. A judge who could not explain his solutions might find the locals willing to appeal overly aggressive judgments by rioting against the judge and killing him.Many of the Judge Dee stories include plot-useful insights into the the non court life of Imperial Chinese, its culture and bureaucracy.All of the above is missing in this book. It is mercifully short. The Kindle version over priced and in content this book lacks charm, or the Van Gulik magic. Too much of the text is given over to elaborate discussions of alternative theories and of course all of these are wrong. It is not too much of a spoiler to say that this is one case that Judge Dee never solves so much as bluffs.Missing in this book are many of the loyal subordinates that were part of his inner circle of law enforcement officers. Sgt Hoong is present but only barely and mostly serving as a listening board for the ramblings of his normally heroic boss. Missing is anything specifically Chinese. The feel of the setting and of the story is generic, flat and non engaging.For what is worth the title is a nice example of a MacGuffin. That is according to Merriam Webster: an object, event, or character in a film or story that serves to set and keep the plot in motion despite usually lacking intrinsic importance.What this review is intended to convey is that: this is not the best of the Judge Dee series.The entire series is not available in a Kindle version; this one could have been skipped.Van Gulik is a better writer than he is in this book. Get the others."},{"Title":"The Emperor's Pearl","review":"The annual boat race is a popular tradition in many Chinese cities near rivers and lakes. The festival provides an opporunity for feasting and betting, but in some cases it's an outgrowth of an older tradition. The capricious river goddess will not give good harvests unless celebrated once per year. When a drummer on one of the boats collapses and dies, the old folks are happy--they say that the Goddess claimed her sacrifice.Suspecting human guilt, Judge Dee investigates--and finds complex stories of greed and passion, plus the legendary theft of an Imperial treasure a century ago.This is an enjoyable mystery in the classical style--investigation of a puzzle. The story combines eternal human passions--greed, fear, lust--with he exotic culture of China 14 centuries ago.

The hardest thing about macrame is trying to teach someone else how to do it, but Helene Bress does it with great ease. Simply brilliant."},{"Title":"The Macrame Book","review":"Yes, this book is an excellent basic book, for people who are just knitting their first knots, which in this book are clearly explained, drawings included. So beginners, this is an ideal book. The book also offers instructions for some projects (not instructions for all of them), which could be inspiring. However, I think these projects belong to traditional art (folk art, I mean); they are not fashionable. Perhaps the challenge is to create up-to-date clothes from the basic knots."},{"Title":"The Macrame Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book on macrame. I learned a lot and find that many of the techniques which I had thought were difficult are really quite easy once you get the hang of it. My sister and I go through this book together and have a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in this hobby."},{"Title":"The Macrame Book","review":"As soon as I opened the cover I knew this book was perfect. On the front and back inside covers there are the pictures and how-tos for every knot for quick reference. It's full of great works of art for inspiration and easy in depth instructions for each knot later in the book. It is definitely what I was looking for and then some. I highly recommend it. :)"},{"Title":"The Macrame Book","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK. I'm a beginner with Macrame and this book just has so many wonderful examples of the art. I can't wait to figure out how to do these pieces. Great examples of how to do certain knots and types of macrame."},{"Title":"The Macrame Book","review":"Best book on macrame out there. I really like the donky kong barrel knots. Great pictures and ideas. I'm going to buy a second copy for myself.
