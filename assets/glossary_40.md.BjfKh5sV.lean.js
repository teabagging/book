According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 32.1 percent of the U.S. population were age 50 and over in 2011. This demographic is also healthier, more aware, more youthful, and more vocal than any previous older generation. Thanks to ongoing medical discoveries, the sexual revolution, and the Internet, today s seniors are also sexier than ever   or at least they re now willing to talk and ask about sex as never before. They are the generation that discovered clitoral orgasms, vibrators, and Viagra, and there s no stopping the thirst for knowledge and pleasure now. Since 2005, Joan Price has penned Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty and emerged as the go-to sexpert for the over-50 population. Price's savvy advice, honesty, helpfulness, and humor garnered awareness in the media, in professional circles of therapists and sex educators, and among the huge population of people over 50 who hunger for real information from an age appropriate author. Price tackles it all in this definitive guide to sex and aging: health, fun (and function), disability, dating, illness, orgasms, G-spots, P-spots, polyamory, kink, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5g_sBgAAQBAJ&dq=Sex+over+50&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Expert Witness: A Defence Correspondent's Gulf War, 1990-91","description":"A military scholar and defense correspondent for The Independent shows that the success of the Allied forces during the Gulf War was a result of careful research and strategic planning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AWJtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Expert+Witness:+A+Defence+Correspondent%27s+Gulf+War,+1990-91&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jane Austen ;: Her homes & her friends,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1jJHAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neural Networks: Algorithms and Applications","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-hS7SfwLR6kC&dq=Neural+Networks:+Algorithms+and+Applications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Years of Victory 1802-1812","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0qq2twEACAAJ&dq=Years+of+Victory+1802-1812&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You and No Other","description":"\\"YOU & NO OTHER positively sparkles with historical details, real-life characters, and an utterly unforgettable hero! ~ PAST ROMANCE Historical Romance Blog Thomas Mardouet, Seigneur de St. Briac, is a man with a perfect life  bold, witty, and splendid to behold, he is the King of France s trusted knight.

In Cold Blood, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The Armies of the Night . . . Starting in 1965 and spanning a ten-year period, a group of writers including Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, Joan Didion, John Sack, and Michael Herr emerged and joined a few of their pioneering elders, including Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, to remake American letters. The perfect chroniclers of an age of frenzied cultural change, they were blessed with the insight that traditional tools of reporting would prove inadequate to tell the story of a nation manically hopscotching from hope to doom and back again from war to rock, assassination to drugs, hippies to Yippies, Kennedy to the dark lord Nixon. Traditional just-the-facts reporting simply couldn t provide a neat and symmetrical order to this chaos. Marc Weingarten has interviewed many of the major players to provide a startling behind-the-scenes account of the rise and fall of the most revolutionary literary outpouring of the postwar era, set against the backdrop of some of the most turbulent and significant years in contemporary American life. These are the stories behind those stories, from Tom Wolfe s white-suited adventures in the counterculture to Hunter S. Thompson s drug-addled invention of gonzo to Michael Herr s redefinition of war reporting in the hell of Vietnam. Weingarten also tells the deeper backstory, recounting the rich and surprising history of the editors and the magazines who made the movement possible, notably the three greatest editors of the era Harold Hayes at Esquire, Clay Felker at New York, and Jann Wenner at Rolling Stone. And finally Weingarten takes us through the demise of the New Journalists, a tragedy of hubris, miscalculation, and corporate menacing. This is the story of perhaps the last great good time in American journalism, a time when writers didn t just cover stories but immersed themselves in them, and when journalism didn t just report America but reshaped it.  Within a seven-year period, a group of writers emerged, seemingly out of nowhere Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, Joan Didion, John Sack, Michael Herr to impose some order on all of this American mayhem, each in his or her own distinctive manner (a few old hands, like Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, chipped in, as well). They came to tell us stories about ourselves in ways that we couldn t, stories about the way life was being lived in the sixties and seventies and what it all meant to us. The stakes were high; deep fissures were rending the social fabric, the world was out of order. So they became our master explainers, our town criers, even our moral conscience the New Journalists.   from the Introduction","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pmsGOSBQdOoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On and off the record: Colosi on negotiation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rmsmAQAAMAAJ&dq=On+and+off+the+record:+Colosi+on+negotiation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game","description":"Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Excerpt: The Wheel of Time (abbreviated by fans to WoT) is a series of epic fantasy novels written by American author James Oliver Rigney, Jr., under the pen name Robert Jordan. Originally planned as a six-book series, the length was increased by increments; at the time of Rigney's death, he expected it to be 12, but it will actually run 14. There is also a prequel novel and a companion book available. Rigney began writing the first volume, The Eye of the World, in 1984 and it was published in January 1990. The author died in 2007 while working on what was planned to be the final volume in the series, although he had prepared extensive notes so another author could complete the book according to his wishes. Fellow fantasy author and long-time Wheel of Time fan Brandon Sanderson was brought in to complete the final book, but during the writing process it was decided that book would be far too large to be published in one volume, and would instead be published as three volumes as large as, or larger than, any previous book in the series. The first volume was published in 2009 under the title The Gathering Storm. The final two books are called Towers of Midnight (released November 2, 2010) and A Memory of Light (slated for a March 2012 release).

Growing Up in America provides a rich, first-hand account of the different social worlds that teens of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds experience. In their own words, these American teens describe, conflicts with parents, pressures from other teens, school experiences, and religious beliefs that drive their various understandings of the world. As the book reveals, teens' unequal experiences have a significant impact on their adult lives and their potential for social mobility. Directly confronting the constellation of advantages and disadvantages white, black, Hispanic, and Asian teens face today, this work provides a framework for understanding the relationship between socialization in adolescence and social inequality in adulthood. By uncovering the role racial and ethnic differences play early on, we can better understand the sources of inequality in American life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nXkSEkYjin4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaplan New MCAT in a Box","description":"Kaplan s MCAT Complete 7-Book Subject Review 20212022 includes updates across all 7 books to reflect the latest, most accurate, and most testable materials on the MCAT.

This approach to communication is the process of designing and implementing a media message to both entertain and educate to increase audience members' knowledge about an educational issue, create favorable attitudes, and change overt behavior. It uses the universal appeal of entertainment to show individuals how they can live safer, healthier, and happier lives.

This intense allegiance continued almost until the moment of independence, an event defined by an emotional break with the king. By reading American history forward from the seventeenth century rather than backward from the Revolution, McConville shows that political conflicts long assumed to foreshadow the events of 1776 were in fact fought out by factions who invoked competing visions of the king and appropriated royal rites rather than used abstract republican rights or pro-democratic proclamations. The American Revolution, McConville contends, emerged out of the fissure caused by the unstable mix of affective attachments to the king and a weak imperial government. Sure to provoke debate, The King's Three Faces offers a powerful counterthesis to dominant American historiography.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OjDqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Torn covenants","description":"TORN COVENANTS, sequel to THE MISTS OF MANITTOO, in THE DOWLAND TRILOGY, is the moving story of Elizabeth Dowland and Wakwa Manunnappu, her Native American husband, striving to build a life together in a world bent on tearing them apart.

Her husband, the former Minister of Health and Welfare under the Shah and an American-trained orthopedic surgeon who played a role in the real-life events chronicled in Ken Follett's best-selling book On Wings of Eagles, was subsequently and wrongfully imprisoned and sentenced to life. Part memoir and part historical account, the book presents one upper-class Iranian family, members of a traditional society who became victims of the state and pawns in the transitory world of revolutionary power politics. Most of all, however, Behind the Tall Walls is the intimate story of one woman caught between clashing armies and conflicting ideologies. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 challenged America's position in the Middle East and stirred unrest throughout the world. Many books have been written about this explosive subject: books that detail the political, historical, and social dynamics behind the events and describe the global consequences of this upheaval. However, none of these works have highlighted the human dimension of the \\"Iranian Crisis\\" as intimately nor illuminated the facts as vividly as Behind the Tall Walls. This book makes an important contribution by filling a major gap in understanding the impact of the Iranian Revolution on the lives of innocent people. A rich and moving tale of war, tragedy, and pain, it is also a tale of love, hope, and triumph, which will stay with the reader long after the last page is turned.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TiH5wAEACAAJ&dq=Behind+the+Tall+Walls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Apostles' Creed (Barclay Pocket Guides)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The soul of the apostolate (A Doubleday image book)","description":"Stresses the need for an inseparably close relation between the contemplative life and the active life.

It tells it by taking you on a 1000-mile-long field trip across the rough side of the continent from the California coast to the Rocky Mountains. This book puts you on the outcrop, geologic hammer in hand, to explore the evidence for how the spectacular, rough-hewn lands of the West came to be. When North America broke free from Eurasia and Africa some 200 million years ago, it triggered a cascade of violent geologic events that shaped the West we see today. As the west-moving continent crunched across the seabed of the ancient Pacific, islands and assorted pieces of ocean floor collected against its prow to build California--and plant gold there too. Meanwhile, mountains squeezed upward from California to Colorado, and vast quantities of molten rock seeded the crust with precious metals while spewing volcanic fire across the land. Later, the land stretched like an accordion to form the washboard-like Basin and Range province and Great Basin within it, while California began to crackle along the San Andreas fault. Throughout the West today, a near-constant drumroll of earthquakes testifies to a world still reshaping itself in response to the ceaseless movements of the Earth's tectonic plates. Rough-Hewn Land weaves these stories into the human history of the West. As we follow the adventures of John C. Fr mont, Mark Twain, the Donner party, and other historic characters, we see how geologic forces have shaped human experience, just as they direct the fate of the West today\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pakwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Rough-hewn,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seminoles (The Civilization of the American Indian series)","description":"Studies of the Oklahoma segment of the tribe have been few, and James H.

An average person spends his or her day enveloped in conversations, e-mails, phone calls, text messages, directions, headlines, and more. But how often do we stop to think about the origins of the words we use? Have you ever thought about which words in English have been borrowed from Arabic, Dutch, or Portuguese? Try admiral, landscape, and marmalade, just for starters. The Secret Life of Words is a wide-ranging account not only of the history of English language and vocabulary, but also of how words witness history, reflect social change, and remind us of our past. Henry Hitchings delves into the insatiable, ever-changing English language and reveals how and why it has absorbed words from more than 350 other languages many originating from the most unlikely of places, such as shampoo from Hindi and kiosk from Turkish. From the Norman Conquest to the present day, Hitchings narrates the story of English as a living archive of our human experience. He uncovers the secrets behind everyday words and explores the surprising origins of our most commonplace expressions. The Secret Life of Words is a rich, lively celebration of the language and vocabulary that we too often take for granted.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1rHevWO2Y-wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man o' War (Thoroughbred Legends)","description":"War Admiral's outstanding three -year old season earned him a championship and the Horse of the Year title.

He shows that the American focus on potential nuclear apocalypse during the Cold War obscured the broader effects of the nuclear complex on society, and that the atomic bomb produced a new cognitive orientation toward daily life, reconfiguring concepts of time, nature, race, and citizenship.

In The Feeling of Life Itself, Christof Koch offers a straightforward definition of consciousness as any subjective experience, from the most mundane to the most exalted the feeling of being alive. Psychologists study which cognitive operations underpin a given conscious perception. Neuroscientists track the neural correlates of consciousness in the brain, the organ of the mind. But why the brain and not, say, the liver? How can the brain, three pounds of highly excitable matter, a piece of furniture in the universe, subject to the same laws of physics as any other piece, give rise to subjective experience? Koch argues that what is needed to answer these questions is a quantitative theory that starts with experience and proceeds to the brain. In The Feeling of Life Itself, Koch outlines such a theory, based on integrated information. Koch describes how the theory explains many facts about the neurology of consciousness and how it has been used to build a clinically useful consciousness meter. The theory predicts that many, and perhaps all, animals experience the sights and sounds of life; consciousness is much more widespread than conventionally assumed. Contrary to received wisdom, however, Koch argues that programmable computers will not have consciousness. Even a perfect software model of the brain is not conscious. Its simulation is fake consciousness. Consciousness is not a special type of computation it is not a clever hack. Consciousness is about being.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mr74DwAAQBAJ&dq=Itself&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marion Pike: The art and the artist","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VqkPOAAACAAJ&dq=Marion+Pike:+The+art+and+the+artist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Baby Blessing","description":"Illustrations and simple, rhyming text portray a Jewish family, surrounded by kugel, candlesticks, challah trays, and more, welcoming the blessing of a newborn baby.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-aN2DwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Baby+Blessing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Howards of Caxley","description":"This book follows the Howards' fortunes in war and peace, from 1939 to 1950, against the backdrop of a little country town.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hWfT2c47MBwC&dq=The+Howards+of+Caxley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Data Structures and Program Design in C++","description":"Programming Principles 2 Introduction to Stacks 3 Queues 4 Linked Stacked and Queues 5 Recursion 6 Lists and Strings 7 Searching 8 Sorting 9 Tables and Information Retrieval 10 Binary Trees 11 Multiway Trees 12 Graphs 13 Case Study: The Polish Notation Appendix A Mathematical Methods Appendix B Random Numbers Appendix C Packages and Utility Functions Appendix D Programming Precepts, Pointers, and Pitfalls Index.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t2gPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Data+Structures+and+Program+Design+in+C&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Through College without Going Broke: A crash course on finding money for college and making it last (Students Helping Students)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o3lYAAAAYAAJ&dq=Getting+Through+College+without+Going+Broke:+A+crash+course+on+finding+money+for+college+and+making+it+last+(Students+Helping+Students)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beware of the Bears!","description":"The three bears decide to get their own back on Goldilocks.

The second edition was released soon after to reflect the rapid progress of the internal audit profession. There have been a number of significant changes in the practice of internal auditing since publication of the second edition and this revised third edition reflects those changes.

Originally created as political instruments, these so-called national oil companies (NOCs) face new demands amid today's dwindling oil reserves and simmering social pressures. Increasingly, state-owned oil firms particularly in the Middle East are having to balance the political demands of their governments with the need to be commercially competitive. In this ground-breaking new volume, Valerie Marcel draws on unprecedented access to the politicians, engineers; and businessmen directing five Middle Eastern state oil companies to shed light on one of the most secretive segments of the international oil industry. The author tells the stories of Saudi Aramco, Kuwait Petroleum Corp., the National Iranian Oil Co., Sonatrach of Algeria, and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. oil titans which together produce one quarter of the world's oil and hold half of the world's known oil and gas reserves. Dr. Marcel explains the complex bond between each state and its oil company, tracing the relationship's evolution from the politically charged days of foreign concessions to today's world of profit-driven decisionmaking. Drawn from over 120 interviews with company executives, middle managers, and oil-ministry officials, the author identifies a number of surprising new trends in these companies' strategy, and she paints a picture of their nascent sense of corporate identity. The book provides rare, up-to-date insight into how state-owned companies are striking a balance between their national mission and their commercial needs. The book also provides an insider's guide to these companies' unique culture. Executives and researchers in the region both inside and outside the oil industry will find it a valuable tool for understanding business in the Middle East.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jUU0mkUyuNQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Western Wall (Holy Places)","description":"Part of a series that looks at the links between different faiths and their holy places around the world, this title examines the historical background and significance of the Western Wall and the roots and practices of Judaism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QN0cNgAACAAJ&dq=Western+Wall+(Holy+Places)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feynman And Computation: Exploring The Limits Of Computers (The advanced book program)","description":"Richard P.

Robert Lustig is at the forefront of war against sugar   showing us that it's toxic, it's addictive, and it's everywhere because the food companies want it to be. His 90-minute YouTube video \\"Sugar: The Bitter Truth\\" has been viewed more than 7 million times. Now, in this landmark book, he documents the science and the politics that have led to personal misery and public crisis   the pandemic of obesity and chronic disease--over the last thirty years. In the late 1970s, when the U.S. government declared that we needed to get the fat out of our diets, the food industry responded by pumping in more sugar to make food more palatable (and more salable), and by removing the fiber to make food last longer on the shelf. The result has been a perfect storm for our health, disastrously altering our biochemistry to make us think we're starving, drive our eating habits out of our control, and turn us into couch potatoes. If we cannot control how we eat, it's because of the catastrophic excess of sugar in our diet--the resulting hormonal imbalances have rewired our brains! To help us lose weight and recover our health, Lustig presents strategies we can each use to readjust the key hormones that regulate hunger, reward, and stress, as well as societal strategies to improve the health of the next generation. With scientific rigor and even a little humor, Fat Chance categorically proves that \\"a calorie is not a calorie,\\" and takes that knowledge to its logical conclusion--an overhaul of the global food system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JK2KDQAAQBAJ&dq=Fat+Chance+(Five+Star+Expressions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Can Begin Again Sermons on the Sermon on the Mount","description":"Christians have always turned to the Sermon on the Mount for inspiration.

Thielicke makes it clear that the Sermon on the Mount can never be understood if, even for a moment, we forget the person of the Preacher of the Sermon. For without the person and work of Jesus Christ the marvellous words of the Beatitudes and the injunctions that follow them are the most radical and devastating distillation of God's claims that can be conceived - they leave us in utter hopeless dismay. Only through Christ can these words of the law become the glorious Gospel that promises a new life. Once again, as in his other best-selling works How the World Began and The Prayer that Spans the World, Thielicke brings profoundly biblical religion alive for modern readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9tTYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Authentic Color Schemes for Victorian Houses: Comstock's Modern House Painting, 1883 (Dover Architecture)","description":"Originally published in 1883, this now-rare book features 20 color plates illustrating directions for mixing primary and secondary colors to achieve olive, russet, citrine, sage, and other mellow tones of the era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ye_DAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Gay Erotica 2003","description":"Presenting the year's steamiest, most provocative gay sex writing...The best-selling gay erotica series in America!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=owFuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Botchan: A Modern Classic","description":"A modern classic in Japan on par with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn or The Catcher in the Rye, Botchan is a very popular Japanese novel and still widely read decades after its first publication. Botchan, a timeless Japanese novel written by Japan's most beloved novelist, Soseki Natsume, is now available in a revised edition featuring a new foreword by Dennis Washburn, Professor of Asian and Middle Eastern Languages at Dartmouth College. Prof. Washburn's foreword places the importance of both the author and the book into perspective for the modern reader. Botchan's story is a familiar one: the youngest son in a middle-class Tokyo family, he is consistently in the shadow of his elder brother. With a practically nonexistent relationship with his family, Botchan finds himself cast adrift after both his parents die. Now on his own, Botchan drifts through college only to find himself thrust into a teaching job in the unfamiliar realm of a country school, far from Tokyo and the life he has known. Botchan's difficulty adjusting to his new life is eloquently described, from his nosy landlord to his students, who delight in tormenting the newcomer from the big city. Through it all, Botchen's life is threaded with his vacillating concern for Kiyo, the family servant he left behind who was the only person to give him love and understanding in his life. Regardless of where he goes or what he does, he is always trying to apply the lessons she taught him to his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lPsVmAEACAAJ&dq=Botchan:+A+Modern+Classic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Station Wagon: A Tribute to America's Workaholic on Wheels","description":"Was there life before today's popular mini-van?

Arnett takes a positive view of higher education during a time when education is being assailed as seldom before. Arnett responds to this criticism with convincing support of the academy reinforced by his personal experiences as well as those of others scholars and teachers. Arnett's book is an invitation to converse about higher education as well as a reminder of the potential for dialogue between teacher and student, dialogue that the author defines as a \\"willingness to enter conversation about ideas,\\" to maintain relationships through differences, and to ask value questions. Arnett see education as more than the dispensing of information. He emphasizes the importance of character development as well as the the development of relationships between students and teachers. Arnett stresses the importance of honesty and integrity in students, teachers, and administrators, and he insists that education should focus more on the good of the entire school than on the individual. Arnett does not offer this book as the truth about education nor as a \\"how to teach\\" manual. Rather, he regards it as an attempt to understand education from a communication perspective and as a reminder of the positive and constructive aspects of teaching. The book is based on Arnett's belief that educators who care about ideas and people not only improve education but also benefit the community.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=174_XZfnkQ4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Road to Love Canal: Managing Industrial Waste before EPA","description":"This book examines industrial waste disposal before the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WSZSAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Road+to+Love+Canal:+Managing+Industrial+Waste+before+EPA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bravo, Maurice!","description":"Since he was a baby, all the members of Maurice's family think he will take up their careers, until one day they discover he has a special gift of his own.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AkAZBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lewis and Clark by Air with CD-Rom","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hCvTJJEkl8AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intuition Workout","description":"This is a new and revised edition of the classic text on intuition.

I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie is a collection of more than 200 of Ebert's most biting and entertaining reviews of films receiving a mere star or less from the only film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize. Ebert has no patience for these atrocious movies and minces no words in skewering the offenders. Witness: Armageddon * (1998) --The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense, and the human desire to be entertained. No matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out. The Beverly Hillbillies* (1993)--Imagine the dumbest half-hour sitcom you've ever seen, spin it out to ninety-three minutes by making it even more thin and shallow, and you have this movie. It's appalling. North no stars (1994)--I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it. Police Academy no stars (1984)--It's so bad, maybe you should pool your money and draw straws and send one of the guys off to rent it so that in the future, whenever you think you're sitting through a bad comedy, he could shake his head, chuckle tolerantly, and explain that you don't know what bad is. Dear God * (1996)--Dear God is the kind of movie where you walk out repeating the title, but not with a smile. The movies reviewed within I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie are motion pictures you'll want to distance yourself from, but Roger Ebert's creative and comical musings on those films make for a book no movie fan should miss.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UwXuJCuQ6q4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Island Magic: Far from Home/An Estate of Marriage/Then Came You/Enchanted (Romance Anthology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KnsSC4CxW2QC&dq=Island+Magic:+Far+from+Home/An+Estate+of+Marriage/Then+Came+You/Enchanted+(Romance+Anthology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Gentlemen Sharing","description":"Mayhem erupts in a small English village when two men arrive to take up housekeeping.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1omrAAAAIAAJ&dq=Two+Gentlemen+Sharing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: The Creatures of Narnia","description":"Meet the creatures of Narnia!

It is a meticulously researched expose of their complex, highly structured community life. Originally translated into English in 1937, the quality of research remains as relevant today as it was when it was first published. This illuminating account will not only appeal to those with a scientific interest in termites, but will similarly enthrall readers who are new to their captivating world. An exceptional feature of his detailed research is the extraordinary psychological life of the termite. While the studies are based in South Africa, the extensive research includes the termites of Magnetic Island, Australia. The Soul of the White Ant is part science, part mysticism, a sort of manual of pantheism, and a very personal and careful observation of termites as a life form.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AgxdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bangladesh (Cultures of the World)","description":"Provides an overview of the geography, history, government, language, art, and food of Bangladesh, exploring its customs and current issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yyREz0r7-BUC&dq=Bangladesh+(Cultures+of+the+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life of Henry David Thoreau","description":" Walden. Yesterday I came here to live.  That entry from the journal of Henry David Thoreau, and the intellectual journey it began, would by themselves be enough to place Thoreau in the American pantheon. His attempt to  live deliberately  in a small woods at the edge of his hometown of Concord has been a touchstone for individualists and seekers since the publication of Walden in 1854. But there was much more to Thoreau than his brief experiment in living at Walden Pond. A member of the vibrant intellectual circle centered on his neighbor Ralph Waldo Emerson, he was also an ardent naturalist, a manual laborer and inventor, a radical political activist, and more. Many books have taken up various aspects of Thoreau s character and achievements, but, as Laura Dassow Walls writes,  Thoreau has never been captured between covers; he was too quixotic, mischievous, many-sided.  Two hundred years after his birth, and two generations after the last full-scale biography, Walls restores Henry David Thoreau to us in all his profound, inspiring complexity. Walls traces the full arc of Thoreau s life, from his early days in the intellectual hothouse of Concord, when the American experiment still felt fresh and precarious, and  America was a family affair, earned by one generation and about to pass to the next.  By the time he died in 1862, at only forty-four years of age, Thoreau had witnessed the transformation of his world from a community of farmers and artisans into a bustling, interconnected commercial nation. What did that portend for the contemplative individual and abundant, wild nature that Thoreau celebrated? Drawing on Thoreau s copious writings, published and unpublished, Walls presents a Thoreau vigorously alive in all his quirks and contradictions: the young man shattered by the sudden death of his brother; the ambitious Harvard College student; the ecstatic visionary who closed Walden with an account of the regenerative power of the Cosmos. We meet the man whose belief in human freedom and the value of labor made him an uncompromising abolitionist; the solitary walker who found society in nature, but also found his own nature in the society of which he was a deeply interwoven part. And, running through it all, Thoreau the passionate naturalist, who, long before the age of environmentalism, saw tragedy for future generations in the human heedlessness around him.  The Thoreau I sought was not in any book, so I wrote this one,  says Walls. The result is a Thoreau unlike any seen since he walked the streets of Concord, a Thoreau for our time and all time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k24pDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913 : A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913","description":"Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913, Second Edition presents a straightforward, balanced, and comprehensive history of American international relations from the American Revolution to 1913.

The corporate saga of the Wabash involved the efforts of strong-willed and creative leaders, but this book provides more than traditional business history. Noted transportation historian H. Roger Grant captures the human side of the Wabash, ranging from the medical doctors who created an effective hospital department to the worker-sponsored social events. And Grant has not ignored the impact the Wabash had on businesses and communities in the \\"Heart of America.\\" Like most major American carriers, the Wabash grew out of an assortment of small firms, including the first railroad to operate in Illinois, the Northern Cross. Thanks in part to the genius of financier Jay Gould, by the early 1880s what was then known as the Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway reached the principal gateways of Chicago, Des Moines, Detroit, Kansas City, and St. Louis. In the 1890s, the Wabash gained access to Buffalo and direct connections to Boston and New York City. One extension, spearheaded by Gould's eldest son, George, fizzled. In 1904 entry into Pittsburgh caused financial turmoil, ultimately throwing the Wabash into receivership. A subsequent reorganization allowed the Wabash to become an important carrier during the go-go years of the 1920s and permitted the company to take control of a strategic \\"bridge\\" property, the Ann Arbor Railroad. The Great Depression forced the company into another receivership, but an effective reorganization during the early days of World War II gave rise to a generally robust road. Its famed Blue Bird streamliner, introduced in 1950 between Chicago and St. Louis, became a widely recognized symbol of the \\"New Wabash.\\" When \\"merger madness\\" swept the railroad industry in the 1960s, the Wabash, along with the Nickel Plate Road, joined the prosperous Norfolk & Western Railway, a merger that worked well for all three carriers. Immortalized in the popular folk song \\"Wabash Cannonball,\\" the midwestern railroad has left important legacies. Today, forty years after becoming a \\"fallen flag\\" carrier, key components of the former Wabash remain busy rail arteries and terminals, attesting to its historic value to American transportation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Db2tDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Follow+the+Flag%22:+A+History+of+the+Wabash+Railroad+Company+(Railroads+in+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Song","description":"INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ONE OF BARACK OBAMA'S FAVORITE BOOKS OF 2021 AN OPRAH BOOK CLUB SELECTION WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD FOR FICTION FINALIST FOR THE PEN/HEMINGWAY AWARD FOR DEBUT NOVEL ?

Winner of an AudioFile Earphones Award The 2020 NAACP Image Award-winning poet makes her fiction debut with this National Book Award-longlisted, magisterial epic an intimate yet sweeping novel with all the luminescence and force of Homegoing; Sing, Unburied, Sing; and The Water Dancer that chronicles the journey of one American family, from the centuries of the colonial slave trade through the Civil War to our own tumultuous era. The great scholar, W. E. B. Du Bois, once wrote about the Problem of race in America, and what he called  Double Consciousness,  a sensitivity that every African American possesses in order to survive. Since childhood, Ailey Pearl Garfield has understood Du Bois s words all too well. Bearing the names of two formidable Black Americans the revered choreographer Alvin Ailey and her great grandmother Pearl, the descendant of enslaved Georgians and tenant farmers Ailey carries Du Bois s Problem on her shoulders. Ailey is reared in the north in the City but spends summers in the small Georgia town of Chicasetta, where her mother s family has lived since their ancestors arrived from Africa in bondage. From an early age, Ailey fights a battle for belonging that s made all the more difficult by a hovering trauma, as well as the whispers of women her mother, Belle, her sister, Lydia, and a maternal line reaching back two centuries that urge Ailey to succeed in their stead. To come to terms with her own identity, Ailey embarks on a journey through her family s past, uncovering the shocking tales of generations of ancestors Indigenous, Black, and white in the deep South. In doing so Ailey must learn to embrace her full heritage, a legacy of oppression and resistance, bondage and independence, cruelty and resilience that is the story and the song of America itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5VH1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rum Rebellion: A study of the overthrow of Governor Bligh by John Macarthur and the New South Wales Corps (Sirius books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=43QcAAAAMAAJ&dq=Rum+Rebellion:+A+study+of+the+overthrow+of+Governor+Bligh+by+John+Macarthur+and+the+New+South+Wales+Corps+(Sirius+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Foundations: An Investigative History","description":"In American Foundations, Mark Dowie argues that organized philanthropy is on the verge of an evolutionary shift that will transform America's nearly 50,000 foundations from covert arbiters of knowledge and culture to overt mediators of public policy and aggressive creators of new orthodoxy. He questions the wisdom of placing so much power at the disposal of nondemocratic institutions. As American wealth expands, old foundations such as Ford, Carnegie, Rockefeller, Pew, and MacArthur have grown exponentially, while newer trusts such as Mott, Johnson, Packard, Kellogg, Hughes, Annenberg, Hewlett, Duke, and Gates have surpassed them. Foundation assets now total close to $400 billion. Though this is a tiny sum compared to corporate and government treasuries, and foundation grants still total less than 10 percent of contributions made by individuals, foundations have power and influence far beyond their wealth. Their influence derives from the conditional nature of their grant making, their power from its leverage. Unlike previous historians of philanthropy who have focused primarily on the grant maker, Dowie examines foundations from the public's perspective. He focuses on eight key areas in which foundations operate: education, science, health, environment, food, energy, art, and human services. He also looks at their imagination, or lack thereof, and at the strained relationship between American foundations and American democracy. Dowie believes that foundations deserve to exist and that they can assume an increasingly vital role in American society, but only if they transform themselves from private to essentially public institutions. The reforms he proposes to make foundations more responsive to pressing social problems and more accountable to the public will almost certainly start an important national debate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nv1SZdM1tz0C&dq=American+Foundations:+An+Investigative+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Accusations: Babylon 5, Book #2","description":"A deadly conspiracy from Mars succeeds in stripping Ivanova of her command and forcing the Babylon 5 loyalists into action.

Driverless cars are hitting the road, powered by artificial intelligence. Robots can climb stairs, open doors, win Jeopardy, analyze stocks, work in factories, find parking spaces, advise oncologists. In the past, automation was considered a threat to low-skilled labor. Now, many high-skilled functions, including interpreting medical images, doing legal research, and analyzing data, are within the skill sets of machines. How can higher education prepare students for their professional lives when professions themselves are disappearing? In Robot-Proof, Northeastern University president Joseph Aoun proposes a way to educate the next generation of college students to invent, to create, and to discover to fill needs in society that even the most sophisticated artificial intelligence agent cannot. A  robot-proof  education, Aoun argues, is not concerned solely with topping up students' minds with high-octane facts. Rather, it calibrates them with a creative mindset and the mental elasticity to invent, discover, or create something valuable to society a scientific proof, a hip-hop recording, a web comic, a cure for cancer. Aoun lays out the framework for a new discipline, humanics, which builds on our innate strengths and prepares students to compete in a labor market in which smart machines work alongside human professionals. The new literacies of Aoun's humanics are data literacy, technological literacy, and human literacy. Students will need data literacy to manage the flow of big data, and technological literacy to know how their machines work, but human literacy the humanities, communication, and design to function as a human being. Life-long learning opportunities will support their ability to adapt to change. The only certainty about the future is change. Higher education based on the new literacies of humanics can equip students for living and working through change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pmYyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brewster's Millions","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZlURAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of yoga: A handbook of theory, practice, and application","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=in0wAAAAYAAJ&dq=Fundamentals+of+yoga:+A+handbook+of+theory,+practice,+and+application&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traditional Clothing of the Native Americans: With Patterns and Ideas for Making Authentic Traditional Clothing, Making Modern Buckskin Clothing and a Section on Tanning Buckskins and Furs","description":"Explores the traditional dress of Native Americans in the nine major cultural areas of North America, with an emphasis on everyday or \\"work\\" clothes.

A fearless at-tacker of intellectual and cultural orthodoxies, Stove left powerful critiques of scientific irrationalism, Dar-winian theories of human behavior, and philosophi-cal idealism. He was also an occasional essayist of considerable charm and polemical snap. Stove's writ-ing is both rigorous and immensely readable. It is, in the words of Roger Kimball, \\"an invigorating blend of analytic lucidity, mordant humor, and an amount of common sense too great to be called 'common.'\\" Against the Idols of the Age brings together a repre-sentative selection of Stove's writing and is an ideal introduction to his work.The book opens with some of Stove's most impor-tant attacks on irrationalism in the philosophy of sci-ence. He exposes the roots of this fashionable attitude, tracing it through writers like Paul Feyerabend andThomas Kuhn to Karl Popper. Stove was a born controversialist, so it is not surpris-ing that when he turned his attention to contemporary affairs he said things that are politically incorrect. The topical essays that make up the second part of the book show Stove at his most withering and combative. Whether the subject is race, femi-nism, the Enlightenment, or the demand for \\"non-coercive philosophy,\\" Stove is on the mark with a battery of impressive arguments expressed in sharp, uncompromis-ing prose. Against the Idols of the Age concludes with a generous sampling of his blistering attacks on Darwinism.David Stove's writings are an undiscovered treasure. Although readers may dis-agree with some of his opinions, they will find it difficult to dismiss his razor-sharp arguments. Against the Idols of the Age is the first book to make the full range of this important thinker available to the general reader.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1zgrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lunches and Brunches","description":"Brunch: The Complete Cookbook features over 100 sweet and savory brunch recipes!

The flocks were so large and so dense that they blackened the skies, even blotting out the sun for days at a stretch. Yet by the end of the century, the most common bird in North America had vanished from the wild. In 1914, the last known representative of her species, Martha, died in a cage at the Cincinnati Zoo. This stunningly illustrated book tells the astonishing story of North America's Passenger Pigeon, a bird species that like the Tyrannosaur, the Mammoth, and the Dodo has become one of the great icons of extinction. Errol Fuller describes how these fast, agile, and handsomely plumaged birds were immortalized by the ornithologist and painter John James Audubon, and captured the imagination of writers such as James Fenimore Cooper, Henry David Thoreau, and Mark Twain. He shows how widespread deforestation, the demand for cheap and plentiful pigeon meat, and the indiscriminate killing of Passenger Pigeons for sport led to their catastrophic decline. Fuller provides an evocative memorial to a bird species that was once so important to the ecology of North America, and reminds us of just how fragile the natural world can be. Published in the centennial year of Martha s death, The Passenger Pigeon features rare archival images as well as haunting photos of live birds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MGuYDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Passenger+Pigeon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better Food for Dogs: A Complete Cookbook and Nutrition Guide","description":"Better Food for Dogs People want their dogs to have happy, healthy and long lives and providing the best nutrition is one of the most important steps you can take toward achieving this goal.

In the United States, much of this attention is predicated on the \\"official\\" discourse, or story, of obesity-that it is a matter of personal responsibility, specifically to the end of monitoring and ensuring appropriate caloric balance. However, even though it continues to have cultural presumption, that discourse does not resonate with the populace, which may explain why efforts of redress have been notoriously ineffective. In this book, the Helene Shugart places obesity in cultural, political, and economic context, arguing that current anxieties regarding obesity reflect the contemporary crisis in neoliberalism, and that the failure of the official discourse of obesity mirrors the failure of neoliberalism more broadly: specifically, to account for authenticity, a powerfully resonant cultural concept today. She chronicles a number of competing discourses of obesity that have arisen in response to the failed official discourse, examining and evaluating each in relation to the idea of authenticity; assessing the practical and behavioral implications of each discourse for both obesity incidence and redress; and establishing the significance of each discourse for negotiating neoliberalism in crisis more broadly.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nNomDAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Slim+Book+on+Weighty+Matters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Valley lilies: Or, messages of comfort","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SWldHAAACAAJ&dq=Valley+lilies:+Or,+messages+of+comfort&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret games of the gods: Ancient ritual systems in board games","description":"The first comprehensive survey of the different methods of divination, this book delves into games originating from many countries and cultures, showing how each is based upon a vision of the universe in which the \\"will of the gods\\" is discovered through ritual practice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gRmWNgAACAAJ&dq=Secret+games+of+the+gods:+Ancient+ritual+systems+in+board+games&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illustrated Nature Encyclopedia: Animals in the Wild (Illustrated Wildlife Encyclopedia)","description":"This comprehensive guide provides information about North American habitats and the creatures found in them.

The understanding of the musical techniques of composition cannot be reduced to a handbook of simplified rules. Music is complex and ever changing. It is the purpose of this book to trace the path of musical growth from the late Romantic period to the serial techniques of the contemporary composer. Through the detailed analysis of the musical characteristics that dominate a specific style of writing, a graduated plan is organized and presented here in the form of explanations and exercises. A new analytical method substitutes for the diatonic figured bass and makes exercises and the analysis of non-diatonic literature more manageable. The explanations describing each technique are thorough. They are designed to help the teacher and the student see the many extenuating circumstances that affect a particular analytical decision. More important than a dogmatic decision on a particular key center or a root tone, for example, is the understanding of why such an underdeterminate condition may exist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EmDPoAEACAAJ&dq=Contemporary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Library Edition)","description":"The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by \\"an enormous thing,\\" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bedquilt and Other Stories","description":"A collection of stories touches on such topics as love, war, race relations, women's rights, and the trials of marriage","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H9Xljcj8J0IC&dq=Bedquilt+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trees & Timber in the Ancient Mediterranean World","description":"Sunday Times Bestseller  A paradigm-smashing chronicle of joyous entanglement  Charles Foster Waterstones Non-Fiction Book of the Month (September) Are trees social beings?

A Handful of Kings, the latest novel by prolific author and former foreign service officer Mark Jacobs, follows Vicky's fast-paced tour of duty -- one where she must decide who the bad guys are, who is lying, and who just might be telling the dangerous truth. Vicky is changing her life. She is leaving the foreign service and her lover at the same time. But before she departs the U.S. embassy in Madrid for home, a well-known American writer shows up with a strange request. Vicky knows that what the writer wants from her is not necessarily what he is asking. But curiosity leads her to play along, and she is quickly drawn into the murky underground of terrorists and spies into which the writer himself has been reluctantly led. The track she takes is full of wrong turns. And at the end of the tunnel, it's not light she sees but an unspeakable threat to people she loves. Recalling Graham Greene in The Comedians, Jacobs weaves an engrossing story that takes place over three continents and illuminates the unexpected ways people betray and defend one another and, ultimately, how they learn to love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iGyLER9hGQQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Musician: An Integrated Approach to Tonal Theory, Analysis, and Listening Includes 2 CDs","description":"Package includes The Complete Musician textbook, the two accompanying student workbooks, and the 8-CD boxed set.

To discuss work and family is also to discuss gender. Ranging from California's Silicon Valley to a remote fishing village in the northeast, part one shows how new work arrangements have created new expectations for what it means to be a woman or a man, and how slow and uneven the pace of change can be. Nowhere are the tensions of work and family more potent than around childcare. Part two takes up these tensions, showing how various \\"solutions\\" to caring for children of all ages (whether infants or teenagers) create new problems. Parts three and four turn outward to show how the new relationships between families and work are changing the relationships between families and the communities in which they live and generating new social policy dilemmas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x-m6AAAAIAAJ&dq=Families+at+Work:+Expanding+the+Bounds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of the life of the late Mr. Jonathan Wild the Great,","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Any physician will tell you that in order to live a healthy life you must take care of your heart. And that includes both exercise and a diet low in the 'bad stuff' and high in the 'good stuff.' You must be disciplined. Discipline is at the root of a healthy spiritual heart, as well. For the man who desires a life of spiritual vitality, discipline is the daily habit that transforms mere desire into doing, and turns good intentions into contagious Bible reading, deepening prayer, and an irresistible urge to follow Jesus. Discipline is not a stumbling block but a springboard to spiritual growth. Dr. Wagner offers this practical tool that will guide men toward the goal of godliness. His life-changing message comes home in three sections: 1) The Need for Discipline - Discover who and what you can become through the joy of an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ. 2) The Disciplines - Unlock the seven spiritual disciplines through inspiring, personal illustrations and practical, simple strategies on how to practice each discipline. 3) Encouragement to Stay on the Course - Obtain helpful ideas on how to sustain a newfound discipline by 'looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.' The Heart of a Godly Man gives you what you want and what you need to deepen your spiritual life - discipline that has the power to give you a life of purpose and joy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kNP-_HWtkzgC&dq=The+Heart+of+a+Godly+Man:+Practical+Disciplines+for+a+Man%27s+Spiritual+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Networking","description":"A guide for beginners offers diagrams and instructions for creating and updating computer networks in the home and office, covering new technologies, troubleshooting, and security.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Aq0IPzq4XZEC&dq=The+Complete+Idiot%27s+Guide+to+Networking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Oath (Babylon 5, Book 3)","description":"When a ruthless ambassador is assassinated, Security Chief Garibaldi and Commander Susan Ivanova join the victim's enraged assistant Na'Toth in a search for the killer, only to find themselves the targets of a blood oath.

What seems to be a spectacular meteor shower turns into a bizarre, green inferno that blinds everyone and renders humankind helpless. What follows is even stranger: spores from the inferno cause the triffids to suddenly take on a life of their own. They become large, crawling vegetation, with the ability to uproot and roam about the country, attacking humans and inflicting pain and agony. William Masen somehow managed to escape being blinded in the inferno, and now after leaving the hospital, he is one of the few survivors who can see.

Dr. Dan explains how any horse owner or stable keeper can take proper care of their animal. These animals are the same equine version of highly trained athletes, he says, and like any athlete they are susceptible to strain or injury. Whether the patient is human or animal, the basic chiropractic technique--manipulating the spine to return misaligned bones to their proper position--is the same. Kamen says, \\"If it has a spine, I can work on it.\\" With the aid of a few bales of hay for height, and a few of these easy-to-follow techniques which are accompanied by over 170 illustrations, you can give your animal the proper care he needs to keep him on track. Dr. Kamen has treated racehorses for what he terms \\"a nagging backache.\\" With this trademark humor and anecdotes about his adventures as an animal chiropractor, Dr. Kamen has again delivered a book that will delight owner and animal alike. A wonderful gift for horse lovers. About the Author Dr. Daniel Kamen was born in Chicago, Illinois and has been practicing chiropractic since 1981. His father is a highly respected anesthesiologist; his mother, a gifted artist. Dr. Kamen's original animal chiropractic organization, \\"Animal Crackers,\\" produced animal chiropractic educational materials, which taught others how to adjust dogs and horses. Dr. Kamen lives with his wife, Sharon, of thirty-four years. Together they have three sons, Jeffrey, Gary and Kevin. He makes his home in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. Dr. Kamen has been featured in many TV, radio, and newspaper stories concerning his work with animal chiropractic. He currently is on tour, teaching a professional as well as a lay lecture seminar on animal chiropractic (horse and dog adjusting). His hobbies include playing the piano and chess (master level). Books by Daniel Kamen include: \\"The Well Adjusted Dog, The Well Adjusted Horse, The Well Adjusted Cat\\" and a novel entitled \\"Stagecoach Road: The Bullies Must Die.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tVo0Ni1gEVMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maire (The Fires of Gleannmara Series #1)","description":"Taking a reformed mercenary hostage during a raid, a Gleannmara warrior queen learns that her captive is a Christian and initially dismisses him as a coward before realizing the inherent strength of his practice of meekness and humility.

R. Butz, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, was the first (and so far the only) writer to treat the entire Holocaust complex from the Revisionist perspective, in a precise scientific manner. This book exhibits the overwhelming force of historical and logical arguments which Revisionism had accumulated by the middle of the 70s. It was the first book published in the US which won for Revisionism the academic dignity to which it is entitled. It continues to be a major revisionist reference work, frequently cited by prominent personalities. This new edition comes with several supplements adding new information gathered by the author over the last 25 years. Because of its prestige, no library can forbear offering The Hoax of the Twentieth Century, and no historian of modern times can ignore it. A 'must read' for every Revisionist and every newcomer to the issue who wants to thoroughly learn about revisionist arguments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vkIpAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Hoax+of+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spirit of the Sixties; The Making of Postwar Radicalism (American Radicals)","description":"The Spirit of the Sixties explains how and why the personal became political when Sixties activists confronted the institutions of American postwar culture.

After establishing its origins in the Catholic Worker movement, the Beat generation, the civil rights movement, and Ban-the-Bomb protests, James Farrell demonstrates the impact of personalism on Sixties radicalism. Students, antiwar activists and counterculturalists all used personalist perspectives in the \\"here and now revolution\\" of the decade. These perspectives also persisted in American politics after the Sixties. Exploring the Sixties not just as history but as current affairs, Farrell revisits the perennial questions of human purpose and cultural practice contested in the decade.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iY-MAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hemp Masters - Getting Knotty: Ancient Hippie Secrets for Knotting Hip Hemp Jewelry","description":"Guide to making hemp jewelry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Oy-pMQEACAAJ&dq=Hemp+Masters+-+Getting+Knotty:+Ancient+Hippie+Secrets+for+Knotting+Hip+Hemp+Jewelry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photo Finish","description":"I've seen every square inch of Violet Eaton's delectable body and she has no idea who I am.

It was the same every morning. Wake up, grab the ice skates, and head to the rink while the world was still dark. Weekends were spent in glitter and tights at competitions. Perform. Smile. And do it again. She was good. She won. And she hated it. For ten years, figure skating was Tillie Walden s life. She woke before dawn for morning lessons, went straight to group practice after school, and spent weekends competing at ice rinks across the state. Skating was a central piece of her identity, her safe haven from the stress of school, bullies, and family. But as she switched schools, got into art, and fell in love with her first girlfriend, she began to question how the close-minded world of figure skating fit in with the rest of her life, and whether all the work was worth it given the reality: that she, and her friends on the team, were nowhere close to Olympic hopefuls. The more Tillie thought about it, the more Tillie realized she d outgrown her passion and she finally needed to find her own voice. This title has Common Core connections.

Both timely and timeless, How Wars Are Won illuminates the thirteen essential rules for success on the battlefield that have evolved from ancient times until the present day. Acclaimed military historian Bevin Alexander s incisive and vivid analyses of famous battles throughout the ages show how the greatest commanders from Alexander the Great to Douglas MacArthur have applied these rules. For example: ? Feign retreat: Pretend defeat, fake a retreat, then ambush the enemy while being pursued. Used to devastating effect by the North Vietnamese against U.S. forces during the Vietnam War. ? Strike at enemy weakness: Avoid the enemy s strength entirely by refusing to fight pitched battles, a method that has run alongside conventional war from the earliest days of human conflict. Brilliantly applied by Mao Zedong to defeat the Chinese Nationalists. ? Defend, then attack: Gain possession of a superior weapon or tactical system, induce the enemy to launch a fruitless attack, then go on the offensive. Employed repeatedly against the Goths by the Eastern Roman general Belisarius to reclaim vast stretches of the Roman Empire. The lessons of history revealed in these pages can be used to shape the strategies needed to win the conflicts of today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Oyo2H346HLMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kentucky Derby Glasses Price Guide, 2000-2001 Edition","description":"An invaluable guide for Kentucky Derby Glass collectors filled with up-to-date information on current market value of past Kentucky Derby glasses.

We present the material at a level that assumes some familiarity with the basics of ordinary and partial differential equations. Some of the more advanced ideas are reviewed as needed; therefore this book can serve as a text in either an advanced undergraduate course or a graduate-level course on the subject. Perturbation methods, first used by astronomers to predict the effects of small disturbances on the nominal motions of celestial bodies, have now become widely used analytical tools in virtually all branches of science. A problem lends itself to perturbation analysis if it is \\"close\\" to a simpler problem that can be solved exactly. Typically, this closeness is measured by the occurrence of a small dimensionless parameter, E, in the governing system (consisting of differential equations and boundary conditions) so that for E = 0 the resulting system is exactly solvable. The main mathematical tool used is asymptotic expansion with respect to a suitable asymptotic sequence of functions of E. In a regular perturbation problem, a straightforward procedure leads to a system of differential equations and boundary conditions for each term in the asymptotic expansion. This system can be solved recursively, and the accuracy of the result improves as E gets smaller, for all values of the independent variables throughout the domain of interest. We discuss regular perturbation problems in the first chapter.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uH_kBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television","description":"A total departure from previous writing about television, this book is the first ever to advocate that the medium is not reformable. Its problems are inherent in the technology itself and are so dangerous to personal health and sanity, to the environment, and to democratic processes that TV ought to be eliminated forever. Weaving personal experiences through meticulous research, the author ranges widely over aspects of television that have rarely been examined and never before joined together, allowing an entirely new, frightening image to emerge. The idea that all technologies are \\"neutral,\\" benign instruments that can be used well or badly, is thrown open to profound doubt. Speaking of TV reform is, in the words of the author, \\"as absurd as speaking of the reform of a technology such as guns.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vbsPAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NTC's EFL Bookshelf CD-ROM","description":"Learning English has never been so convenient and fascinating!

But in the end he became an embittered crank who so possessively loved the company he built that when his son, Edsel, tried to change it to suit the times, Henry destroyed him. It was left to Edsel's son, Henry II, to avenge him and save the Ford Motor Company. From the details of Henry I's illicit affair, which produced an illegitimate son, to the life and loves of \\"Hank the Deuce\\" and his celebrated feud with Lee Iacocca, this is an engrossing account of a vital chapter in American history.

This first poet of the English language stands before the gateway of the early modern age at a time when the elite languages of French and Latin were giving way to the vernacular of the common people. Richard West weaves a fascinating picture of a man whose own character has always puzzled lovers of his comic masterpiece, The Canterbury Tales. How did he remain so apparently cheerful and serene through one of the cruellest eras of history? As a child he survived the Black Death, later he fought in France during the Hundred Years War, served as a diplomat in Italy, and became an MP at the time of the Peasants' Revolt and the murder of Richard II. Richard West sees Chaucer as the creator not only of English poetry, but of the national character and humour, the forerunner of Shakespeare and Dickens - in many ways, as the first Englishman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CnhaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Chaucer+1340-1400:+The+Life+And+Times+of+the+First+English+Poet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Matchibako: Japanese Matchbox Art Of The 20s & 30s","description":"Japanese matchbook art of the 1920s and 1930s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rwg0AAAACAAJ&dq=Matchibako:+Japanese+Matchbox+Art+Of+The+20s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Europe in our time, 1914 to the present","description":"This is a new release of the original 1948 edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WAInngEACAAJ&dq=Europe+in+our+time,+1914+to+the+present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honku: The Zen Antidote to Road Rage","description":"How many times this week has your morning commute, or just plain driving to the grocery store, turned into a road-rage-inducing nightmare?

Then, when the student has found out how tricks can be done, he would do well to turn his attention to Our Magic, by Mr. Maskelyne and his associate, Mr. David Devant. And from this logical treatise he can learn how experiments in magic ought to be composed. It is from this admirable discussion of the basic principles of modern magic that more than one of the points made in this paper have been borrowed. Mr. Devant calls attention to the fact that new tricks are common, new manipulative devices, new examples of dexterity and new applications of science, whereas new plots, new ideas for effective presentation, are rare. He describes a series of experiments of his own, some of which utilize again but in a novel manner devices long familiar, while others are new both in idea and in many of the subsidiary methods of execution. One of the most hackneyed and yet one of the most effective illusions in the repertory of the conjurer is that known as the Rising Cards. The performer brings forward a pack of cards, several of which are drawn by members of the audience and returned to the pack, whereupon at the command of the magician they rise out of the pack one after the other in the order in which they were drawn. In the oldest form in which this illusion is described in the books on the art, the pack is placed in a case supported by a rod standing on a base, and the secret of the trick lies on this rod and its base. The rod is really a hollow tube and the base is really an empty box. The tube is filled with sand, on the top of which rests a leaden weight, to which is attached a thread so arranged over and under certain cards as to cause the chosen cards to rise when it descends down the tube; and in putting the cards into the case the conjurer released a valve at the bottom of the tube, so that the sand might escape into the box, whereby the weight was lowered, the thread then doing its allotted work, and the cards ascending into view, no matter how far distant the performer might then be standing. It seems likely that the invention of this primitive apparatus may have been due to the fact that some eighteenth century conjurer happened to observe the sand running out of an hour-glass and set about to find some means whereby this escape of sand could be utilized in his art. The hollow rod, the escaping sand, and the descending weight have long since been discarded; but the illusion of the Rising Cards survives and is now performed in an unending variety of ways. The pack may be held in the hand of the performer, without the use of any case, or it may be placed in a glass goblet, or it may be tied together with a ribbon and thus suspended from cords that swing to and from almost over the heads of the spectators; and however they may be isolated the chosen cards rise obediently when they are bidden. The original effect subsists, even though the devices differ....

When the government of Jordan granted amnesty to a group of political prisoners in 1999, it little realized that among them was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a terrorist mastermind and soon the architect of an Islamist movement bent on dominating the Middle East. In Black Flags, an unprecedented character-driven account of the rise of ISIS, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Joby Warrick shows how the zeal of this one man and the strategic mistakes of Presidents Bush and Obama led to the banner of ISIS being raised over huge swaths of Syria and Iraq. Zarqawi began by directing terror attacks from a base in northern Iraq, but it was the American invasion in 2003 that catapulted him to the head of a vast insurgency. By falsely identifying him as the link between Saddam and bin Laden, U.S. officials inadvertently spurred like-minded radicals to rally to his cause. Their wave of brutal beheadings and suicide bombings persisted until American and Jordanian intelligence discovered clues that led to a lethal airstrike on Zarqawi s hideout in 2006. His movement, however, endured. First calling themselves al-Qaeda in Iraq, then Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, his followers sought refuge in unstable, ungoverned pockets on the Iraq-Syria border. When the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, and as the U.S. largely stood by, ISIS seized its chance to pursue Zarqawi s dream of an ultra-conservative Islamic caliphate.

As the priest struggles to cope secretly, he crosses paths with associates on the complex margins of a Church facing modern politics in the early twentieth century. Georges Bernanos's compelling and dark portraits of that shadowy world's inhabitants throw into stark relief the determination of a humble priest, Father Chevance, who alone knows C?nabre's secret and struggles to save him. By turn touching and scathing, The Impostor explores the delicate balance between redemption and damnation and illuminates the fragility of our constructed selves. Georges Bernanos (1888-1948), one of the twentieth century's most powerful and idiosyncratic writers, was also the most original Roman Catholic writer of his time. The Impostor, the second of his novels published in French, is the last to be translated into English.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9CdcAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Impostor+(Modern+Scandinavian+Literature+in+Translation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cake Mix Magic 2: 125 More Easy Desserts ...

Revolutions in communications and transportation are ushering us into the Age of Everything-Everywhere, where people and goods often move instantaneously from one location to another. He shows us that because \\"near equals far\\", all the equations by which national power, corporate wealth, and personal influence have been calculated must be radically redrawn. Bold New World examines our rapidly changing society on the eve of the new millennium and foresees the world in the decades to come. Knoke doesn't just describe trends; he analyzes the dynamic forces that link them, which are creating chains of cause and effect already rippling out into the next century. In brief, imaginary episodes that open each chapter, Knoke illustrates how these trends will affect the everyday lives of people around the world, from CEOs to migrant workers. After sketching these lives, he returns to his ever-practical examination of the future, offering hands-on advice on how we may prepare ourselves for what lies ahead.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9hAhKJ6QIqsC&dq=Bold+New+World+the+Essential+Road+Map+to+the+Twenty-First+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Concept Dictionary of English","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PHoYAAAAIAAJ&dq=Concept+Dictionary+of+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snake Hair (All Aboard Reading)","description":"Recounts how the Greek hero Perseus vanquishes the serpent-haired Medusa whose gaze turned people to stone.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TAsPAAAACAAJ&dq=Snake+Hair+(All+Aboard+Reading)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhubarb in the Catbird Seat","description":"For more than fifty years Red Barber was the voice of baseball.

Leading up to the trial was jury selection. A man named Jeffrey Welbaum was selected as a juror, more specifically an alternate juror. Jeffrey is a controversial juror due to the fact his mother in-law worked at Michael Jackson s Neverland Ranch and he was still selected as a juror. Jeffrey was able to keep his notebooks after the trial since he was an alternate juror. There were only several alternate jurors that had notebooks that fully documented the trial. This book is one of them which is a summary or shortened version of the trial that documents what Jeffrey found meaningful from trial testimony documented witness by witness. In 2006, Vincent Amen purchased the notebooks from Jeffrey Welbaum and later the rights to publish them as a book. There is a great value to the notebooks with positive implications. What does a juror note from Trial testimony to ultimately render a verdict? This question may have never been explored before prior to publishing these notebooks. For prosecutors and defense attorneys alike, these notebooks can be helpful in determining how to try cases. Based on all evidence shown and witness testimony, what a juror finds meaningful to note can provide a means to being more effective in organizing and trying a case.

She explains the customs of the Chinese table, the kinds of food and implements used in a Chinese kitchen- with suggestions for substitutes where that is necessary - and, most important of all, Chinese methods of preparing food. Housewives, please note that a centuries-long shortage of fuel in China has led to the development of cooking techniques which need the shortest possible time on the stove.

How do I communicate happiness, surprise, or anger? How do others communicate these emotions to me? Such questions become increasingly relevant as we become more competent in the language we are learning. Expressive Japanese is the first detailed guide to emotion words and expressive strategies for students of the language. Words connoting feelings, such as \\"kanashii\\" (sad), are important in everyday Japanese conversation, but communicating emotions effectively also requires the use of expressive strategies, such as \\"Nani?\\" (What the heck?), \\"Yattaa!\\" (I did it!), or \\"Hottoite!\\" (Leave me alone!). Introductory chapters examine the characteristics, constraints, and history of expressive Japanese and discuss linguistic variations and styles and how these play a part in conveying emotion and empathy. There follow more than seventy entries that draw on hundreds of authentic examples taken from a variety of sources, including television dramas, comics, interviews, novels, essays, newspaper articles, and web sites. In these examples, students will find playful and creative uses of expressions that do not usually appear in language textbooks. English cues and key Japanese expressions are indexed at the back of the volume, making this a handy reference for anyone who possesses a grasp of the fundamentals of elementary Japanese. Based on extensive research by a prominent linguist and teacher, Expressive Japanese brings learners into the world of real human interaction and effectively illustrates how native speakers use language to convey identity and a sense of self as well as to communicate feelings and emotion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S5cBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IT Service Vision Software: Macro Reference, Release 2.3","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EOsnAQAAIAAJ&dq=IT+Service+Vision+Software:+Macro+Reference,+Release+2.3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The bird of time;: Songs of life, death & the spring,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5AYaAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Brazilian Portuguese (Teach Yourself Tape)","description":"Bestselling language courses!

But, in 1898 the army at last came in sight of Omdurman capital of the Mahdi's successor, the Khalifa.

Readers will also learn about African history, religions, and ways of life plus how African and American foodways are related. For example, cooking techniques such as deep frying and ingredients such as peanuts, chili peppers, okra, watermelon, and even cola were introduced to the United States by sub-Sahara Africans who were brought as slaves. Africa is often presented as a monolith, but this volume treats each region in turn with representative groups and foodways presented in manageable fashion, with a truer picture able to emerge. It is noted that the boundaries of many countries are imposed, so that food culture is more fluid in a region. Commonalities are also presented in the basic format of a meal, with a starch with a sauce or stew and vegetables and perhaps some protein, typically cooked over a fire in a pot supported by three stones.

Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy return to it again and again through their lives? Why does each rereading seem more nourishing? FRODO'S WOUND is a collection of essays that approaches these questions from various angles. It argues that while epic conflict and heroic warriors may provide the initial allure to the book, what lingers and deepens with each reading is its emotional complexity, its knowledge of loss and grief, and its yearning for something only dimly understood. Uniquely, it is a study of Tolkien that barely mentions Christianity and assumes no broad knowledge of the mythological world of Middle-earth. Instead, the book offers a series of close readings that reveal Tolkien's subtlety and sensitivity, and does not shy away from probing the significance of his occasional clumsiness. FRODO'S WOUND shows why Tolkien is a great writer, and why THE LORD OF THE RINGS is really a book for older adults--indeed, for anyone who has ever lost their way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xdZ7zgEACAAJ&dq=From+the+Great+Wound&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Margot Fonteyn (Get a Life)","description":"Margot Fonteyn began life on the 18th of May, 1919 in Reigate, Surrey, as plain Peggy Hookham.

From Queen to Empress vividly evokes fashionable society in Victorian England and America through paintings of the period, contemporary illustrations and photographs, and striking costume photographs taken especially for this volume. In separate chapters devoted to royal influence, underdress, evening and day wear, mourning attire, wedding clothes, and court dress, the author, a member of the staff of The Costume Institute at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, offers a highly readable account of the ways in which fashion influenced the dress of all but the very poorest sections of the population. By 1837, the year of Victoria's accession to the throne, the simple silhouette and printed cottons of the early nineteenth century had already begun to give way to a more elaborate style of dress. Luxurious silks and an extraordinary diversity of shapes including huge domed skirts and elaborately molded corsets made possible by new dressmaking techniques marked the fashionable Victorian woman by the time Queen Victoria was declared Empress of India. From Queen to Empress accompanies an exhibition opening at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in December 1988.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7KnpAAAAMAAJ&dq=From+Queen+to+Empress:+Victorian+Dress,+1837-1877+:+An+Exhibition+at+the+Costume+Institute+December+15,+1988-April+16,+1989&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr. Fager: Thoroughbred Legends","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1DmKAQAACAAJ&dq=Dr.+Fager:+Thoroughbred+Legends&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behind the Doors of San Miguel de Allende","description":"Robert de Gast, author of the popular The Doors of San Miguel de Allende crosses the thresholds of homes in this historic Mexican town to discover their remarkable outdoor paradises--sunstruck, lushly colored courtyards, patios, and breezeways--that lay beyond them.

In the title story, told from a mother's point of view, a teenaged son has been taken over with alcoholic binges; he vomits; he loses all cognizance of himself. As we learn more of the father, we find that he, too, is an alcoholic, a chain-smoker, and not far from death. The piece ends on a note of misogyny and violent helplessness, as if to imply like father, like son. Alcoholism, violence, class and racial prejudice figure throughout these stories, which are often garish and melodramatic, like the tale of a Britisher gone completely to seed in India (\`\`Bombay Morning''). Leask makes it clear that he's brought his woes upon himself. The same self-destructive impulse grows a bit maudlin in \`\`Smoking Section,'' about a man who can't pay his bill at a sleazy diner. But in \`\`Daddy's Eyes'' and the fine \`\`Piggybank,'' Leask offers a more reflective view: in the first, an overworked, unhappily married father, whose own childhood was miserable, manages nonetheless to enter his small son's world with empathy and love; in the second, a young boy views his repulsive family's bankruptcy and abusive ways with the determination to do better. The question in many of these stories may be whether alcohol has led to unpleasant behavior, or whether these are unpleasant people who become even more unpleasant when they drink. Accomplished, but to trade upon some mythic eternal wound among men seems facile. The women here are no better. -- Copyright ?1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The ONLY difference between these editions is: an Answer Key with pages reduced to 1/4 size can be found at the back of the Teacher's edition. Like most third graders, my son found learning the multiplication tables through rote memorization a challenge. After an afternoon of tiresome drills, I knew there had to be a better way! I drew a grid for tables 1-10. Not surprisingly, Scott knew tables 1, 2, 5 and 10, the tables with easy patterns. Well, then, why not find patterns for the rest of the tables? Tables for EVEN numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8, we discovered, end in some combination of 2-4-6-8-0 and are easy to learn. Tables for ODD numbers, we found, also have distinct patterns. Patterns made Scott smile. He could see the underlying structure and knew he got it right. The traditional method of learning one math fact at a time, such as 8 x 6 = ?, is not only difficult but highly inefficient. Rote memorization is passive and mechanical. Students typically find it boring. Why not learn one pattern for the entire table? Discovering patterns is active, creative and engaging. The essence of mathematics is patterns. Learning to recognize patterns at an early age develops analytical skills. Patterns greatly benefit children with special needs, such as those with ADD/ADHD, autism and dyslexia. They can better recall and visualize the table when they see a pattern. This is true for all children. Patterns aid recall. My workbook utilizes both left and right-brain strategies to teach multiplication. There are marked differences between children who are left-hemisphere dominant and those who are right dominant. Whereas the left-hemisphere dominant child can construct the whole from the parts, the right dominant prefers the big picture, seeing patterns and making connections. Special needs children are often right-brain dominant. Learning the multiplication tables is much easier when both hemispheres are engaged. It is the responsibility of parents and teachers to ensure children learn the multiplication tables. Without them, a child will not progress beyond third grade math. Fractions, decimals, percentages and algebra will be beyond a child's reach. In California, the number one reason students do not graduate from high school is failure to pass algebra. A leading cause is: failure to master the times tables! It is a national disgrace that fifteen-year olds in the U.S. rank near the bottom of industrialized nations in math skills. We must reverse this alarming trend. The time to intervene is in the third grade. Teachers, why not a more effective approach to the multiplication tables than the \\"drill and kill\\" of rote memorization? Why not bring the \\"magic\\" of math into the classroom? If all third graders were to genuinely like math, they would be more likely to succeed in school. Parents too must do their part. Parents have a huge influence over a third grader. By high school it may be too late. Mastery of the multiplication tables is essential to your child's future. My goal in writing this workbook is not only multiplication mastery for all children but to instill in them a love of numbers and fascination with math.

Initially excited by its lively stories, he paused at the New Testament, faced with a baffling inner question: Where in the world is Christ today? An unexpected answer came during his teenage years with a spontaneous experience of the Christ being, but this only led to more questions. Later, discovering the work of Rudolf Steiner, he found the authentic vision and language he needed to clarify and better comprehend his own experiences, but the questions kept coming. The Greatest Gift Ever Given is a fruit of Ridenour s life-long search for answers: a book that is at once deeply thoughtful, humorous, philosophical and poetic. In Part I,  Raising the Foundation , he studies the Judeo-Christian mysteries. After humanity s  fall  into materialism, these mysteries signal the development of human individuality. The impulse for self-hood continues with Christ, who brings a new path of divine love. But the mystery of Christ leads naturally to his shadow. Today, we can no longer escape the question: Where in the world is Judas? Without Judas s betrayal, Christ s greatest gift could never have been given. We can t reject Judas, but should transform him within ourselves. In Part II,  Lowering the Temple , Ridenour relates the theme of metamorphosis to the contemporary world. Once guided by initiates, personal transformation now needs to blossom from within each individual human soul. The topic of evolution takes us to a consideration of the perennially-controversial Charles Darwin, as well as the intuitive approach of Goethe and the living thinking of Rudolf Steiner. A rich treasure-trove of ideas, The Greatest Gift Ever Given sharpens a dynamic focus on current spiritual needs and contributes a thought-provoking response to them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-H06DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+greatest+gift+guide+ever&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ramayana","description":"The grand Indian epic is translated into lively, vivid English prose in an attempt to bring the great story to life for modern American readers.

Robert Monroe, a Virginia businessman, began to have experiences that drastically altered his life. Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a \\"second body\\" to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbound by time or death. Praise for Journeys Out of the Body \\"Monroe's account of his travels, Journeys Out of the Body, jam-packed with parasitic goblins and dead humans, astral sex, scary trips into mind-boggling other dimensions, and practical tips on how to get out of your body, all told with wry humor, quickly became a cult sensation with its publication in 1971, and has been through many printings. Whatever their 'real' explanation, Monroe's trips made for splendid reading.\\"  Michael Hutchinson, author of Megabrain \\"Robert Monroe's experiences are probably the most intriguing of any person's of our time, with the possible exception of Carlos Castaneda's.\\"  Joseph Chilton Pierce, author of Magical Child \\"This book is by a person who's clearly a sensible man and who's trying to tell it like it is.

But did you know that in His own time, the Jews expected the Messiah to be a military leader who would liberate them from Rome?

You ll be enthralled by Jesus  teachings, appreciate the significance of His power to perform miracles, and dig deeper into the meaning of some of His best-known parables. You ll see the connections between Jesus and the prophecies of the Old Testament. You ll walk alongside His first disciples and become entangled in the plot that led to His arrest, trial, and death. But most of all, you ll see that although Jesus was obedient to His father in heaven, he bucked convention in his life on Earth from the Romans and the Sanhedrin to everyday Jews and sometimes even His close friends, Jesus was perceived as a rebel who broke new ground in faith and action. Whether you are new to your faith journey or revisiting a well-loved road, this compelling guide to Jesus  life and times is the extra insight you need to spark your soul.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NtINEAAAQBAJ&dq=Rebels%27+Seed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The End of American Innocence: The First Years of Our own Time 1912-1917","description":"An historical account of the political and intellectual atmosphere of the USA in the early 20th century, which contends that the old order was being challenged and altered long before World War I.

Gen. George S. Patton's troops covered more ground and took more enemy prisoners than any other Allied army in northwest Europe. Brig. Gen. Otto P. Weyland's XIX Tactical Air Command (TAC) provided air support every step of the way. Their combined success is something of an anomaly; air-ground relationships are notoriously confrontational and plagued with inter-service competition. How did Patton and Weyland work together to achieve such astounding success? Drawing on exclusive access to official records, David N. Spires finds that this success was due to four key developments: the maturation of tactical aviation doctrine, effective organizational procedures, a technical revolution in equipment, and, above all, the presence of pragmatic men of goodwill who made the system work. He focuses on the highly effective personal relationship between Patton and Weyland -- men who respected, trusted, and fully relied on each other and their respective subordinates. This collaboration extended all the way down the chain of command: Patton's ground troops and Weyland's airmen trained together in England, and so by the time they entered combat, they operated together as a single unit. Contrary to conventional wisdom, air-ground relationships in the field can be cooperative rather than confrontational. Today's air and ground officers can continue to benefit from the amazing success of the Third Army and the XIX TAC.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ja9qBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mantras for Daily Living: \\"A Pocket Book of Affirmations in Rhyme to Claim All the Good You Desire in Your Life\\"","description":"Affirmations have long been considered an effective way to change our subconscious patterns and the aim of this book is to provide easy to remember affirmations in rhyme Mantras which, through their ease of repetition, will resonate with you and help you create the subconscious pattern you want.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPa3AAAACAAJ&dq=Mantras+for+Daily+Living:+%22A+Pocket+Book+of+Affirmations+in+Rhyme+to+Claim+All+the+Good+You+Desire+in+Your+Life%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bread & Spirit: Therapy with the New Poor: Diversity of Race, Culture, and Values (A Norton Professional Book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Count of Saint Germain","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FGH5CRoW1vQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Global Covenant: The Social Democratic Alternative to the Washington Consensus","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kn6BAQAACAAJ&dq=Global+Covenant:+The+Social+Democratic+Alternative+to+the+Washington+Consensus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Doctor","description":"A timeless collection of advice, operating-room wisdom, and reflections on the practice of medicine, from the  best of the writing surgeons  (Chicago Tribune).

A number of these pieces take the form of letters offering counsel to aspiring physicians. Featuring wry and witty observations on matters of life and death, medical ethics, and the awesome responsibilities of being a surgeon, Letters to a Young Doctor should be required reading for all medical students and anyone interested in the endless miracle that is the human body. \\"No one writes about the practice of medicine with Selzer's unique combination of mystery and wonder,  observed the Los Angeles Times, while The New York Times praised Selzer s  marvelous insight and potent imagery  for making  his tales of surgery and medicine both works of art and splendid tools of instruction.

An honest sturdy young officer and a decent pretty girl get to know each other on an excursion. Unconsciously they drift into a relation where heart meets heart, the breaking of which causes the deepest pain. But both see clearly from the beginning that there is no other end. For they know that the world is stronger than the individual, and the many small moments than the one supreme. They know it, for they are, like their creator, resigned realists. They shut their eyes only in order not to see the end too near. (Richard M. Meyer)---The interest of Fontane's novels lies rather in character than in action. While he portrays many types characteristic of Berlin and the surrounding region, and is very successful in rendering local color and the atmosphere of the particular circle described in each book, his penetration into universal human nature is sufficiently deep to raise him far above provincialism. His effort is to represent people vividly and naturally in their normal relations, not to strain after sensational or even dramatic situations. \\"Trials and Tribulations\\" (\\"Irrungen Wirrungen\\", 1887) gives an excellent idea of his power. In a gently moving story, told without the forcing of emotion or the contriving of exciting scenes, he deals with the pathos of the relation between a man and a woman, alike in an attractive simplicity of character, but forced apart by difference of rank. The situation is laid before us without expressed censure or protest, and is allowed to have its effect by the sober truth of its presentation. Fontane's is an honest and sincere art, none the less great because unpretentious.

Nine years later, Freud completely reversed his position, insisting that these sexual memories were actually fantasies that never happened. Why did Freud retract the seduction theory? And why has the psychoanalytic community gone to such lengths to conceal that retraction? In this landmark book, drawing on his unique access to formerly sealed and hidden papers, Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson dares to uncover the truth about this critical turning point in Freud's career and its enduring impact on the theory and practice of psychoanalysis. The Assault on Truth reveals a reality that neither Freud nor his followers could bear to face. Bracing in its honesty, gripping in its revelations, this is the book that prompted Masson's break with the psychoanalytic community-and launched his subsequent brilliant career as an independent thinker and writer.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jDkkSLkjdJ8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patterns for Papers (Victoria and Albert Colour Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LSlnygAACAAJ&dq=Patterns+for+Papers+(Victoria+and+Albert+Colour+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A treatise on algebra","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mcVc5v8_kyoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Osteopathic Technique","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BLrzBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baja California Plant Field Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6nIVAQAAIAAJ&dq=Baja+California+Plant+Field+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It's Like This, Cat","description":"\\"Superb. The best junior novel I've ever read about big-city life.\\"   The New York Times. After another fight with Pop, 14-year-old Dave storms out of their apartment and nearly gets hit by a car. Kate, the local cat lady, comes to the rescue, and Dave returns home with an ally: Cat, the stray tom that becomes Dave's confidante and his key to new friendships and experiences. Cat inadvertently leads Dave to Tom, a troubled 19-year-old who needs help, and Mary, a shy girl who opens Dave's eyes and ears to music and theater. Even the Cat-related confrontations with Pop take on a new spirit, with less shouting and more understanding. It's Like This, Cat offers a vivid tour of New York City in the 1960s. From the genteel environs of Gramercy Park to a bohemian corner of Coney Island, the atmospheric journey is punctuated by stickball games, pastrami sandwiches, and a ride on the Staten Island Ferry.

Microsoft Excel is more than just a spreadsheet; it is an essential tool for businesses. In fact, it would be fair to say that it is probably one of the most important tools that a business could have at its disposal. Some of the best uses for Excel include extracting data into charts, using it to identify problems and trends, bringing all the data together from multiple files and other sources so it's all in one easy-to-use place and much more. The basis of Excel lies in formulas and functions, used for storing data and retrieving it, for doing calculations, and for analyzing data, all in one simple grid format. It is these formulas and functions that provide the biggest headaches for inexperienced users and that is what my guide is all about - how to use them and a look at some of the most commonly used ones. Given that there are more than 400 functions alone and not much less in the way of formulas, I couldn't possibly go over every single one of them. You don't need to know them all though; Excel has a built-in Function Wizard that helps you to get the best function for what you are doing and built-in Formula Intellisense helps with formulas.

The post colonial era in the region signaled a reconceptualization of geographical space as Southeast Asian countries established themselves territorially and harnessed their energies to work collectively in the new global equation. This led to formation of organizations, such as ASEAN, AFTA and the economic growth triangles, which represent a clear Southeast Asian voice internationally.

The answer is important not only to philosophers of mind, for significant moral and legal consequences rest on the distinction between voluntary and involuntary behavior. However, \\"action theory\\" the branch of philosophy that has traditionally articulated the boundaries between action and non-action, and between voluntary and involuntary behavior has been unable to account for the difference. Alicia Juarrero argues that a mistaken, 350-year-old model of cause and explanation one that takes all causes to be of the push-pull, efficient cause sort, and all explanation to be prooflike underlies contemporary theories of action. Juarrero then proposes a new framework for conceptualizing causes based on complex adaptive systems.

Through a mix of science, autobiography, case studies, and speculation, Jonathan Cole shows the importance not only of facial expressions for communication among individuals but also of facial embodiment for our sense of self. He presents, in his words, \\"a natural history of the face and an unnatural history of those who live without it.\\" The heart of the book lies in the experiences of people with facial losses of various kinds. The case studies are of blind, autistic, and neurologically impaired persons; the most extreme case involves Mobius syndrome, in which individuals are born with a total inability to move their facial muscles and hence to make facial expressions. Cole suggests that it is only by studying such personal narratives of loss that we can understand facial function and something of what all our faces reflect.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TtikGdCOjGEC&dq=Face&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS, VOL. 10: COMPANION","description":"Originally published: London: Bell & Hyman Limited, 1983.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J-JSalViBrMC&dq=THE+DIARY+OF+SAMUEL+PEPYS,+VOL.+10:+COMPANION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Design Your Own Games and Activities: Thiagi's Templates for Performance Improvement","description":"Smart trainers know that games and activities can involve adults in learning like no other instructional method and no one knows more about games than Sivasailam \\"Thiagi\\" Thiagarajan.

Students are taught spells that are petty and ill-wishing, and when Mary discovers evidence of a terrible and cruel experiment in transformation, she decides to leave. But the moment her broomstick takes off, she realises that Tib the cat has been captured ...

In cities, small towns, and suburbs all over the country Americans are returning to a class system that seemed doomed a generation ago. They are following all the traditions developed by the Old Guard of an earlier era. But there is a difference. The top rung of the social ladder is now the goal of the many rather than the few. Social position can be earned, whereas, formerly, it could be achieved only by birth. That is why the old-line families are claiming that \\"Society is dead.\\" And they may be right when they think of society as their grandmothers knew it. But a new society is springing up that bears the closest resemblance to the old. It is bigger; many newcomers have reached the heights. But they have not killed society, even in its original sense. The prestige of the old inner circle has never been higher. Acceptance by this Old Guard is the criterion by which newcomers gauge their success. Almost all the recent arrivals in the world of high society are rich. But they are not satisfied with wealth in itself. In the prosperity that followed World War II many Americans began to earn large incomes. The result is that the possession of money no longer guarantees prestige. And so a position in society has become a status goal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PJUfzgEACAAJ&dq=The+private+world+of+high+society&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Data Mining: Opportunities and Challenges","description":"Data Mining: Opportunities and Challenges presents an overview of the state of the art approaches in this new and multidisciplinary field of data mining.

Its command structure is ineffective. Its soldiers are demoralized. Its equipment is outmoded and inadequate for many of the tasks to which it is assigned. The causes of the problem can be traced to a number of sources, including political indecision, peacetime neglect, and budgetary cutbacks. But, perhaps most crucially, the ability of the army to carry out its essential function, which is to maintain the capacity to fight wars, has been undermined by the process of bureaucratization initiated by passage of the Unification Act of 1968 and reinforced by later structural changes. This process has transformed and disfigured the military command structure at every level, from the Chief of Defence Staff to the so-called Hellyer corporal, with disastrous results. The dreadful torture and murder of a teenager in Somalia was significant precisely because it showed how badly morale and discipline have deteriorated in Canada's army. In \\"Significant Incident,\\" David Bercuson gives readers a rare inside look at the state of our armed forces. He draws on historical sources, leaked documents, material submitted to the Commission of Inquiry into the Somalia Affair, and on scores of exclusive interviews. He uses this material to describe today's army, both on duty in Bosnia, for example, and on the home front. It is against this multifaceted background that the deterioration of a proud regiment, the Canadian Airborne, and its ill-fated mission to Somalia begins to make sense. \\"Significant Incident\\" will be welcomed by soldiers, but will send shockwaves through the media, the military high command, and political circles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eEGsAAAACAAJ&dq=Significant+Incident:+Canada%27s+Army,+the+Airborne,+and+the+Murder+in+Somalia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bully in Sight: How to Predict, Resist, Challenge and Combat Workplace Bullying","description":"Bully In Sight is a comprehensive guide on how to predict, resist, challenge and combat bullying in the workplace.

After the publication of his first novel in 1962, Rudy Wiebe was the only identifiable Mennonite literary writer in the country. Beginning in the 1970s, the numbers grew rapidly and now include writers Patrick Friesen, Sandra Birdsell, Di Brandt, Sarah Klassen, Armin Wiebe, David Bergen, Miriam Toews, Carrie Snyder, Casey Plett, and many more. A similar renaissance is evident in the visual arts (including artists Gathie Falk, Wanda Koop, and Aganetha Dyck) and in music (including composers Randolph Peters, Carol Ann Weaver, and Stephanie Martin). Confronted with an embarrassment of riches that resist survey, Magdalene Redekop opts for the use of case studies to raise questions about Mennonites and art. Part criticism, part memoir, Making Believe argues that there is no such thing as Mennonite art. At the same time, her close engagement with individual works of art paradoxically leads Redekop to identify a Mennonite sensibility at play in the space where artists from many cultures interact. Constant questioning and commitment to community are part of the Mennonite dissenting tradition. Although these values come up against the legacy of radical Anabaptist hostility to art, Redekop argues that the Early Modern roots of a contemporary crisis of representation are shared by all artists. Making Believe posits a Spielraum or play space in which all artists are dissembling tricksters, but differences in how we play are inflected by where we come from. The close readings in this book insist on respect for difference at the same time as they invite readers to find common ground while making believe across cultures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5uXaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marty Robbins","description":"During his three decades as a country music performer, Marty Robbins (1925-1982) placed 94 songs on Billboard's country music charts, with sixteen number-one hits. In addition to two Grammy awards, he was also honored with the Man of the Decade Award from the Academy of Country Music in 1970. His Hawaiian songs, rockabilly hits, teen-angst ballads, pop standards, and country & western classics showcased his exceptional versatility. Yet even with fame and fortune, Robbins always yearned for more. Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins is the first biography of this legendary country music artist and NASCAR driver. Drawing from personal interviews and in-depth research, biographer Diane Diekman explains how Robbins saw himself as a drifter, a man always searching for self-fulfillment and inner peace. Born Martin David Robinson to a hardworking mother and an abusive alcoholic father, he never fully escaped the insecurities burned into him by a poverty-stricken nomadic childhood in the Arizona desert. As Diekman describes, he spent his early teens in trouble with the law and worked an assortment of short-term jobs after serving in combat in World War II. In 1947 he got his first gig as a singer and guitar player. Too nervous to talk, the shy young man walked onstage singing. Soon he changed his name to Marty Robbins, cultivated his magnetic stage presence, and established himself as an entertainer, songwriter, and successful NASCAR driver. As NASCAR's Bobby Allison said, \\"He started out being a singer driving a race car, but he became a race car driver who could sing.\\" For fans of Robbins, NASCAR, and classic country music, Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins is a revealing portrait of this well-loved, restless entertainer, a private man who kept those who loved him at a distance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flight 93","description":"United Airlines Flight 93, which took off from Newark Airport the morning of September 11th, 2001, is perhaps the most famous flight in modern American history: We know of the passenger uprising, but there s so much more to the story besides its harrowing and oft-told climax. Amazingly, the definitive account of this seminal event has yet to be written. The book offers the most complete account of what actually took place aboard Flight 93  from its delayed takeoff in Newark to the moment it plunged upside-down at 563 miles per hour into an open field in rural Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Flight 93 provides a riveting and complete narrative of the lead-up, event, and aftermath of the flight, based on interviews, oral histories, personal tours of the crash site and evidence recently made public. It examines the lead-up to that horrific morning; the stories of the victims who were launched into the center of history; the revolt that saved untold amounts of carnage on the ground and likely, the US Capitol; the eyewitnesses and first responders who rushed to the crash scene; the impact on family members; the effort to uncover evidence at the site; and the legacy the story leaves for future generations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MXiFBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Growing Up in North Dakota : A Memoir","description":"Growing Up in North Dakota is a vivid story of the \\"pioneer\\" period of the state's history.

First published in Russian in 1974, it was immediately hailed by Soviet critics as a superb-if atypical-example of war literature and a moving depiction of the degradation and ultimate damnation of a frontline deserter-although it did provoke controversy for its sympathetic portrayal of the deserter's wife. But the novel has also attracted the attention of both Western and Soviet critics for it masterly psychological portrait of two characters caught in a hopeless situation. The novel tells the story of a Siberian peasant who makes a tragic miscalculation by deserting in the last year of the war, and the loyal wife who embraces his fate as her own. Rasputin examines the doomed relationship of these characters, sharply evoking the ties that bind individuals to their land, their community, their family. More than commentary on the nature of Soviet power or on the conduct of the war, Live and Remember is simultaneously a timeless tale with universal appeal and a very Russian story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5EUXRw2ZMIwC&dq=Live+and+Remember&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Transformations of Gwen Volume 2","description":"In this volume Gwen brings to her knees a muscular young \\"bad boy\\", enticing him with an array of rubber.

N. Granovsky, V. P. Botkin, P. V. Annenkov, A. V. Druzhinin, and K. D. Kavelin (Cambridge Studies in Russian Literature)","description":"This book studies the work of five Russian liberal thinkers who were active in the period 1840-60 against the general background of Russian history, literature and thought in that period. All five thinkers (to each of whom a separate chapter is devoted) played an important part in the flowering of Russian letters in the 1840s, and were involved in the attempt of the intelligentsia, the conscience of the nation, to bring more humane and enlightened values to their backward and semi-feudal country. By the 1850s, when a more radical wing began to emerge in the intelligentsia, the moderation of these liberals became more apparent. While the radicals were prepared to countenance revolutionary upheaval, the liberals counselled patience, toleration, and gradualism. In his conclusion Dr Offord explores the possible reasons for the failure of the liberal tendency, represented by these thinkers, to establish itself properly in Russia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aiNvPwAACAAJ&dq=Portraits+of+Early+Russian+Liberals:+A+Study+of+the+Thought+of+T.+N.+Granovsky,+V.+P.+Botkin,+P.+V.+Annenkov,+A.+V.+Druzhinin,+and+K.+D.+Kavelin+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Russian+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home of the Brave","description":"Kek comes from Africa.

Young courtier Fulke FitzWarin would not be an obvious companion for Prince John, but the boy from the Welsh Marches is there as a reward for his family's loyalty to the crown. The FitzWarins are as proud as they are true, and when Fulke is accused by John of cheating during a game of chess, he cannot help but respond. Thus begins a bitter rivalry that will resonate throughout their lives. The FitzWarins dream of reclaiming their family estate and title, Lords of the White Castle. After this quarrel with Fulke, however, John's vindictiveness leads to Fulke renouncing his allegiance and becoming a rebel outlaw. In romance, too, Fulke is no closer to fulfilling his heart's desire. A youthful dalliance means nothing compared to his love for the spirited Maude le Vavasour, but marriage in medieval England is more about alliance than about love, and Fulke can only watch helplessly as Maude's father arranges a more suitable match. After all, what can Fulke offer Maude apart from a lifetime on the run.... With all the intrigue and pageantry that bring the twelfth century vividly to life, this award-winning novelist spins us an irresistible tale of a deadly rivalry and an impossible love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OXks4s6_NukC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pathfinder - The Works of J.

He revealed this in several writings throughout his career, culminating in The Moment, his attack against the established ecclesiastical order. Kierkegaard was moved to criticize the church by his differences with Bishop Mynster, Primate of the Church of Denmark. Although Mynster saw in Kierkegaard a complement to himself and his outlook, Kierkegaard challenged Mynster to acknowledge the emptying and estheticizing of Christianity that had occurred in modern Christendom. For three years Kierkegaard was silent, waiting. When Mynster died, he was memorialized as \\"an authentic truth-witness\\" in the \\"holy chain of truth-witnesses that stretches through the ages from the days of the apostles.\\" This struck Kierkegaard as blasphemous and inspired him to write a series of articles in F?drelandet, which he followed with ten numbers of the pamphlet The Moment. This volume includes the articles from F?drelandet, all numbers of The Moment, and several other late pieces of Kierkegaard's writing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JWaYDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Moment+and+Late+Writings:+Kierkegaard%27s+Writings,+Vol.+23&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Integrative Document and Content Management: Strategies for Exploiting Enterprise Knowledge","description":"Portals present unique strategic challenges in the academic environment.

But on September 8, 1944, in the London suburb of Chiswick, a thunderous double-boom was heard followed by a huge plume of black smoke rising high into the air. Several minutes later another explosion rocked the earth near Epping. There had been no warnings, no drone of aircraft above, just sudden devastation. \\"Operation Penguin,\\" the V-2 offensive, had begun. The A-4 rocket, better known as the V-2, Vergeltungswaffen Zwei, or \\"Vengeance Weapon 2,\\" was the first ballistic missile to be used in combat. Soaring over 50 miles high at supersonic speeds, the V-2 would strike its target within 5 minutes of launching. Once in the air its deadly warhead was unstoppable. The ancestor of all Cold War and modern day ballistic missiles, as well as the rockets used for space exploration, the V-2 could not win the war for Germany--it was too expensive, too complicated, too inaccurate, and its warhead was too small--but its unprecedented invulnerability and influence on Allied planning made the V-2 and the advancements it represented the ultimate war prize, and British, American, and Soviet forces scrambled to seize German rocket technology along with its scientists and engineers. In V-2: A Combat History of the First Ballistic Missile, T. D.

This thesis presents an analysis of the image of childhood in the works of Matute written for adults, observed in two distinct literary contexts: that of the realistic novels and of the fantastic works. This division also corresponds, though not mathematically, to the two creative periods of the writer, so that the continuity and evolution of both the theme and the aesthetic techniques throughout the author's entire literary career can be observed. The analysis which concerns the realistic works of Matute contains three chapters: firstly, approaches to the child antihero, which includes subtopics such as the Cain theme, the infantile cruelty, and the death in the childhood; secondly, an analysis of the aesthetic techniques that contribute to the subjective descriptions of the identity of child; thirdly, an observation of the relationship between the Matutian Child and the external world. In the part entitled \\"Childhood in the fantastic works of Ana Maria Matute\\", we have used as corpus fantastic works of the second period of Ana Mar a Matute and showed how the world of children is adapted to a new fantastic and medieval environment. The analysis also includes three sections: a discussion of the continuation/renewal of the topic mentioned above; the analysis of some secondary fantastic characters related to the theme of childhood; finally, a systematic study of the symbolic objects in the works of Ana Mar a Matute.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nybm4pQcVdAC&dq=Aranmanoth+(Espasa+narrativa)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lily's Ghost","description":"A sinister old house, an intriguing new friend, a 50-year-old mystery, and a tag-team of disgruntled ghosts force 13-year-old Lily to unearth her family's deepest secrets in this multilayered tale that's both hilarious and harrowing, comic and creepy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CdR3PwAACAAJ&dq=Lily%27s+Ghost&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Classical Scholarship from 1300 to 1850","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h2iuzgEACAAJ&dq=History+of+Classical+Scholarship+from+1300+to+1850&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Eastern Panther: Mystery Cat of the Appalachians","description":"As a wildlife biologist and author, Gerry Parker draws on his experiences and knowledge to explore the origins and existence of the mysterious cat, the Eastern Panther.

The defining feature of the Pacific Theatre of World War II was the clash of carriers that ultimately decided the fate of nations. The names of these battles have become legendary as some of the most epic encounters in the history of naval warfare. Pre-war assumptions about the impact and effectiveness of carriers were comprehensively tested in early war battles such as Coral Sea, while US victories at Midway and in the waters around Guadalcanal established the supremacy of its carriers. The US Navy's ability to adapt and evolve to the changing conditions of war maintained and furthered their advantage, culminating in their comprehensive victory at the battle of the Philippine Sea, history's largest carrier battle, which destroyed almost the entire Japanese carrier force. Examining the ships, aircraft and doctrines of both the Japanese and US navies and how they changed during the war, Mark E. Stille shows how the domination of American carriers paved the way towards the Allied victory in the Pacific.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MKs5EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Eating Game: The simple truth to health and fat loss in the modern world","description":"New York Times Bestseller Stop and even reverse! age-related weight gain and muscle loss with the first-ever weight-loss plan specifically designed to shrink your belly, extend your life, and create your healthiest self at mid-life and beyond.

Burgoyne's defeat at Saratoga went shock waves through the British command, but the efforts along the frontier appeared to be impairing the American ability to conduct the war. Following massacres at the colonial settlements of Wyoming, Pa., and Cherry Valley, N.Y., the Continental Congress persuaded General Washington to conduct a decisive offensive to end the threat. Brewing for years, the conflict between the Iroquois and colonists would now reach its deadly climax.

The author traces Gandhi's role within and outside the Congress and describes how the Mahatma was politically sidelined from the very start of the negotiations for the transfer of power. The result was that when the Congress agreed to the partition of Bengal and Punjab in March 1947, it did not even consult the Mahatma; he was \\"in the picture\\", but out of accord with Congress policy. Sensing that his political views counted for less and less, Gandhi accepted the reality of partition, though he could never personally reconcile to it, and turned his attention to dousing the raging communal fires.

At the 2002 Olympic winter games in Salt Lake City, gold medallist pairs skating couple Jamie Sal  and David Pelletier inspired the imaginations and captured the hearts of millions of viewers from around the world and found themselves at the heart of International Olympic controversy. When Jamie Sale and David Pelletier finished second to Elena Berezhnaia and Anton Sikharulidze, after skating what was considered an incontestable perfect performance, there was an uproar of disapproval from Canada and several other nations. French judge Le Gougne later admitted that she had been pressured to place the Russians first. After an intense investigation, the International Olympic Committee, awarded a second gold medal to Sal  and Pelletier acknowledging the injustice that had been committed. Gold on Ice details the investigations and political games that were uncovered at the 2002 Olympics and tells the story of the two skaters who did all the right things, dreamed all the right dreams and in the end made all the difference for future skaters. Beverley Smith chronicles the early lives and events of this dynamic pair - the disappointments and the triumphs - and the events leading up to and following the skate that would define their careers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KekFAAAACAAJ&dq=Gold+on+Ice:+The+Sale+and+Pelletier+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prayer for a child","description":"Ideal for sharing, this Caldecott Medalwinning beloved classic presents an illustrated prayer full of the intimate gentleness for familiar things, the love of friends and family, and the kindly protection of God.

Bernard Brauchli's comprehensive history fills a major gap in the literature on this instrument. Beginning with the earliest-known references, he traces the clavichord's evolution up to the mid-nineteenth century, ending with a study of performance technique. The clavichord's structural developments (traced largely through an analysis of extant instruments), literary documentation (much of it presented here for the first time in English), treatises and iconographical sources are presented in chronological order. What emerges from this study of the various sources is an overview of the essential role this instrument played both socially and musically for more than four centuries, restoring the clavichord to the position it justly deserves in history.

When Anita Naakka jumps in front of an oncoming train, her daughter, Norma, is left alone with the secret they have spent their lives hiding: Norma has supernatural hair, sensitive to the slightest changes in her mood--and the moods of those around her--moving of its own accord, corkscrewing when danger is near. And so it is her hair that alerts her, while she talks with a strange man at her mother's funeral, that her mother may not have taken her own life. Setting out to reconstruct Anita's final months--sifting through puzzling cell phone records, bank statements, video files--Norma begins to realize that her mother knew more about her hair's powers than she let on: a sinister truth beyond Norma's imagining. As Sofi Oksanen leads us ever more deeply into Norma's world, weaving together past and present, she gives us a dark family drama that is a searing portrait of both the exploitation of women's bodies and the extremes to which people will go for the sake of beauty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iZqyDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vedi","description":"Book 3 in Ved Mehta's Continents of Exile series.

The most important business and parenting book of the year.   Forbes  Urgent and important. . . an essential read for bosses, parents, coaches, and anyone who cares about improving performance.   Daniel H. Pink Shortlisted for the Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you ll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world s top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule. David Epstein examined the world s most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields especially those that are complex and unpredictable generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They re also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can t see. Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, Range makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6nsmEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Range&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knowledge Management and Virtual Organizations","description":"Annotation Twenty essays present current research on knowledge management as related to effective design of new organization forms.

More attuned to images than to words.How does the church adapt to such a culture? Or should it, in fact, eschew adapting for maintaining a course it has followed these last two millennia? Or something in between?These are exactly the questions asked in The Church In Emerging Culture by five Christian thinker-speaker-writers, each who advocate unique stances regarding what the church s message should be (and what methods should be used to present it) as it journeys through this evolving, postmodern era. The authors are:Andy CrouchRe:Generation Quarterly editor-in-chiefMichael Hortonprofessor and reformed theologianFrederica Mathewes-Greenauthor, commentator, and Orthodox ChristianBrian D. McLarenpostmodernist, author, pastor, and Emergent senior fellowErwin Raphael McManusauthor and pastor of the innovative and interethnic L.A.-based church, MosaicMost unique about their individual positions is that they re presented not as singular essays but as lively discussions in which the other four authors freely (and frequently) comment, critique, and concur. That element, coupled with a unique photographic design that reinforces the depth of their at-once congenial and feisty conversation, gives you all-access entr e into this groundbreaking discourse.What s more, general editor Leonard Sweet (author of SoulTsunami and AquaChurch, among several other acclaimed texts) frames the thought-provoking dialogue with a profoundly insightful, erudite introductory essaypractically a book within a book.

It is the moving tale of Waguli (Whippoorwill\\") and Oconeechee, a young Cherokee man and woman separated by the Trail of Tears. Just as they are about to be married, Waguli is captured be federal soldiers and, along with thousands of other Cherokees, taken west, on foot and then by steamboat, to what is now eastern Oklahoma. Though many die along the way, Waguli survives, drowning his shame and sorrow in alcohol. Oconeechee, among the few Cherokees who remain behind, hidden in the mountains, embarks on a courageous search for Waguli. Robert J. Conley makes use of song, legend, and historical documents to weave the rich texture of the story, which is told through several, sometimes contradictory, voices. The traditional narrative of the Trail of Tears is told to a young contemporary Cherokee boy by his grandfather, presented in bits and pieces as they go about their everyday chores in rural North Carolina. The telling is neiter bitter nor hostile; it is sympathetic by unsentimental. An ironic third point of view, detached and often adversarial, is provided by the historical documents interspersed through the novel, from the text of the removal treaty to Ralph Waldo Emerson's letter to the president of the United States in protest of the removal. In this layering of contradictory elements, Conley implies questions about the relationships between history and legend, storytelling and myth-making. Inspired by the lyrics of Don Grooms's song \\"Whippoorwill,\\" which open many chapters in the text, Conley has written a novel both meticulously accurate and deeply moving.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=60rTBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tug (Wesleyan Poetry Series)","description":"An inmate on Florida's death row writes piercingly of incarceration, racism and growing up.

In 1690, a resident Spanish official looked back over the eventful, sometimes tumultuous history of Nuevo Leon and penned a richly detailed account of the years 1630 to 1690. Although Juan Bautista Chapa's Historia de Nuevo Leon was not published until 1909, it has since been acclaimed as the key contemporary document for any historical study of Spanish colonial Texas. This book offers the only accurate and annonated English translation of Chapa's Historia. Drawing on the Discourses of Governor Alonso de Leon (the elder), which cover the years 1580 to 1649, and on his own experiences as permanent secretary to the governors of Nuevo Leon, Chapa traces the history and colonization of Texas and Northeastern Mexico from the 1630s onward. He presents the only account of the Spanish expeditions in the 1660s against the Cacaxtle Indians, who had raided south of the Rio Grande for horses and slaves, and the only diary account of Alonso (the younger) de Leon's 1686 expedition to the Gulf of Mexico in search of La Salle's French settlement. Chapa was also an authority on the local Indians, and his Historia lists the names and locations of over 300 Indian tribes. This information, together with descriptions of the vegetation, wildlife, and climate in seventeenth-century Texas, will be of interest to ethnographers, anthropologists, biogeographers, and other scholars.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4TrsDAAAQBAJ&dq=Texas+and+Northeastern+Mexico,1630-1690&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Urban Politics Reader","description":"The Urban Politics Reader draws together classic and contemporary writings that best illuminate the basic questions of urban politics  how interests contend for power over the distribution of resources and why some win while others lose. Contributions from Martin Shefter, Clarence Stone, Rufus P. Browning and Saskia Sassen are included among the thirty-two generous selections. The Reader juxtaposes the main theoretical approaches to urban power with vivid accounts of actual political experiences on such key themes as the urban crisis, the politics of race, ethnicity and gender, national urban policy, suburbanization and globalization. Strom and Mollenkopf illustrate how thinking about cities is central to our understanding of democracy and citizenship, and how although the parties to urban politics may change over time, the struggle of new groups to gain access and representation is a constant theme. The Editors' introductions suggest topics and questions for class discussion, demonstrate the significance of urban politics, and suggest directions for further reading and thinking, while the associated bibliography enables deeper investigations. By drawing together important but widely dispersed writings, The Urban Politics Reader provides an essential resource for students of urban politics.

There is no denying Ms. Beverley is a master storyteller and perhaps because of this political incorrectness she delivers a powerfully fresh stage for her story.\\" ~Tara A. Green Ruined through her vile brother's schemes, Eleanor Chivenham is offered rescue by marriage to a rake with an infamous French mistress. Eleanor accepts, determined to treat the arranged marriage with cool dignity. Then she meets Nicholas Delaney. Not only does he stir her senses, but the trouble and pain beneath his smooth exterior reaches her heart. Nicholas is indeed troubled. While serving his country by seducing secrets out of a French spy, he is persuaded to marry Eleanor to protect his family's honor. But such chivalry runs counter to his carefully wrought rogue image, and extends the life-threatening plots shadowing him to Eleanor. To assist, Nicholas re-assembles the Company of Rogues, a schoolboy group he started years before. But not even they can dampen Eleanor's fighting wit that is quickly unmasking their enemy and testing Nicholas' formidable will.

Karen Shimakawa argues that the forms of Asian Americanness that appear in U.S. culture are a function of national abjection a process that demands that Americanness be defined by the exclusion of Asian Americans, who are either cast as symbolic foreigners incapable of integration or Americanization or distorted into an  honorary  whiteness. She examines how Asian Americans become culturally visible on and off stage, revealing the ways Asian American theater companies and artists respond to the cultural implications of this abjection. Shimakawa looks at the origins of Asian American theater, particularly through the memories of some of its pioneers. Her examination of the emergence of Asian American theater companies illuminates their strategies for countering the stereotypes of Asian Americans and the lack of visibility of Asian American performers within the theater world. She shows how some plays Wakako Yamauchi s 12-1-A, Frank Chin s Chickencoop Chinaman, and The Year of the Dragon have both directly and indirectly addressed the displacement of Asian Americans. She analyzes works attempting to negate the process of abjection such as the 1988 Broadway production of M. Butterfly as well as Miss Saigon, a mainstream production that enacted the process of cultural displacement both onstage and off. Finally, Shimakawa considers Asian Americanness in the context of globalization by meditating on the work of Ping Chong, particularly his East-West Quartet.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HIUVKbD0GrAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In tune with the Infinite;: Or, Fullness of peace, power and plenty, (The life books)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OowWAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Life in Baseball","description":"\\"Highly successful in knitting together this story of the life of a most remarkable and dedicated player--perhaps the most spirited baseball player ever to have graced the diamond.\\"--Library Journal. \\"I find little comfort in the popular picture of Cobb as a spike-slashing demon of the diamond with a wide streak of cruelty in his nature.

A native of Massachusetts, Pike settled in Arkansas Territory in 1832 after wandering the Great Plains of Texas and New Mexico for two years. In Arkansas he became a schoolteacher, newspaperman, lawyer, Whig leader, poet, Freemason, and Confederate general who championed secession and fought against Black suffrage. During his tenure as Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite--a position he held for more than thirty years beginning in 1859--Pike popularized the Masonic movement in the American South and Far West. In the wake of the Civil War, Pike left Arkansas, ultimately settling in Washington, D.C., where he lived out his last years in the Mason's House of the Temple. Drawing on original documents, Pike's copious writings, and interviews with Pike's descendants, Walter Lee Brown presents a fascinating personal history that also serves as a rich compendium of Arkansas's antebellum history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d-4EEAAAQBAJ&dq=Albert+Pike+A+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mosaic Mind: Empowering the Tormented Selves of Child Abuse Survivors","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=58CQtwAACAAJ&dq=The+Mosaic+Mind:+Empowering+the+Tormented+Selves+of+Child+Abuse+Survivors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Man Tango","description":"Continuing the memoir that began in The Original Sin, Anthony Quinn describes his life from age twenty-five to the present, discussing his Hollywood career, celebrity friendships, and his son's death. 150,000 first printing. $150,000 ad/promo.

The ten-division North Korean army, spearheaded by 150 Russian-made T-34 tanks advanced, capturing Seoul, the capital of South Korea, in four days and continued advancing to the southeastern corner of the peninsula by August 1st. As the casualties mounted, the U.N. Allied Headquarters sent a landing operation to Inchon in the Yellow Sea to cut off enemy supply lines and take Seoul back from the North Korean Occupation. It shortened the war and saved many lives. In preparation for the successful landing operation, the Allied Headquarters deployed the Under Water Demolition Team of the U.S. Navy and a platoon of Korean Marines. They cleared mines along the shipping lanes, swept the enemy off adjacent islands and reconnoitered the landing sites. At dawn on September 15, 1950, UDT's and Marines led the armada of the landing operation, OPERATION CHROMITE, to the landing site. Under heavy enemy fire, they arrived at the beachhead in the first wave of the landing crafts, spearheaded the fierce firefight against tremendous odds, and finally crushed the enemy. At the summit of Mount Ungbong, they raised the U.N. flag to declare the liberation of Inchon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vNyF5s0wdHsC&dq=Tales+of+the+Yellow+Sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The new Poland (University of Illinois bulletin)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=84sVzwEACAAJ&dq=The+new+Poland+(University+of+Illinois+bulletin)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Flock of Fools: Ancient Buddhist Tales of Wisdom and Laughter from the One Hundred Parable Sutra","description":" These teachings from the heart of Buddhism ring true . . . a sumptuous meal of wild and comic dharma.

Where do we find the meaning of the text: in the author's head? in the reader's? Or do we, instead, make meaning in the practice of reading itself? If so, what part do our own values play in the process of interpretation? And what is the role of the text? Catherine Belsey considers these and other questions concerning the relations between human beings and language, readers and texts, writing and cultural politics. Assuming no prior knowledge of poststructuralism, Critical Practice guides the reader confidently through the maze of contemporary theory. It simply and lucidly explains the views of key figures such as Louis Althusser, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida, and shows their theories at work in readings of familiar literary texts. Critical Practice argues that theory matters, because it makes a difference to what we do when we read, opening up new possibilities for literary and cultural analysis. Poststructuralism, in conjunction with psychoanalysis and deconstruction, makes radical change to the way we read both a priority and a possibility. With a new chapter, updated guidance on further reading and revisions throughout, this second edition of Critical Practice is the ideal guide to the present and future of literary studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b32CAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaplan CSET: The California Subject Examination for Teachers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"It Came from Hunger!: Tales of a Cinema Schlockmeister","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ginnie and the New Girl","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Who Do You Think You Are Anyway?","description":"Dr. Robert A.

Reisman's experiences in other cultures bring a richness and depth to The Unseen Body. The way he thinks about the body and medicine the rivers and tributaries, the flowing and unclogging, the top-down organization of the brain is extraordinary!\\"  Mary Roach In this fascinating journey through the human body and across the globe, Dr. Reisman weaves together stories about our insides with a unique perspective on life, culture, and the natural world. Jonathan Reisman, M.D. a physician, adventure traveler and naturalist brings readers on an odyssey navigating our insides like an explorer discovering a new world with The Unseen Body. With unique insight, Reisman shows us how understanding mountain watersheds helps to diagnose heart attacks, how the body is made mostly of mucus, not water, and how urine carries within it a tale of humanity s origins. Through his offbeat adventures in healthcare and travel, Reisman discovers new perspectives on the body: a trip to the Alaskan Arctic reveals that fat is not the enemy, but the hero; a stint in the Himalayas uncovers the boundary where the brain ends and the mind begins; and eating a sheep s head in Iceland offers a lesson in empathy. By relating rich experiences in far-flung lands and among unique cultures back to the body s inner workings, he shows how our organs live inextricably intertwined lives an internal ecosystem reflecting the natural world around us. Reisman offers a new and deeply moving perspective, and helps us make sense of our bodies and how they work in a way readers have never before imagined.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=55oOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Juniper Tree and Other Tales","description":"\\"A milestone, a tour de force, a joy to see...27 stories from the Grimm brothers' collection [including] some familiar tales and others that are less well known.

It's about idealism, obsession and failure in Seattle, a progressive city on the fringe of America's continent and consciousness. Grant Cogswell is a poet, a punk rock-fan, an anarchist, a grassroots activist, and one very temperamental character. He loves Seattle so much he has the city logo tattooed on his arm. In the summer of 2001 he decides to run for city council. He's so determined to win that he'll even wear a polar-bear suit to a city hall meeting. Phil Campbell, the author, is a burnt-out recently fired alt-weekly reporter, a manic depressive who sees few reasons to live. Inspired by his friend Grant s passion, and without anything better to do, he agrees to manage Grant's campaign. For eighteen weeks, Phil devotes himself to Grant s grassroots challenge all the while fending an overzealous roommate challenging him for his position as manager of their shared house. Overshadowing the story is the tale of U.S. Rep. Marion Anthony Zioncheck, a legendary boozer and forgotten lefty radical from the 1930s. As Grant's campaign unfolds, so does the story of Zioncheck's tragedy   his rise and fall from an energetic young politico to a madman who is sent to the insane asylum. The question: Is Zioncheck's tale a lesson already learned, or a prophecy waiting to be repeated?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xJ8my_0pQUEC&dq=Zioncheck+for+President:+A+True+Story+of+Idealism+and+Madness+in+American+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Routledge Intensive German Course (Routledge Intensive Language Courses)","description":"This intensive foundation course in German is designed for students with no previous knowledge of the language.

His dramatic disappearance (a probable suicide) at the age of forty-one, his movie-star good looks, his role in various movements of the day, and his shifting relationships with key figures in the arts have made him one of the more intriguing and elusive artists of the time.

Reidel traces Kees s career from his birth in 1914 and boyhood in Beatrice, Nebraska, to his stint as an award-winning short-story writer and novelist, his rise as a poet and critic in New York, his branching off into abstract expressionism, jazz music, and theater, and his experimental and scientific filmmaking and photography.

The discovery of neurotransmitters revolutionized the way we think about the brain and what it means to be human yet few people know how they were discovered, the scientists involved, or the fierce controversy about whether they even existed. The War of the Soups and the Sparks tells the saga of the dispute between the pharmacologists, who had uncovered the first evidence that nerves communicate by releasing chemicals, and the neurophysiologists, experts on the nervous system, who dismissed the evidence and remained committed to electrical explanations. The protagonists of this story are Otto Loewi and Henry Dale, who received Nobel Prizes for their work, and Walter Cannon, who would have shared the prize with them if he had not been persuaded to adopt a controversial theory (how that happened is an important part of this history). Valenstein sets his story of scientific discovery against the backdrop of two world wars and examines the fascinating lives of several scientists whose work was affected by the social and political events of their time. He recounts such stories as Loewi's arrest by Nazi storm troopers and Dale's efforts at helping key scientists escape Germany. The War of the Soups and the Sparks reveals how science and scientists work. Valenstein describes the observations and experiments that led to the discovery of neurotransmitters and sheds light on what determines whether a novel concept will gain acceptance among the scientific community. His work also explains the immense importance of Loewi, Dale, and Cannon's achievements in our understanding of the human brain and the way mental illnesses are conceptualized and treated.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tjTQa04BXXwC&dq=The+Last+Chance+Kid&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seattle Slew","description":"One of the most popular Thoroughbreds in recent times, Seattle Slew is the only undefeated Triple Crown winner, sweeping racing's three jewels while keeping his perfect record intact.

It will surprise and challenge both Democrats and Republicans, motivate them to consider how we judge our nation's leaders, and illuminate the consequences of re-electing a commander in chief unfit for the role. This book is a sobering assessment of the man in the Oval Office and a warning about something even more important -- who we are as a people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xUW4DwAAQBAJ&dq=Warning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best of Weight Watchers Magazine : Over 145 Tasty Favorites--All 9 POINTS or Less","description":"A selection of the best meal ideas from Weight Watchers Magazine features a host of great recipes for appetizers, one-dish meals, main courses, holiday menus and party suggestions, pasta, baked goods and desserts, and snacks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hjDlzQEACAAJ&dq=Best+of+Weight+Watchers+Magazine+:+Over+145+Tasty+Favorites--All+9+POINTS+or+Less&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pontefract (Story of the English towns)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BEfFYgEACAAJ&dq=Pontefract+(Story+of+the+English+towns)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Energetics of food","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"That'S My Baby (Harlequin Promo)","description":"Harlequin Special Edition brings you three new titles for one great price, available now!

Looking back into the mists of evolutionary time, fish-like ancestors can be seen transformed by natural selection and other evolutionary pressures into animals with feeding habitats as varied as an anteater and a whale. From frog to pheasant and salamander to snake, every lineage of tetrapods has evolved unique feeding anatomy and behavior. Similarities in widely divergent tetrapods vividly illustrate their shared common ancestry. At the same time, numerous differences between and among tetrapods document the power and majesty that comprises organismal evolutionary history. Feeding is a detailed survey of the varied ways that land vertebrates acquire food. The functional anatomy and the control of complex and dynamic structural components are recurrent themes of this volume. Luminaries in the discipline of feeding biology have joined forces to create a book certain to stimulate future studies of animal anatomy and behavior.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f7exUolnxugC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Control of Human Parasitic Diseases, Volume 61 (Advances in Parasitology)","description":"Control of parasitic infections of humans has progressed rapidly over the last three decades.

First appearing in  Green Tea,  originally published in 1869, Dr. Hesselius became one of the first literary occult detectives. J. Sheridan Le Fanu often made revisions to his work and re-released several under new names, including two from In a Glass Darkly:  The Familiar,  a revised version of  The Watcher,  published in 1851, and  Mr. Justice Harbottle,  a revised version of  An Account of Some Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street,  published in 1853. Most notably, this collection includes what is likely Sheridan Le Fanu s most famous work,  Carmilla.  A young countess turned vampire, Countess Mircalla uses the anagram of her name, Carmilla, to disguise herself in order to prey on unsuspecting young women.  Carmilla  would heavily influence Bram Stoker s Dracula, which would later become the prototypical vampire archetype.

This seemed to be on the brink of success when it was thrown into confusion by the discovery of the class paradoxes. That initiated a period of intense research into the foundations of mathematics, and with it the birth of mathematical logic and a new, sharper debate in the philosophy of mathematics. The Search for Certainty examines this foundational endeavour from the discovery of the paradoxes to the present. Focusing on Russell's logicist programme and Hilbert's finitist programme, Giaquinto investigates how successful they were and how successful they could be. These questions are set in the context of a clear, non-technical exposition and assessment of the most important discoveries in mathematical logic, above all G--ouml--;del's underivability theorems. More than six decades after those discoveries, Giaquinto asks what our present perspective should be on the question of certainty in mathematics. Taking recent developments into account, he gives reasons for a surprisingly positive response.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gyNbrpYXzxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seasons of Light (Lighted Path Collection)","description":"Witness nature's seasons in the luminous artistry of Thomas Kinkade.

After a carefree childhood, Mary Margaret Kelly came of age in the shadow of grief. Her father, a dashing daredevil Air Force pilot, died when she was nine. Maggie saw her mother struggle to put their lives back together. As the family moved from one city to the next, her mother warned her to beware of daredevil men and avoid risk at all cost. Following her mother s advice, and forgoing the magic of first love with a high school boyfriend who was too wild to feel safe, Maggie instead sought out all the things her mother had lost a predictable partner, a stable home, and a regular paycheck. She chose to marry a dependable, kind man who was a reliable husband and successful accountant. Together they had a son and found happiness in a conventional suburban life. Until tragedy struck again. Now on her own, feeling a sense of adventure for the first time, Maggie decides to face her fears, setting off on a whirlwind trip from San Francisco to Rome, Paris, and Monaco. But when her travels reconnect her with the very same irresistible, thrill-seeking man she s spent thirty years trying to forget, Maggie becomes terrified that rushing into love and sharing his life may very well end in disaster.

Its manifestations are conniving and destructive, dwelling in she who desires to have her way, no matter who is destroyed in the process. You can't defeat what you can't see. While most people are hyper-focused on Jezebel--and are basing their warfare on a misunderstanding of what Jezebel really is--fewer understand the workings of Jezebel's demonic partners in crime. The spirit of Jezebel couldn't execute all its wicked plots without the spirits of Ahab, the false prophets and the eunuchs.

And a new ally will help him take it - his alter ego for whom he has nothing but contempt - Starfleet Captain James T. Kirk. Honorable, idealistic and decent, James T.

It takes someone of [his] stature to tackle this theme head-on  (The New York Times). There is a philosophical school of thought that believes the presence of God in art, literature, and music in creativity in general is a vacant metaphor, an eroded figure of speech, a ghost in humanity s common parlance. George Steiner posits the opposite that any coherent understanding of language and art, any capacity to communicate meaning and feeling, is premised on God. In doing so, he argues against the kind of criticism that obscures, instead of elucidates, meaning. From the power of language to vital philosophical tenets, Real Presences examines the role of meaning and of the spiritual in art throughout history and across cultures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NsN7alUl2HcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eyes of the Storm: Hurricane Katrina and Rita The Photographic Story","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Conan the warrior","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The craft of fiction","description":"\\"The Craft of Fiction\\" by Percy Lubbock.

Only thing is, if they're so special, how come they never see anyone who looks like them in their school history books? Then, on a class trip to a nearby cathedral, Leo's attention is drawn to a large marble slab high above the doors of the hall. Right there, bang in the middle of a list of war heroes, Leo finds himself staring at something incredible: his own name. Desperate to know who this other Leo was, the two friends embark on a search. And together, they begin to uncover missing stories from the past, ones which they are determined to put back into their rightful place in the pages of history.

In this book Christian Jacquemin shows how the power of natural language processing (NLP) can be used to advance text indexing and information retrieval (IR). Jacquemin's novel tool is FASTR, a parser that normalizes terms and recognizes term variants. Since there are more meanings in a language than there are words, FASTR uses a metagrammar composed of shallow linguistic transformations that describe the morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic variations of words and terms. The acquired parsed terms can then be applied for precise retrieval and assembly of information. The use of a corpus-based unification grammar to define, recognize, and combine term variants from their base forms allows for intelligent information access to, or \\"linguistic data tuning\\" of, heterogeneous texts. FASTR can be used to do automatic controlled indexing, to carry out content-based Web searches through conceptually related alternative query formulations, to abstract scientific and technical extracts, and even to translate and collect terms from multilingual material. Jacquemin provides a comprehensive account of the method and implementation of this innovative retrieval technique for text processing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W6AB06SBAGMC&dq=Spotting+and+Discovering+Terms+through+Natural+Language+Processing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freedom Of Assembly (American Rights)","description":"American democracy owes much to the rights guaranteed to individuals in the U.S. Constitution and specifically in its first 10 amendments, known as the Bill of Rights.

Bruce Waltke, James Houston, and Erika Moore examine ten lament psalms, including six of the seven traditional penitential psalms, covering Psalms 5, 6, 7, 32, 38, 39, 44, 102, 130, and 143. The authors -- experts in the subject area -- skillfully establish the meaning of the Hebrew text through careful exegesis and trace the church's historical interpretation and use of these psalms, highlighting their deep spiritual significance to Christians through the ages. Though C. S. Lewis called the \\"imprecatory\\" psalms \\"contemptible,\\" Waltke, Houston, and Moore show that they too are profitable for sound doctrine and so for spiritual health, demonstrating that lament is an important aspect of the Christian life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DHSNAwAAQBAJ&dq=Psalms+for+Healing+%5BWith+Ribbons+(3)%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amphitryon.

Harper Lee Hailed by the Washington Post Book World as  a sort of Catcher in the Rye out West,  Richard Bradford s Red Sky at Morning is the classic coming-of-age story set during World War II about the enduring spirit of youth and the values in life that count. In the summer of 1944, Frank Arnold, a wealthy shipbuilder in Mobile, Alabama, receives his volunteer commission in the U.S. Navy and moves his wife, Ann, and seventeen-year-old son, Josh, to the family s summer home in the village of Corazon Sagrado, high in the New Mexico mountains. A true daughter of the Confederacy, Ann finds it impossible to cope with the quality of life in the largely Hispanic village and, in the company of Jimbob Buel an insufferable, South-proud, professional houseguest takes to bridge and sherry. Josh, on the other hand, becomes an integral member of the Sagrado community, forging friendships with his new classmates, with the town s disreputable resident artist, and with Amadeo and Excilda Montoya, the couple hired by his father to care for their house. Josh narrates the story of his fateful year in Sagrado and, with irresistibly deadpan, irreverent humor, describes the events and people who influence his progress to maturity. Unhindered by his mother's disdain for these \\"tacky, dusty little Westerners,\\" Josh comes into his own and into a young man's finely formed understanding of duty, responsibility, and love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2mu2AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The German Generals Talk","description":"The German Generals who survived Hitler's Reich talk over World War II with Capt.

Kennedy. Grassroots \\"Viva Kennedy Clubs\\" sprang up not only in the southwestern United States but also across California and the upper Midwest to help elect the young Catholic standard bearer. The leaders of the Viva Kennedy Clubs were confident and hopeful that their participation in American democracy would mark the beginning of the end of discrimination, violence, and poverty in the barrio. Although the dream of attaching their own Camelot to Kennedy's ultimately ended in disappointment, these participatory efforts contributed to an identity-building process for Mexican Americans that led to greater emphasis on Americanization for some and to the more radical rhetoric of the Chicano Movement for others. In \\"Viva Kennedy,\\" Ignacio M. Garcia surveys the background, development, and evolution of the Viva Kennedy Clubs and their post-election incarnation as PASO, the Political Association of Spanish-Speaking Organizations. He argues that patriotic fervor of the 1940s and postwar economic expansion spurred middle-class Mexican Americans to strive for full inclusion in American society. Ironically, those involved in the Viva Kennedy movement showed their militancy in fighting discrimination even as they upheld America's conservative values. They believed that discrimination could be overcome through government actions that recognized their civil rights and through their own political participation. Garcia describes the post-election problems of the Viva Kennedy reformers, who first saw the Kennedy administration ignore its campaign promises to them and then encountered their own factional squabbles, chronic funding problems, and a growing unease among Anglo Americans wary of Mexican American political power. Based on research and interviews with key leaders of the Viva Kennedy movement such as Ed Idar, Jr., Edward R. Roybal, and Albert Pena, Jr., this study unveils a portrait of a people in transition and provides a nuanced picture of twentieth-century Mexican American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b8MA_vCh_nQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Clean Your Room","description":"Got a messy room?

Mothers and Sons is a deeply penetrating and beautifully written meditation on the dramas surrounding this most elemental of relationships. Each of the nine stories focuses on a moment in which an unspoken balance shifts; in which a mother or son do battle, or experience a sudden crisis, thus leaving their conception of who they are subtly or seriously altered. A son buries his mother and goes out to a drug-fuelled rave on a remote beach near Dublin. A mother sings about treacherous love to a rapt crowd of musicians in a local pub. And in  A Long Winter,  Colm T ib n s finest piece of fiction to date, a man goes searching for his mother in the snow-covered Pyrenees. Psychologically intricate and emotionally incisive, each finely wrought story teases out the delicate and difficult strands woven between mothers and sons. This is an acute, masterful, and moving collection that confirms T ib n as a great prose stylist of our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dp5ctxe6eS8C&dq=Mothers+And+Sons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At the Billionaire's Bidding (The Wedding Auction) (Silhouette Romance, No 1442)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Created for God's Pleasure: A Challenge for Single Women","description":"\\"Created for God's Pleasure\\" is for all women in general and single Christian women in particular. The message of the book is that the single Christian woman has a prominent place in God's plan for His Church and Kingdom. The centre of the book portrays a living reflection of the hearts of twelve single women from a multiplicity of progressions, faithful in their service to God, but are on their own and does not wish to be. They have never been married and would like to be. Many of these women have accepted this role with grace; however many others appear to have taken up a lamentation of what they see as unacceptable plight, albeit ordained by a loving God and Father. From their testimonies we find sadness, disappointment, resignation, hope deferred and somewhere in the midst of it all, some acceptance of what might inevitably be \\"God's will\\" for their lives. Having created us God reserves the right to keep us to Himself by not giving us away in marriage, so that we can serve Him with individual devotion and without distractions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_P93mAEACAAJ&dq=Created+for+God%27s+Pleasure:+A+Challenge+for+Single+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Hands of Providence : Joshua L.

Postwar literary theory has absorbed the skepticism, suspicion, and paranoia of the Cold War mentality, and it plays them out in debates about the divided self, linguistic indeterminacy, the metaphysics of presence, multiculturalism, canon formation, power, cultural literacy, and the politics of literature. The major critical movements of the postwar age, Siebers argues, belong to three dominant phases of the Cold War era. The age of charismatic leadership characterized by Churchill, FDR, Stalin, and Hitler lies behind the preoccupation with \\"intention,\\" \\"affect,\\" and \\"impersonality\\" found in the New Criticism. The age of propaganda motivates the fascination with the guiles of language, undecidability, and deconstruction. The age of superpowers provides the dominant metaphor in the new historicism's analysis of the technology of power. All three ages of criticism reflect the skepticism of the Cold War mentality, and this skepticism, Siebers posits, has impaired the ability of literary theorists to talk about the politics of criticism in an effective way. A trenchant analysis of postwar theory, Siebers's work presents a new view of the politics of criticism and a surprising vision of what theory must do if it is to enter the post Cold War era successfully.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LFydQgAACAAJ&dq=Cold+War+Criticism+and+the+Politics+of+Skepticism+(Odeon)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buzz Buzz Buzz","description":"A delightfully illustrated cause-and-effect story that will keep readers flipping the pages.
