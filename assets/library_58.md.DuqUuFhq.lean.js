I felt that the ending was contrived. The solution to their problem made no sense to me. And then though Acheron basically told them to do it, it didn't work and then he had to come fix it? Sorry to be so vague but I don't want to give it away :p I just couldn't quite connect what was going on in the end. I'm looking forward to her shifting her focus to the Were-hunters."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"This series manages to just keep getting better and better. In Ms. Kenyon's latest addition to the DH series we meet Wulf. A Viking that is a Dark Hunter but not. He has survived for centuries with no one remembering him five minutes after he leaves their presence. That's all about to change when he meets Cassandra. Problem with Cassandra is he has sworn to kill her kind (she's Appollite) and now with the help of the Gods and orders from Ash he now finds himself protecting that which he has hunted. Of course Cassandra is half human so it should be okay that he is now feeling intense things for her and there is the added bonus that she remembers him.We learn more about the DH legend in this story as well as getting to know the Appollite's as well. They are more then people that might turn Daimon. This story was very touching at times (I even managed to tear up a few times) as well as sensual. Ms. Kenyon has an incredible imagination and is not afraid to use it. Julian, Zarak, Ash, Talon, and Kyrian all play a part in this story. I would really be hard pressed to pick my favorite story since they are all different and lets face it so far all of the DH are yummy! If you are new to this series you will find this book very entertaining, and if you have been following it from the beginning such as I have you won't want to miss this story!!! I can hardly wait for the next in the series. Ms. Kenyon truly can't write it fast enough for me!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Whew. I'm not sure why I keep buying Sherrilyn Kenyon's books. I feel kind of like a sucker after this one, and even though I am particularly interested in a couple of characters in the series and would like to know how their stories turn out, I don't know how many more of these things I'm going to buy. Maybe I'll compromise and buy them used instead of new.Anyway...The main love story in this book fell flat, and any real conflict between them was, for all intents and purposes, resolved way too early. (...)For the first three books, the Dark Hunter world was knit together fairly well, but with this book, I think it's starting to unravel around the edges. The next books need to tie up some of the apparent inconsistencies in the world instead of bringing in more mysterious events and secondary characters. I mean, just how many people still running around in the present time were born on Acheron's birthday, anyway? And why isn't Apollo a little more concerned about his last descendant's death? Come to think of it, if Cassandra's death means Apollo's death and therefore the end of the whole world, why aren't whole pantheons of gods protecting her?Peeves, in no particular order:- The author's habit of advertising her other pseudonym's books and her web site. She does it in almost every one of her SK books, and I find this incredibly cheesy.- Simi. She is tolerable only in extremely small doses.- Black clothing, black leather, blah, blah, blah. I find myself thinking longingly of Valerius' story, since it sounds like his wardrobe is a bit more varied. I hope he doesn't turn into a leather addict by the time his book comes out."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Okay, I know I'm going against the majority, but I just didn't like this installment as much as I liked the other ones.By the way I'm a huge Sherrilyn Kenyon fan and have devored all of her Dark-Hunter novels. They are on my keeper shelf and I re-read them every chance I get.Having said that, Wulf and Cassandra's romance didn't engage me as much as Zerek, Talon, Kyrain and Julian's did. I kept reading the book hoping for something more from them and never getting it. The part I did love about the book was it's prolouge, which gives you a deeper background on Acheron's orgins (which I think I have figured out!!!) and the apperance of the other Dark-Hunter's from her previous books and Julian (which, I thought was the best part of the novel).Yet, I'm still glad I read it, and I hope that the next novel about Vane will be worth me rushing to the store the moment it's released, like I did for this one."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Centuries ago, he became immortal when he was tricked by a Dark-Huntress whom he had a brief affair with. With the help of her lover, the Norse god Loki, Morginne switched their souls without his knowledge, and Wulf Tryggvason became a Dark-Hunter, while she became mortal. But to add more to his suffering, she put the ultimate curse on him: no human, save someone of his own bloodline, would ever remember him after five minutes of meeting him. Then a thousand years later, he finally met a woman who could remember him - then it turned out that she belongs to the race that his kind has been hunting down for years.Cassandra Peters is a descendant of Apollo. As the only one left who bears the blood of the ancient god, she grew up running from those who hunted her - those who believe in the ancient curse. Now with only eight months before her twenty-seventh birthday, she knows that time is running out for her. And with her enemies closing in on her, she is more fearful that her time on earth is becoming shorter. Then one fateful night in a Minnesota bar, Wulf comes to her rescue. For the very first time, Cassandra meets a man who makes her yearn for all the things she could never have - that of loving someone and being loved in return, and actually growing old in the company of the man she loved.KISS OF THE NIGHT, while having the same romantic element as the other books in the series, is different in other aspects. Wulf and Cassandra are practically enemies sworn to hate each other's kind. Both are forbidden to each other, and this is something that they must overcome not only to find the happiness they both yearn for, but also enable them to save the world from extinction.Although I felt that this was the weakest of the first five books, I still had great fun reading this and it was great to be given a more in depth look into the lives of the Apollites and Daimons alike. It was also great to once again see those gorgeous heroes from the previous books and see them in action as they help to fight off the Daimons. And, of course, there is Acheron. Sherrilyn Kenyon maintains the mystery surrounding his real identity that leaves the readers aching for his own story.Filled with humor, sizzling love scenes and butt-kicking actions, this is another enjoyable book from the Dark-Hunter series."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"This was an impulse buy. I was ready for checkout with two books, when I saw this in the new realise section. I actually but back one of the books to get this. It was unheard of for me to do espesially from an author I had never heard of before. I haven't regretted it a bit. Kenyon is the best.Her Dark-Hunter series gives a whole new mythical meaning to the idea of vampires. Immortals with no souls fighting for the innocent, and getting their souls back if they find their true love. The fighting and god powers give dimension to the story line.The heroine an Apollite, Cassandra is destined to die on her 27th birhtday and she's pregnant by Wolf (a Dark-Hunter) who no one, but his relatives and other immortals can remember meeting five minutes after he leaves. Their being chased by Daimons who want to kill Cassandra and her baby as the last descendants of Apollo, so they will be cured (not that it would work). If they did kill her Apollo would die and with him the sun. The book is fast and detailed. You want to rush ahead to know whats going to happen next. It's a book that can easily be read twice.I have now read all of Kenyon's books and will continue to get them. If your cautious borrow someone else's. But when your hooked you just can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Cassandra Peters is an Appollite, a descendant of the God Appollo. Her race has been cursed and she will die at the age of 27 like all Appollites. She is attacked by Daimons (soul sucking vampires) and is rescued by Wulf Tryggvason, a Dark Hunter. Not long afterwards her dreams are invaded by this gorgeous Dark Hunter. The dreams are so life like that they are almost real. Wulf has been ordered to protect Cassandra, as the last in the line of Appollites, the World will end if she dies.I didn't like this book as much as the other in the series. I found some of the details confusing. If the World will end as Cassandra is the last in long line of Appollites, then what about all the other Appollites we meet in the underground city? However, the relationship between Wulf and Cassandra was quite touching. A good read nonetheless.Lea Ling Tsang"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I LOVED this book. I appreciate a true kick you know what female and this book had two of them who were role models if ever there were one or two. Wulf was sexy and fun. I really liked the vulnerable side of him when he was with Cassandra and Chris. He was alpha and at the same time, he wasn't stupid about it. Likewise Cassandra wasn't the typical romance heroine who is so independent that she does something stupid to prove herself to the hero only to cause him to have to save her.Even more than that, I loved the whole Destroyer scenes. They were spooky. I never knew what Stryker would do next. And then there was Urian who took my breath away. Yow! I hope we have more stories about him and Kat too.I am in love with the Dark Hunters. I just wish they were real."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I really enjoyed the charachters of Wulf and Cassandra. I did feel the love scenes were a little flat, especially compared to her past charachters, they were not nearly as good as Talon's & Sunshine's for example.SPOILER ALERT ON:I was a bit confused & let down by the ending, Ash once again saves the day and helps ensure that Wulf finds his true happiness. It's starting to make you wonder why the DH worry so much about their futures with Ash around. It's also unclear with what truly happened when Cassie and Wulf saved each other by the mutual feed. I don't get why this saved them, and what there state is now, are they human, yet immortal?SPOILER ALERT OFFThe fight scenes were great and I enjoy the cameo appearances by the other dark hunters, it keeps these awesome heros alive. As always Ash kicks butt, I simply can't wait to hear his story.I personally don't mind her mentioning D-H.com, if you've checked out that website and are a true SK fan you will know that the website really helps the heros come off the page so to speak."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I recieved this book yesterday and last night stayed up late and finished it. Sherrilyn has once again brought her Dark-Hunter series an fantastic book. Cassandra an Apollite has only one year to produce a child and to make it worse she has only a few years left to live. Wulf is supposed to be her enemy and yet he is drawn to her. You will want to read this one to see how they get together. Katra, Artima's handmaiden is intoduced in this one and happily Simi makes her appearence. Her GA-GA-Goo made me fall out of my chair laughing. Can't wait for Night Play coming out this August.

We also meet Cassandra, the last living descendant of the god Apollo, father of the Apollites. With the Daimons hunting her, and the Apollite curse hanging over her, who would think anything else could be added to her already chaotic life? Well, try having STEAMY dreams about a certain Viking Dark Hunter that seems so real, Cassandra wakes up without clothes only to find out that she's got a little surprise as well!!!! Although this wasn't my favorite book in the Dark Hunter series, I still loved the fact the Kenyon makes the seemingly heartless Daimons more human and you find yourself empathizing with them...The love scenes are HOT and the love story between Wulf and Cassandra is simply beautiful!!!!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"This is a great read, but if you are already a fan of the dark-hunters then its to be expected. This to me was one of the more heart felt stories of the series. A basic lesson of dont judge a book by its cover. For those that have never read a Sherrilyn Kenyon master piece, then you are in for a real treat, be warned though once you buy one dark-hunter, were-hunter or dream-hunter book, you will be hooked for life. Enjoy! (FYI) if you started the series with newer books, this book explains Achrons demion spy. aka Strykers son."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"This is the fifth installment in the Dark-Hunter series. It is neither the worst nor the best. It follows the story of Wulf, a Dark-Hunter sworn to protect the human world from soul-sucking Daimons. Wulf has a curse upon him, that no human not of his bloodline can remember him. This fact apparently makes him feel quite lonely. Then he meets Cassandra, and discovers that she can remember him. Their attraction to one another is complicated by the fact that their species are natural enemies, and that forces beyond their control have been working to push them together against their will.This book was very enjoyable at some parts, boring at others. Just when I thought I was ready to give up on it, something would grab my attention and make me laugh or cry. I can't say either main character was all that remarkable. Cassandra was honestly quite two-dimensional. Wulf was a bit more developed but unfortunately still predictable. Overall, I think if you're a fan of the Dark-Hunter series you'll enjoy this book"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"WOW this series is fun and very good to fallow. This is one of the best paranormal romance sultry series to get into. I have had so much fun with this series and am still fallowing it. I just downt want it to end. I have many characters that I realy like but ASH will always be the one I LOVE!!!!! Enjoy the fun of it all!!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"While I know that some of Kenyon's other books are better written, I can't help but love this book! The sex scenes are sizzling & my favorite part- the bit characters are pretty endearing. Yup, I admit it. I read it for the character of Chris Erickson.The story surrounds the character of Cassandra- someone who is doomed to die at a young age due to being half-Apollite. If that's not bad enough, she has to procreate before her expiration date or the world will end. (Not that she knows this little fact.) Enter Wulf- a sexy ex-Viking who unfortunately can't be remembered by anyone not blood related to him. Well... anyone but Cassandra, who he meets one night at the local bar as she's being hunted down by Daimons who want the young cutie dead...Again, I really enjoyed this story. It's got one or two parts of it that get bogged down a little, but nothing to the extreme. (The only part I found a little dragged out was when everyone went to the Apollite city- could have been about 10-20 pages shorter.) Still, it's a great story and all of the characters are pretty endearing. I actually found myself curious as to what happened afterwards, a rarity for me!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I felt this 5th book in the series that the author ran out of steam. It was extremely rushed and forced. I thought mortal enemies coming together would be more exciting. This stretched the impossible a little too far for me. I felt the 2 characters connected too soon and for no good reason. Too much discussion of the history of their race and not about their romance."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Good book with alot of tear-jerker moments.probably one of the best in terms of character depth.

Plus, you know, there's the hot and steamy stuff."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Although I liked the series from the start, after the fourth book I felt like the story line of the dark hunters was getting a little too repetitive but Wulf and Cassandra's story completely revitalized the series. It gives more history of the Apollites and that angle made the story much more interesting. It didn't focus as much on the heroes tortured past, which I liked because as interesting as the tortured hero is as a character, it can be depressing. If you are on the fence with the series I highly recommend giving this book a chance!!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I enjoyed this book. Wulf is a DH and Cassandra is an Apollite. The Apollites were created by Apollo and also cursed by him to die on their 27th b-day. You get to learn more about the Apollites and why some choose to turn into Daimons (which are Apollites who refuse to die at 27). I think this book gives readers more understanding about the otherside and makes the whole series even better. The calvary is called out with Julian, Kryian, Talon and Zarek all making appearances in this book. We are introduced to a new character, Urian, who by the end of the book I was loving and so wishing he might get his own book. Otherwise, he will mostly likely be making more appearances in books proceeding this one."},{"Title":"Structure of Matthew's Gospel: A Study in Literary Design (Library of New Testament Studies)","review":"I had the privilege of being a student of Dr. Bauer for a seminary class on Matthew about the time this book was released. The course was life-changing: not only is Bauer one of the world's leading specialists in Matthew, but his communication, teaching and writing skills are so personal and passionate that even technical material is understandable. His heart for God, Scripture and practical application are all commendable.I owe my passion for Matthew's gospel all these decades later to Dr. Bauer. I now teach Matthew on the college level, and I draw from his well in probably every class session. No one has brought to life the beautiful and intentional literary design, and its resultant theological/practical implications to life like Dr. Bauer.As it is academic, the book would probably be s stretch for college students, but a worthy one to stretch towards.Anyone seeking to capture the flow, narrative and message of Matthew will find a wealth of resources.Whether structural analysis of biblical text is new or not to you, as it is wrestled with, you will be amazed at the life lessons that will result. If you have never considered the crucial place of chiasm, inclusio, and other literary devices/forms in Scripture (or other ancient texts), buy this book yesterday. Bible teachers and preachers should buy it even sooner than that.Even better, sit in on one of his classes with this book in hand as soon as possible.Tell him I sent you.God bless, and thank you, David Bauer."},{"Title":"Wind power for the homeowner: A guide to selecting, siting, and installing an electricity-generating wind power system","review":"This was an excellent book when written 30 years ago however electronics, controls and inverters has changed a lot since then.

The first part of the book explains how you got to where you are in your marriage (you will think he is writing about YOU) and the second half of the book is how to rekindle your love for one another, even when one spouse is doing most of the trying. Tim Clinton emphasizes that marriages are sacred and holy ground, but he provides hope so that you don't feel like you are &quot;gutting it out&quot; for the next 20 or 40 years, just because God says so.

Great care is also given to detailing various situations that arise from Goal Line to a flexible Cover 3 that can be used when a team throws a totally unexpected formation at you. I would highly recommend this book as a classic. Possibly THE classic in this area. My only caveat is that it IS a classic. This book was written in 1984, before the modern explosion in pass formations, and the variations we call the West Coast and/or Run and Shoot Offenses. I only wish he would update this book and talk about some of the new developments in it."},{"Title":"Coaching the Defensive Secondary","review":"Coach Mark Aubrey Schuster has written a great book on the Defensive Secondary.

Alberti came from one of the wealthiest familes of Florence, which contained \\"political grandees and bankers with international firms and contacts.\\" Through a series of business catastrophes, most of which he could not avoid because he lacked the necessary political patronage from the ruling Medici family, Alberti descended from rich banker to pauper. In a humiliating denouement to this process, a papal court in 1454 excommunicated him because he had failed to pay two debts:**Calling on a well-known ritual of symbolic action, the ceremony took place in the Florence cathedral itself, immediately after a particular Mass. Read out to all those in attendance, the anathema was following by the ringing of a bell, the lighting and sudden putting out of a candle thrust into the ground, and the raising of a cross, all in sign of the debtor's enforced separation from the Church.**His poetry sprang from his abasement:**In the late 1430s and 1440s, when Francesco looked from his high windows down to the street known by his family name, an exile in the middle of his native city because he could not step out of his doorway, save at the risk of being seized and arrested for debt and back taxes, he was driven to moralizing and dark rumination.Francesco was a man so distressed by his financial and social undoing, and so outraged by the city's political bosses, that he had to make his psychological peace with them or be overwhelmed by rage and despair. . . . His poetry is a way of conversing with himself: it is a secular prayer, a mode of self-examination and improvement, a diary irregularly kept.**Although one would not say that he is a \\"major\\" poet, still there is much to appreciate in his verse, particularly if one understands how far this man fell in the world. Here is a prosaic \\"literal translation\\" (so described by Lauro Martines) of one of his most poignant poems:**I know I do not know more than others comprehend,and I'm no longer, which I know, the man I was;and I know that he knows nothing who claims too oftento know all and to grasp everything.And I know that he who'll not be blamedis a beast confirmed, hard and whole,and I know that those with too much faith in this worldcome to a bad end, unless they check themselves.And I know what a gap there is between word and deed,and how we counsel others with such easeto do the very things we fail to do ourselves.And I know how assiduously man sharpens himselfto bypass legal right and grab the property of others,and how in short the world works its own havoc.I know the way to hold a bridle and a girl,how to go out in company and hold my own,but I know not all it takes to get back what is mine.**The last line is very effective in Italian, \\"ma non so tanto far che torni il mio,\\" particularly because the final verb \\"tornare\\" suggests not only the regaining of something but also the balancing of an account and the turning of a wheel (of fortune). As Martines demonstrates, because Alberti's poem \\"juxtaposes being and not-being, knowing and not-knowing, existence and knowledge\\"--also through the use of similar sounds, \\"non so\\" (I know not), \\"non son\\" (I am not), \\"so\\" (I know), and \\"sono\\" (I am)--it encapsulates Alberti's parlous position (exiled, excommunicated, scorned, impoverished, yet still capable of great feeling) when he wrote this poem.Alberti's ability to craft his words so carefully in the midst of misery shows how composed a person may be, albeit only temporarily. In other poems, his darker thoughts move across the page:**El ver fuggiasco in fondo si ritruova,ch'apena pu&ograve; fiatar sanza licenza.Che si de' far per chi poco ci puote,se chi pu&ograve; pi&ugrave; la guida come vuole,s&igrave; che n'andiamo in precipizio e \`n preda?(Fugitive truth finds itself down at the bottom,where it can barely breathe without a permit.What to do when you can't do much,if those who can do much run things their own way,so that we rush headlong and are prey?)**In the last line, the procession of \\"andiamo\\" (rush), \\"precipizio\\" (precipice) and \\"preda\\" (prey) strongly evokes Alberti's sense of doom. Yet Alberti also recognized that \\"L'amico &egrave; un altro io proprio redutto\\" (\\"a friend is another I\\").As Martines comments: \\"Francesco's poetry belongs to the history of Florentine exile literature from Dante to Luigi Alamanni, except of course that his was an internal exile, an alienation; and this condition has not been studied by historians.\\" Thanks to Martines, we may now understand many neglected topics of the Italian Renaissance."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension, anemia, and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated. She says bedrest is actually harmful, that ultrasounds increase fetal mortality and left-handedness (???) and a host of other claims. She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism, water births, home births, doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Having already had one child, I am aware of what childbirth entails, and the associated risks. When I bought this book, I was hoping to have more of a comparative narration of the differences that I would go through with a twin pregnancy. I find that the so called advise that this author gives is not clear, is not helpful, and above all puts a fear on the mother, above and beyond the recognition of risk. The excerpts that are included in the margins are extremely negative, and irrelevent to the reader. Almost every time a doctor is mentioned, the person describes how the doctor didn't/wouldn't believe them, or that the Dr. did not take anything the patient said seriously. Along with that the exerpts generally describe the doctor as being incompetent in his/her diagnosis. The information that is included in these exerpts is irrelevent to carrying twins - nurses yelling at you because you're not pushing correctly, or experiences at the doctors office that resulted in the patient being ignored. This information has more to do with the assertiveness of the patient than it does of carrying twins and I found it to be very discouraging. The incessant focus on the loss of one twin is also extremely disturbing. While the occurance can happen, I desperately searched in the book for a positive majority of successful twin births, and this book did nothing to assuage my fears that had been instilled right from the beginning. The authors descriptions of the irreperable damage that having twins will do to your body, does not allow for any alternative methods to avoid such things. Vericose veins, and stretch marks, and incontinence apparently are a guarantee with twins, as is the extra fold of skin that will never go away. Nothing I read in this book gave me anykind of positive outlook for carrying, delivering, or caring for twins. I do not recommend this book to anyone who is expecting twins."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book had me convinced that amy twins would have some type of birth defect, or that something would go wrong with my pregnancy, labor, or delivery. I read this when I was on bedrest, and finally had to remove it from my room because it scared me too much. The author seemed only to concentrate on what could go wrong with a twin pregnancy. I would recommend the only other twin book I read - &quot;Keys to Parenting Twins.&quot; It's much more positive! By the way, my twins were born completely healthy &amp; normal at 36 weeks."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Noble's book is best summarized as &quot;frightening&quot; and &quot;far out.&quot; Her thoughts on twinship experiences in utero sound like something out of the X-Files; her warnings against the evils of consuming dairy products and foods containing preservatives are pure paranoia; and the gorey details of multiple pregnancy hazards are nothing short of terrifying. In fact, the positive aspects of having twins are completely ignored. The only redeeming quality of this book would be the last 3-4 chapters dealing with prematurity and dealing with loss. However, this same content can be found in many other less frightening and definitely more positive books, such as &quot;Twins!&quot; by Agnew, Klein and Ganon."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This was the first book that I bought when I found out that I was expecting twins and I found it to be outdated and full of a lot of biased information. The author has her own thoughts about what type of diet you should eat and advocates natural childbirth but doesn't provide a very comprehensive point of view to assist those that may not want to experience childbirth the way that she has. If you share her views then this book will be very helpful to you.I also tried contacting a lot of resources at the back of the book and found most of the numbers to be disconnected."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"While this book didn't scare me, I found it laughable and largely useless for the majority of twin-carrying women who like and trust their obgyns, believe that pain is generally to be avoided, and are actually comforted by the fact that institutions such as hospitals exist. Also, I found the book highly offensive in that it strongly suggested that miscarriage in twin pregnancies is caused by a mother's doubts about carrying twins. Gee, what a wonderful guilt trip to impose on a grieving mother..."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I do not recommend this book at all. There is way too much discussion of what can go wrong and too much &quot;new age&quot; philosophy that is very strange to me. Elizabeth Noble is under the impression that she had a twin that died in utero and that influences the way she has gone about writing this book. This is very scary reading for any woman pregnant with twins."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This was the scariest book on twins that I read. If you want to be afraid to eat, sleep or breathe during your entire pregnancy than this is your kind of book. Almost every chapter focuses on a negative aspect of carrying more than one baby and there are more chapters on what can go wrong than what to do to help things go right."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Having just been told I was expecting twins, I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard, &quot;singleton&quot; pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance, I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin, preterm labor, birth complications, vanishing twin syndrome, etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition, the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise, which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other &quot;macrobiotic&quot; health store food. All in all, I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I really appreciated the author's views on protecting children. I found her to be progressive and well-informed when it came to such issues as circumcision. There is a great deal of medical research which shows that circumcision is harmful and traumatizing to the child, and this author tells it like it is."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I was very disappointed overall with this book. In particular, the misinformation perpetuated by this author in the section on diet and nutrition was shocking. The author advocates &quot;free range&quot; and &quot;more natural&quot; animal products in place of tested, safe chicken and dairy products. As a veterinarian and graduate of The Ohio State University College of Food, Agriculture, and Environmental Sciences, I can testify that the quality of such &quot;natural&quot; products is often much lower than their farm-grown counterparts. Furthermore, the agricultural processes decried by this author in fact serve to make our food supply safer than ever before. Certainly this book does not present an &quot;expert&quot; opinion, nor does it provide safe and accurate information for the women who need it most. As far as the rest of the information in this book, I found it outdated and, in other cases, inaccurate. The author apparently has never been through a twin pregnancy herself; she is not particularly sensitive to the emotions of the mothers for whom the book is ostensibly written."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book scared me to death when I was pregnant. NONE of the terrible things it described happened to me. I feel it was also very one-sided. I agree the reviewer #1, The book made you feel bad ! Like being pregnant with twins was going to be a terrible experince, beware!The book was just so negative! I threw it in the garbage after I had the babies!"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Never was I so worried and scared in my life than when I read this book. I hope and pray that I will never have to use most of the information, because it only deals with the problems, not the pleasures.

First of all, it is very technical &amp; difficult/unpleasant to read. Second, it has pictures of women after childbirth with like several feet of hanging extra skin -- not something I needed to see when I was emotional and pregnant with two. It also had the most negative, scary tone. It seemed to tell you all of the things that could go WRONG and very little of what could go right. Let me tell you, from a woman who has been there -- it can go beautifully &amp; without incident -- &amp; not everyone ends up with miles of extra skin on their stomachs. If you buy this book while pregnant, it will only serve to scare the wits out of you. Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere for good information!"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book was originally written in 1980 and, although a few chapters were added in 1991, it still reads like the early 80s - a time when a woman really could &quot;fail&quot; childbirth! If you are looking for an excuse to gain 50-60 (or even 70!) lbs or an excuse to never drink another glass of milk (according to the author, the idea that milk is good for you is just a myth propagated by the highly government subsidized dairy farmers), then this book could be for you. On the other hand, if you're on bedrest, considering using an epidural or even (gasp) a c-section, this book will try to make you feel bad about it.Then there are the chapters about the long term psychological effect of having to share a womb. If you believe, as the author does, that you can remember back to the day you implanted as a little embryo in your mothers womb, then you might think there's something to this. I just had to laugh.The author cites a lot of conflicting studies about twins and draws whatever conclusions she wants from them. All in all, I didn't get any of the practical advise I was looking for."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book, should be required reading for a multiple-birth pregnancy. Noble assumes you're looking for detailed information, and provides it. Unfortunately, having an unexpected multiple-birth pregnancy IS scary, and I don't think a chapter on death is out of place--particularly now that women are having higher-order multiples. I was actually grateful to read about other women who weren't especially thrilled to find out they were having twins. (Of course, many women who were absolutely thrilled were also included in the book.) It's a hard happiness for many women. Finding out other people had difficulty accepting the news helped me a great deal.Noble's view on sea vegetables might seem a little weird, especially for people who've never traveled. Surprise--people are finding out that the &quot;traditional&quot; American diet may not be the healthiest, especially for a pregnant woman. I live in a rural area and wasn't able to get sea vegetables, but if you're sick of milk and cottage cheese, you'll try anything. The calcium requirements for a mother carrying multiples are amazing. She also is a great person to read if you feel pressured into &quot;not eating&quot; during pregnancy for fear of gaining too much weight. The health of the babies is what's paramount, and she does a great job of supporting women. Doctors in America are much more likely to do c-sections for multiples --that's a proven fact, and it's also been proven that might not be neccessary. The more informed you are, the better your choices. Get this book if you only buy one multiple-birth book--it's the most complete."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"My midwife advised us to get this book as soon as we found out we were expecting twins. I am a Lactation Consultant and already had it as a reference for clients.I found the information to be extremly truthful and very informative. I too followed their advice on nutrition as also advised by my midwife. It was difficult to consume so many calories and protein but I did it for the health of my babies and myself.While reading this book I found out why I was experiencing all these different things with my body that I never experienced with my other 4 births and pregnancies. I also was very prepared and informed of all the things to expect with multiples.Between my midwife and this book I felt totally confident and positive about my pregnancy and birth. Without it I would have been in the dark and frightened!I ended up delivering vaginally and totally natural at 39 weeks and 4 days. My b/g twins weighed 7lbs 14oz and 7lbs 15 oz. I never had any problems the whole pregnacy (absolutely NO BEDREST) and my babies stayed with me the whole time and went home with me. If I did not have such great resources the outcome may have not turned out so great!"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I bought this book back in 1991 when it was just published, and I was pregnant with twins. My twins are now 9 years old, and I have not seen a book since then that is as informative and emotionally holistic as Elizabeth Noble's HAVING TWINS. I followed her advice for weight gain and protein intake as well as whatever other advice I was able to accomodate. My twins were born 1 week AFTER their due date and 7 lbs 2oz and 7 lbs 4 oz. I guess you could say it really worked!I felt the chapter on the death of a twin was completely appropriate. I appreciated being able to talk about that possibility and make plans for &quot;what if.&quot; The chapter is tastefully written with deep respect for the reader. I found it extremely moving and useful.I am just about to buy this book and give it to a friend of mine who is pregnant with triplets - super twins. If I had been able to find a better book, I would have bought it, but the writing and advice in Elizabeth Noble's book is as good today as it was 9 years ago when I bought it for myself."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"A refreshingly non-bubbly book full of detailed medical and statistical information, but is it all nonsense?The references to astrology are the first tip (pg 9, 10, 36.) The inability to distinguish correlation from causality is the next (castor oil preventing hare lip, pg 183.) But the worst is the entire chapter on fetal memories, recovered with the aid of hypnotic or primal therapy. The author remembers knowing about, while still a fetus, not just the death of her sibling, but the death of her theoretical twin, whose existence is unsupported by any other evidence.On top of this are the obvious errors: 15,000 diaper changes in the first year (pg 55), mislabeled graphs which contradict the text (pg 90), presenting only a study contradicted by the bulk of the medical literature on the miscarriage rates from amniocentesis (pg 166).Given the new age nonsense, the lack of understanding of what constitutes scientific proof, and the fact that the book is dated (revised in 1991, there is no mention of the triple screen AFP test), it is impossible to evaluate the author's much more reasonable sounding advice on topics like diet."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I bought this book when I found out I was having twins in 1997. The chapter on Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome scared me to death and I skipped over the information on loss and planning after the loss. I SHOULDN'T HAVE! We lost our twins to TTTS on 7-4-97 and I then went back to the chapters I had skipped and found very useful information that I wished I had taken the time to read before our loss. Not all parents have successful twin or higher pregnancies and the media tends to 'glamorize' the successful ones while the rest of us are left to wonder if we made the right decisions or not. More needs to be available to the parents who are struggling daily to save their babies. Not all multiple pregnancies end with two or more healthy beautiful babies to bring home. But these babies do matter and do affect many, many lives and are NEVER forgotten by the families that lose them."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I was startled by those who rated this book so poorly simply because it covered the negative aspects of carrying twins. For those of you who had a rosy experience carrying your twins, BRAVO! However, in many instances, there are terrible things that can occur, and do. That is why a multiple gestation is considered such high risk. If you are not interested in reading the negative aspects, skip those parts. I lost my twins at 36 weeks and searched for any and all information I could find. I was thankful to have a resource so complete. This book could leave out all of that information, but how helpful would that be? The author would be negligent in not reporting all the facts, regardless of whether or not it's what I want to hear. It offers a comprehensive, useful tool for those facing a twin pregnancy."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I found this book to be extremely informative on the many issues a twin mom-to-be needs to be aware of that a singleton mom-to-be does not. There were areas that did not apply to my pregnancy, but to have the information available was invaluable.As someone who had an &quot;event free&quot; pregnancy... all the way until my 28th week, I was able to focus until that point on all the exciting things happening (and not happening) to my body and those of my babies. When the unexpected and unexplained happened during a routine ultrasound, the discovery that one of my twins had died, I found the section on the loss of one twin to be an invaluable resource. When I had subsequent bedrest, preterm labor, tocolytics, then was able to deliver both babies naturally 8 weeks later, this book continued to keep me informed. This book was something I could turn to during each of the very different stages of my pregnancy. I strongly recommend it. And I attest the health of my surviving twin to the teamwork between myself, my OB and my perinatologist. I would not have been such an educated patient, able to participate in my and my surviving daughters care, without this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"As a mom of triplets and a childbirth educator who works with multiples I suggest this book for all expected parents. The simple truth is that most OBs don't tell couples what they really need to know. I think couples need to be able to make informed choices and to do that they need ALL information. They need information about nutrition, lifestyle, bedrest, preterm labor and the drugs that are used to try and stop it, and about how important state of mind is in every pregnancy. I believe Elizabeth has one of the most honest books about multiple pregnancy. She has good information about nutrition and the work Dr. Brewer has done in the field. She gives accurate informtion on the side effects of most preterm labor drugs and she gives moms the information they need to make it to term. It isn't bad to question authority it is healthy. Be pro-active in your pregnancy your babies will thank you."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"When I was having twins, this book was my bible. I loved it! I found it to be very informative. While I had a wonderful obstetrician in attendance, it was nice to have something to fill in the blanks when he was not available. Being inquisitive by nature, this book fit the bill. I read it from cover to cover. I found it to have a common sense approach to the process of having twins.I tended to follow its advice and found it very reassuring. Its dietary recommendations were sound. I followed them, as they were not inconsistent with my doctor's own. I felt good throughout my pregnancy and was very happy to be having twins. When they were born, my son weighed in at 7 lbs. 2 oz., and my daughter weighed in at 6 lbs. 6 oz.The book really gives one all the information about having twins that one could ever want: the good, the bad, and the ugly. It is a reality based book. Were my daughter having twins, I would give her a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"The best book available for keeping a positive attitude about having and delivering full-term healthy babies. I credit the excellent health of my twin girl (8 pounds 3 ounces) and twin boy (8 pounds 13 ounces) to the information in this book.The &quot;In Utero&quot; chapter was not my style; it was a bit &quot;out there&quot;. Overall, this book was what helped me feel that I could achieve my goal - to have two beautiful, healthy babies (and no C-section!)."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I read this book right after I found out that I was having twins. Although I was a little concerned about the financial aspects of having two children, I was very positive about having twins. This book absolutely scared me! Doom, gloom, and more doom! After reading it, I thought that I would end up on bedrest early, that my twins would end up in NICU for months, and that all sorts of problems would come up. My husband and I later attended a childbirth class for multiple births and one of the first things that the instructor told us was to NOT read this book. There are so many other books out there that do tell you the risks and the problems, but manage to stay positive. Incidentally, I never was put on bedrest, my girls were born at 36 weeks, they spent one night in NICU and came home with me three days later. Believe me, from talking to other moms of twins and my own experiences, this is much more common than this book would make you believe."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book met my need for information regarding vaginal birth of multiples, in my case triplets. There are almost NO books available with the same depth of coverage. If you ask around, you will find that many people think vaginal delivery of multiples is too risky or downright negligent. I was very encouraged by the chapter on \\"SuperTwins\\" and went on to deliver vaginally at 34 weeks. My boys were healthy but did stay in NICU for a month. E. Noble's info prepared me, though I must say, I didn't read all of it. I particularly skipped the chapter on fetal memories. I think there are books out there that will meet whatever informational need you have. It is obvious from the reviews that this book isn't for everyone. I bought this book when I thought I was expecting twins."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Noble's book provides information on everything and anything that you would ever need to know about having multiples.

Had to laugh at some things in this book. Please go with a newer version from this century:-)"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome, along the lines of, \\"when not even one of the triplets lived, I went out and got drunk,\\" and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that I was quite stressed and anxious when in fact, my twins were born naturally, five days before the predicted due date, had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about, and were in excellent health. In fact, I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition, the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby. So, unless you like being scared, I recommend against buying this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I was looking for a comprehensive, layman terms guide that I can refer to in anticipation of the birth of my twins. This books wasn't it. Its seems as if the author forgot her audience, parents that do not have time to completely comprehend each and every detailed paragraph of a page. Extremely busy/expectant/multitasking parents are the norm - they are looking for bite sized data that they can learn from - quickly. Hoping this author takes to heart this feedback and revisits what could be a valuable resource."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"As a childbirth educator I have reviewed numerous books on birth and can only strongly recommend this book for my students/clients carrying multiples. While every other developed country in the world knows the benefits of hormone-free meats and animal products and evidence-based maternity care, we Americans still suffer under our unrestrained capitalistic model of care. Yes, the author, Eliz. Noble, recommends organic and natural foods and yes, vegetarianism. Food corporations began giving them to animals in the 70's--not for our benefit--but for their's. Faster growth and more production. The American Cancer Society recognizes that vegetarianism is the most effective way to avoid most cancers. But Noble says if vegetarianism isn't for you--go organic. It is also the TRUTH that our bodies have not changed in the last 35 years, but how OBs treat women certainly have. What mainstream Americans consider \\"in their best interest\\" advice from their OBs is often actually \\"liability-risk care\\" and not \\"evidence-based care\\". Noble cites studies and evidence-based care and this is simply too difficult for most mainstream Americans to hear. That's why, out of the 26 placings of developed countries, we rank #25 in maternal mortality and #21 in infant mortality. That's bad, very, very, very bad. For the truth that other developed countries know, read this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I HAD TWINS IN MAY OF 99.

Since this is my first pregnancy and it's with twins, I was hoping for information about what to expect and what makes this experience different. While the book has some good information, it's very negative and spends a great deal of time talking about the risks of a multiple pregnancy and the odds of one dying."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"My favorite part of the book was the story about a woman who carried unsuspected triplets to full term, with no drugs, no C-section, at home, with midwives. The book is overall so interesting that I've read it from cover to cover several times. It is encouraging, particularly in its assertion that with proper nutrition and care, &quot;routine&quot; C-sections, episiotomies, and premature deliveries can be avoided altogether. I recommend it even for mothers of singletons!"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book was very disturbing to me -- most notably in its judgmental tone. One very offensive statement: The author actually asserts that miscarriages often result from the mother's ambivalence about being pregnant. Anyone who has been close to anyone who has had the misfortune to lose a much-wanted pregnany can understand how potentially damaging and hurtful such an assertion can be. The book also discourages anything but a vegetarian diet, when research actually suggests that even vegetarian moms of multiples should consider supplementing their diet with red meat, given the special challenges of properly nourishing multiples. Being pregnant with twins is stressful enough without reading such ill-informed nonsense. If readers are looking for a book that provides great information on multiple pregnancies, as well as helpful suggestions for how to contribute to a healthy pregnancy, I suggest that they turn to Barbara Luke's book on &quot;When You're Expecting Twins ...&quot; instead."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I bought this book because it seemed to be highly regarded by other parents of multiples. However, I have been disappointed in the overall content. While Elizabeth Noble does a fine job of pointing out that carrying and delivering multiples is often risky (which I knew -- that's why I wanted a book!), she inserts a lot of personal bias and commentary into passages that are presumably meant to be factual/informational. Those of us who are not strongly interested in an organic, vegetarian/vegan diet, and those of us who are NOT REMOTELY interested in childbirth without pain meds, might find the tone of the book off-putting.The many cross-references could be valuable resources for the reader, but the references and information do tend to be older. The first edition of the book was published in the early 1980s; subsequent editing has not addressed Ms. Noble's reliance on studies from the 1970s. Without more recent information on twin mortality and complications, it is difficult for the reader to determine what is REALLY worrisome or advisable.My biggest concern about this book is its focus on all the things that could go wrong. It's true that expectant mothers need to be informed, but we also need to be supported and reminded that the vast majority of twin pregnancies result in two perfectly healthy babies. FWIW, *most* resources that I've seen focus on the scary side -- but the fact that they all do it doesn't make it ideal.I plan to buy another, more recent book to get me (and my babies!) through my twin pregnancy."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Finding out I was pregnant with twins was moving, exciting, shocking and scary. I wanted a book that would help me understand how my pregnancy would be different to a singleton pregnancy, what to expect and some guidelines on how to look after myself. Although the book was informative and I loved the little comments made my mothers of multiples in the borders I didn't feel satisfied. I was more worried than before as the book goes into so much detail about the loss of a twin (this was the majority of a book) and premature labor. It started out good explaining the types of multiples and how common they are (or not) was interesting but there were very few pictures and I found it to be quite long winded. I must say that although this book was informative I felt more worried and anxious for my twins after reading it than before and was left still not knowing what to expect during my pregnancy."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I found out at 18 weeks that I was having twins. An incredible surprise that I still have not gotten over. I received this book as a gift and read it almost cover to cover. I found it to be very practical, helpful, supportive and generally very easy to read. It explained in detail what to expect and how it all works. I learned a great deal and feel a little more comfortable about having two babies at once. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a little extra help."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"The first thing to buy after the doctor says...&quot;I think I can hear another heartbeat!&quot; Twin pregnancies ARE different, and as a recent twin Mom, I relied on it from beginning to end of my pregnancy...right to 38 weeks, with over 14 pounds of combined birthweights. It's a great book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I agree that many sections of this book are out of date and that some of the material can be scary but for those of us who experienced difficult twin pregnancies it was a great resource. I found this to be the only book that described in detail the complications I experienced and medical solutions to those problems. I felt comforted to read about my situation and read botht he positive and negative outcomes so that I was prepared. If you have and uncomplicated pregnacy I would not recomend the book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This is an excellent book which covers all aspects of twin pregnancy and birth. Ms. Noble provides clear, much needed information on the joys and risks of multiple birth pregnancy. During my twin pregnancy this book helped me to be aware of the potential difficulties I could face and helped me to seek out good medical care when there were difficulties. Ms. Noble presents the information on the loss of a multiple in a compassionate manner. When one of my babies died, this book was the only resource I had which helped me to contact organizations which were a lifeline for me after the loss. THANK YOU!!!"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"If an expectant multiple mom read nothing else but this book, she would have the information she needed to have a happy, healthy, FULL-TERM multiple pregnancy. Multiple pregnancies ARE different, and that is what this book is all about. As a childbirth educator and doula, I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parents Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Wow! This book has certainly aroused a lot of strong feeling! I feel very lucky to have found it early in my pregnancy almost nine years ago. I credit the book, as did another reviewer, with having full-term babies who were both over 8 pounds, with feeling good about labor even though I did end up with a (very well-handled) c-section, and with having no separation from my babies throughout their birth and our time in the hospital. While I didn't agree with everything in this book, I never agree 100% with anyone, so that didn't bother me. The most important and helpful thing about Elizabeth Noble's book is that it doesn't whitewash the many intense feelings and struggles that twin pregnancy brings--of course I can't speak for everyone, but Ms. Noble's candid explorations really resonated with me. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to love two at once, and I still think that babies do better coming one at a time, even though having and being twins has its magical side. I'm a proponent of attachment parenting, and I know how hard it is to fill two babies' needs for touch, attention, and attunement if there's only one of you! Anyway, I urge those who want to explore the full nature of their feelings about having twins, and who want to avoid unnecessary interventions and separations from their babies, to read this book and see for themselves how they feel about it! For myself, I say, &quot;Thank you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Silver Threads, Golden Needles (Magical Love)","review":"V.T. Murdock III beat up his spouse before leaving her to die. Somehow, Lynn recovered and fled knowing the next time she could be dead. Lynn opens up an underground railroad for abused women while using a magical golden needle to stitch quilts that bring comfort to troubled people.Lynn's world shatters when Grant Major arrives looking for his runaway sister Betts. He confronts Lynn, demanding she give him his sibling to take home because Betts is under a doctor's care and has pulled this vanishing stunt in the past. He fears for her safety. Inadvertently, Grant has brought Murdock back into the picture, as he and V.T. may become business partners. Now Grant has to protect more than just his sibling this time, as he and Lynn begin to fall in love perhaps with her healing quilts giving the duo an edge.SILVER THREADS, GOLDEN NEEDLES is a warm magical romance that centers on two themes: everyone needs loves and hugs, and the impact of spousal abuse. The story line is cleverly conceived so that the reader can feel the pain and fear of the victims while also observing the uplifting romance between the lead characters. What keeps the plot from becoming maudlin is Grant, a compassionate person who goes the extra meter to take care of people he cherishes. Paula McKinley must have used a golden word processor to write this winner.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Silver Threads, Golden Needles (Magical Love)","review":"I FOUND THIS BOOK INTRESTING BUT I NEEDED TO GO INTO MORE DEPTH.

Overall, the book gives the feeling that you are sitting with an old salt discussing sailing. In many instances, drawings in the book have been made from photographs or museum pieces, I would have preferred to see the detail of the photograph rather than a simpler and less accurate drawing. It has some facts on ship life and fittings that I have found no where else, however, it left me wanting more than it could provide. For those interested in finding out a little about the topic (those looking for a primer) this is a nice book with interesting drawings and anecdotal references.

The notion of anyone profiting from Sept. 11th, whether by money or publicity, was abhorrent to me.I have to admit, though, that I couldn't put the thing down! There are some gems in this collection, many from writers I've never heard of but will certainly be looking out for in the future. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this book turns out to be a collector's item in 20 years when some of the younger writers have made some headway onto the literary map (there are already some big names in here like Jeanette Winterson and Phillip Lopate).If you don't have the time or the patience to read the whole book (there are about 60 stories in all), I'd suggest at least reading these (I'm referring to my dog-eared personal favorites):In the Before section, stories by:-Leelila Strogov-Jim Merlis-Maura Kelly-Snooder Greenberg-Luc Sante-Michael Cunningham-Thomas Beller-Josh Kramer-Sabin Streeter-Josh GilbertIn the After section, stories by:-Debra Fontaine-Charles Waters-Bryan Charles-Sam Lipsyte-Elizabeth Grove-Amy Brill-Vince Passaro-Dorothy Spears-Joseph LieberAll in all, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in important, moving, funny, and of course also very sad NY stories, as well as a cross-section of some very fine writing."},{"Title":"Before & After: Stories from New York","review":"\\"New York Before and After\\" is an excellent reflection of American responses to the September 11th attacks in both the public and the private sphere.From a public perspective, this book is one of many examples of the rampant opportunism that followed the attacks. Most of the post-9/11 opportunism was political and included legislation that provided yet more tax cuts for the wealthy, and a catastrophically expensive missile defense program that has never worked. It was also apparent, in the culture industry, as evidenced by the eruption of countless obnoxious benefits, and the verbiage of irrelevant news personalities who had suddenly come to believe that their bland polemics meant something.From a private perspective, this book beautifully exemplifies the rapid retreat that most of us made from any sustained analysis of what made 9/11 possible. For about 48 hours after the attacks, we Americans appeared to have woken up from the slumber of mass consumption and entitlement, and actually begun to take a good hard look at how the rest of the world viewed us and how are government actually works. But old habits die hard, and in the case of 9/11 they arose from the grave in a matter of days.\\"New York Before and After\\" is a marvelous confluence of both these phenomena. Firstly, some writers made up for in ambition what they lacked in talent and used 9/11 to pump stories from their Web site into publication. A few of these stories are good and most of them are not. Without the collapse of the World Trade Center, it is doubtful they would have been published. Secondly, these writers both performed and perpetuated the collective national sin of focusing on the drama while avoiding any meaningful examination of events. Some of the writers in this collection are smart enough and talented enough to have produced a meaningful and relevant examination of events, but of course that was not the purpose of this book. Publication and the perpetuation of collective self-pity were both its purpose and result."},{"Title":"Before & After: Stories from New York","review":"I may not be the most objective reader in the world as I have lived in New York for the last 8 years and saw the World Trade Centers on fire myself as I was being evacuated out of downtown Manhattan. But I found this book to be incredibly moving.I was mainly interested in reading the 9/11/01 accounts and wasn't even sure if I would be interested in the &quot;Before&quot; section. But I was pleasantly surprised. The stories are a collection of everything from the humorous to the bittersweet to the ugly. The wide variety of characters span from every walk of New York life. Some people I felt could have been written by my best friends in New York. Some stories I could relate to through my own experiences.The &quot;After&quot; section was grippingly real and heartbreaking. There is one story of a man who survived escaping from the Twin Towers, which is so detailed that I felt as if I was reliving the day as I read it, tears coming to my eyes. This section is also varied, getting different perspectives on what happened and how to deal with the aftermath. I work four blocks away from Ground Zero. There is rarely a day when 9/11 does not come into my thoughts. It is a comfort to read these stories and know that New Yorkers are all suffering in their own ways."},{"Title":"Before & After: Stories from New York","review":"In this excellent collection of New York stories, Bryan Charles's is the standout by far. He describes how a mundane morning at work turned into a nightmare. If you want to know what it was like to be there, this is the story to read. The account of his escape from the Towers will make your heart pound. As time passes and this event takes on even greater historical importance, accademics and general readers alike will look to this story as the primary account of what happened in New York on 9/11."},{"Title":"Before & After: Stories from New York","review":"This is a book that shouldn't be missed. These stories are original, funny, smart, lovely, heartbreaking and real. Way to go, Thomas Beller. It's good to see editors who go out of their way to pay attention to the voices of their generation."},{"Title":"Before & After: Stories from New York","review":"This is a book that should be read if you are interested in people. This is a book not so much about a city, but about the diverse people who make up the city.The stories are drawn largely from Tom Beller's excellent literary website, Mr. Beller's Neighborhood. Some of the stories are by professional writers, others are not. So naturally the writing styles and quality differ from story to story. Over all, the qualty is very good indeed.The book is divided into two parts, part one has stories written before 9/11. The stories here are from people who are proud to live in and be a part of the city. The people who write and appear in these stories are not the cold unfeeling people that New Yorkers supposedly are. They are very warm, flesh and blood people, all too human, even in their occasional flashes of arrogance.The second part is made up of stories that take place on 9/11 and after. The stories reflect people who are hurting, who have witnessed horrible things, who are trying to cope and understand what has happened to them and their city. But these people are still proud to be New Yorkers, even in the depth of their agony.This is a small book, but the stories in it are great indeed."},{"Title":"Before & After: Stories from New York","review":"Drawn from the innovative website, Mr. Bellers Neighborhood, the stories capture the small details and the overwhelming environment of New York. Over fifty (very) short non-fiction stories reveal the intricate human relationships and connection with a city that can be highly impersonal or incredibly involving. The 'before' section goes back decades with author's observations and reflections on personal moments in time. New York in the 1970's has always been a fascinating period for me so I absorbed the related stories with relish. The standouts in this half of the book are The Tomkins Square Park Riot, Old Boilers and Old Men, Tom's Restaurant, and The Turtles in Central Park (I remember hearing about the turtle phenomena!). The pivot point is 9-11. The 'after' half captures the impact of the event and each story is gut-wrenching, emotive, and still surreal. This is an interesting compilation and a fine contribution to the history of New York. On a strange side note, I read the book while visiting my hometown of Winnipeg where coincidentally the book was printed."},{"Title":"Before & After: Stories from New York","review":"There's something creepy about how this group of self-indulged, narcissistic writers found a way to use a great big crisis for their good-- a great way to get published. Besides just a few entries, most of the stories are not so special, beyond looking at how the attack affected themselves. Beller has always been more of a creature of ambition than true talent-- someone with a voracious appetite for taking the limelight, coming on to the scene, exploiting what can be made out to be \\"Hip\\"...even if it's Sept 11."},{"Title":"Essential Winlnet: Developing Applications Using the Windows Internet API with RAS, ISAPI, ASP, and COM","review":"Very good book if you want to start developing with WinInet.

And I agree with the other reviewers that it may be the best book on WinInet (isn't it the ONLY book?), can be used as a reference guide, and the asynchronous section was insightful.However, for a developer who is trying to take these APIs in a new direction (really do some hard-core ATL with C++) with COM, I found the book a bit lacking. [Admittedly, this book was focused on applications, not objects]. I needed more information about creating UI-less COM objects and perhaps I was looking for this book to do more than it claims. For example, the pre-IE5 WinInet API set doesn't support UNICODE and that information is key to C++ COM developers.Definitive Guide? Not quite.If you're looking to do some hard-core COM development with WinInet, I'd stick with the WinInet Reference on Microsoft's site, grab a good ATL reference and go from there (espeically if you're someone who can pick up a new, relatively small API set quickly. There's really nothing to WinInet).If you're just using VB to create your COM objects or application, then this book is a good resource."},{"Title":"Essential Winlnet: Developing Applications Using the Windows Internet API with RAS, ISAPI, ASP, and COM","review":"Aaron Skonnard has accomplished quite a feat - he actually explained the intricacies of the WinInet API in a very understandable manner.He showed not only the practical use of the API, but the underlying implementation; he explained the various protocols (HTTP, FTP and Gopher) well and the WinInet implementations of them. He discussed both the client and server side of the WinInet API and gave a great networking primer for anyone new to networking.There have been several books that touched upon the WinInet API, but only dedicated a couple chapters to it.

The book talks about Windows 95 and NT 4, but more importantly, it talks about IE 4, which is the foundation of IE 5 and 6. I think the WinInet functionality began w/ IE4 and has not changed much, if at all.The book does illustrate all examples in C++; however, there are enough non-language-specific *explanations* throughout the book to give it some value to everyone--I say this mainly because there are no other books on WinInet, at present, and clear explanations are not easily found on the Web. I know C++ so I cannot say how easy or hard it is to follow the examples if you don't know C++.I'd love to see a newer book on this topic that would cover VB/C# .Net and IE 6, but until then, this book is my primary source for WinInet info."},{"Title":"Essential Winlnet: Developing Applications Using the Windows Internet API with RAS, ISAPI, ASP, and COM","review":"If you know something about WinInet already, don't expect to learn new low-level tidbits or tricks.

It greatly pains me to write a poor review for one of his books. Quite frankly, however, The Grand Crusade stinks! At the risk of spoiling the novel I pose this question: Why &quot;kill off&quot; the most likable character of the series and then bring him back as an animated slab of lava? Another question: Is it really necessary to include the romance scenes between the old man and the hot twenty-something? It was sick enough to make me put the book down and watch &quot;Simpsons&quot; reruns. Worst Series Ending Ever!"},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"I first started reading Stackpole around the time his fourth X-Wing novel, Bacta War, hit stands and I've been entranced ever since. He's been my favorite author for years. I've gone back and read Talion:Revenant, Once a Hero, A Hero Born, the Battletech novels - anything I could get my hands on. I've never had reason to look back or to doubt that a Stackpole book would be enjoyable. However, as Stackpole's books roll out, I find that I keep feeling his talent is regressing. He has grand ideas that fall short of the vision. In short, I felt that the Dark Glory War was his best novel of this series and The Grand Crusade his worst. I felt hardly any affinity for the characters. Crow or Tarant Hawke seemed to lose the virtues that I enjoyed in him. Instead he became a two dimensional character: love Alexia, kill bad guys. The other characters seemed to feel the same way, with the worthy exception of Resolute. Resolute seemed to thrive in this novel. Perhaps this is because Resolute has always been melodramatic, so his human side seemed that much better. The reincarnation of the Norrington was, unfortunately for me, I very big let down.In all, I felt like the story had great potential, despite my reservations about the Norrington, but it lacked the development, vitality, or the rapport I needed to grab onto this novel. Take this review for what it is. I'm still waiting for the next Stackpole novel with high hopes (the new trilogy he's working on). And hopefully, his mystery novel will be released at some point. Peace."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"I've never read Michael Stackpole and was pretty happy with the first book in this series..couldn't wait until the second one came out. Of course, the ending was a bit of a shock (the author's own notes warn about ill will towards him because of it) but I still was hoping the story would pick up a bit of speed and resolve itself in the third installment. What did I find? Ho-Hum...I had to force myself to finish. Nothing is resolved to any satisfactory measure - the most important character is a lump of clay (literally) and the other characters just seem to start fading away. We can't always expect a happy ending, but there didn't even seem to be one at all! A thoroughly disappointing way to spend some hard earned cash. Next time one of his books come out I'll be sure to see if my local library has it first so I at least don't bother spending my own money."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"The Grand Crusade is the final chapter in the The Dragoncrown War Cycle. The previous book suffered from some dreadfully dull passages, and I'm sorry to say the final book has the same problem. Stackpole spends way too much time arranging the pieces for the final conflict, and not enough time making those pieces interesting. The Dragoncrown War Cycle ends up being a series that starts on a high note and then plummets from there.Will Norrington is dead. Will is the man everybody believes was prophesized to be the one who kills Chytrine, the queen of the north and the woman who wants to take over the entire world. Chytrine's armies are raiding the southern lands and the various provinces are fighting each other politically as much as they're fighting her. King Scrainwood of Oriosa, a conniving coward, has made an arrangement with Chytrine in order to protect his kingdom and the seat of his power. General Adrogans has beaten Chytrine in the west, but the rulers of the southern kingdoms fear that he will set up an empire for himself. Paralyzed by politics and fear, it looks like Chytrine has an open invitation to take over everything. Only a few heroes are willing to try and stop her, and they manage to get enough support to raise an army. But all is not what it seems. Is Will really alive, able to fulfill the prophecy? As the southern armies fight for their lives, a new figure may emerge to decide Chytrine's fate.The Grand Crusade does little to live up to its billing, feeling more like a half-hearted skirmish as far as this reader is concerned. I was hoping for a riveting conclusion that would keep me on the edge of my seat, and I kept waiting for it to happen as Stackpole maneuvered everybody into their proper positions. He places the various leaders at the head of their armies, has the expedition to the northlands put together, and makes sure everything's set. Unfortunately, this takes up half the book and I had trouble keeping my eyes open.The main problem is that the prose is very wooden, much more so then I remember the previous books being. Most of the characterization and the dialogue felt forced and unreal. Stackpole, both in his dialogue and in his narrative voice, uses a very annoying technique that just started getting on my nerves, especially when it happened in almost every chapter. He starts to list things. &quot;But he had acquiesced for two reasons.&quot; Then, he goes on to talk about those two reasons. Stackpole does it. His characters do it. I see Stackpole ticking off his fingers as he's writing, if that weren't a physical impossibility requiring three hands. It's a symptom of the entire book, where he's constantly setting things up, describing everything without actually doing anything.It gets worse as Stackpole sets up the battles. Action is one of the things that Stackpole excels at. He can be quite bloody in his descriptions (and when he gets to the battles in The Grand Crusade, he is still quite graphic, so be warned), but everything has a pace and intensity that I just marvel at. He puts the reader down in the middle of the action and you almost find yourself looking behind you to make sure somebody's not coming up to you with a sword ready to skewer you. It's quite effective, and the book has a lot of energy when he writes the combat scenes. However, every time it looks like the battles are about to start, Stackpole starts setting them up again. He shows us countless strategy sessions between the generals, and he has those same generals brood on those strategies some more before finally executing them (many times listing the various things that could go wrong).Don't get me wrong. I'm not an action junkie, needing the blood and guts to make a book good. However, the non-combat part of the book has to be interesting, or give me the battles! I found that I barely cared about any of the characters, including characters who I had cared about in the previous books. On the positive side, I didn't find any of the characters annoying, which is a step up for a couple of them (Kerrigan and Isaura). Ultimately, I found that the battles were the only interesting things in the book, and I found myself getting annoyed when each battle would end and more strategizing happened.While the battles themselves were wonderfully done, I found that the results of them too often had convenient resolutions, as somebody comes in and saves the day. One battle has General Adrogans come from very far away and arrive at the perfect time to do what's necessary to turn the tide. While he knows that the war is happening there, he has no idea what the exact situation is. He's just going to help as best he can, and he just happens to get there where he can make the biggest difference. So many of the battles begin with our heroes acknowledging that they are in an almost impossible situation, and that even if they prevail they're going to lose a lot of soldiers. However, most of the time they don't have to deal with that because something else happens.Ultimately, if it wasn't for the battle scenes, this book would be the bottom of the barrel. As it is, it's close. I've seen so much better from Stackpole, and the series started out so wonderfully. I didn't realize that I was already at the top when I started it. If this wasn't the final book of the series, there's no way I would have finished it. Avoid it if at all possible.David Roy"},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"'The Grand Crusade' is the last book of DragonCrown War series. I loved the pace of the book, because it is as fast-paced as the other reviewers have mentioned. Still, the whole nature of the Norrington prophecy was not fully explained to my liking. Nor was Kerrigan Reese esteemed even half as much as Will. I did not feel as drawn to Will as I was to the character of Kerrigan Reese throughout the whole series. We see Will having a one night fling with the Princess, and people considered that to be love. Yet, there was love and that was solely found with Alexia and Crow. Plus, a more thorough explanation and psychological profile of Chytrine would have thoroughly boosted the book. So, these are my main criticisms about the series in general and the book in specific."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"Wow, yet another powerful effort from Michael Stackpole. I have read every one of his books, and this easily stands at or near the top in terms of quality.The Dragoncrown war continues to rage, with all the devious machinations and backbiting and infighting that Stackpole is so adept at writing. Secret societies, clandestine meetings and political posturing contribute significantly to this book, as in the previous three in this world of Stackpole's creation.In the north, a gifted general, Adrogans, had won a great but surprisingly easy victory in the previous book. Now, some of the results of that swift conquest conspire to turn the assembled nobles of the many kingdoms against him due to fostered suspicion. In the south, the gifted young woman, Alexia, who from birth was trained to lead armies, is forced to confront experienced leaders in a concerted effort to drive the enemies from the southland. She is accompanied by a number of remarkable companions, including her lover, Tarrant Hawkins, a disgraced hero of old, are the champions united to lead the forces of the south. The young wizard, Kerrigan, who had been as much a liability as a boon comes into his own, facing and passing a number of challenges beyond the ken of any but him. The determined Vorquelf, Resolute, leads a separate band to the north to infiltrate the lair of the evil queen of the north and end her threat forever. Paramount among his goals is the redemption of his homeland, conquered and defaced by the queen and her minions for over a century.At no point in this book did the story seem to slow. Stackpole weaves romance, humor, action, and intrigue so well that I simply could not put down the book, and it was done before I realized it! There are many developments which were foreshadowed, though the manifestation of some events was unexpected. The characterization is excellent, with some characters being truly respectable, and others simply deserving hatred. Stackpole has really come into his own in the creation and development of his own world. You will not be disappointed in reading this book! Even the population of spelling and punctuation errors typically so rife in first editions these days is a vast improvement over other recent books."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"I went through this book in less than 24 hours, which is faster than I went through the trilogy's second book, When Dragons Rage. This book was an excellent read -- I found it very hard to put down. I was connected so deeply with the characters in the whole trilogy, it was very important to me to find out what happens to them in the end, which was extraordinary. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes fantasy at all -- or anyone who has recently seen the Lord of the Rings films. The tale of adventure and love and loss and courage and dedication and loyalty and devotion is just so universal -- it is rare that you find a series that explores all of these things at once, in addition to larger issues. Destiny is at play here, and this book takes a good, hard look at what prophecy really may be, what destiny really might mean. Never have I read a book that deals with the concepts of destiny and prophecy better than this one. Additionally, woven into it all is a love story, and the story of one man who has spent his entire adult life fighting -- and finally finds happiness. The tale is just so rich, I cannot say enough good things about it. It has to be one of the best books -- and the best series -- I've read in my life.Fair warning to everyone, though -- if you thought that the family tree was convoluted to begin with, just wait. It gets even more mixed up. All you can do is sit back and enjoy the ride -- I certainly did."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"The Grand Crusade by Michael Stackpole is the final book in the DragonCrown War Cycle. The first book, which is actually a prelude, isThe Dark Glory War (A Prelude to the DragonCrown War Cycle). The first book in the actual trilogy isFortress Draconis (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 1)and then is followed byWhen Dragons Rage (The Dragoncrown War Cycle, Book 2). I stumbled upon this series based on a recommendation by a friend. After reading The Dark Glory War I immediately ordered the rest of the novels. After finishing the previous three books I was looking forward to reading this novel and seeing how things end up.The plot of this book carries over from the previous book. Chytrine is still terrorizing the lands seeking to rule. The Norrington prophecy is still being bandied about. Kerrigan Reese is still adding knowledge to his already impressive magical repertoire. The political element, and political subterfuge is still present. Added to the mix is the possibility of another Norrington not being born yet and how that affects the prophecy as well as a few unexpected surprises. While I expected most of the plot elements that were included in this novel, I was also expecting to be, at least a little, surprised, at some of them as well. However, when all was said and done and I had finished the novel I realized that the disappointment I felt was not because of the writing itself, but rather that the plot became flat. There was nothing new to really grab my interest. In fact, there seemed to be quite a bit of fluff with this book. From reading the previous books, it's evident that there will be a major war. Yet, the build-up tot hat war and the battles that follow as so long and drawn-out that the battle doesn't matter because the book was barely holding my interest any longer. It pains me to say that, because I did enjoy this series up until this book.The characters, what to say about the characters. If you have read the previous books, you know exactly what you will get from the characters in this book. The only character that really has any significant development is Alexia other than that it seemed as though I was re-reading the previous books. Sure, there are returning characters such as, Kerrigan, Sayce, Resolute, Scrainwood, Chytrine etc, but there is nothing really new about them. Furthermore, they don't really feel as though they are contributing to the story too much. Rather they feel as though they are being dragged around by the story. There are a few instances that it seems that Mr. Stackpole wanted to develop the characters a little, but it comes off as somewhat contrived and uninteresting. The characters that I had come to really enjoy have become uninteresting and two-dimensional cut outs of what they once were and could have been. Some of the dialogue that the characters say left me slack-jawed wondering not only why they said it, but at times what they meant. Unlike previous books, I felt disconnected with the characters and that is disappointing considering all the time I invested in reading this story.Some criticisms about this novel:1 - The build-up to the climatic ending is so long and drawn-out that when it does get to the battle I simply wanted it to be over so I could know what happened. When the end \`battle' did arrive it was so anti-climatic that it almost seemed a mockery of the entire story.2 - There are multiple instances in this novel where the editor was obviously asleep. Missing words, repeated words, phrases that make absolutely no sense and bad dialogue. For a book that is the final installment of a trilogy that has spanned well over 2,000 pages to have this type of mediocrity was disappointing and took something away from the magic of the previous books.3 - The characters. The characters that I had grown rather fond of in the previous books suddenly became uninteresting and flat. Their dialogue was severely lacking any type of emotion; in fact it felt as though they were just going through the motions.4 - The many loose ends and mysteries that had been building up through the previous books were sloppily explained and dealt with. A few of them I was very disappointed in, and a few others I simply could care less about. Regardless, I was disappointed that the ones I did care about were haphazardly tied up and explained.Some things I did enjoy about this novel:1 - The world, as with the previous books, is interesting and detailed perfectly. The layout of the land made sense and the \`rules' of the world also seemed appropriate.2 - I still like Mr. Stackpole's descriptions. He toes the fine line between explaining just enough to the reader so the reader can see his vision, but not too much that the reader is only allowed to see one thing and not use their imagination.As a series, I would most likely recommend these books to fantasy fans who are well versed in the genre and can understand the good and the not so good of this trilogy and take it in stride. In the previous novels, Mr. Stackpole has proven he can write interesting and engaging novels however I would call this novel neither of those things. Besides the things I listed above, I am not really sure what \`went wrong' with this novel, but I can not say I enjoyed it nearly as much as I did the previous books. I was expecting great things from this novel, answering all the questions from the previous books etc. Sadly it simply didn't deliver what I was hoping for. I would not suggest this book to any except those who have read the first three books and really want to know what happens."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"This book should be a lesson to all authors. If you try to do something clever while writing your trilogy, like killing off the most interesting character in the whole book, then you better replace this character with someone or something even MORE interesting. Unfortunately, Michael Stackpole did nothing of the kind in the final installment of his DragonCrown series and the whole epic falls flat in the end.This was very unfortunate, as I really did enjoy the first two books and the third one appeared to be a promising endeavor. Stackpole, however, just went through the motions with this one. Stackpole took a big chance killing off the lead character in the second book and while at the time I thought this was very clever and exciting, it took the whole heart and soul right out of the ensuing novel. This book had nothing to make it the least bit original, interesting or exciting. The final battle scenes were dull, the final confrontation with the ultimate ice queen, who for some unknown reason wishes to rule the whole world, were entirely predictable. The other characters in the novel lost their edge about one-third of the way through and never got it back. Characters such as Kerrigan never fully developed. The whole romance/relationship between Alexia and Crow was not only unbelievable, but repetitive and boring. (Way too many little, \\"I love you!!\\", \\"No, I love you more!!\\" scenes which were very annoying and added nothing to the book.)I was very disappointed in this effort, which seemed to be thrown together in a rush to just get the job done. I know this author can do better. In all fairness to Stackpole, at least he ENDED his fantasy series. Unlike a few authors out there I can mention. That's the reason he gets three stars instead of two. I hope that his future novels fare better."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"I think this is about the best Stackpole book I've yet read. And that's saying quite a lot.For starters, I didn't go back and reread any of the earlier books in the trilogy that this one concludes, so it had been about a year since I last visited the world and characters of the story, but this final book pulled me back into the story pretty well from the start. There were certain events from earlier in the series that were alluded to from time to time, in which I couldn't quite recall all the details of what had happened, but that didn't detract much at all from the new progress of the story in this book. Much more frequent were the events from the last book alluded to in this one, which came quite completely back to memory when they were mentioned, making my enjoyment of this book all the greater by drawing on remembered enjoyment of the previous one.The characters in this DragonCrown trilogy are wonderful, so many different types of people, so well developed, both the heroes and the villains. The plot is great too; the Norrington prophecy and all the developments from it, which drove a large part of the plot, had me making all sorts of guesses of what could happen, yet there were still surprises for me in how it all worked out. And it was a satisfying ending...actually more so the further I get from finishing it. Will's ultimate fate was kind of bittersweet, but maybe better than the various other guesses I'd been making. And as for the &quot;Hawkins Secret&quot; from the prequel, The Dark Glory War, well, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, though similar, but was cool nonetheless, and it was worked into this final book of the series very well. Stackpole's writing style is wonderful to read, the storyline is engaging, the characters and themes were excellent, and overall, I'm very happy with the book and with the series that it concludes. I'd love to see more from the world of this story!"},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"This was probably the best in the trilogy of the DragonCrown War, or whatever you want to call it. I read it in about a day or so, and I have to admit it was great. I am a very big fantasy fan, and can tell you this one is probably not going to get huge notice because it is unrecognized, but it is superb none-the-less. One of the only things that made me unhappy was how he didn't elaborate enough on the world after the war, and the way he played the Norrington prophecy all through. However, I encourage everyone to read this, especially those who have read the previous two."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"The Grand Crusade... first off, it's an accurate title. Michael takes his time reintroducing the characters, and while I understand why writers do that, I'm not convinced it needs to be done in a limited series (this is presumably the last book).As usual, I enjoyed Michael's narrative immensely. The clarity with which he describes not only combat scenes but entire battles is startling, especially since it's easy to read. Possibly the most appreciated element, which Michael uses well, is his inclusion of descriptions of some of the nastier wounds that people take. The kind of thing that makes the reader realize how gory battle really can be.If you're looking for the revival of Will Norrington, don't hold your breath. It's over half-way through the book before the possibility of THE Norrington's return is addressed. While I wasn't addicted to the idea of Will showing up again (Princess Alexia's interpretation of the prophecy matched mine) I had been hoping to see him again. Frankly, I'd grown very fond of the little thief.What Michael did left me feeling as if he were struggling to find a solution. 85% of the book was collimated like a laser, burning away chunks of this tale, revealing to us the glory, hopes and fears of the characters in every chapter. That was consistent with the rest of the series.But that 15% seemed to wander, and to my thinking, detracted from the book, and the grand crusade (apologies, pun intended).Don't take my word for it, though. Read it and rebut. ;)The return of some old friends, and the introduction of some new ones, makes for great moments. Temmer is addressed again, and some background is filled in that explains a lot about Isaura. We get looks at new perspectives, including a few zooms on Chytrine herself, and it does help fill in the whole story.Oddly enough, the epilogue felt a little rushed to me, but I'm a glutton for character resolution. Of course, I wouldn't mind if Michael went on with this world...The Grand Crusade was absolutely that. Even the 15% that I felt wandered a bit wasn't near enough to turn me away or even make me regret the wait.If you liked Timothy Zahn's &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy, The Lord of the Rings movies and/or Dave Duncan's &quot;The Gilded Chain&quot; series, you'll enjoy the Dragon Crown War series.And if you enjoyed the first three books, I doubt anything will keep you away from the last one. All in all, a great read."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"If you liked the other books in the series, you will love this one. Like a couple of the other reviewers, I finished the book in a little over a day. Stackpole simply screams through 75% or 80% of this book, which is both good and bad. Good because the book hardly ever slows down enough to have you wandering when something important will happen again, as is often the case with other writers (like Jordan, where you sit there thinking if I can just finish this page maybe something will happen on the next). The downside is the very little time spend with character resolution, since I am, along with one of the other reviewers, a horrible glutton for. I do have to admit, I am glad we didn't see Will again, I just couldn't bring myself to really like him. But overall this book is great, I really loved it, and hopefully we can look forward to hearing from these characters again."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"Before I satrt I just wanna say I've never really been a &quot;Reader&quot; it just wasn't my thing. I'd rather watch a movie or play a video game. Well one day when i was sitting in an airport Delayed and board out of my mind. I went to the book store in the teminal to get a magazine and saw the book &quot;I, Jedi&quot;. I've always liked the SW movies and games so I thought what the heck so I picked it up and began to read. 3 days later I was done and I loved it. then i began reading stackpole's X wing series and i read 4 within a month. let me remind you I was not a avid reader. Then I saw the onslaught twosome and bought that and Vector prime and I had to choke down VP just so I could get to the great writing of M.A.S. .Then I found out M.A.S. wouldn' be writing anymore SW novels so I looked around I ender up buying Talion:Revenant and I Loved it. THEN I found Dark Glory War. and I read all 4 withing the month. I was spell bound and COULD NOT PUT THEM DOWN. Reading them was like watching a movie in my head. I spent EVERY waking moment in this world. I now Love reading and realize what all those teachers were saying when they said books can take you to other worlds. I cant wait for another Talion or maybe a continuation of this series(fingers crossed). I even told my Brother about them(he's 19) and is even less of a reader than I am and he can't put them down either. I just special ordered Eyes of Silver and cant wait to get it. cause I know I wont be disapointed.WARNING: Only begin this series if you want to be transported to another world. Only read it before bed if you want to be up fore hours thinking about the beauty of this world.I just want to say THanks to Michael A. Stackpole I am now a Avid reader and I will never go back."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"I enjoyed The Dark Glory War, the prequel to this trilogy, a fair amount. That being said, the story took a steady downhill slide from there.It is pure fanboy fantasy, and at it's very worse. These heroes have all the personality of mud. The men are all \\"humble\\" and act completely shocked to find themselves in the roles of heroes. And the women are downright offensive. These strong, proud, independent women, who turn into docile, eager to please slaves when their men look at them. They fall in love with the male protagonists, even though they hardly know them, and the males have few qualities worth falling in love with as it is.The \\"heroes\\" of the books are always going on in the vein of \\"We're heroes, because...\\" as though they're trying to reassure the reader that they really are heroic. Unfortunately, their actions are only heroic through use of something known as Deus Ex Machina. Absolutely nothing they attempt ever fails. With the exception of Fortress Draconis and one small scene in When Dragons Rage, no one ever dies because the heroes made bad choices.In fact, no one ever dies. At least, no one important, and the important ones never stay dead. Oh, a building collapsed on your head? Well, you're still alive! Severely poisoned? Well, not only do you come back to life, but we've convinently burned off those extra three hundred pounds that make you less attractive to the women!The \\"love scenes\\" make you wonder if Mr. Stackpole has even seen a woman. Even romance novelists no longer use the old \\"their tongues entwined\\" crap. It was one of these disgustingly gratuitous scenes that made me shut the third book without even finishing it. The whole trilogy reads as the ultimate fantasy of a guy who could never get a girlfriend. And now he's suddenly the hero, with a hot blonde warrior woman who turns into a vapid nothing when he's around.Go read Lynn Flewelling, Carol Berg, or Mercedes Lackey. THEIR characters won't spend the whole book insisting that they're heroes."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"The first two books in this series, and I'm including the prerquel, were excellent. This book was way to brief. We spent hundreds of pages building up to a final battle that was boring, over way to quickly, and didn't make alot of sense compared to the chain of events seen in the previous novels.The Will dilemna is solved in a very unsatisfactory way as were pretty much all the resolutions. It seemed as if Stackpole thought hey time to end it and just threw something together thtat tied up all loose ends. I didn't feel like the ending was given much thought."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"I read the first two books of the series and thoroughly enjoyed them, but was pretty disappointed with the third book.This book had so much potential, but Stackpole made the mistake of killing off the most interesting and important main character and while I'm sure he did this to shock the reader, it ruined the book.I read the third book to see if by some \\"miracle\\" that the character would be resurrected, but was disappointed. Once that character was taken out of the book, it totally ravaged the trilogy. It took the spirit out of the book. I had to force myself to read the rest of the book and instead of being entertained by the ending, it just left me feeling plain depressed."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"I really didn't expect this much out of this series when i first picked up The Dark Glory War, but with the way Stackpole was able to tie you to the characters and describe with grizzley detail the battle scenes but also the brutal political discussions that decided what the South will do against the avalanche of the North, I found myself enthralled.The 4th book of the series (3rd of the trilogy) doesn't slow down at all. I really enjoyed seeing the transformations that were wrought in certain characters (i.e. Kerrigan), but really didn't understand the incarnation of Will. As one reviewer said that he thought he might have struggled for a way to tie it up, I would have sworn at the end of the third book that Will would come back because of the &quot;Immortal, washed in fire.&quot; I finally found myself liking him while they were in Sarengul. Maybe the note from Crow at the end hints at something more to come. Especially since the problem of the Oromise was never really settled......I interrupt for a moment...But the entire book is great and the series itself has really psuehd high into my book rankings. Jordan's fallen and I wonder if he will even bother picking himself up. If you like the battles in this book Gemmell is a great read (rigante), Martin might be my favorite (Song of Ice and Fire) and for whoever liked the politics discussed in these books, might also hold him in favor.....I continue.....and the war between the Dragons and the Oromise could rage on and again humans, elves, urzrethi, and gyrkyme could be caught in the middle of saving their homes and being pawns of a far larger game."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"Stackpole has continuously put forward remarkable novels. Despite this, he is not given the credit he deserves. I have read Jordan, McCaffrey, and many other popular fantasy writers, and none of them have published anything that compares with Stackpole's best novels (I won't compare him with Tolkein because, quite frankly, you can't beat a legend...you can only become a legend yourself). Stackpole's stories are filled with original plots, characters, and twists; yet draw enough from traditional fantasy(i.e. elves, magic, etc.) to be easily understood by the common fantasy reader. This mix of originality with familiarity is combined with a superb storytelling ability to create books that grab your attention and don't let go until they have guided you through amazing worlds, cultures, politics, characters, and stories.The Grand Crusade in particular is among Stackpole's best. Without giving any major spoilers, I will just say that it brings back some much loved characters from The Dark Glory War, introduces some great new characters, includes more unexpected plot twists than the other books in the series, and still manages to end the Dragoncrown War Cycle remarkably well.Finally, I don't know if he will ever see this, but I would like to thank Michael Stackpole for all of his hard work. He has provided me with years of enjoyable reading.If you are reading this review and have never read Stackpole's work before, then I would recommend you start with either Talion: Revenant or The Dark Glory War."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"I'm a big fan of Stackpole and it pains me to say that this book was a let down. The Dark Glory War was an awesome book and a great way to start the series. The next two books were great as well. However the standards are set so high and what he comes back with is a very anticlimatic ending. The ending is fairly predictable and the descriptions of the battles are probably the worst of any I've ever seen him write. It does hurt the series but the quality of the rest of the books makes the series well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"I was simply amazed by this book. While definitely shorter than the two previous books in the series, Grand Crusade has nothing lacking in depth. As others have noted, characters from the Dark Glory War make a great reappearance, particularly Nay. Long-standing characters like Resolute and kerrigan undergo some surprising changes. For those who detest Scrainwood and the ultra-stuffy magisters of Vilwan, don't worry, they get their just desserts. Some of the revelations about the Hawkins and Norrington family trees are very surprising. My only gripe: it was extremely difficult to keep track of the Dragoncrown fragments, I was never sure which pieces belonged where(except the Fortress Draconis pieces) or who had them. Overall, a masterpiece by Stackpole and i look forward to one day meeting the next generation of heroes."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"The battles rage, betrayal upon betrayal, intrigue within intrigue, the saga moveson to its mighty conclusion. Sort of. THE GRAND CRUSADE is touted as the conclusion to the Dragoncrown War Cycle but to be honest while it is a fine piece of fiction the ending left me feeling like the story was only partly finished. Instead of the fireworks of a grand finale we get the sputtering fizzle of a wet firecracker.After a three book build up the disposition of many of the main characters is left till the epilog, in a rather offhanded and cavalier manner it seems to me. It almost reads like the author came to a certain point, got bored, and says...'this is what happens, THE END.' When finished you may find yourself, as I did, looking back and many of the subplots and wondering just what in the heck they were doing in the story to begin with. Were they just red herrings placed there to distract form the true ending? Maybe foreshadowing for an additional series? Whatever the case it left me feeling rather unsatisfied.I think what make the ending even more disappointing is that up until the ending it really is a fine piece of fiction, a real joy to read. I'll RECOMMEND it but with the warning to the reader that you may feel a bit unfulfilled at the end."},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"Twenty-five years ago, the Southern rulers were more interested in playing petty political games against one other than destroying the Empress Chytrine. Now she has built up her strength and has captured Fortress Draconis, which allows her hordes of the North to capture some of the southern realms. Her army also hunts for the pieces of the Dragon Crown.The council of kings meets in Narriz to decide how to fight Chytrine's forces, a very hard job since she has turned one of the kings into her enslaved creature. She also walks among them using her magic to pass off as one of the royals. The true heroes of the conference are not the rulers. The champions include Princess Alexia, Prince Erlestoke (who is willing to defy his father if it means killing Chytrine), Alexia's lover Kedyn's Crow who has fought the empress for a quarter of a century, the powerful mage Kerrigan, and Resolute the Vorquellyn elf who is determined that his homeland will be returned with the fulfillment of the prophecy. These brave souls are steadfast in their quest to regain the lost lands and put an end to Chytrine's reign of terror.This novel is aptly named as the civilized countries of the South (comparable to the European armies wanting to free Jerusalem from Muslim rule) do their part to try to oust the evil ruler and her minions in Aurolan. The various sub-plots showcasing the many heroes give the reader a feeling that after three books, there will be a final resolution, one that is realistic and satisfying. THE GRAND CRUSADE is epic in scope and will appeal to readers who like larger than life fantasy and sword and sorcery sagas.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Grand Crusade","review":"\\"The Grand Crusade\\" is the third and final novel in The DragonCrown War Cycle series approximately one generation following \\"The Dark Glory War\\" prelude novel. It is an amazing book filled with creative battles, detailed descriptions, and interesting characters.I am pleased with the outcome of the series. The unique powers exhibited by the sullanciri are clever. General Androgans and Kerrigan have impressive displays on the battlefield and in magic respectively. Some important revelations resolve unanswered incidents from earlier volumes but most loose ends are tied up at the conclusion with a slim possibility of a future generation story.The timing of Qwc, an odd character throughout the series, to be at a particular place with a certain individual damages the free will versus fate discussion. The Alexia and Crow romance is nice but I feel the bedroom details could be neglected. The Norrington, whom will challenge Chytrine according to the prophecy, is unusual yet anticlimax compared to other fantasy novel heroes.Characters and countries overwhelmed me by the end of the novel and a glossary would have been worthwhile along with a more detailed map of the significant terrains.I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"A Writer's Workbook: Daily Exercises for the Writing Life","review":"First, I know this review looks too long, but it might help you out. So please, read on.I read a few of the \\"chapters\\" (exercise sections) of this book and found it to be a little too conversational. Sure, we all value a charming and witty instruction book to a dry academic one, but I still think she brings nothing new to this genre of book.It seems like she could easily have gotten all of these ideas from other writing books, seminars and articles, and frankly, most of them are better written than this one. You've probably encountered most of the ideas put forth in this book, beginning with an intro akin to:\\"Oh, we all say we're going to write, but we never get around to it. Well never, fear, because [insert generic writing guide book title] is here to kick your rear in gear!\\"Something like that.There are really so many different types of books, kits, articles, memoirs, classes and manifestos on the subject of writing, exercises, inspiration and so forth. (Just do a search on Amazon for Writing Instruction or Writing for Publication.) I really can't recommend this book, though.Unfortunately, the author also thinks it's cute or somehow necessary to write quite a few words in ALLCAPS to add emphatic notice to the concept. Personally, I think that WRITING like THIS every few PAGES looks unprofessional and can be quite IRRITATING. This stylistic flaw alone makes me wonder whether she's a very credible source. Is font manipulation creative? Sure, to an extent, but \\"all-caps\\" serves no purpose, and it's easy to do and banal.I think that this work misses a point about writing: it requires self-discipline as well as inspiration and talent. It's easy and sometimes fun to get caught up in books like these, but really, if you just read a varity of nonfiction, novels and periodicals for a few hours each week you can begin to understand observational skills, and you won't need these silly little exercises. You'll be inspired by what you read, and how the articles or whatever you read remind you of your own experiences.So, the point is, if you feel that you need to spend money on a book like this, perhaps you don't have the ability to discipline yourself into a steady routine of journaling and writing. Buying a book like this one will allow you to read some tips and eventually forget about it. After brief excitement and productivity, you'll be back to square one; with no self-discipline, you'll never apply this book to your life week-by-week as you should. It will collect dust next to your yoga books.I offer this criticism not to sound nasty, but to make you think about what you are buying.It's simple to buy a Men's Fitness magazine, for instance, but it won't help you unless you actually work out routinely. Same thing.I guess the bottom line is that this book is okay for a casual read, but look it over in a bookstore first to see if you really want to pay the price of owning it.I give it about 2.4 stars."},{"Title":"A Writer's Workbook: Daily Exercises for the Writing Life","review":"This book is a perfect solution for those writers in need of something to write about.Caroline Sharp wrote this book after not writing for a significant period of time.

For the first half of the book, we follow public relations specialist Steve Randall as he travels from place to place meeting various members of the publication team producing a new Bible incorporating these new finds. Unfortunatly, the main reason for these meetings seems to be to allow Wallace to provide his lengthy and detailed exposition in the guise of dialog. The first half of the book is tedious and unexciting, and only when Randall begins to find discrepencies in the new documents does the story begin to improve. Unfortunately, there is too little action for too much of the book, and while the second half is better than the beginning, it takes far too long to get to.This story also reflects the culture of the early 1970's, when it was written. People smoke in hospitals (!), there is no security in the airports, and the furniture and clothing descriptions clearly reflect the period. The story is also set against the cultural questioning of organized religion that also marked the period, and Wallace seems to be arguing that Christianity needed a breath of fresh air to save it from irrelevance. The underlying themes regarding the nature of faith and its role in life are still worth considering. Perhaps the most important question raised by this book is \\"What is the meaning of faith?\\""},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson","review":"The body of work, the writing of John Esten Cooke, is fine. But very disappointing for a couple of reasons. First, the last page of the Appendix is missing. Not only on that missing page does it have the continuence of the previous page, but a footnote from a passage in the first part of the book. Yes, I returned the original that I ordered, with hopes that I just happened to get a &#34;dud&#34;. But no, the replacement was the same. And wanting Cooke's writing, I decided to keep the replacement. Second, & this is very annoying, every other page the print is samll than the previous page. I know this is a reprint of a very old (1866) book, but I'm sure the original wasn't in this &#34;form&#34;. Plus, a portion of one map in cut off.

But, be fore-warned!"},{"Title":"Till The Dreaming's Done: Poems Crafted For Thinking People","review":"A friend of mine just recently let me borrow this book. The first thing that I thought of when skimming through it, was that the poems inside of this book are all about things that I can relate to.Usually, when a person thinks of poems, they think of things like, \\"So shows a snowy dove, drooping with crows; as yonder lady or her fellow's shows...\\" However, there's nothing like that at all along those lines in this book. Till The Dreaming's Done is just good old modern, rhyming poems that us normal folk's out there can relate to and enjoy.Put me down for 5 out of 5 stars..."},{"Title":"Till The Dreaming's Done: Poems Crafted For Thinking People","review":"The cover of this book matches what can be found inside of it so very well. In that, the authors writing \\"encompasses\\" so many different subjects and feelings. He writes about everything - from new love and old lighthouses, to pink sunsets and silver stars.His book is just plain one of a kind, and that's why I myself give it five G O L D stars."},{"Title":"Till The Dreaming's Done: Poems Crafted For Thinking People","review":"What can I say about Till The Dreaming's Done. The poems that are written in this book are like precious gemstones - they gleam with sheer brilliance. Every one is the pinnacle of fine writing and one can only hope that this beautiful book spreads like a brushfire across the world.After reading in Mr. Harley's Foreword that the 1994 movie, The Shawshank Redemption was one of the things that played a powerful impact on his writing, as well as magnetized into many of his poems; that also is one of my favorite all-time films and I couldn't wait to dive into his book. Let's just say, that after reading every single one of his poems and coming across certain ones like \\"Suds on the Roof\\" and \\"Hope\\", the author was not fibbing.So, if you happen to love the ocean, optimism, all things that great dreams are made of, and poems that rhyme like no other, then this book of poetry I believe is by far one of the best...bar none. With that said, I must echo the words of a Mr. Alexander C. Robertson: When is his next book coming out!!"},{"Title":"Till The Dreaming's Done: Poems Crafted For Thinking People","review":"I have known Andrew Harley for a number of years and honestly didn't know how truly amazing his talents were. I knew he was funny and very outgoing, but to read his poetry just reminded me that people have so many different sides to them and that we all are in some sense amazing people. I love the way he has incorportated his beliefs into his writing. If you ever have the chance to get your copy autographed and meet the man behind the poems, you will see what I am talking about. He has several fantastic talents, but I believe with his poetry he has found his niche in life. Just Spectacular and Incredible to say the least.

This young man uses some pretty darn good analogies throughout his poems and seems like he'd be one heck of a fun guy to chat with over a cup of coffee.In conclusion, I do believe that we haven't heard the last of this 20-something poet and I know that I'll be awaiting that second book release from him one day down the road."},{"Title":"Till The Dreaming's Done: Poems Crafted For Thinking People","review":"This author is going to fly to the top.

I LOOK FOR MORE GOOD WORK FROM ANDY IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A mirror for witches","review":"Looking back through the perspective over three hundred years, it seems incredible that so many people could have been caught up in the ignorance and mass hysteria of the Salem witch trials in colonial Massachusetts, but this very fine novel by Esther Forbes (better known for her book for young people, &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot;) is a well-researched and well-written account of the fictional Doll Bilby, rescued in France as a small child after seeing her own parents burned alive as suspected witches, and brought to America by a sympathetic ship captain. The shock of witnessing her parents' horrible deaths wreaks mental and emotional havoc on Doll that sets her up as one of the victims of the Salem witch-hunts. In an era when mental illness was often seen as being possessed by devils, and anyone possessed by demons must therefore be in league with them, Doll doesn't stand a chance. Forbes writes her book in the style of a 17th-century text and evokes both the time and the place so accurately that we feel we have been transported back to colonial times. Forbes manages to steer clear of any moralizing tone, and lets her story tell itself; her understated tone conveys a powerful message of a young girl destroyed by the combined forces of ignorance and prejudice. Reading this book, one realizes who was really doing the devil's work in Salem."},{"Title":"A mirror for witches","review":"The story is one often told: a high-spirited young girl rouses the jealousy and suspicion of her Puritan neighbors. Her non-conformity gives rise to an occassion for her to be accused as a witch, and once accused, she is doomed. The real genius of this book is not in the plot per se (though the addition of the lover who takes advantage of the situation to convince Doll that she really is a witch and he as a demon is her appointed mate is a plausible and original twist. It is often overlooked that many of the people who perished in the witch-crazes believed themselves to be guilty, whether because of mental illness, infectious mass hysteria, or the confusion brought about by their terror during interogation and torture.)But, as I was saying, the real genius in this book lies in the narrative style and tone. Esther Forbes makes the risky but ultimately successful decision to structure this book like those of the era for which the events of the plot would be recent past: readers of Defoe's Moll Flanders will feel a jolt of recognition at many of the odd capitalizations and lengthy chapter headings. In keeping with this, the narrator appears always to disapprove of the 'witch' and approve of the pious townspeople who persecute her. However, Forbes' skill is such that the underlying message - that Doll has been entrapped and destroyed by prejudice, superstition, and spite - is always clear in the subtle ironies of situations. The result is that the tone throughout is one of impending doom, and the sense of the injustice done to Doll is far keener than it might have been had the narrator railed against it."},{"Title":"A mirror for witches","review":"This is a haunting, exquisitely crafted, work of fiction, which should be judged on its own considerable literary merits rather than for its imagined relationship to any particular set of historical events. I'd especially recommend to it to those who have enjoyed &quot;Lolly Willowes&quot;, by Sylvia Townsend Warner, or the work of Shirley Jackson (&quot;The Lottery&quot;, &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;) Forbes does a marvelous job at creating a voice which belongs to the seventeenth century, while subtly incorporating a very modern concern with the darker impulses of human nature. (Come to think of it, fans of &quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot; should like this as well.) Forbes recreates the form, atmosphere, and tone of a seventeenth-century chapbook, in which the most uncanny events are presented as literally true, but the twentieth-century reader will have their own perspective on the short and tragic life of Doll Bilby, &quot;who took a fiend to love.&quot;"},{"Title":"A mirror for witches","review":"this is a masterful story, well written. the style is superior to much modern fiction of today. it 'feels' like a biography. i am interested in the sociology of the salem witch trials &amp; have read much of the fiction &amp; nonfiction regarding that period, and this novel is one of the best things i have read."},{"Title":"A mirror for witches","review":"I found this book by complete accident browing a used bookstore (the best way to find them, and my #1 past time!) and I was completely enchanted.Forbes prose and story is completely unforgettable.

I bought it for its date (1928) and the excellent wood-cut illustrations scattered throughout. Inside was glued a newspaper review placed there by (I assume) the first owner -- it was an interesting enough find. Of course I read the book, though solely out of curiosity and the fact that I had forgotten Esther Forbes' authorship of the lame novel Johnny Tremain. The book read quickly, though seemed more like a novel from the 19th century than one from the Jazz Age. The content was interesting, but neither 'engaging' nor 'vigorous' as its newspaper review had led me to believe. On the whole, though I admit my pride regarding the ownership of the unique 1st edition, I do not plan on recommending the book to anyone not extensively studying literature regarding early witchery or the behavioral history of early Salem, Massachusetts inhabitants."},{"Title":"Crime and Criminology","review":"I have found this text to be a thorough exposition of topics within the stated subject matter.

It comes with two CDs that are very well prepared, also. I've used \\"Teach Yourself Arabic\\", \\"Al-Kitaab\\", \\"Living Language\\", \\"Instant Immersion (THE WORST!)\\", etc., and this is the only text that is clear, well-thought out, and plainly builds on previous instruction. I HIGHLY recommend it--along with other aids such as the Pimsleur CDs, Awde's \\"The Arabic Alphabet\\", Wightwick's \\"Your First 100 Words\\". Since I mentioned them above, I should point out problems with two particular series: The \\"Living Language\\" series is OK--but NO ARABIC SCRIPT! That's a huge fault. \\"Instant Immersion\\" (8 CDs) is nothing more than a recitation of words and phrases with their English equivalents--no more helpful than attempting to memorize an entire book verbatim by having someone read it to you. Get \\"Mastering Arabic\\" with the 2 audio CDs--Wightwick and Gafaar have done a wonderful job with this."},{"Title":"Mastering Arabic","review":"I started with this book, and I had tried loads before. I ended up doing a degree in Arabic and this book was a perfect start. Its important to get a grip of the writing before you do anything else, or you will be hobbled in your studies. Its beautifully presented and the examples are large (you wouldn't believe how many books have tiny examples for you to copy). I would heartily recommend this book.I also worked in Foyles (charing cross road) which had one of the best foreign language sections in the UK for non-European languages (some really obscure titles!) and I regularly looked through the books available for learning as a beginner. This still looks the best."},{"Title":"Mastering Arabic","review":"This is a language book. It contains 2 CDs that are very high sound quality which is necessary in order to understand exactly how the sounds in a foreign language very different from English should be spoken. It begins with learning the alphabet and continues to progress through words (vocabulary) and then to sentence structure. It then continues to familiar phrases useful to one who might be attempting to use their Arabic in a real life situation (like when traveling in the Middle East). This is not just a business travel \\"crutch\\" for emergencies; it seems much better than that. I have worked in several other books on Arabic and they all seem to leave something to be desired but this one (with its CDs) seems to pretty well overcome the other's shortcomings (so far). This is really a little too early to tell since it will be several years before its real benefits are known to me.I am a typical Mid-west American with some interest in languages and I have studied Spanish, German, with some Hebrew and Russian exposure. I thought I would tackle Arabic because it is an entirely different language in structure and speech than any other language that I have studied. I am 68 also. This is an adventure.There is also another book to complement this book that looks to be worthwhile. It is called Arabic - Verbs & Essentials of Grammar. It is written by the same authors and appears to be a nice complement to studying Arabic."},{"Title":"Mastering Arabic","review":"I highly recommend this book because of it's organization and the two CDs that come with it. It starts out teaching you how to right the alphabet (broken in to two groups of letters which aids in remembering how to write them) and introduces words as it goes. It is grammar heavy but, ummm, it's rather important to know the grammar rules in order to speak MSA properly.Great book with a great price! I recommend this over Alif Baa any day, it gets you in to the language and using it, my Egyptian and Iraqi friends are impressed with my \\"accent\\" and with my knowledge of vocabulary and writing skills. GO FOR IT! It's worth every dime, and is darn cheap on Amazon.com!Yet another book that I recommend to supplement your formal school studies in Elementary Arabic I! Even the CDs are great, they use a native speaker so you get used to those \\"intimidating\\" Arabic sounds and even start to master them."},{"Title":"Mastering Arabic","review":"\\"Mastering Arabic\\" is a bit of a misnomer, because this is more of an introductory book, but for anyone who has ever even started to learn another language, the format will be familiar. Basically, each chapter presents a concept, such as countries and nationalities or numbers, offers several different exercises to help one master it, ranging from reading handwriten Arabic to writing and answering simple descriptions and questions. Additionally, in each of the first few chapters, the authors present a few different letters and their forms. I began learning Arabic with a book specifically about this, so, the first few chapters of this book were a bit of a review, but the authors still kept it interesting. Also, for people new to Arabic, this book will help them learn the script without being overwhelmed as they go. Finally, the CDs that come with this book are a great asset. Learning a language is hard on its own, but it can be harder without any audible frame of reference. In each chapter, there are activities designed to fit with the CDs, and they help a lot. This is a high quality text and great for people new to Arabic, but, to be clear, it will not help you 'master' Arabic."},{"Title":"Mastering Arabic","review":"I like Jane Wightwick's books. They are pretty good and thorough and easy to understand. I have this book and her beginner's Arabic book. I think if you learn the information in that first book this other book would be a review for you and a lot more, so you would come away with more. The Dec. 2004 version also has 2 Cds which are very helfpul for learners of Arabic."},{"Title":"Mastering Arabic","review":"I only give it 3 stars because of its flaws but I find this book the only one, which is usable to an extent if you learn Modern Standard Arabic on your own.Considerations for a review:Needs an Arabic-English dictionary.English-Arabic dictionary should include all the words used in the text, it's a common practice with language textbooks, otherwise it is the actual exercise. The author says, you need to get a dictionary but the words should be supplied, anyway.Romanisation is stopped too early. At least, the vocabulary should have it.Since the hand-written Arabic is not the focus of this book, the hand-written exercise should provide a guide on what is written. I think, the author is not aware of the difficulty of deciphering hand-written Arabic by a European learner.The ads and newspaper article exercises are also a waste of time, lots of guessing, not learning.I have experience in learning foreign languages, including Chinese and Japanese but Arabic seems much more difficult, since it's much harder to look up words dictionary and finding the right form of that word or using a form to get the dictionary form, the diglossia and varieties of Arabic, so it would be good to make more explanations to exercises, so that learners don't struggle but concentrate on learning. So grammar notes could have more romanisation and translation as well so that a learner could focus on the grammar, not on reading or looking up words."},{"Title":"Mastering Arabic","review":"The exercises in the book and on the CD's are good.

The action of the book takes place mainly in the U.S.A. Perhaps what is most compelling about the novel is the point-of-view of the professor-priest who describes his relationships with the exemplary characters in the novel. For them he had performed rituals of marriage and other ceremonies, according to the ancient Vedic rites that he learned in India as the son of a Himalayan, Hindu, Brahmin priest. The touching, sometimes comical, or even tragic impressions of these relationships and their contexts have been captured on individual videotapes (a device of the plot) which the professor reviews at his leisure, while offering trenchant commentaries. The Hindu priestly, scholarly and human experience of such an individual has never previously been recorded in literature. Rarely, has anyone penetrated to the heart of his own cultural heritage--particularly as experienced in exile--the way Professor Chandola has done in this novel. Yet, his skill as a writer creates in the reader a sense of being carried easily along the pathway of his wonderful storytelling.\\" -- Charles S.J. White, Professor Emeritus and former Chair, Department of Philosophy and Religion, American University."},{"Title":"The Dharma Videos Of Lust And Bust: A Novel of Religious Mysteries","review":"Although the work is subtitled \\"A novel of religious Mysteries,\\" it reads more like a series of discrete vignettes, each revealing another facet of traditional belief or practice juxtaposed with the realities of modern life. While the author illustrates how rituals serve as the glue of family relationships and social values, he also narrates several messy collisions of religious tradition with contemporary lifestyles. The expansive scope of the work is impressive, covering a wide range of human relationships and life stages. His compass includes life from birth to death, commitment and infidelity, feminism and patriarchy, humor and sorrow. But even more remarkable is how he is able to use these situations to shed light on an equally broad range of Indian religious beliefs and practices, from Vedic cosmology to classical aesthetic theory. While the work stands well on its own, I can imagine that it would also make fine reading in an introductory course on Indian religions.David C. Swain, Ph.D., South Asian Languages and Civilizations"},{"Title":"The Dharma Videos Of Lust And Bust: A Novel of Religious Mysteries","review":"Book Review from Hindustan Times, March 27, 2006Reviewer: Arup Chakraborty (Lucknow, India)An authentic tang of religious mysteriesDharma Videos of Lust and Bust is a novel that offers an authentic tang of religious mysteries. Written by Anoop Chandola and published by BookSurge, an Amazon.com Company USA, it is a piece of writing as dense as the jungle and foliage of the Himalayas and packed with action, learned allusions and philosophies. The plume of Chandola, a noted scholar, touches the rims of Hinduism, Sikhism, yoga, rationalism, religion and 9/11 and pierces through his readers' mind with alacrity, lucidity and vivacity. In fact, when a reader picks up this book and begins to plug away at it, he cannot but stop only at the last page. Every word, every leaf and every chapter of this novel springs into life and forces a reader to finish it at one go. He proves with adequate reason that rationalism is nothing but the child of faith.Thus in chapter 2 (Illusion of Sacred Sex), he writes: \\"In this video, the Vedic marriage known as Prajapatya, the most common among the traditional eight types, reveals fascinating mantras and rituals. They are performed in front of God Agni, which comes the same root as the Latin word Ignis (fire).Why Agni? Scholars of the Rig Veda, the oldest living scripture in the world, created around 1500 years before Christ, have figured out a lot about ancient Vedic beliefs and practices.\\" This and many such references emerge from this marvelous novel as if from a dream. Like a scholar-adventurer, he wanders from one place to another and establishes a fine cord with the universe and gives the message of oneness to the world.On page 107, he writes: \\"So what did Hindus call their religion?\\"\\"Several names. The most common is Dharma. But the westerners liked to use the word Hindu or Hinduism... Remember, Hindu and Hinduism are not Indian in origin.\\"\\"You mean these are foreign names forced upon you?\\"\\"Yes. But when Muslim rule came to India, many Hindus gladly adopted Arabic, Persian, and Turkish names. You know the first Prime Minister of India, Nehru? His name is Arabic based.\\" In this way, Anoop Chandola weaves together personal lives and public events. This novel is ambitious, poignant and remarkable. He evokes things Indian with an inwardness that is lit with wit and humour. To top it all, it is intelligence, manifested in a brilliant handling of language that leaves a permanent impression on our mind."},{"Title":"The Dharma Videos Of Lust And Bust: A Novel of Religious Mysteries","review":"A Himalayan Brahmin priest reflects on his life in this dense novel.Professor Chaube has led a dual existence?one as a Ph.D. in socio-linguistics and the other as a priest performing marriages and sacred ceremonies and offering advice. At a surprise party thrown in his honor, he receives a box of videos containing the footage of the various rituals and rites over which he has presided. The ensuing trip down memory lane is a cathartic process full of stories of happy couples, painful breakups and sordid scandals. In order to better interpret the experiences of those he has helped, the professor expresses his views on a broad variety of topics, including the origins of certain religious rituals and Ayurvedic practices and the rich folkloric history of Hinduism. He also examines the importance of the cooperation between different faiths, adding a unique cultural perspective to his study. While his insights are often fascinating and informative, they cast a heavy academic shadow over the narrative, and the religious anecdotes and linguistic histories often drown out the character development. Still, \\"The Dharma Videos of Lust and Bust is an engaging, educational read, particularly worthwhile for its extensive discussions of the Hindu faith.More a combination of memoir and textbook than fiction, but enjoyable nonetheless.?--Kirkus Discoveries"},{"Title":"The Dharma Videos Of Lust And Bust: A Novel of Religious Mysteries","review":"\\"How do ritual and religion alter and mark our lives? And how does our modern world transform our most cherished beliefs? The answers to these intriguing questions are the provocative premise of Anoop Chandola?s stunning debut novel.When professor and priest Chaube retires, his devoted students present him with an unusual gift: videos of the ceremonies he has performed for them.But each video goes beyond the marriage, funeral or naming ceremony it depicts, bringing forth mesmerizing tales of Indians living in a liberated America.Ancient, sacred stories knock against modern mores, and like the tales of Scheherazade, they're absolutely addictive. A marriage erupts into murder. A dying young woman marries her beloved, and grandparents change their names in a desperate attempt to evade Muslim fanatics. This is a world where rituals are reinterpreted to make modern sense, where the most divine thing need not be a god, but can be a single mother raising her child.Fascinating, satirical and erudite, Chandola?s novel touches on Hinduism, Sikhism, yoga, rationalism, religion, a woman?s right to choose and 9/11, creating a rich and ever-changing tapestry of experience. Each story becomes a thread added to the shining whole, as the past intersects the present with stories of pleasure, betrayal, lust and pain. Generous, humorous and full of linguistic pleasures, Chandola brilliantly melds the myths of ancient religions with the mysteries of modern life, immersing us in an entirely new and hypnotic world.\\"--New York Times Best Selling Author Ellen Tanner Marsh"},{"Title":"The Dharma Videos Of Lust And Bust: A Novel of Religious Mysteries","review":"Anoop Chandola stages the intersection of ancient Indian mythology and contemporary reality. From the vantage point of a migrant living in the United States, Chandola provides us a glimpse into the ongoing reinvention of tradition in unlikely circumstances, gracefully balancing contradictions even when they can't be solved. The past never disappears, but only a few can allow us to discern its evolving significance in the chaos of the present. Chandola's characters are routinely charming and endearing, insisting upon the possibilities of community, integrity and dignity over either blind ritual or capitulation to indivdualism. Here is a rare writer who gives us the benefit of wisdom born of careful, benign observation in multiple cultural locations, successfully addressing multiple audiences.Vik Bahl, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Human Resource Management (9th Edition)","review":"This book's content and support is, unquestionably, the best available today.

But not any more.

It was interesting to see how she got started in the first place. I like how she emphasizes to always check up on what people say and never take it at \\"face value\\". Crooked House was creepy. The couple were actually living in the house where she had lived, thats nasty! It had a rather sordid ending too, very scary! but it ties in very well. Good use of flashback. I was expecting her to die in her last mystery just the way that Agatha Christie kills of Hercule Poirot at the end of his last mystery. It didn't quite feel the same, I almost expect more Miss Marple Mysteries. It did come full circle with Miss Marple emphasizing fact and not what people say in both. There is also a difference between the first and the last in that Miss Marple is much more of an outsider in the first one (its as if she is experimenting with her craft) and takes \\"center stage\\" in the last (the work of the expert). It was an interesting change of pace to see two people other than Miss Marple being amateur detectives in her first, it gave me a point of comparison."},{"Title":"Sleeping Murder/The Murder at The Vicarage","review":"I was thrilled, as a 'newly fledged' Agatha Christie fan, to find this excellent double volume of Miss Marple's first and last cases.

It might well be worth 5 stars for some or most people, but I bought this book thinking it contained the majority of his sermons. Again, it doesn't. Only 6. I have not read this book, however I did read the 2 Volume biography on G.W. (the biography is AWESOME). I guess it was my fault for not looking into this book further before purchasing.

It was a quick read even with a lot of financial terms explained and I believe I am wiser having read it."},{"Title":"401(k)s For Dummies","review":"This is a great 'starter kit' for anyone. It's also a perfect primer for college graduates who are lucky, smart and connected enough to get a job. 401-K information isn't a college course unless one majors in finance, etc., so the average newly-employed should have a working knowledge of who is doing what with their money and how they can maximize their fund (for retirement or how to roll it over when they leave that job in 2 years for the next one....)

In my opinion I should receive 1/12th of it for free since my friend won't be able to use the January page; along with a complimentary Christmas gift for next year. But instead I decided that I would do the world a favor and save them the embarrassment of wrapping and giving an empty box with an IOU note as a gift. You can't use an IOU note to keep track of the date. So please do ME a favor and pass on this calendar no matter how attractive you think an actor might be.

Over to You contains 10 fictional stories that all have something to do with flying. For those who have an idealistic view of the life of fighter pilots, it's an interesting read. Dahl, who himself was a fighter pilot during WWII, does a brilliant job describing the decisions and actions that a fighter pilot has to make, and that's not all fun. Dahl portrays his characters in a remarkable atmosphere and with a sense of tragedy that is truly impressive."},{"Title":"Over to You: Ten Stories of Flyers and Flying","review":"Roald Dahl is a great author with a wonderfully wicked sense of humor and take on life. I have another collection of his short stories and was sad to discover this short little collection had one of the stories from my larger collection.

Very little in vocabulary and grammar is covered, except only in how it relates to small talk and asking for directions and the like. You couldn't actually hold a CONVERSATION with the instruction in this book.If you want a book to help you understand some of the intricacies of Japanese customs (such as what to say when you're the first employee leaving for the day, or what grammar article to include if you're asking an unknown person versus a friend), then this book may help.If you're looking to have more of a long-term understanding of the language, and not intending just a stay of a few days in Japan, then you'll need something more."},{"Title":"Architect of Dreams: The Theatrical Vision of Joseph Urban","review":"Joseph Urban was primarily responsible for bringing the influence of the Vienese Secessionist Movement and Modernism to the theatre of America near the turn of the 20th century. Sure, he wasn't the only one and this book doesn't try to over-state Urban's influence. The text lets the designs do the work.The book is nothing more than a catalogue but what an extraordinary catalogue it is! The photos of the renderings and models are top quality and really good choices by the author and editors. One can really see the watercolor techniques in the renderings along with the development of the design ideas Uban went through in his varied and prolific life as a designer. I really enjoyed the ddesigns and written text associated with the New School of Social Research. His work seems to be a precurser to Mondrian without the sterility of some of the Bauhaus concepts. His theatrical work really enlivened his architectural work.His designs for the theatre were outrageous and vital.I rate this book so very high because Urban's work is so important to stage design in America. As I said earlier, this book is a catalogue - but what a body of inspired and fantastical work to catalogue!"},{"Title":"The Man Who Walked the Earth","review":"Another simply told tale from Ian Wallace. His text is spare, straightforward, and compelling. The illustrations, like so many of his, are evocative of place and time, with enough detail to make us feel the homeliness of the house and its inhabitants. The warmth of lamplight spills into each scene, guarding us and the characters of brother and sister and mother against the harsh cold of the out of doors, really of the world. The arrival of the stranger out of the cold, his magic tricks, his presentation of gifts, and his departure happen so fluidly that we, too, are caught up in the surprise and delight of his visit. The best of his gifts brings this story to its close, and we want to read it again to recapture the magic."},{"Title":"MCDBA SQL Server 2000 All-in-One Exam Guide (Book/CD Set)","review":"This book is full of glaring errors, and the testing software is ABSOLUTELY USELESS.

When I 'browsed' it, it seemed clear enough so I took a chance. Now that I've read all but the last few chapters (and done all the exercises, etc), I feel I would buy it again and, indeed, recommend it with a small qualification or two.Positives:First, it is not the bottom of the heap - far from it. I've read much poorer quality technical books before. I rated it at 3 stars but, if it hadn't claimed to be a test prep book, I would have rated it at 4 stars.Second, it is great for new people. So what if it misses a few of the finer points (even necessary ones?) Within two days of starting with it I was using DTS and replication and getting XML responses back through IIS. I found it very clear to get these services going.Third, I don't mind pictures and this book has quite a few. Nothing like a picture to show you what screen you *should* be looking at.Fourth, other than minor typos, the author is literate. Better than many other books out there.Negatives:First, this is *not* a test prep book. I've taken a number of cert tests (dozens) and I don't feel like I'm even close to ready for testing. However, I do feel a lot more confident about understanding the questions. A lot more.Second, there are some awful mistakes in some of the exercises. All of them are correctable and you have to correct them but it makes you suspicious whenever you start an exercise. For me, that isn't a bad thing. For a complete newbie, it could be a bit distressing.Third, the test banks don't work well. This doesn't make it a '1' in my opinion. I've not seen a test bank in a book that is representative of the real test. However, it does degrade my overall score for the book a little.

The book will not help you pass the MCDBA exams (70-228 and 70-229), nor is it a good reference book for your job. First of all, there are many aspects of T*SQL that are missing. For example, how can one write a book about the Select statement without such basic topics as \\"Having\\" and \\"Group By\\"? Secondly, the information is frequently wrong. Not misinterpreted, but plainly wrong (i.e., SQL*Server will reject your syntax). Finally, the questions in the \\"sample\\" tests have NO relationship to the actual exams.

No trace of documentation on any but one feature of DBCC is included; Query Analyzer docs are woefully brief.3. This book will help you FAIL the MCDBA exams.

One of the first autobiographical works in the modern sense, it also represents the first time a psychological and theological enterprise were combined. It also helps to bridge the gap between the Classical world and the Medieval world, exhibiting strong elements identifying with each of those major historical periods.Most undergraduates in the liberal arts encounter the book at some point; all seminarians do (or should!). Many adults find (or rediscover) the book later, after school. For many in these categories, there are concepts, narrative strands and historical data new and unusual for them. However, Augustine's 'Confessions' is still generally more accessible in many ways that truly classical pieces; it has interior description as well as external reporting that we are familiar with in modern writing.The 'Confessions' shows Augustine's personality well - he was a passionate person, but his focus wavered for much of his life until finally settling upon Christianity and the Neoplatonic synthesis with this faith. Even while remaining a passionate Christian and rejecting the sort of dualism present in the Manichee teachings, he varied between various positions within these systems. Augustine's varied thought reaches through many denominational and scholarly paradigms.The 'Confessions' are divided into thirteen chapters, termed 'Books' - the first ten of the books are autobiographical, with Augustine describing both events in his life as well as his philosophical and religious wanderings during the course of his life. The text is somewhat difficult to take at times, as this is writing with a purpose, as indeed most autobiographies are. The purpose here at times seems to be to paint Augustine in the worst possible light (the worse his condition, the better his conversion/salvation ends up being); at other times, one gets a sense (as one might get when reading the Pauline epistles) that there is some significant degree of ego at work here (Paul boasts of being among the better students, and so does Augustine, etc.).Augustine also uses his Confessions as a tract against the Manichean system - once a faithful adherent, Augustine later rejects the Manichean beliefs as heretical; however, one cannot get past the idea that Augustine retained certain of their intellectual aspects in his own constructions even while denouncing them in his official life story.The whole of the conversion turns on two primary books - Book Seven, his conversion to the Neoplatonic view of the world, including the metaphysics and the ethics that come along with this system; and Book 8, which describes his conversion to Christianity proper. This is where perhaps the most famous directive, 'Tolle! Lege!' ('Take and read!') comes from - Augustine heard a voice, and he picked up the nearest book, which happened to be a portion of the Pauline epistles, arguing against the undisciplined lifestyle Augustine lived. Scholars continue to debate whether Augustine's conversion to Christianity was more profound or more important than his conversion to Neoplatonism; in any event, Christianity interpreted through a Platonic framework became the norm for centuries, and remains a strong current within the Christian world view; Protestant reformers as they went back to the 'original bible' in distinction from the Catholic interpretations of the day also went back to the 'original Augustine' for much of their theology.The final three books are Augustine's dealing with the creation of the world via narrative stories in Genesis 1 exegetically and hermeneutically. This is very different from what is done in modern biblical scholarship, but is significant in many respects, not the least of which as it gives a model of the way Augustine dealt with biblical texts; given Augustine's towering presence over the development of Western Christianity in both Catholic and Protestant strands, understanding his methods and interpretative framework can lead to significant insights into the ideas of medieval and later church figures.The Loeb Library is one of the few editions where the reader can get a copy of this Latin text in the Latin language. Widepread in English and other languages, actual Latin editions of this famous text are increasingly rare, and the Loeb Library has a consistency of quality of editions that makes this one well worth having. This is a book that will be of interest to novice readers of Augustine as well as scholars, to students, clergy and laypersons, and anyone else who might have an historical, literary, philosophical, theological or other interest in Augustine - something for everyone, perhaps?"},{"Title":"Linguistic Theory and the Function of Word Order in Dutch: A Study on Interprentice Aspects of the Order of Adverbials and Noun Phrases (Studies of)","review":"This book is written by my father.

The main character, Martin, is a great warrior mouse. He left his cave that he had defended for his whole life to journey the world, on his way he passes through Mossflower and learns the hard way of how mean the Queen is. He meets up with the creatures from the forest and decides to help their noble cause to get rid of the Queen. Martin hates the evil Queen and vowed to kill her for the pain she caused him. Martins hate for her is because she imprisoned him and broke his father's sword that he gave to Martin before his death. Because of this hatred toward the Queen and love to the creatures he accepted to take a journey to a mountain named Salamandastron where someone lives to free them from the Queen. Throughout his journey that creatures sent him on he and his companions find many enemies and life threatening obstacles. When he gets to the mountain he discovers his destiny and becomes an even greater fighter. In one scene, Martin takes his army of creatures to defeat the Queen, by surrounding her castle. His plan is to good for the Queen she is not able to really fight back. This book shows that good will defeat evil in the end.

Also, the characters are so plainly black and white, good or bad, making it very fairytale/folktaleish.

So many characters, lots of battles, and an excellent plot. I loved this book! I was glad to hear more of Martin the Warrior, and the creation and origon of The Redwall Abbey! The story begins with the death of Verdauga, the wild cat ruler of Mossflower. He had two children, Gingivere, a kind and gentle cat, and Tsarmina, a merciless tyrant. Tsarmina and a vixen named Fortunauta poison Verdauga's medicine. Tsarmina blames Gingivere who is sent to the cells where Martin was previosly sentenced to for passing through Mossflower armed with a sword, which Tsarmina broke and tied the handle to Martin's neck. Soon a mousetheif named Gonff is also sent to the same cell as Martin, a short time later, they escape back to Brockhall, the home of all the woodlanders who wished to be freed from the iron fist of Tsarmina the Queen of the Thousand eyes, and the ruler of Kotir and Mosflower. Soon, Bella, the ruler of Brockhall, sends Gonff, Martin, and Young Dinny the mole on a dangerous quest to the mountain of the Fire Lizard, Salamandastron, to find her father, Boar, and bring him back to Mossflower to restore justice. On the way, the trio run into nice bats, frogs and other reptiles, and a new friend, Log-a-Log the shrew. Together, they make it to the mountain, where they meet Boar the fighter! Boar and his large group of hares fix Martin's sword, and make it stronger. But Boar dies in a battle against the searats of the \\"BloodWake\\", which Boar wins even though he was killed. Martin, Gonff, Dinny, and Log-a-Log free the slaves that where serving as oarslaves on the ship. They sail back to Mossflower and flood Kotir out. Then Martin and Tsarmina have a final battle to the death. Tsarmina is stunned by the power of the small mouse, she walks backwards into the water, and she drounds. The story ends with the Abbey being built and the freedom of Mossflower!Mossflower was the best Redwall book I have read yet, and I would recomend it to almost anyone in the world! You should read it."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The book Mossflower is great. The book has detailed battles and fights. Although the book is great it wouldn't be the best for smaller childern. I rated the book 5 stars because the author who wrote the book keeps the reader reading. There are parts where there is unbelieveble action. Then they go into talking and discussion. When you least expect it, a fight or scene of action comes up and you can't put the book down. The best reason why you can't stop reading because unlike most books Mossflower has action through most of the book. Out of all the books I've read Mossflower is the best."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"MossflowerBy: Brian JacquesReviewed by: J. ChoPeriod: 1This book is about where woodlanders want to be living freely, but to do that they have to beat the queen named, Tsarmina. She killed her own father just to be ruler of Mossflower. Since the woodlanders cannot take any more of this, they decide to fight back. So a badger named, Bella decided to call for her father so they can live freely. So she sends Martin the Warrior, Gonff the Prince of Thieves, and Dinny the mole to Salamandastron to bring her father back. While that is happening there is war between the woodlanders and Tsarmina. But even thought Martin, Gonff, and Dinny don&iexcl;t bring her father back, Marin kills Tsarmina, and Mossflower is free.Why I liked this book is that because it&iexcl;s interesting. It has much excitement, and how they solve everything is very interesting. They solve mysteries that have many clues (the clues are hard too.) For example, when they needed to find their way to Salamandastron, they had to go through many riddles just to find a map to the place. They found the map after many days of work. For example of a hard riddle, &iexcl;&iexcl; If it is a joke, then it&iexcl;s a clever one, you&iexcl;ll admit. Beech, oak, ash, rowan in that order, can&iexcl;t you see, it&iexcl;s the first letter of each one. B then o then a then r, spells Boar.&iexcl;&iexcl;What I also like about this book is that the plans that they have are really slick. They have plans that the enemies don&iexcl;t know about. They get confused and Tsarmina thinks that the fault of that is because of her guards. For example, when two cub woodlanders escaped the stoat that was in charge wasn&iexcl;t very lucky. &iexcl;A luckless stoat had been &iexcl;volunteered&iexcl; from the cell guards by Fortunata and Cludd, and was pushed unwillingly into Tsarmina&iexcl;s chamber. &iexcl;&iexcl;Er, your Maj of green Queenest, er upper of all ruler and lower Moss. Er, er&iexcl; The prisoners have gone!&iexcl;&iexcl;My favorite part in the book was when Boar (Bella&iexcl;s father) fixed up the sword that got broken by Tsarmina, and that sword was the sword that Martin&iexcl;s father gave to him before he left to defend their land. Boar made the metal part so it can be unbreakable, and it was described that it was very beautiful. And the emotion that was expressed by Martin was very persuasive."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The main characters in \`Mossflower' are Martin (from \`Martin the Warrior'), Bella of Brockhall (Brockhall is a badger compound), Skipper (also known as Skip, he's the skipper of the otter crew), Lady Amber (the peaceful queen of the squirrels), Goffen Prince of mouse thieves (a good thief), Tsarmina (an evil wild cat Queen... the queen of Kotir) Gingivere (Tsarmina's brother but that of a kind and gentle heart) Ben and Goody Stickle (a hedgehog couple owning the four baby hedgehogs Spike, Posy, Ferdy and Coggs), Dinny (a young mole), Chibb (a red breast robin acting as a spy), Log-a-Log (a friendly shrew) and Boar the fighter (Bella's father) and the list goes on.When I opened the front cover of this book on the first page there was a snippet from the book and here it is:For a moment Martin's eyes meet those of Tsarmina's. His voice was clear and unafraid. \\"You should have killed me when you had the chance, because I vow that I will slay you one day.\\"The spell was broken. The guards hauled on the ropes, dragging Martin off to the cells. In the silence that followed, Tsarmina slumped in her chair and sniggered \\"A mouse kill me, indeed! He's hardly worth worrying about.\\"But boy was she wrong! In the rest of the book you are just enticed in the adventures from dancing crabs to stolen children, it is in the last and final chapters that Tsarmina is slain by a true warrior, it is also in these final chapters the most tense chapters that we find out weather our strong and heroic warrior's life is so close to being snuffed that you need a box of tissues.

The only flaw in this book, and it isn't in the writing or anything, is that this book may be mistaken by many people as just another \\"wind and the Willows\\" rippof (as with others in the series), while as it realy is filled to the brim with new ideas and entresting characters.

There he finds out that the woodlanders there are being ruled under the tyrant Verdauga, the wild cat who has a fortress, Kotir. Martin is captured for trespassing and carrying a sword, which belonged to his father. Gingivere, Verdauga's son says to let Martin go but Tsarmina, his sister, orders him to be killed but Verdauga says to just throw him in the dungeons for a while because he saw that Martin is a real warrior. Tsarmina loses her temper and breaks Martin's sword in two. She then orders that the broken sword hilt be put around Martin's neck. Before Martin is taken away though, he vows that he will kill Tsarmina for breaking his sword.Unfortunately for Martin, Tsarmina murders her father, putting the blame on Gingivere. She throws him into the dungeons then puts herself in her father's place, now to be the tyrant of Kotir and Mossflower. The woodlander animals flee to the safety of Bella the Brokhall, a female badgers, place. They then try to concoct a plan to stop Tsarmina from her reign of terror.Winter passes, then spring arrives, with Martin still forgotten in the dungeons. He tries to talk to Gingivere but is always quieted by the soldiers. One day though, a mouse named Gonff, the Prince of Mousethieves, is put in the same cell as Martin for stealing food from Kotir. Fortunately, Gonff is also an escape artist and they flee from Kotir, Martin promising to return to rescue Gingivere someday.Martin joins up with the woodlanders to stop Tsarmina. He makes friends with Lady Amber, queen of the squirrels, Skipper the leader of the otters, Dinny the mole, and more. Bella asks Martin, Gonff, and Dinny to venture to the mountains of Salamandastron to ask for help from her badger grandfather. With only an ancient poem to guide them, they set out to Salamandastron.Meanwhile, two young hedgehogs who try to pretend to be warriors are caught by Tsarmina's soldiers and are put in two cells on either side of Gingivere's cell. Gingivere manages to make tunnels from their cells to his cell so they can be together. The Mossflower animals get help from the Mask, the mysterious brother of Skipper, who is a master of disguises, to rescue the two hedgehogs and Gingivere.Sorry, I can't tell you anything more because it'll spoil the story! You'll have to read to find out of Martin and his two friends are able to reach Salamandastron safely and if the woodland animals are able to save Gingivere and the two young hedgehogs.The best of the Redwall series, &quot;Mossflower&quot; is lots of fun. In my opinion, Tsarmina is one of the best villains in all of Brian Jacques' books. I also love the characters of Martin, Gonff, Columbine (Gonff's sweetheart), Lady Amber, Skipper, and Mask. For those who haven't read any of the books, I suggest you read &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot; first (if you want to read in time order), then &quot;Mossflower&quot;, though all of the books can stand by itself.

The book that I read is called, \\"Mossflower.\\" I liked Mossflower because of how Brian Jacques tells, not just about what happens to the person, but he tells about the surrounding area. He also informs you on exactly what is happening. He gives a lot of details. I think my favorite part is when Boar the Fighter {a badger] gives Martin the Warrior [a mouse] a new sword. It is very good because I can picture in my mind Martin swinging his sword, jumping on and off the anvil. Also, I would like it a lot if I was able to meet Brian Jacques. I am encouraging you to read this book because it is very funny, and has a lot of action. --Alex"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I have already read Redwall and Mattimeo and think this book is a good one to start off with. I think that Gingivere was a great character though Tsarmina could have been crueler and more cunning. I loved Bella and Dinny (he was a cute mole!) and the hares. This was sad, but when Boar died it made an interesting twist in the story. Argulon was the BOMB!If you haven't read this superb book, READ IT NOW!!!!!!!!This series is THE BEST I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower. To people who haven't read it, yeah another book. But I say CLASSIC!!!!! My favorite characters were Dinny the mole, Skipper the otter, and Lady Amber the Squirrel. Mossflower was the first Redwall book I ever read, and I got so into it I'm nagging my parents for the whole series!!! (Tsamaria was an awsome idea for an enemy!)(From DaveM's G-daughter/////// Jessica Pace)"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I think this book was great. But I think Tsarmina was a bit to stupid! The chracters were strong and the plot was good. Look for other books in the series for instance like Salamandastron, The Bellmaker and The long patrol"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Though I'm reading this book for the third time, I still get caught up in it and still love it. Just because it's full of mice doesn't mean that it's always peaceful and it certainly doesn't mean that it's silly and uninteresting. It is VERY interesting and I really recommend you read it."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Well it's actually been over a year since I have read the book but if my memorie serves right it was definitly the best redwall book I had ever read!It was also the book that introduced me to the series. ~Christy or Eveningstripe the Sabre"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I love this book! I Hope to read more of the REDWALL series.I think there is an interesting plot and twist of characters.I wish the Mask wouldn't die.I really liked Martin the Warrior and Gnoff!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"When I was swung into the story, I began to nourish a flame of hatred against all the Greeneyes almost instantly. Gonff caught me in a whirl of deight and giggles(wish I was as good as a bard!). My favourites were as follows: Ferdy, Coggs, Gonff, Martin and Gingivere. I thought that the way Brian Jacques weaves this story, with Gonff's songs, good bad guys, traitors, heartbreaks and battles was very clever. A must-read!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower was the best book I've ever read. Some people say things like &quot;Adventurous, exciting, and wonderful&quot; about other books but that's pretty much a perfect thing to say about Mossflower. Tsarmina was pretty much why it's better than Redwall."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I loved this book! It was full of excitement and adventure. The plots are complicated and the book is long, but I never got bored with it. It has great descriptions and makes you feel close to the characters. I have read it multiple times, and every time I read it I find it exciting. I can't put it down once I start reading. It takes unexpected turns and twists that keeps it gripping. Brian Jacques is a great writer, and has written several other books in the Redwall series. I hope he continues to write more Redwall books."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This series is the best series ever written! In the series, Mossflower is my favorite book! I don't know about you, but my favorite was Dinny! If anybody has any doubts about reading this series, they gotta talk to me!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This book is Jacques's best work. Who ever reads it will love it. Touching, funny,sad everything you need to make a book perfect!!!!! Ones who open it wont be able to put it down!

Look for more of Brian's work like Bellmaker, Mariel of red wall &amp; others!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This is only the second book I've read in the Redwall series, but I think it is the best. These books are amazing, epic stories that are very hard to put down until they're finished. Great job, Brian Jacques!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I think that Mossflower is one of the better books in Redwall. It takes place in Mossflower, with the peaceful woodlanders fighting for peace against the evil vermin. My favorite character is Columbine. My favorite scenes are when Skipper of the Otters and Lady Amber, Squirrelqueen, go after the vermin of Kotir and Abbess Germaine lectures them after they come back injured, when Martin (mouse), Gonff(mouse), Dinny(mole), and Log-a-log Big Club of the shrews find the swan in the pond close to Salamandastron, the fire mountain, and when Martin finally defeats Tsarmina, the wildcat, Queen of A Thousand Eyes. All in all, I think that this was a great book."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Now, the tale of the hero continues with Martin in Mossflower where an evil cat has taken over inside castle Kotir. The evil cat Tsarmina has killed her father and is determined to put all Mossflower creatures in their place. But Martin stumbles upon a group of rebels in Mossflower called Corim and joins them in freeing Mossflower from a new tyrant who would enslave them all! This is the tale where Redwall Abbey is born and the legends of Martin's heroics burned into the minds of friends and foes alike. This is an excellent book and I've read it several times. Jacques is brilliant and creative as he draws the reader in until the very last page. The story of Redwall has only just begun! Read Mossflower!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This is my favorite one in the series so far. This one is about Martin The warrior on a quest to find boar the fighter, and it is also about Maritn the warrior defeating Tsarmia queen of a thousand eyes, or verdauga greeneyes whatever you want to call her. I would actually reccomend to start with mossflower then redwall. Or if you want the series the way it should be so you dont spoil any surprises, here is the listLord brocktreeMartin the warriorMossflowerLegend of luke ( strongly reccomended great story, I would say the best one of them all)Outcast of RedwallMariel of redwallBellmakerSalamandastronRedwallMattimeoThe pearls of LutraLong patrolMarlfoxTaggerung"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I like this book a lot, because it lets you know more about Martin the warrior. It also lets you know about how Redwall was built. My favorite character is Gonff the Mousethief, because he is hilarious! If you got hooked on the first book like I did, you will definitely want to pick up this book and start reading it right away!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Maybe its the kid in me that enjoys the Redwall books so much. I don't know. What I DO know is that this is an excellent series of stories. They are easy to read, and flow from chapter to chapter seamlessly, with loveable characters, nasty villains that you just love to hate, and vivid scenery. I can close my eyes and see every little detail in my mind.I'm not sure that I have a favorite part of the book, but the battle between Martin and Queen Tsarmina was excellent.I highly reccomend this and every other Redwall book to everyone, young and old alike."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I think this book was just as good, if not better than Redwall. It had a little more action, and less adventure. This book was ten times funnier than Redwall. When reading this series, you don't think of the characters as animals, because you can relate to them as humans.The story starts out at Ben Stickles house. Troops from Kotir barge in, and take food for the \\"kingdom\\". Meanwhile a warrior mouse named Martin is walking through Mossflower. When the soldiers leave the Stickles house, they see Martin. They draw their weapons and start to fight. Martin is winning for about ten minutes, one mouse, verse about five stoats, weasels, and ferrets. He is finally captured and is put in the dungeons of Kotir.At Kotir, Lord Green eyes, also known as Verdauga, is sick. A healer named Fortunata is trying to \\"help\\" him regain his strength. Tasarmina, his greedy, power hungry daughter, has hired the vixen to frame Gingevere, Tasarminas brother, for killing Verdauga. Tasarmina and the fox, make a potion to kill him. They tell Gingivere to deliver it to his father. After drinking it, he dies instantly. Tasarmina takes over, and sends her brother to rot in the dungeon.With Martin and Gingivere in the dungeon, and the evis Tasarmina ruling Kotir, who will save Mossflower? Read the book to find out. This is a comical, adventorous, and action packed book."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I really enjoyed Mossflower. Brain Jacques has a great style of writing that just pulls you into the book. All of the Redwall books are wonderfully written. They are filled with adventure and excitement, each page seem's to draw you into the world that Brian Jacques has created. It's almost as if you are there with the characters. Brian Jacques rivals J.R.R.Tolkien in his mastery of captivating the reader in his writing. Anyone who has enjoyed Tolkien will enjoy the Redwall series by Brian Jacques."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is a book of adventure and love and hate. It is the first quest of Martin the Warrior, the famous mouse from Redwall. Mossflower is a tale of woodlanders coming together to destroy evil and build a new place of dwelling for them. The quest begins when Martin comes through Mossflower and he helped the woodlanders stop the evil wildcats. He got a magnificent sword from a friend and used it well. He is Redwall's mascot, he is what every woodlander boy wants to be like.Brian Jacques pumps out another masterpiece and it doesn't leave you hanging. I loved this book, and you connect with the characters very well. If you don't read this book you are missing out on one of Brian Jacques' best works. I recommend this book to the fullest."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Just in case you aren't sure about this book, GET IT! It's the best book ever written in the best series on earth. All the other books are great too. Brian Jacques wrote it for blind kids originally, so the detail is amazing! I had the privilage to meet the author and he is really nice. Get this book for anyone! You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower Woods has terror upon it as the wildcat queen Tsarmina rules at Kotir, and evil castle. A mouse called Martin the Warrior is traveling and he stops in Mossflower. Later, Martin arrives in Brockhall, a hidden home in the woods. The badger Bella of Brockhall is worried, so she sends Martin off with two of his new freinds to find her father Boar the Fighter.Bella is hoping Boar will save Mossflower from Queen Tsarmina. Boar is at Salamandastron, a home for badger lords. The journey will be long and difficult for Martin the Warrior. What will happen to the once peaceful Mossflower Woods, and will it be saved? This thrilling book is very exciting and full of suspensing action!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I liked the book because the author had that special talent that takes you into the book. You could always tell exactly what was happening. It was like you were right there in the book. You could also tell exactly what the characters looked like,where they were and what they were doing. If they were running in the hills, you could tell what was around it! And you could also have an imaginaiation that was 100% correct.The best part of the book was when Martin, Gonff, Dinny, Boar, and the Hares fought Captain Ripfang and his gang of sea rats. Martin fights hard, killing numbers of rats. Gonff runs around taking rats down in his path. Dinny shouts out furious comments to the enemies while fighting. The hares use their powerful hind legs to stun and a dagger to kill. Boar is the biggest and has no problem killing and chilling. But when he tells his companions to take the ship and return to Mossflower, he is killed by a mob of rats right after he takes down Ripfang.The story element most vivid to me was the setting because the writer made the words so describing. You could practically tell what a single blade of grass looked like. Mossflower is the home of all the woodlanders. You could tell exactly what it looked like. The settings were unusual in a very good way."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I really enjoyed 'Mossflower' that's why I gave it five stars. Out of all the Brian Jacques books I have read 'Mossflower' is my favourite. That's because I like adventure, action, mystery and a lot of other qualities 'Mossflower' has. To anybody who likes the same qualities in a book as I do 'Mossflower' is a great book to read. Why stop at 'Mossflower' though? Read all of Brian Jacques' books. I know I will."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This is an excellent book that tells of the founding of Redwall Abbey. A must read first kinda book. A perfect beginning of a seris to a great end, Brian Jaques is a must-read-his-books-author, this perfect book is a must-read, deffinetly!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I like this book a lot! it is full of action packed battles. it has a excellent plot. Brian Jaques creates a great world for young readers to escape to. i have read all 4 &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books and i still enjoy these book's better. This book is worth every penny!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is the first book of the series I have read so far. I didn't understand it when I was a lot younger, so I only read about half of it, not knowing what the heck was going on. But just recently I decided to give it a second chance. The mintue I got into it, I couldn't put it down. I was always wonderig what was going to happen next, or how things were going to turn out. I loved Gonff, as well as even some of the &quot;bad guys&quot;. Brian Jacques described it very well, and did a very good job on it. Im hoping to read the rest of the series soon. I'd recomend reading this book."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"My grandmother gave me the first three Redwall books for christmas years ago. I avoided reading them until the car ride to her house months later (what if she asked me what they were about?)and I haven't stopped. With all of the rich details, thrilling fights and involving characters of a classic epic tale, Mossflower is an exciting and engaging story about the good, the evil, the weak and the strong. Don't fall for the adolescent male stereotyping that the Redwall books have often endured- this is a book for boys, girls, men, and women. (not for children under say, 6 or 7, the battle scenes are fairly realistic but suprisingly not disturbing as they are short and hardly gruesome)"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"If you are just starting the redwall series you'd probably want to get this book first because it explains somethings about the warrior Martin and Salamadastron and other things. This book is one of my favorites(other than Mattimeo) and it is worth the price. Anyone who wants to add some good books on their bookshelves I reccomend the Redwall series."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is an electrifing book with lots of action. A compelling sequel to redwall. Martin the Warior comes to an unknown place to him and gets himself locked in a cell for a year then a plump mousetheif named Gonff. Together thewy escape and take down Kotir i will not tell you how a cuple of little mouses take down a castle but the book will."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"It's a Redwall book. Need I say more? Just like the others, this book is excellent, and even in the beginning, it has you caring for the characters or (or in the villainess Queen Tsarmina's case) loathing them. This book keeps you wanting more, and with it's size bigger than usual books, gives exactly that. Out of 5 stars I give it 10! Be sure to check out the other Redwall books also! You won't be disapointed!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Brian Jaques must have some magic power because I stayed up all night and half a day reading this truly irresistable book! Its plot is wonderfully woven out---it is also brilliantly complex. The charachters,especially that little Gonff, are the neatest little things that I've ever seen or heard of! The flames of Salamandastron---talk about creative! I love it! And the beginning, how they talk about Mossflower woods in winter, that gave me the most graphic picture in my head of the woods of Mossflower. And even more, I was confused at the layout of Mossflower before this book. But after carefully studying its delicately drawn map and comparing it to other maps, I could recite it like a poem! This message is for everybeast: &quot;DON'T MISS OUT ON LIFE--- READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!&quot;"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This book was one of the best novels I read since the outsiders. It is so full of adventure nd action i could hardly put it down. Martin,Gonff &amp; Dinny made a great team. i can't believe they killed Tsarmina. She was so evil and smart I thought they would eventually run away. But then Boar the fighter was found and all was better."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This book is the perfect prequel to Redwall. I loved the characters, especially Gonff, and everything else about it. A must read book. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. This message is going out directly to all the people who gave it 4 stars so if you're one of them listen up: &quot;SHUT UP!! You fools don't know what you're talking about!!&quot;"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mosslfower is by far one of the best books that I have read from the collection. It is a wonderfully written masterpiece that combines fantasy and adventure. The actuion leaves you on the edge of the seat, whjile the comedy sends you over on your side. Gonff the mouse is a holarious little thief that brings humor to the book that goes unmatched by any other in the collection. The animals come to life, through this great book. They are given great attitudes, and character. This book is well worth reading and definetly deserves any readers time. It is one of the best book i have ever read and you can say this to once you read it. I garuntee that."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Of all the books I read Mossflower is #1. &quot;Martin the warrior&quot; is fantastic. All through the book there is adventure and exitement, and yes, like all the others there is a quest going on in this one too. New caracters are all through the book. Best of all, in all the other books the caricters talk about Martin. I love all of Brian Jacques' books but personally this one's the best!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"From Tsarmina to Martin, Jacques creates a stuning world of woodland creatures. i love the squirrels and Tsarmina has got to be one of the best villians of all time. I'm in college and I still think she is pure evil."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is a remarkable book. Martin the warrior is thrown into a deungeon at the castle Kotir, but right before that he tells Tsarmina:&quot;Your father made a just decision,but you made the right one. You should have killed me when you had the chance, because I vow I will slay you one day.&quot; He is thrown in where he meets Gonff,the prince of mousetheves. Together with a young mole named Dinny,they quest for Salamandastron to find Boar the Fighter so he can help with the war. Tragecly Boar dies fighting against the searats;Martin and his friends take the ship where, amazingly, Martin reunites with his friend Timbalitso. In the war, everyone helps defeat Kotir, but in the end,it is Martin,alone and single handed, who kills Tsarmina. He is badly wounded and gets one last talk with Boar at the gates of dark forest before returning to the real world. I liked Mossflower because I feel like I am there along side the Corim. To me all of the places in the book are really there; I can go there and be a character."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is my favorite Redwall book in the series that starts with Redwall and as of now ends with Marlfox. Mossflower is the foundation for all the other Redwall books. It tells of the epic battle where the woodlanders of Mossflower Woods, led by Martin the Warrior, Gonff the Mousethief, Skipper the Otter, and Lady Amber the Squirrel, fight to gain back their freedom that was taken from them by the evil Queen Tsarmina the Wildcat. In this adventure, you will find that you get into the story as one of the woodlanders! I know everyone that reads this book will agree with me that Mossfllower is a great book."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The best of the Redwalls, without a doubt, must fall to Mossflower. Jaques does it agian, I absoulty loved this book. Mossflower is plainly amazing, the story has a wonderful plot with twists and turns running through.

I love this book and if I had it my way I would I would give it six stars and I strongly encourage everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is truly a wonderful book! Martin the Warrior arrives in Mossflower Woods, near the place that is going to be Redwall Abbey. He gets thrown in the dungeons of Castle Kotir, castle of wildcats and vermin.

Imaginative animals in realistic situations. Good book for most ages."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This was an awsome book. For all you people that want to get intrested in REDWALL series I sugest you start with this one. From my opioion. YOU WILL DEFINATELY GET HICHED."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I have read all of the Redwall books. This one was my favorite.Martin's sword is awesome.I am looking foward to the next book The Long Patrol, and there are rumors of other books in the making called Marlfox and Luke the Warrior, Martin's father."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"A great story if you read Redwall first.Gnoff acompanies Martin in his quest to Salamandstrom."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"A great story for learning how Redwall Abbey came about. The hero and his sidekicks, Gonff and Dinny, are very well characterized, as is the villain, Tsarmina. Heroic Heros and Villainous Villains. You'll be cheering the whole time."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is by far Brian Jacques' best work. It is somewhat remenescent of Robin Hood with it's rebel heroes (remarkably warrior mice) and tyrannical villains (interestingly wild cats and foxes). The reason I did not give this book a 10 is that the charactars are somewhat shallow.The hero is a bit too heroic and the villain is a bit too villainous. It could use a few more 'shades of grey', but it's nonetheless a great book.Don't be fooled by the mice and cats in this book, this is a violent book, but somewhat lighter than Brian Jacques' other works.I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is about Mossflower before Redwall was built. Tsarnima, the wildcat queen, is a ruthless despot of Mossflower, is tried to be overthrown by the woodlanders."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This easily is one of the finest books I have ever read. Engaging and fun, it fully takes you in depht to the characters personalities. You often find yourself wondering what's gonna happen to some of them."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This book was EXCELLENT!! My brother had read this and begged me to read it myself. I was bit skeptical at first, but as I progressed in the book, I could see what I had been missing. No matter what age or what gender, this book easy to understand and follow. It is a great story, and every child should own it."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"In this beautifully rendered prequel to Redwall, Brian Jacques tells of how Martin the Warrior came to Mossflower. Jacques uses masterful storytelling and high adventure in this story of Mossflower's own Revolutionary War. Martin and his friends, Gonff the mousethief and Dinny the mole, set off to find the ruler of the now famous mountain, Salamandastron. Meanwhile, Martin's friends mount a increasinly daring resistance to the wildcat ruler of mossflower. This book is far different from the other Redwall books, in that like &quot;Martin the Warrior,&quot; Redwall has not been built. The characters in this story are believable, noble, and at times terribly gluttonous. Gonff the mousethief is perhaps the best character ever created by Jacques. Readers of Fantasy will love this book down to the last word."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"\\"Mossflower\\" is the third audiobook I've listened to in the Redwall series, the other two being \\"Redwall\\" and \\"Taggerung.\\" The best thing about the series is the sense of being drawn into a charming world through Brian Jacques' vivid descriptions, rich vocabulary, and use of epithets and reoccurring scenes and character traits that create a sense of familiarity and connection to the Redwall world for the reader. Identifying the parts of the typical Redwall framework adds a layer of interest to listening to the story. The down side is (for the adult reader at any rate) the stories can become too predictable and the characters less archetype and more stereotype. There is no question as to which characters are Good and which are Evil, it's embedded in their species, and that sort of simplification tends to make the story slightly less compelling (for me, at least).Regarding \\"Mossflower\\" in particular, the storyline was consistantly entertaining, but there were some weaknesses with characters - I didn't find Martin to be that compelling as a hero, given his legendary status in the other books. The scenes with the Bad Guys were repetitive and Tsarmina was not a very nuanced antagonist, not a good leader, or much of a threat to the Good Guys - in contrast to Cluny in \\"Redwall\\" who was a fun character to watch and a viable threat. But even in \\"Redwall\\" the scenes with the villains were fairly one-note. Possibly it's the author's intent to make the evil side seem boring and futile and predictable, and the villains as dumb, easily led, and self-defeating. But for me the lack of subtlety takes away from the story.\\"Mossflower\\" didn't live up to \\"Redwall\\" in my estimation, but the Redwall world is fun to be drawn into all the same."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I think this is a thrilling adventure of Martin the Warrior and his new best friend Gonff. As they go questing with friends that they meet on the way, Log-log, and Denny, they crash their boat and wake up in a bat cave. They also get trapped in a frog cave and end up helping an eel. During the whole book, Martin is thinking about the oath he made to Tsarmina and how he would complete it. I think this book is great, but to really get the thrill, you need to listen to the audio version."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I first read this book when I was eleven, and seven years later it is still one of my favorite books. I do like it better than the original Redwall because it reads more like a fantasy than an old world childrens' story, which adds a deeper dimension to the characters and description.The book is written in a charming descriptive manner, with lively and distinct characters that makes it entertaining for an older audience as well as younger kids. I can almost say that Redwall peaked at Book 2, which is probably not a good thing for the series. After the fifth book or so, the series goes into rapid decline, so the newer ones are not too good.If you want to know which Redwall books to read, read Redwall, Mossflower, Mattimeo, Mariel of Redwall, Martin the Warrior, and Pearls of Lutra. In my opinion, these are the best, and that you need not bother with the rest of them. Perals of Lutra is a newer one, but unexpectedly good. At this point, Brian Jacques needs to revive the series, and bring his books up to the level of Mossflower, or just end it all together."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I enjoyed the first book better because the mole language in the second book is hard to understand. I still recommend the second book because it brings as much joy, laughter, and page-turning experience. The best character, in my opinion, is Gonff (and Martin!) If you love the first book, READ IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is as cute as the original Redwall novel, but with a slightly more complicated plot and style of writing. The sense of history that Mossflower contributes to the world of Redwall Abbey is delightful--here is the story of what is essentially the legendary past, yet it is told through the same sort of vivid and personal style as the first Redwall book. In addition to providing a sense of history, Mossflower also substantially expands the geography of Brian Jacques' fantasy universe. The characters' quest leads them through an amazing range of environments in which they encounter many new (and throughly charming or at least amusing) animal civilizations. All the while, the reader's knowledge of several more familiar animal cultures is expanded. This book is expecially informative regarding otters, badgers, and squirrels.In short, Mossflower is an adorable and fun read that expands the reader's knowledge of the Redwall world. My only reservation is that it is so similar in plot to the first book that it lacks some of that book's novelty and excitement."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is as cute as the original Redwall novel, but with a slightly more complicated plot and style of writing.

In Mossflower also lies Kotir, the castlethat holds so much evil.Martin the Warrior is a mouse that is very brave and courageous. He is strong heartedand true to his friends. Martin is certainly the perfect character.Brian Jacques is an excellent story teller and this is a story you can't let sit on yourbookshelf.

I got it from one of my friends for my birthday and I thought it would be too long to read. I had to do a book report and was reading Mossflower at the same time as my book for my book report. It ended up that I didn't like my other book at all and asked my teacher if I could change to Mossflower. She said that was fine and so I started reading more of it each day. One night I read until midnight! I loved how realistic it was. It really felt like you were right there. I could feel myself scared when Tsarmina plugged up the tunnels. I was curious when the hares took the four wanderers to Salamandastron. Some of the things that happened were totally unexpected, like at the end,but I won't tell what happens! You'll just have to read it yourself!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This is the second Redwall-series book, but is actually a prequel to \\"Redwall\\". The storyline is very thin, but it is certainly exciting for the kids with lots of action. My kids produced plenty of laughter due to the antics of Martin, Gonff, and Young Dinny. Jacques writes well, and this is to the benefit of my children who want to plow through the umpteen books in this series. One is enough, though, for me to read aloud. (For now, until they beg for more!)"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"It is all you want in a good book.It has just the right amount of action,peril,valor,and humor. If you want a book that is good for everyone, you just found one!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The Redwall series was recommended to me by my own readers, who recognized a similarity between the writing style, animorphism, and medieval setting of my own debut novel \\"The Other Side of Yore\\" and of Brian Jaques' famous books. As I learned more about the books, I was amazed that the books had escaped my attention for so long. Sure I had heard the name in passing, but I really didn't know what the books were about, and had probably passed them over as too child-oriented when I was a young blossoming fan of fantasy. Boy, had i been missing out!Mossflower may be the best YA fantasy book I've read since \\"The Hobbit,\\" maybe even surpassing \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" for imagination, superb writing skill, literary worth, and sheer reading enjoyment!Far from being just a book for young adults, I am well over thirty and highly critical of most fiction books, and was unable to put the book down. Not only does Jaques write in an incredibly skillful and beautiful style, but his plots and subplots are nothing short of genious. The character developement of the animorphed creatures is far superior to even the average bestselling author of fiction starring realistic human characters. Jaques is a master of dialogue and dialect, and I especially enjoyed the strange coloquial mole-speech;\\"Hurr, Oi be liken it moiself better'n any deeper-n'-ever pie oive et, stan' on moi hole!\\"The triumphs, determinations, and gallant speeches of Martin the Warrior actually brought tears to my eyes a few times during the tale, and the antics and humorous songs and poems of Gonff made me laugh out loud more than once.What's more, Jaques created a complex villian to be modelled by fantasy authors for centuries to come in the characterization of the wicked cat Tsarmina, and painted a thoroughly believable array of personalities and attitudes in the various soldiers of her army.Like Tolkien's work, Jaques has also done his homework thoroughly, and has created a vast history to support his tales, which I think is a trait missing from many of the more fly-by-night and commercial fantasies of today.By the end of this novel, you will have forgotten than mice can't talk and that badgers don't wield swords, having become intimately familiar with some of the most realistic personalities ever to grace the pages of a novel. I cannot recommend this book enough, and am sure that the others in the series will be equally delightful!J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"\\"Mossflower\\" is the epic prequel to \\"Redwall\\". Written by Brian Jacques, it is a book full of adventure and surprise.The peaceful woodland creatures of Mossflower are forced to live under the tyrannical rule of the evil wildcat queen, Tsarmina. That is until the coming of Martin the Warrior. Martin brings hope and promise to the animals of Mossflower. With the help of a mighty weapon, the habitants of Mossflower will ban together to take back what is rightfully theirs and put an end to the evil reign of Tsarmina.I highly recommend this book. It is full of action that draws the reader in and keeps him/her reading."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This and all the other Redwall books are marvelous! My favorite series. They are long enough to keep you going for a while, but short enough so that you will never, ever be bored. All the Redwall books are fantastic, but this takes the cake for best. A battle between good and evil. Fantasy but not kiddie. You don't have to be an animal lover to love this series. Try Mattimeo and the Ledgend of Luke also. If i could give it 100 stars, I would!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I read Mossflower, and so did most of my friends. We all agree that it was one of the best books we have ever read. This book was not the first of the Redwall seiries that I read, but it was the one that got me hooked. I have now read Redwall, Mossflower, Marial of Redwall, Martin the Warrior, Outcast of Redwall, Mattimeo, and probably a lot others that either I can't think of right now, or I am to lazy to type. As soon as I get off the computer, I am going to start the newest book, Pearls of Lutra. I love the Redwall books, and will probably still be reading them over again when I am in high school. The charecters are beautiful, and made just perfectly to fit the book. The book is packed with action, adventure, humer, stories, songs, ballads, dreams,feasts, and I think you get my point. Brian Jaques is a wonderful storyteller, and he shows it in this book. His feasts make your stomach grumble, with the berry flans, and hotroot soup, and strawberry tarts, and deeper'n'ever turnip'n'tater'n'beetroot pies. The battle scenes are discibed in idylic vivedness, with the plots to overcome Kotir. I think this may have been the best book I ever read"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"To me, this book is the greatest of the Redwall series that I've read (about 10 of the series). Since this tells us about how Redwall started and expanded the life of Martin the Warrior, this book is one of the most influential books to the others. Martin's sword appears in the series in almost every book, so this one is worth reading. Also, if this is the first Redwall series book you want, you will be surprised to find out that all the characters are animals! Since all of the books in the series are good, it is hard to choose which one is the best, but I think this one is. Furthermore, this book helps set the tempo in which most of Brian Jacques' books go by. Of course, what story is complete without a quest the characters have to do? In this thrilling book, Martin the Warrior sets off with his friend Gnoff the Thief to find a badger who could turn the tide in the battle against the evil warlord and lead the people in Mossflower to freedom.All in all, this is a great book. If you could only read one book in this series, this is the one to choose.K.Q."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The second book in the Redwall series, Mossflower provides much of the backstory for the first novel, Redwall, recording Martin the Warrior's time spent in Mossflower wood and his battle to free the natives from the tyrannical rule of Tsarmina the wildcat. Martin arrives as a stranger to Mossflower, but is soon imprisoned by Tsarmina. The wildcat breaks the sword of his father, and he vows to take her life. After his subsequent escape with the help of his friend Gonff and the animals of Mossflower wood, Martin sets out on a journey of riddle solving, traveling, capture, and escape in order to restore his father's sword to its glory, kill Tsarmina and destroy her castle Kotir, and bring freedom and peace to the inhabitants of Mossflower. This text shows remarkable improvement, both in style and in setting, from Redwall and even now remains one of the best books in the series. Martin is a true hero and an enjoyable protagonist, both supporting characters and villains are well-developed and interesting to read, Martin's jorney provides our first glimpse of Salamandastron, and the book provides much backstory to Redwall and creates a prime jumping off point for the many, many sequels and prequels that follow. This is one of my favorite Redwall books to reread, and I very highly recommend it.Where I sometimes feel frustrated by Redwall, Mossflower is truly a delightful, enjoyable read from beginning to end. Already in this second novel, all traces of the human influence visible in Redwall are gone, creating a more complete, independent world and more intelligent characters. The religious overtones are gone as well, Jacques' writing style has matured, and he has a greater grasp of the different beings, landscapes, landmarks, and mindsets within the world that he has created. As a result, Mossflower is a complete, highly enjoyable read by an accomplished author. It moves quickly and smoothly, manages to be funny, provoking, and emotional in turn, and is a truly engrossing and enjoyable read.Jacques is, however, almost too good at filling in all the backstory to Redwall--almost every character and location in that book is explained in this one, often providing answers that are too pat. It comes off as a bit scripted and pretentious, and the reader can get so caught up in looking for these connections that he becomes distracted from the story itself. These pieces of backstory do provide a more complete world, and in the following books Jacques will tempter, contradict, and expand upon them, but for now they do feel forced. However, this really is the most major drawback of the book. In all other ways, it is a well-written and exciting story.Mossflower is truly one of my favorite books in the Redwall series to come back to and reread. Martin is a inspiring, enjoyable protagonist--not cliched, not too funny, but very strong, independent, and realistically human and social. His journey to rebuild his father's sword is central to Redwall history, and it also is our first view of Salamandastron, which will become increasingly important in later books. The battles are memorable (although the final battle against Tsarmina does go a bit quickly), as are the characters (Skipper, Lady Amber, Mask, and Gonff all stand out in my mind). The is one of the books that I love to curl up and dive into, and it's prime material for getting lost in. I definitely recommend it if you're at all intested in the Redwall series."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Brian Jacques did it aqain. Another incredible epic with the mouse or should I say mice that created Redwall. Although this wasn't as good as the first one it is still an awsome book. About an over grown cat that is trying to take over mossflower when along comes Martin. He is here to save the day. Like in all of the redwall series there is a riddle that must be solved so that some characters will go on a journey. There is something that Brian does to his books so that they never get boring. I can never put it down because I have to turn the page to see what happens next. I don't think that this books is for just kids like me but it is for evryone. That includes the adults too. So if you haven't bought and read this book yet do it right now because it is not a waste of money. You will never regret reading this daring tale!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is an excellent addition to the Redwall series, and pretty soon my copy's going to fall apart; I've read it WAY too many times! I enjoyed reading this book for several reasons. First, it's exciting! The battles are in the right places, they're never drawn out, and they will always find a way to shock, amuse, or effect you. Second, the plot is an excellent and genuine find. It's not the same old, same old, plots that have found their ways into books. It's fresh. Third, it has Martin the Warrior in it. He's my absolute favorite character of all, and any book with him is fine by me.SUMMARY: For a long time, the peaceful land of Mossflower and its inhabitants were under the claws of Verdauga, King of a Thousand Eyes and a wildcat tyrant. When he falls ill, however, he passes on the ruling to his far crueler daughter Tsarmina. The peaceful woodlanders begin leaving the settlement as the evil wildcat demands more and more tribute to the wildcat fortress, Kotir. Because of this, Tsarmina declares a war on the woodlanders, knowing that she would have to weed them out before Kotir falls into famine (the soldiers are no farmers!). Just as things look pretty bad for the woodlanders who know little of war, a young mouse hero who was witnessed to beat up a patrol \\"single-pawed\\" (as in, weaponless) comes along. This hero, of course, is Martin.Soon, the woodlanders find a new hope. They are convinced that if they could contact Boar the Fighter, the badger ruler of Mossflower, they could defeat Tsarmina and her vermin horde. Bella, daughter of Boar the Fighter, calls upon Martin (who is accompanied by his friends Gonff the Prince of Mousethieves and Young Dinny the mole) to go to Salamandastron to seek out Boar the Fighter. In the end, however, it is brave, fearless, heroic (I'm naming a few of Martin's good traits. There are way too many!) Martin the Warrior who comes to battle Tsarmina!I won't say anymore. I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it! Anyway, read this book. It's excellent. The other Redwall books are excellent too, and I'm anticipating the arrival of \\"Triss\\" and \\"Loamhedge\\" in bookstores. Later!~*DatBzzEB*~"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I don't feel that I need to give you a whole bunch of reasons to read this book. Just read it and you will know why I feel this way. If you like mystery, comedy, adventure, love stories, battles, and/or poetry, you will LOVE Mossflower. I could not put it down!!!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Martin the Warrior Mouse, didn't know he was intruding on private property where strangers weren't allowed, when he stepped into the province of Kotir. The King, being a just, yet aging wildcat, saw more in Martin than the others. The King decided it wouldn't be wise to kill him, but the King's daughter, Tsarmina, a cold-hearted wretch, thought he deservd to be killed immediately. Tsarmina broke Martin's sword in her rage,a big mistake, for then Martin vowed he would slay her one day. Tsarmina poisoned her own father and then blamed it on her gentle, younger brother, Gingivere. She declared herself ruler of Kotir. She had Martin and Gingivere thrown into the dungeon. In the dungeon Martin met his cell mate, a prince of thieves by the name of Gonff. Gonff was a very comical character indeed ( he was my favorite) he always chanted verses of poems, even in the worst of times. Gonff and Martin became fast friends and decided to be mates. They both escaped out of the dungeon and went back to Mossflower. Bella of Brockall, knew as soon as she met Martin that he was a worthy one and sent him, Gonff and Dinny (the mole) on a mission to find Boar the Fighter who is also her father, in Salmandastron,( a land where no one has ever returned from) and tell him to come back to Mossflower for the mishap with Queen Tsarmina. As well as hearing Martin's quest, you also hear how the rest of the woodlanders dealt with Tsarmina's forces. Even though, Tsarmina's force's said woodlanders were dumb, the woodlanders would always outwit her forces somehow. In the beginning you really have to pay attention otherwise you'll put it down and miss out on it!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I loved reading the adventures of Marting the Warrior.

The young mouse, Martin, is a great warrior and is an exciting character to follow. He comes upon the land of Mossflower during his travels, a land ruled by the King of the the Thousand Eyes regime. The King treats Martin with respect, but his daughter murders him that night. The new Queen, Tsarmina, treats Martin terribly. She even breaks his father's sword. Martin vows to kill her for her actions. At the same time, the woodlanders are planning to revolt against the evil regime, because Mossflower is their land and it belongs to them.Martin must partake in a quest to a mythical place for a sacred item to help the Woodlanders win.This book was superbly written. Brian Jacques incorporated danger, suspense, romance and humor into this book. All these elements were put together into a great book. He made me feel like I was there during the battles between the Thousand Eyes army and the Woodlanders, they were that detailed and exciting. Martin's friend Gonff is quite the joker and had me laughing at times. I felt that I had known all the characters personally by the end. I found this book great and I can't wait to finish reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This was the first book I read in the Redwall series.

Martin has to go on an adventure to the great firey mountain called Salamandastron searching for Boar the Fighter, the one that could lead them to victory.

He masters it again when h ties so many stories together. Yuo shouldrwad this book!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Tied even for The Greatest Redwall Book Ever, the best features of this one are the originality of the setting, and the characters. Obviously, since Redwall Abbey hasn't been built yet, this dictates a very different, very interesting plotline, where the heroes are on the outside of the safe, comfortable fortress. This change might also be influential in the superb characters, or it might be that, as the second(third?) book written, Jaques has mastered the art without it becoming repetitious. Whatever the reason, Martin, Amber, and Skipper all have excellent personalities without being cliche, and the time is taken to develop them fully. Even Tsarmina is one of the most original, recognizable villains in the series. And lest I forget to mention, the plot is superb, with an engaging build up leading to a realistic ending that closes the story very well, while leaving one wanting to read the other books. This book is definetly the place to start the Redwall series, as the ones that come before it (Martin the Warrior, The story of Luke) are not nearly as well written, and best left until after one is already addicted, which this book will do to you in a few pages."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Martin is off to seek Salamandastron leader Boar the Fighter.

Martin's past is full of adventure, great moments, even love, but most of all, tragity. Anyways, about Mossflower: Wow! This book is really awesome, and my favorite charters were Martin, Gonff, Dinny, Skipper, Amber, Gingivere and basicly all the good guys. Also, have any of you that have also read Redwall noticed that the cat Julien that Matthias meets, well his full name is Squire Julien Gingevere. Gingivere was Tsarmina's brother in Mossflower. I bet that just could be where Jaqcques thought up his name: From Redwall, since I'm pretty sure he wrote Redwall first, even though Redwall comes after Mossflower. I bet Gingivere was Julians ancestor. hmmmmmm.... Anyhow, thought that was cool. Mossflower is a fabulous book, Martin is one of my favorite heros. Read it."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"this redwall tale has surely something to tell. it surely strikes the heart in adventure, its swashbuckling fights (my fav's) to its amazing characters. Mr. Jacques had certainly evovled in his writing skills after redwall. Yes, Mossflower is the second redwall tale, and if you have read Redwall the 1st book, you'll see the difference! well, let's begin with the plot. this story's plot is so different than the other stories, that you'll be craving for its twists, turns, and even zigzags! the battles range from Marin the Warrior and Gonff setiing a great trap for some baddies, Martin swishing his sword, taking a few heads, Tsarmina double-crossing some pesky partners, and to Boar the fighter cutting rats in two. The characters are superb! This time, the villains are not the only entertaing characters (that's what happens to any series, the villains make them good). Martin is a delight to meet, which makes the fact this book was the first to feature him. and Gonff is truly the mcoy! his joyous songs to his clever escapes to his brilliant nature, Gonff truly steals this book. As for Boar, he is truly a great character (even though he's only in a small part of the book), his dawning size to his great battle armor and blade, and to his great fighting skills, Boar truly is a badger lord. And as for the baddies. Sorry girls, but this is the only Redwall with a female villain (but the new Redwall book, Triss, is supposed to have one). This villain is the great Tsarmina! She is a ferocious wildcat Queen, skilled to the fang, with her great bow to her razor claws, she is 100 percent evil and dangerous. And so is Bane, the fox. he is quite the brilliant villain, with his mercanary clan to his great battle-skills. Only one thing is a cliche' in this book about the villains: Tsarmina goes insane for a bit. This has also happened to Gabool, Ublaz, Mokkan, Ungatt Trunn, and Slagar the Cruel. That's alot of insane rodents! well, that's about it,Mossflower is an amazing tale of friendship, laughter, gore, and sadness. So what are ye' waiting for?

If you like adventures, food and animals you'd love this book!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"With Mossflower, Brian Jacques has won the crown for today's best fantasy storyteller. He found a wonderfully successful formula with Redwall, and this one is an excellent addition to the series. Once again his descriptions are colorful, well-thought-out and delightful. The story trips along at a satisfying pace. There are places where the reader can't get enough, because the plot is so perfectly crafted. One of Jacques' strongest points is his ability to draw his reader into the story through deft character development and outstanding plot paceing. We get to see Martin the Warrior at his best, kicking some vermin tail. The wonderful moral center, faith and courage that the characters in all the Redwall books demonstrate makes these books that much better. Next to the book Martin the Warrior, this is the best in the series. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is really good.

I absolutely loved this book the first time I read it. You get so involved in it's storyline and the characters' and their journeys. This is great for a first time Redwall reader or a veteran reader. It's wonderful in any way. Martin the Warrior was pictured as an ancient hero is Redwall but this book chronicles the events of his journey through the vastness of Mossflower to save it from the Wildcat Queen Tsarmina. New areas of the land are explored in Mossflower that weren't in Redwall and (oh my!) there IS no Redwall Abbey. This book takes place in a time when there was no safety and the higher power was of course the evil power. But there's always someone who will stand up against that power...."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The most detailed of the Redwall books, but a teensy bitsluggish on the action.

It's about a very curageous warrior mouse called Martin who wants to destroy the evil wildcat queen Tsarmina who even poisens her father to rule all of Kotir and Mossflower."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This book is chronologically first in the series. If you would like to read this series begin with Mossflower, it makes it less confusing. This is the touching epic of the woodlanders of Mossflower Wood, and their fight for freedom against the tyrannical wildcat queen, Tsarmina. One day a traveling mouse called Martin the Warrior is captured by a party of Tsarmina vermin. He is thrown into the dungeon, right on top of Gonff the Mouse Thief! Here begins a wonderful tale of adventure, danger, and best of all, a happy ending. Well, thanks for your time. If you are considering reading this series, read it in chronological order. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Compared to this, they're nothing! This is definitley the best book ever! I haven't read this edtion, but I think the one I have is out of print. I loved this book. My favorite characters were Martin, Dinny, Gonff, Skipper, and Lady Amber. This is to anybody who gave it less than 5 stars: You have absoballylutley no idea what you're talking about, and if you don't like it, then you have no taste, and that's just too bad for you! I say, BUT THIS BOOK AND BUT IT NOW!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This has to be the best book I have ever read in my life, and that's sayong a lot. This book had it all, action, adventure, drama, and thanks to Gonff, humor. I've read Mossflower 12 times, and each time was a treasure. The plot was well laid out, and the characters were amazing. This is the best Redwall book, and I've read them all. If you want a great story with great battles, read this book. And if you don't like on;y battles, they also have a good mix of woodland life and an epic journey."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I remember when I first saw this book. I was in desparate need of a silent reading book that day, so I grabbed MOssflower, checked it out and ran to class.Well, I finished it in TWO DAYS it was so good! Then I bought the entire series! I read them over and over! I really disagree with the age level. COME ON! I'm above the age level and I LOVE the books! They are awsome!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I liked this book because it is a cool adventure. It is also my favorite book because it has a lot of action in it."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is my absolute favorite book of the series. It's amazing how different the good and evil creatures are: the loyalty and comradeship of the heroes and the treachery and deceit of the villians, but they all fit together like peas in a pod!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I haven't read all of the Redwall books in the series, but I have read most of them, and this one is definitely my absolute favorite! The other ones are just amazing with wonderful stories of good against evil and the Redwallers saving their abbey. This one, though, tells about how they freed their land from tyranny and claimed it for their own to make it a peaceful place to live and that is why I like it best. When people ask me what it's like, I tell them, &quot;It's kind of like Braveheart, only with animals.&quot; Brian Jacques does amazing work on these books. They are all so descriptive that you feel like your standing in Mossflower looking around. It is truly incredible to read. And, just as a side note, I think the animation on these books is just so cool looking. It gives you a good interpretation of Jacques' description of the land and characters. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Martin the Warrior, the legndary warrior of Redwall Abbey. To everyone in Redwall he's not only the founder of the Abbey but a hero to everyone. This is just one of his stories. In this story Martin arrives in Mossflower woods, seasons before the Abbey was built, only to find it rulled by wild cats. He dosen't know much about it but his fighting spirit gets him into trouble. The Kings daughter breaks his sword and thrown him in the dungon with Gonff the Prince of Mousetheives. Will he break out? ANd when he dose what will happen to him? Will he ever get vengence upon the terrible Tsarmina for breaking his sword.Mossflower is one of the earlier pieces of Brian Jacques work, and right up there with the best. If you loved the heroic acts of Redwall you'll love Martin. Now if I could just translate the molespeach everything would be perfect!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is awesome! Unlike other Redwall books in the series, the action starts in the first chapter. Martin the Warrior comes down from the Northlands and teams up with the Corim to defeat the wildcats (as seen in the tapestry) and free Mossflower. This excellent book also includes the first construction of Redwall Abbey itself. Yes, this book has Gonff the Prince of Mousetheives, Bella of Brockhall, Timballisto (friend of Martin), and many more! This book has non-stop action! Did I mention that this book is great? When you're reading, remember this: anything can happen!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I can truthfully say that this is by far the best book i have ever read in my life. Like the other books in the Redwall series this book starts out with one group of characters which splits into many more groups until they all converge in the end. There are many different scenes in this book and each one is filled with excitment and brand new interisting characters like toads and rabbits. If i could give this book more stars i would give it as much as i could!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This was a great book. It is the 2nd book in the Redwall Series and I could not put it down. Although it was not as good as the original &quot;Redwall&quot; it was a great page turner. I am going to go read the third one right away! A MUST READ"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This is a great book, especialy when Tsarnima gets wierd by listening to the ground! This book is packed with exitment, battles and written so well you could feel mossflower around you.

A captivating novel!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I have read this book 4 times and loved it everytime. It is very sad and funny and great. I loved it when they flooded the castle. Tsarnima was a great villian. It should be rewritten with more detail, more padges, and more battles then it would be a ten because I love long books."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"In this commendable novel, Brian Jacques creates a world of mice, moles, cats, badgers, and many other creatures. It is about a war against the destructive armies of Kotir, led by Queen Tsarmina, who are trying to take over Mossflower. In it, a mouse warrior named Martin is trying to save the woodlanders by making a journey into the unknown. In this story, Brian Jacques portrays the attitudes of each species in a certain way, but also includes the personalities of the individual characters. The author also has a diversity of vocabulary and writing styles, placing the storyline in with interesting details. This book also shows the reality of war. At first, I thought this book would be severely boring, but I was wrong. This book is an intriguing, well-written story. It has a unpredictable plot, lovable characters, and malicious villains. The only terrible bad part is how the author at some points leaves you hanging when he stops at the climax of the section. I enjoyed reading this book and would want everyone to read it. I would really recommend this book to all readers who love advernture, fantasy, excitement, and suspense."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"\\"Martin! Martin! Go get Salamandsrton and fight for the peace for mossflower \\"You should read this book, its amazing. This book is about Martin the Warrior that is trying to get to Salamandsrton territory but he cant find it . So he gets help from a badger that has a map hidden in his house to get to salamandstron . Once they find out the clues of the map and soon find their way to salamandsrton and fight for Mossflower grounds and peace. The theme of my book is even if youre are small you can overcome anything.Jacques never stopped writing. He also wrote the mossflower book because he wanted to make that world more colorful than redwall . He also write this book because animals are more identifiable to young readers and not adults. Brian Jacques also he doesn't like the term fantasy. \\"Courage form the hearts , not from the numbers that grow \\"-Dryden Annus Mirabilis. In Jacques books the courage of hundreds of animals fighting grows during battle even though the # fo fighting doensnt grow. I recommend this book to people that are kids and adults that have fun reading animal wars . Also who people who like animal stories"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The redwall books are wonderfull.They combine great characters and wonderfull stories along with consistant dialects. Not too mention the description of the food. Brian jacques writes for young adults but the charm enchants older adults as well. You can't help but fall in love with the characters and clear cut protagonists. The antagonists are truly antagonists giving you a stark line between good and evil black and white. Reading this book swept me away. The only fault that I could find in regards to this book is the simplistic plot and character developement. But hey this is a childrens book and I can live with it will all of the other wonderfull things going on it it"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I would highly recommend Mossflower to most any middle school student. The book is interesting because it has two plots running simeltanyisly. I also liked how the auther used animals for his main charecters. I disliked how some charecters died pointlessly. It was neat how the two plots met at the peak of the story."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This book is A MUST-READ BOOK. Filled with humor and friendship, not to mention of war this book, makes a miracle. I could not put it down until late in the night. Don't miss this awsome book from Brian Jacques."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"As soon as I started reading I knew this was no ordinary book. The plot is probably the most convincing and fascinating of all the books I have read!The characters are clear and convincing especially Queen Tsarmina.I think at the beginning when Tsarmina orders the death of her father we wish we had seen a bit more of him.I think the character of lady Amber is not fully portrayed In this fast paced adventure thriller. Nevertheless I think this is a spectacular work of literature and should be read by every kid in the world who would like a break from civilisation,a brilliant adventure and a book that takes you into the thick of its own world."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"especialy this one? I may be only 11 but I've read every book except Marlfox,( I'm waiting for paperback)in this series and this one kicks butt!! When I first looked at it I was trying to win a contest at my school and I thought that it was going to be long and dull. Boy was I wrong. If anyone out there is thinking what I thought, DON'T!!!!! Byfar the best of the series my favorite characters are, Martin, Gonff, Lady Amder, Skipper, Bella, Columbine, and Gingivere. My favorite part is when Martin and Gonff are locked up. &quot;We could take this place single pawed with a stick. What a useful thing to send us!&quot; Any reader of any age would love this book! It keeps you on the edge of your seat. Unlike some books it gets you really atached to the characters. I cried near the end. I've read this book three times and I enjoyed all 3 times. Read this book!!!! Sasha Ann Scott Age:11"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"A masterful story of cunning, treachery, determination, and bravery. Brian Jacques' tale ofhow the Redwall Abbey came to be is truly a must-read for any fan of the Redwall series, and foranyone who has not read one of the Redwall books, Mossflower is a great place to start!The storyis full of riddles, songs, memorable characters, and one cannot forget the battles of the peaceloving woodland creatures versus the evil troops under the command of the the merciless wildcatTsarmina. The brave Martin, clever Gonff, the strong Skipper of the Otters and a plethoraof other colorful characters make this book one not to miss. There's something for everyone inthis book, action, humor, love, mystery, and riddles that make the mind boggle!Truly one ofBrian Jacques' best and most beautifully done works, also a fantastic tale for all ages! This wasthe first of Jacques' books that I ever read, and I've looked forward to any of his new booksever since"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Although the original &quot;Redwall&quot; is probably the best-written novel in the series, one gets the impression that Brian Jacques was still feeling out his style at the time of writing. The original book is a gem of creationism -- it &quot;founded&quot; the entire world of Redwall -- but it is in the follow-up prequel, &quot;Mossflower,&quot; that Jacques truly masters his art.&quot;Mossflower&quot; features the best hero (Martin's first appearance) and by far the best villain (the deliciously evil Tsarmina). It also contains the best epic journey (the original trek from Mossflower to Salamandastron) and the best final battle (Martin's unforgettable encounter with Tsarmina). And as an added bonus, Jacques wrote himself into this novel, in the form of the mousethief Gonff.The world of Redwall is an enchanting one, but in the later books Jacques seems to be running out of originality. For his heroic style in all its original glory, &quot;Mossflower&quot; is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This one competes with The Bellmaker for the title of Best Redwall book... everWhereas the Bellmaker drew a lot of interest from its new, foreign setting, Mossflower achieves a sense of unfamiliarity by setting the book in the area around Redwall before the abbey existed, allowing the reader only a sense of distant affection.It's this sense of affection that buffers the varied, likable cast of humorous, multi-talented, heroic, and resourceful characters as they battle one of the canniest villains in all the Redwall books.It's a classic that massively influenced my childhood and cognitive growth... in a very pleasant way. I'll never forget what Mossflower did for me."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The Redwall series is absolutely fantastic. Even now, at the age of 19, I reread them for fun. I am an avid reader, and yet, it is really difficult for me to compare these books to anything else. I would love to be able to say that Artemis Fowl, Harry Potter, and the Inheritance Cycle are similar, but they are not. Brian Jacques wrote these novels specifically for blind children, so they are extremely descriptive (compared to other children/teen novels).I strongly recommend any person from the ages of 7 to infinity to read these novels. I started in third grade if I remember correctly, and have never stopped. If anyone happens to stop by Sienna Crossing Elementary back in Houston, you'll see the legacy I left behind in the library (a giant mural of Martin the Warrior)."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The Redwall and Mossflower Woods books are one of those rare series of books that will allow you to escape the daily grid and responsibilities.

This book provides the backstory of how Martin the Warrior came and saved Mossflower from the evil rule of the crazed wildcat Tsarmina. This is the story of the exiled woodlanders, not free to live in peace, because of the cruel wildcat rule. When the Warrior comes to them, he convinces them to fight for their freedom, instead of hiding out for the rest of their lives.This is a sprawling adventure story, and I liked it more than &quot;Redwall&quot;. The characters are all likeable, and the adventure is even larger, as Martin and his friends quest to Salamandaston, home of the great badger kings who once ruled Mossflower in peace and tranquility. There are battles aplenty here, and despite the young targeted audience, Jaques keeps up this spirit of war with lots of violence and bloodhsed. The theme of this book could be the courage of a few saving many, or the desire to fight for what one believes in.This is a very good book, giving the history behind the creation of Redwall Abbey, and how its inhabitants came to the head of Mossflower woods. It also makes more sense of &quot;Redwall&quot;, as we know more about the mouse that Matthias and the entire population of the Abbey revere and speak about as though legend."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The book I read was called Mossflower by Brian Jacques. I liked the book because it was exciting and very adventures. A reason would be thatthe three friends Martin, Gonff, and Dinny the mole had to run from the kortir soldiers while tring to make it to Salamandastron to find the mighty Borh the warrior.The best part of the book was when the Woodlanders attacked the worriors of kortir army. The fight raged on on and off through the week. Near the end of the fight the woodlanders pushed the kortir army back and then celebrated their first victori.The most vivid part of the book would be the settings and the characters. You could always picture the setting in your mind. For example when the woodlanders where sneaking across the edge of the woods to make chibb the robin be a spy for them and then when martin the warrior went to the pond and the swan there ate one of the kortir soldiers and the others went fleeing for their life. Then for character you have the mask and how he dresses to look like different animals."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This is the action packed sequel to Martin the Warrior as well as a prequel to Redwall and it's squels.

I hope all the other redwall books are just as good and plan on getting one by one."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Amazing!!!!!! I love this book, it's exciting, humorous, and action-packed! Mossflower truly has something for everyone, from romance to wit, from intrigue to everything else. After taking over Mossflower, the cat warlord Verugdiga Greeneyes is poisoned by his own daughter, the evil Tsarmina. She rules Mossflower with a cruel iron paw, making life miserable for the woodlanders who live there. But when a mouse warrior from the north ,Martin, comes, it seems they may have some hope. He must journey to the great moutain of Salamandastron, to get help from the great badger Lord who rules there. He must do this with two companions, one of which (Gonf the Mousethief) is having trouble leaving behind his lovely Columbine.Read this book, you'll love it!A note from Lizzla's Mom: This is a wonderful series which, like J.K. Rowling's books, has appeal for all ages. I have enjoyed reading Brian Jacques' wonderful melange of fairy tale, fable, classical tragedy and comedy. A blend of Shakespeare and Disney - the books are entertaining, fast-paced and adorable (just like Lizzla!). Highly recommended *****.-Lizzla's Mom"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"'Mossflower' is the follow-up to 'Redwall', a great adventure story that introduced us to a land of mice.

He finds the Mossflower woods groaning under the oppression of Old Lord Green eyes and his crazy daughter Zarmina. He gets together with some local woodlanders and they come up with a plan to bring the that empire down.Good book, giving animals human characteristics is not wholly an original idea but Brian Jaquas does it exceedingly well. If you are thinking about reading this book to younger children don't(the good guys don't exactly win in all instances). There more then enough in the way of plot to also keep older audiences interested."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I really enjoyed this book, because it was a very good science fiction/ fantasy book. It was a very good book that kept me wanting to read it more and more to see what happened next. I couldn?t put the book down once I began reading. It was about talking animals with a problem. Martin a warrior mouse was traveling from his home land, searching for his father when he was captured. He was thrown in the jail of Kotir in mossflower. He later finds out the all the woodland animals in mossflower are being enslaved and attacked by wildcats and there army. After being helped by the woodlanders he decides to stay with the woodlanders and help them defeat the intruders. With his new found friends he sets out to the mountain of Salamandastron to get help from a great warrior badger. On the way they overcome many hardships. While back in Kotir the rest of the woodlanders find out other ways to stop the intruders.I rate this on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, a 5. I rate this a perfect five because this is just the kind of book I enjoy reading. This book also has a lot of action and fighting in it which kept me wanting to read more."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"i think you should read redwall books.its about animals that fight for their fredom.my favorite one is mossflower.what happens is that this mouse who came from another country and he saves other creature from assflower."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I think Mossflower is the most phenomenal book I ever read. It is written by Brian Jacques, who I think is the best suspense writer. It is about a brave mouse named Martin who breaks the law that trespassers must not carry weapons. He got ambushed by three weasels, he whooped them until they finally tied him up and brought him to the castle, and threw him into the dungeons. About a week later a mouse thief gets caught and gets thrown in with Martin. But he is a well connected thief. So his friends, CORIM (counsel of resistance in Mossflower) tries to get the thief (Gonff) and then rescues them both. After awhile, Bella (the leader of CORIM) wants Martin, Gonff, and a young mole named Dinny, to go find her father (Boar) at salamanderson to help fight the evil queen Tsmania (at the castle). Will they find him? Is he dead? Find out by reading the book. I'm am 10 and live in California, email my mom at jjjeanie@aol.com"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This book is an AWESOME fantasy novel! It has lots of action, perfect decriptions, one really evil character(tsarmina), one funny and likeable character(gonff), a hero(martin) and a ton of great supporting characters! Mossflower is one of the best fantasy books I have ever read! I can't wait to read the rest of the redwall books because they all sound good too! So buy Mossflower if you are into exciting, descriptive fantasy novels because this is the perfect example of one!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I think Mossflower is one of thebest books I've ever read. The book follows four basic groups throughout it. The first group is the Corim. They're like a rebel group against this communist-like group. The main leader of the Corim is Bella, a local badger of the area. They try to take over what was once theirs from Tsarmina. The second group is Queen Tsarmina, a wildcat, and her army. Her father took over Mossflower and treated the woodlanders nicely. Tsarmina didn't like this, so she killed him. She now rules Mossflower with an iron glove. She blames her brother, Gingevere, for the murder and sends him to jail. The third group is Martin the Warrior, Young Dinny the mole, Gonff the mouse theif, and Log-a-Log the shrew. Each have a different story. They are sent out by Bella to find Salamadastron to bring back her father and husband to overthrow Tsarmina. The last, and least important group, is Argulor. He is an eagle who deperarely wants to eat a pine marten. He has an intense rivarly with Tsarmina. You may not think he's important, but he is. I've read other Redwall books, but htis is one of the best. Every Redwall fan should read it."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This is an excellent book that tells of the founding of Redwall Abbey. A must read first kinda book. A perfect beginning of a seris to a great end, Brian Jaques is a must-read-his-books-author, this perfect book is a must-read, deffinetly!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I love these books, there fairly well written, with charectors you adore, and plots you can really get into. But the one thing I could never stand about these books was the whole. &quot;Spirit of Martin visited me in a dream...&quot; &quot;Martin sent the sword to me from the sky...&quot; or &quot;Martin the Warrior's spirit is speaking through you...&quot; Well when my mother (who reads all the books out loud to us) got to this book, we were all greatful to be rid of the whole 'spirit of Martin' and we could get back to enjoying the charectors and getting into the plot. Also this book had some exceptionally great charectors, and Martin was so much better in this book then in Martin the Warrior, I think. So please read this one, it is my absolute favorite so far, I have yet to read Legend of Luke, Pearls of Lutra, Marlfox, or Outcast of Redwall. Though I am sure they too will be great...as long as the Spirit of Martin isn't too prominant...."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This book was the perfect prequel to Redwall. I loved the plot, the characters, and the layout. This is the 5th Redwall novel I own and I plan to collect the entire series due to this book. It is very pivitol in the series. It is a must have in the Redwall series."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Just in case you aren't sure about this book, GET IT! It's the best book ever written in the best series on earth. All the other books are great too. Brian Jacques wrote it for blind kids originally, so the detail is amazing! I had the privilage to meet the author and he is really nice. Get this book for anyone! You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower is really a charming book. All the characters are so unique, and by the end of the book, you really feel like you know them, even though they are animals. Most of the time, you forget they are animals because they have such human characteristics. Jacques is an excellent author, and rarely do you get bored reading his books. Mossflower is excellent, and I think it appeals to animal lovers. And after you read this book, you'll want to read the rest. Each book leads into each other, and they are so charming. If you like animals, adventure, and historical fiction, you'll like this."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"If you thought Redwall was good, you'll be surprised at how good Mossflower is. Though Mossflower is a prequel to Redwall, you pick Mossflower up and you won't be lost in the dark. Mossflower tells the tale of Martin the Warrior mouse and his first real adventure. The book has vivid characters that make you part of the book. And if you finish Mossflower and you want more(which you probably will), check out the next book in the series, Mattimeo, another great Brian Jacques book."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This was our family's first foray into the Redwall series, and frankly I'm a bit disturbed by all the reviews saying Mossflower is the best of the lot. If so, then we've a lot ahead of us to endure. It's not great literature, it's overwritten, the violence is often over the top, and yet some passages are so obscure they need explaining. Even so, I'll admit my five year old boy loved the book--his first 'chapter' book. Now he wants to be a warrior mouse. Hmm. Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed it, but an attentive parent will want to edit as he reads. I am grateful for those frequent parts where Jacques explains that violence and death are bad but that sometimes the only choice for peaceful woodland creatures who want to stay free is to fight. Actually a quite realistic message. The world of Mossflower is quite as fallen as our own. Christian parents take note: death means going to 'the gates of Dark Forest,' and, though there are Christian virtues here, they are never so called."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This book... stinks. This book... is not good. This book... I'll stop now. As you probably guessed from the title, I don't like this book. I never will. It is dull in comparasin to other of Brian's greats such as Mariel of Redwall, or Redwall for that matter. As one can come to expect, the baddies are helpless jerks. They attck each other in the middle of the knight, and rush out of doors that they know have arrows flying at them. The only half bright bad guy is Bane, a leader of a group of mercinaries. There is a totally needless insertion of a half blind eagle into the book who dies without doing any damage. [Well, he takes Bane with'im]. I fail to see how a giant wildcat can be scared into death by a mouse. This book is as exciting to read as it is to watch paint dry."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I had read Redwall and enjoyed it greatly. This book was very disappointing. It was so slowly paced I have not read any others in the series despite strong recommendations from friends. I'll take Tolkien."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I don't know what it was about this book that made me want to read it over and over again. It didn't have any colosal {I don't know if I spelled that right} battles or anything. I guess it was just the amazing storyline! The adventure was fantastic, but I honestly like whats going on with the woodlanders better than Martin the warriors journy, more action happens with them. In all, this is one of the best Redwall books, complete with an awesome one on one battle at the end. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"\\"The arrow flew through the air and pieced Martin in the shoulder, he didn't flinch.\\" This is a snippet of Brian Jacques' book Mossflower. Mossflower is Brian Jacques' second book in the Redwall series, a series that talks of the adventures of many animals connected in some way to the abbey called Redwall.In Mossflower, Tsmaria, a vicious wildcat, has taken over the village in Mossflower woods and all its creatures, including hedgehogs, moles, squirrels, otters, mice, etc. These creatures are called Woodlanders. The Woodlanders used to live in the village and farm the nearby land, but Tsmaria changed that. She taxed the creatures so heavily that they were forced to retreat deeper into Mossflower woods. One day Martin the Warrior, a mouse, stumbled upon Mossflower and joined the Woodlanders. Bella, a badger and one of the leaders of the Woodlanders, saw great courage in Martin so she sent him on a quest. The quest: to bring her father, Boar the Fighter, back to Mossflower to free them from Tsmaria. Gonff, prince of mouse thieves, and Dinny, a mole, went with Martin to Salamandastorn, a badger mountain, where Boar the Fighter was living.Mossflower is a good book in many ways, it combines adventure, battles, strategy and trickery into an outstanding story. I like how the battle scenes are described and how he gives some foreshadowing in the beginning. I also like how the ending does not end abruptly and quickly, there's some suspense. Brian Jacques did a stellar job in creating this book; he is one of my favorite authors. Other Redwall books Brian has written are Martin the Warrior, The Long Patrol, The Legend of Luke, Redwall, Pearls of Lutra and many more. I have liked all of his books but Mossflower was my favorite and I encourage you to read it."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Do you think Martin and his friends can overthrow the wicked Tsarmina? Join them on their quest for Salamandastron, the mountain of the fire lizard, to find out. The book Mossflower tells the tale of brave Martin and his friends vanquishing evil and restoring peace."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"In the exciting tale Mossflower, Brian Jacques makes up an adventure that you'll never forget. Mossflower is one of the stories in the Redwall series. This tale is about the gallant Martin the warrior. Martin comes to an old woodlander village. He meets some pretty interesting people such as Dinny the mole, Fortuna thye vixen, and the great prince of thieves Gonff. Martin and Gonff met when they were in the Mossflower dungeon. They both went on the Kotir palaces ground, and got jailed. They eventually escaped from the unilateral evil queen Tsarmina. When she heard that they escaped, she ordered war on the woodlanders. In the battle, the woodlanders were losing by a significant margin. Dinny, Martin, and Gonff had a savvy of when they asked them, to find Boar the fighter. If they got him on their side, they would win the war. They will travel to Salamandastron to find him. On their way, it brings them many questions. Will they even find Salamandastron? Who are their enemies? Who are their allies? Who will help them? Will they come back? Brian Jacques' novel will make you think and fantasize a world like his description. I highly recommend this exciting nailbiter."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I am a die hard Redwall fan and this is by far my favorite book in the series. It explains the history of Redwall and how it came to be, with Martin the Warrior and many others rising up against the evil wildcat Tsarmina. Brian Jacques is a great writer and this has a particularly great plot. There is peace and happiness, war and sadness, victories and losses, and love and hatred. There is no boring part of the book, and you are always kept on your toes, reading ahead to find out what happens next. Young and old alike will love this book, i guarantee. I really recommend that everyone who hasn't already, buy this book!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower!!!! Another adventure by Brian Jacques tells the story of woodlanders oppressed by a crazy wildcat queen until one day a mysterious mouse comes to free them all... this is one of my favorite books by B.J. I could not stop reading it! The author gives wonderful incites into the world of the creatures of mossflower as he breathes life into the most wonderful characters from quaint moles to hearty otters to hotheaded squirrels to even a prince of mouse thieves! And he gives a sense of being there, as if you are right there in the action.I would recommend this book if you have any imagination at all, love fantasy or if you are a young reader looking for an adventure. I would not recommend this book if you are not a fiction reader, or if you do not have an imagination, or if you were never ever a child.Brian Jacques is one of the best authors I have ever read the books of and I highly recommend these books for all ages."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I'm enjoying this series quite a bit. It's not deep literature, but it's fun, with heroic heroes and villainous villains. The characterization is fluffy but entertaining. I have to admit that I enjoy the stereotypes associated with each of the woodland critter species (especially the moles): is that wrong? At least in this book some of the protagonists try to rescue a stranded rat, even though the rats are always villains.I'm a little disturbed over the treatment of the young hedgehogs Ferdy and Cogs. The adult character encourage them to act like soldiers, which is cute until the little ones take it too seriously and end up getting captured, which in turn leads directly to the deaths of several unnamed characters. And yet no one ever reprimands them, or even explains to them what they did wrong.The full-cast audio production adds a lot to the enjoyment, even though the changes in audio levels are so great that some characters are deafening (especially Bor the Fighter). I have trouble wrapping my brain around this being an abridged production of the original book. It's long.As always, the characters are obsessed with food. Don't read or listen if you are hungry. Otherwise, enjoy."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This is in my opinion one of the best Redwall books. The story of a band of woodland creatures resisting the tyrannical reign of the evil wildcat queen Tsarmina, this book has lots of fighting and battle scenes. It is also the first book in which Martin the Warrior appears, the heroic mouse from the northern coast destined to free Mossflower from the cat's oppressive rule! This is the first Redwall book I ever read and it is one of my favorite books of all time! I would give it ten stars if I could!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Now before you begin rolling your eyes at yet another review in which the reviewer rambles on and on about how this is the best Redwall book, I want to make something clear: this is not the best written book in the series nor is it the most original. But it was the first Redwall book I ever took the time to read and I was instantly hooked. Though you may be able to find more lively characters and more descriptive battles in other Redwall installments, I truly feel that Mossflower captures the essence of what the Redwall series is. The witty songs, the thrilling battles, the delectable feasts, the steadfast friendships, a variety of characters, and laugh-out-loud humor are all what make the Redwall series so enjoyable to read.Mossflower is the second installment of the Redwall series. It is the book that gives us some insight into the story that came before the red walls of the abbey rose. Martin the Warrior, a courageous mouse from afar, comes upon Mossflower country and is captured by the army of Lord Verdauga, the wildcat that rules Mossflower. But Verdauga is soon murdered by his wily wildcat of a daughter, Tsarmina, who is a more barbaric ruler than her father ever was. Martin and a newfound friend, a prankster mouse thief by the name of Gonff, escape from Tsarmina's castle, Kotir. Martin meets Gonff's friends, most of them poor woodlanders, broken by Verdauga's rule. But Martin soon rouses the fighting spirit the woodlanders never knew they had, and they all find themselves caught up in a war between the forces of good and evil, in a forest called MOSSFLOWER.Though some may question my opinion, Mossflower is my favorite Redwall book. I will remember it and reread it until my memory fades and my eyes are too weak to read with. Happy Reading! :-D"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I've read all of the Redwall books (after the first two, I read them about a book per day) and I must say, this one is one of the better ones out of the series. Martin was always my favorite character in the Redwall series and Mossflower brings him back, along with a few other likeable creatures. This story is what happens after Martin The Warrior. Martin travels to the land of Mossflower only to find it has been taken over by Verdusa (something like that, I can't really remember) Greeneyes and his evil daughter, Tsarmina Greeneyes. After Verdusa dies, Tsarmina takes over, and this means trouble for the woodlanders. Tsarmina is the epitome of evil. She kills for fun and lies her way out of things.So, its up to Martin and the woodlanders to fight for the freedom of Mossflower.If you liked this book, definatly read the rest of the series, and if you like Martin, read Martin the Warrior and Legend Of Luke"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This Redwall novel is and has been my favorite Redwall novel made yet.

I finished the book by the next day, reading non-stop. I then bought every book in the series, and they are great. The author makes the world come alive to the reader and makes them want to enter into that world of wonder.

I'm 19 years old and I remember my 5th grade teacher reading me this book when I was 10! From that point on I have collected all the books in the series. I remember being able to identify with Martin and his followers from day one. Everyone in my class (even the class clown, David!) loved the time when our teacher would whip out her paperback and pick up where she had left off the previous day. Everyone groaned when the rats and ferrets chased after the otters, everyone held their breath when the Gloomer was sent in the water. Everyone laughed when Gonff danced with the crab. Everyone was spellbound with delight when Martin and Gonff met the hares, and everyone cheered when . . well I'm not going to say! The tone and style of the story weaves itself around you until you are spellbound by its magic. Even though the reality of animals talking isn't possible, in Mossflower you accepted that they did and moved on to the adventure. The characters were all well developed and there was just enough flat characters to contrast with the dynamic ones. The result is that you get a sense of realistic stability not often found in a talking animal book. The obvious character foils made you sense the good and evil and you take a side; the side you stick with until the end. All in all, this book is a classic. The poetry, the words, the characters, and best of all the magic, make it come alive into your heart, imagination and soul. This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"One series to rule them all...A dark army that has overrun the land. An unlikely hero on sent on an epic quest. A sword that is broken and forged anew. A search for the lost king. I could easily be describing Lord of the Rings! I have read several books in this amazing series (and shall not stop till I have read them all), but so far this one is undoubtedly my favorite. When you read Redwall and Mattimeo (and some of the other books in the series), you feel as if it's set in the present. But when you read the books about Martin the Warrior, the legendary hero of Redwall Abbey...The time of great heroesWhat can I say, reading Mossflower is like reading a book about the legend of King Arthur or Robin Hood. You're stepping back in time to an era when villains were more wicked, heroes were more brave, and the country was more wild. The story begins with Martin entering the country of Mossflower and then swiftly being imprisoned because he is carrying a sword. The ultimate climax of the book is set up swiftly when Martin swears vengeance upon the evil Queen of the land (who in an awesome scene breaks Martin's sword and tells the guards to have him wear it around his neck). But even for the Hero Martin, vengeance doesn't come easy.Have you ever been on a quest?Like Redwall, there is a major sidequest for our hero to embark upon (you can't kill the main villain with a broken sword now can you?), involving a search for the old Badger Lord king of Mossflower. Also like Redwall, there will be clues to unravel, friends to make, and alliances to forge. And like the great Lord of the Rings, there will also be beautiful songs to sing and poems to read.Hungry yet?And let's not forget about the fantastic way the author has of drawing up beautiful descriptions without overloading the reader. The Redwall foods in particular are famous, and for good reason. When reading this book you'll not only feel every mile of the journey, you'll also mouth-water every time the food is described. Good stuff.A battle between good and evilUltimately, what holds this book together is wonderful characters and the way that they interact together. Even the villain is not simply an evil tyrant bent on evil purposes. There is a depth of character here that few books can touch in my opinion. And the icing on the cake is the irony and action that's to be found. The battle sequences in this book will enthrall you, and way things work out is really pulls at you emotionally. There is strong narrative here. And I cannot and will not ever forget the ending of this book. It stands as one of the greatest endings I've ever read in any book. Every story of a legendary hero needs a showdown, and the one in this book is incredible.In the End...Mossflower is more than just a good book. It is a GREAT book. It is the story of the origins of a legendary Abbey, a Legendary Country, and a Legendary Hero. To readers of the Redwall books it is an essential buy. To all others it is without a doubt an essential read. If you only read one book in the series, let it be this one."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I think that Mossflower is simply the most fantastic book in the whole Redwall series, and close to perfection. This is the story of how Martin the Warrior, a legendary hero, came to Mossflower country. It is a time of desparation, when no one is safe from the evil Tsarmina and her army. Unlike the other Redwall books, this story has an uncanny sense of adventure, soul, suspense, and humor. The characters are larger than life. Mossflower chronciles how all the great legends of Redwall came to be, and you see how the characters became part of ancient legend. It is a wonderful book, and unparalled in its grand storytelling."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I have read every Redwall book from Redwall to The Legend of Luke. i am going to get Lord Brocktree once it comes out. This is the second-best book in the series, the only one better is Pearls of Lutra. Mossflower has villains you will hate with all of your heart and heroes you just can't resist, such as Gonff who teaches a crab to &quot;dance&quot; on his route to Salamandastron, home of the badger Lord Boar the Fighter. The evil wildcat queen, Tsarmina's, tyrannical reign needs a quick finish, and Martin the mouse is the one to do it. Oh and by the way, &quot;Tsarmina&quot; is a play on &quot;tsarina&quot; with &quot;mean&quot; added in."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"&quot;Mossflower&quot; is about Martin the Warrior, the legendary character mentioned in &quot;Redwall,&quot; the book that came before this one in the Redwall series.In the beginning of the book, the mouse Martin is traveling through Mossflower woods, the future site of Redwall Abbey. The forest and its inhabitants are under oppression by a fearsome wildcat known as Verdauga Greeneyes, Lord of the Thousand Eyes. He has two children--a gentle son named Gingivere, and a merciless, cruel daughter called Tsarmina. The wildcat family is served by hundreds of soldiers. The family and their horde live in a fortress called Kotir.Martin has a sword hanging around his neck; it had once belonged to his father, Luke the Warrior. When Verdauga's soldiers see him walking through the forest with the sword, they arrest him on the charge of bearing arms and drag him to Kotir. He fights them fiercely all the while. After struggling with him for a while, the soldiers manage to drag him to Verdauga's chamber, where the wildcat is laying in his bed, ill. Although Verdauga admires the mouse's courage and spirit. Tsarmina, however, expresses feelings of disgust, snaps the sword in two, leaving only the hilt hanging around Martin's neck, and throws him into one of Kotir's dungeons.Meanwhile, the carefree mouse Gonff, a thief who calls himself the Prince of Mousethieves, is making his way back from Kotir, where he has stolen food. Gonff is a member of CORIM, the Council of Resistance in Mossflower, which is an organization set up by the forest dwellers to fight Verdauga's tyranny. Gonff lets his guard down and manages to get himself captured by two of Kotir's soldiers. He is taken to the fortress and put in the same dungeon cell as Martin, where the two become friends. Gonff knows just how to escape the cell, and does so, taking Martin with him. They go straight to the headquarters of CORIM, the mansion home of a female badger called Bella of Brockhall.Martin is welcomed by the CORIM leaders, and he decides to help them with their mission. He befriends Lady Amber, the leader of the squirrel population, and Skipper of Otters, the chieftain of an otter tribe who dwells in nearby River Moss, along with many others. Gonff remains his best friend, along with a mole called Young Dinny.At Kotir, the ruthless wildcat Tsarmina poisons her father and accuses her kindly brother Gingivere of the murder. Gingivere is imprisoned, and Tsarmina is proclaimed the new Queen. She promptly embarks on a reign of terror. The woodland dwellers become more desparate than ever to overthrow the wildcats.Bella of Brockhall has convinced Martin that the only way to get rid of Tsarmina and her minions for good is to fetch her father, Boar of Brockhall, who is a formidable warrior. He dwells in an extinct volcano known as Salamandastron, a long journey from Mossflower. Martin agrees to make the journey, along with Gonff and Dinny. They set out immediately, but are followed for a good part of the journey by three of Tsarmina's bumbling soldiers. Along the way, they befriend a shrew called Log-a-Log, who assists them by letting them use his boat to travel on the river. They get lost inside a pitch-black mountain, where they are helped by some bats. At last they reach Salamandastron.If you want to find out what happens to the three friends, read &quot;Mossflower,&quot; by Brian Jacques, one of the best books I've read to date."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This book follows &quot;Redwall&quot; in the book series of the same name. The central character is Martin the Warrior, the legendary mouse warrior to whom a reference appears in every Redwall book. It tells readers how he obtained his famous sword and defeated the wildcat queen, Tsarmina. Before the arrival of Tsarmina's warlord father, Lord Verdauga Greeneyes, the inhabitants of Mossflower (a heavily wooded area) lived independently and peacefully. However, Verdauga and his large army storm through the woodlands and conquer them, setting up residence in a huge abandoned fort called Kotir. At the time that the story takes place, Verdauga is on his deathbed. Tsarmina poisons him and frames her gentle, just brother Gingivere as a murderer, ordering that he be locked up immediately. Just before this happens, Martin is also locked up for traveling through the territory while armed (although he was unaware of the law against armed travelers). His weapon is a rusty old sword that once belonged to his father. Cruel Tsarmina breaks the heirloom and hangs the hilt around Martin's neck so that he will never forget to obey the laws of Kotir. Instead, Martin vows to Tsarmina that one day he will kill her. She has him locked up in the dank dungeons of Kotir. After weeks of imprisonment, Martin gets a cellmate--the cheeky, personable Gonff, a kindhearted mouse who thieves food from Kotir to help the woodlanders, who are planning a revolt against Verdauga's and Tsarmina's rule. Gonff promptly escapes, taking Martin with him, and informs the woodlanders of Verdauga's death and Tsarmina's usurping of the crown. Martin becomes part of the resistance. He meets the stately badger Bella of Brockhall, whose family used to rule Mossflower before Verdauga conquered the area. Bella asks Martin, Gonff, and a young mole called Dinny to journey to an extinct volcano known as Salamandastron. Every male badger in Bella's lineage had gone to Salamandastron as soon as he came of age. Bella's father, Boar of Brockhall, had been at Salamandastron when Verdauga invaded Mossflower, and he had never returned in the years since. Bella believes that if her father returns, he can help the woodlanders overthrow Tsarmina... This book is every bit as good as &quot;Redwall,&quot; and one of the best books in the entire series."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This is my second excursion into the world of Redwall (my first was &quot;Redwall&quot;) and I can only say that I was entirely entranced and captivated by this wonderful story. I could hardly wait to come home from work and dive back into it. Brian Jacques is very rapidly becoming my favorite author. The Redwall series are supposedly &quot;children's&quot; books, but really they are for anyone who enjoys a well-told, exciting story. The characters in &quot;Mossflower&quot; as they were in &quot;Redwall&quot; are exceptional. Dinny the mole with his comical molespeak, the heroic and noble badger Boar the Fighter, the truly wicked Tsarmina, Martin the Warrior, Chibb the robin, all are wonderful and complex, well-thought out characters. Their actions and doings are as compelling as the story itself. Mr. Jacques does a good job of not making the battle scenes too gory while still providing the necessary imagery, with Martin wiping the blood and sweat from his face as he engages in battle with the sea rats at Salamandastron. The final battle between Tsarmina and Martin was quite epic. I love the idea of &quot;going questing&quot; as Martin did in his search for Salamandastron and hope to go &quot;questing&quot; myself in the future. I guess that seems a silly notion, but a fun idea nontheless. &quot;Mossflower&quot; will fire your imagination and transport you to another world, one of courage, humor, bravery, nobilty, &quot;questing&quot;, good vs evil, and mostly, a world of high adventure. I can only hope the rest of the &quot;Redwall&quot; series are as good as this story."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Life in Mossflower Woods is a battle for survival. An evil wildcat name Tsarmina rules the land with an iron fist. The local residents do what they can to keep the evil cat at bay, but they are losing. One day, a young mouse named Martin is captured and locked up simply for walking through the castle grounds. With the help of an enthusiastic mouse thief named Gonff, he escapes. With the help of squirrel archers, otters, and a mix of other wildlife warriors, they start a siege on Kotir, the evil cat's castle. Meanwhile, Martin and his friends are going to Salamandastron, the Fire Mountain, to get his sword fixed and find Boar the Fighter, because with him on their side they will be able to finally overthrow Tsarmina. Along the way, they are trapped and sidetracked many times by various dangers. Will they make it to Salamandastron? Can the woodlanders overthrow Tsarmina? Read the book for the answers. I thought this book was exciting and interesting all the way through. It is fantasy, (my favorite genre), and very intriguing. Brian Jacques is a great medieval writer, and if you like Lord of the Rings, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The dominating (in my personal opinion) Redwall series has to be the best fantasy ever written! Jacques has a pure talent for giving animals human characteristics. This was the first book in the series that I read, and I absolutely loved it! Jacques' creativity was spectacular and the characters were witty and great. If you like to read fantasy books, DO NOT pass this book up!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Brian Jacques has done it again with Mossflower. I love how brave Martin is throughout the book. He shows such great courage and determination. Courage that we should show in our lives. I strongly recomend this book to anyone who likes animals and adventure. The books were really well written. I also think that they can be enjoyed by an older audience. I just want to say if you enjoyed these books, I think you'll really enjoy the Lord of the Rings trilogy along with the Hobbit."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I have read many, many, great books. Mossflower would totally be at the top of the list! I started reading it, and I just couldn't put it down! The plot and characters draaw you in, until you fell like you are in Mossflower woods, helping Martin, young Dinny, and Gonff find Salamandstrom. This book is amazing, and I definitely reccomend it for ages 6 and up!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"If you started the series off with Redwall, then you are definetley going to be pleased with this one. In Mossflower, you learn how Martin the Warrior came to be in Mossflower, and how he helped fight back and overthrow the tyranical regime of Tsarmina the queen of a thousand eyes. It is overall a much better story than Redwall, and the characters are a bit more beliveable and real. I don't want to give the story away too much, but the plot, and subplot are both very well written and it definetley draws you in to the point where you cant put it down. One of my all-time favorite stories, you won't be dissappointed."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"YEAH, WHOO! Kill em! Yeah!Oh, sorry, I was reading this AWESOME BOOK. Maybe you've heard of it, Mossflower? What? You are still debating on reading it? I'll slap you if you don't read it this instant! Go on, do it."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The Redwall series was recommended to me by my own readers, who recognized a similarity between the writing style, animorphism, and medieval setting of my own debut novel \\"The Other Side of Yore\\" and of Brian Jaques' famous books. As I learned more about the books, I was amazed that the books had escaped my attention for so long. Sure I had heard the name in passing, but I really didn't know what the books were about, and had probably passed them over as too child-oriented when I was a young blossoming fan of fantasy. Boy, had I been missing out!Mossflower may be the best YA fantasy book I've read since \\"The Hobbit,\\" maybe even surpassing \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" for imagination, superb writing skill, literary worth, and sheer reading enjoyment!Far from being just a book for young adults, I am well over thirty and highly critical of most fiction books, and was unable to put the book down. Not only does Jaques write in an incredibly skillful and beautiful style, but his plots and subplots are nothing short of genious. The character developement of the animorphed creatures is far superior to even the average bestselling book of fiction starring realistic human characters. Jaques is a master of dialogue and dialect, and I especially enjoyed the strange coloquial mole-speech;\\"Hurr, Oi be liken it moiself better'n any deeper-n'-ever pie oive et, stan' on moi hole!\\"The triumphs, determinations, and gallant speeches of Martin the Warrior actually brought tears to my eyes a few times during the tale, and the antics and humorous songs and poems of Gonff made me laugh out loud more than once.What's more, Jaques created a complex villian to be copied by fantasy authors for centuries to come in the characterization of the wicked cat Tsarmina, and painted a thoroughly believable array of personalities and attitudes in the various soldiers of her army.Like Tolkien's work, Jaques has also done his homework thoroughly, and has created a vast history to support his tales, which I think is a trait missing from many of the more fly-by-night and commercial fantasies of today.By the end of this novel, you will have forgotten that mice can't talk and that badgers don't wield swords, having become intimately familiar with some of the most realistic personalities ever to grace the pages of literature. I cannot recommend this book enough, and am sure that the others in the series will be equally delightful!J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"i think the redwall series is a very genius piece of work, its in the style of warriors and a little harry potter. well, this takes place before, yes before, redwall abbey was biuld. the area is under rule by tsarmina, a blood thirsty tyrant queen teatering on the edge of insanity bent on enslaving all of the woodlanders and take control of mossflower but then new hope comes alive when martin the warrior comes and a new hope is restored. with the help of gnoff the mousthief and dinny the mole. they set of to salamandastron to bring back boar the fighter who might free the woodlanders from the evil queen of a thousand eyes. this story also fills up quetions not answered in the first book which makes even more engrossing to read. the one thing i don't like about the series is that it is very drawling and long, like it will take over 10 pages to start a plan but all and all these are still great books."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower!!!! Another adventure by Brian Jacques tells the story of woodlanders oppressed by a crazy wildcat queen until one day a mysterious mouse comes to free them all... this is one of my favorite books by B.J. I could not stop reading it! The author gives wonderful incites into the world of the creatures of mossflower as he breathes life into the most wonderful characters from quaint moles to hearty otters to hotheaded squirrels to even a prince of mouse thieves! And he gives a sense of being there, as if you are right there in the action.I would recommend this book if you have any imagination at all, love fantasy or if you are a young reader looking for an adventure. I would not recommend this book if you are not a fiction reader, or if you do not have an imagination, or if you were never ever a child.Brian Jacques is one of the best authors I have ever read the books of and I highly recommend these books for all ages."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The book starts off with Martin Travelling into Mossflower territory where he will soon be held prisioner at the castle Kotir. with the help of a mousethief(Gnoff), a Trusty mole(Young Dinny)and a Shrew(Log-a-log) who they befriend along the way, they set off to find Boar the fighter. He is the only creature who can save Mossflower from the evil Queen Tsamina and her vermin. This story is one of my favourites in the series and does not require reading the first book, so anyone who is not familiar with the redwall series can still enjoy this book. With twists and turns along the way the gang end up fighting for their lives with Searats, an owl and lots of other enemys!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I have read all of the Redwall books, besides Taggerung and Triss, and this is definitly my favorite. Also upon reading all of the other books i have noted that the plot is different. Another book like this is Lord Brocktree. It is probably this way because there is no Redwall yet, and the good guys are actually attacking from the outside instead of defending. Anyway this is definitly my absolute favorite Redwall story and probably my favorite book. Read it! Mossflower rules! PS Brian Jacques will never lose his style like some believe!!!"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Mossflower was the first I read and now that I've read almost all of them I have to say it's my fav one. After a while the later books tend to begin a sort of pattern, like there's a bad rat, stoat, ferret or fox that's trying to take over redwall or salamandastron and some good creatures go along a journey to do whatever and meet up with other creatures. Don't get me wrong, they're still good, I'm just saying htat Mossflower was really original. It was unique and it could take you along so you don't want to put it down but it's not so much like that so you're reading and reading and get a headache. So if you're just starting the Redwall series which is a really great and magical series of books, I would recommend Mossflower as the first although redwall was the first written."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"I was introduced to the magical world of the Redwall books by my friend last month, and recently, I have finished \\"Mossflower\\", the second installment of the series. So many characters, lots of battles, and an excellent plot. I loved this book! I was glad to hear more of Martin the Warrior, and the creation and origon of The Redwall Abbey! The story begins with the death of Verdauga, the wild cat ruler of Mossflower. He had two children, Gingivere, a kind and gentle cat, and Tsarmina, a merciless tyrant. Tsarmina and a vixen named Fortunauta poison Verdauga's medicine. Tsarmina blames Gingivere who is sent to the cells where Martin was previosly sentenced to for passing through Mossflower armed with a sword, which Tsarmina broke and tied the handle to Martin's neck. Soon a mousetheif named Gonff is also sent to the same cell as Martin, a short time later, they escape back to Brockhall, the home of all the woodlanders who wished to be freed from the iron fist of Tsarmina the Queen of the Thousand eyes, and the ruler of Kotir and Mosflower. Soon, Bella, the ruler of Brockhall, sends Gonff, Martin, and Young Dinny the mole on a dangerous quest to the mountain of the Fire Lizard, Salamandastron, to find her father, Boar, and bring him back to Mossflower to restore justice. On the way, the trio run into nice bats, frogs and other reptiles, and a new friend, Log-a-Log the shrew. Together, they make it to the mountain, where they meet Boar the fighter! Boar and his large group of hares fix Martin's sword, and make it stronger. But Boar dies in a battle against the searats of the \\"BloodWake\\", which Boar wins even though he was killed. Martin, Gonff, Dinny, and Log-a-Log free the slaves that where serving as oarslaves on the ship. They sail back to Mossflower and flood Kotir out. Then Martin and Tsarmina have a final battle to the death. Tsarmina is stunned by the power of the small mouse, she walks backwards into the water, and she drounds. The story ends with the Abbey being built and the freedom of Mossflower!Mossflower was the best Redwall book I have read yet, and I would recomend it to almost anyone in the world! You should read it."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"The kids love them and I enjoy reading them to the children. The books have puzzles and action and a moral.

If you've read any of the other Redwall books, you've heard plenty about the great Martin the Warrior. Here he gets to show his stuff, going from a prisoner to a hero in one epic saga.The book showcases all of Brian Jacques' strengths as a writer. There is a charming cast of characters, good humor throughout the tale, and plenty of songs and feasts to be had. It does also show the few weaknesses in Jacques' style, such as the odd tendency of all animals of a certain group to talk and act the same or the vaguely formulaic way in which the plot develops. However, the book has enough moments that make you smile and cheer for the characters that unless you're nitpicking, these minor flaws are easily ignored.Like all books in the Redwall series, Mossflower is part of the larger fictional world without requiring readers to know anything else about the setting. If you've read other Redwall novels, you'll be thrilled to see the adventures of Martin the Warrior and Gonff the Thief. If you've never read the series before, you can still dive right in and enjoy things here. You'll find a world that is entertaining and well worth a second visit."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"When I first read Mossflower, I couldn't put it down. Since then, I have read it twice. In the first book of the series, Redwall, you hear of Martin the Warrior. In this book you get to know him. Also, you might want to know that there is no Redwall Abbey. There is a rundown fortress call Kotir where the bad guy Verdauga, his evil daughter Tsarmina, and his kind son Gingivere live with an army of rats, stoats, weasles, etc. My favorite characters are Bella, Martin, Gonff, Dinny, Skipper, Mask, Boar, Lady Amber, Columbine, Log -a - log, Abbess Germaine, Ferdy, Coggs, Gingivere, and of course the shrews. These are only a few of the characters. The country of Mossflower is held under the tyrannical rule of Lord Verdauga and later under the tyrannical rule of his daughter Tsarmina. This story is how the good and honest creatures set out to free themselves from the tyrannical rule of Tsarmina. If you want to find out more read or listen to Mossflower. Oh, by the way, one of the battle crys in here is the word Mossflower. Mossflowerrrrrr!!!!! Bad guys beware cause Martin the Warrior is here.

Set in Mossflower woods, this book is both thrillingly adventurous yet deliciously homey, as Martin and the woodlanders fight against Tsarmina, the evil wildcat queen. This book will have you on the edge of your seat as you fall in love with Brian Jaques' characters. The moles, speaking in their own, and at times, hard to understand, dialect, (For instance, in mole speech: \\"I like garlic\\" is \\"Oi loiks garlic\\") and the always cheerful British hares will make you laugh out loud! If you liked Redwall, you'll love Mossflower."},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"Redwall pretty much rocked, so I was not sure what to expect with Mossflower, as sequels are often such a letdown. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised with this more than satisfactory prequel to Redwall. This helps explain how Redwall came to be, and introduces the mighty Martin the Warrior, one of the - if not THE - most important character in the Redwall saga. Hands down, if you liked Redwall, you must read this one. Just between itself and Redwall make for a very good duology if you don't read the rest of the books (but you know you do!)"},{"Title":"Mossflower","review":"This audio CD is a wonderful story about Martin the warrior and his friends and how they save Mossflower from the iron fisted grip an insane cat has over the woodlanders of Mossflower.

He does not know at first, and he passes through the borders of the kingdom. Seeing this, soldiers come from the castle (called Kotir) and try to stop him.

When he gets out - I won't tell you how - he helps the woodlanders to try to defeat the evil cat warrior, Tsarmina. But Tsarmina has many fighters, and they are all trained, merciless, vermin.

There was a gap of nearly four years between my last Latin class in high school and my first Latin course in college, and that gap was long enough that I forgot nearly everything I had previously learned. The intro college course that I took was using this textbook for the first time, and I myself, my classmates, and my instructor were all very pleased with it.Despite the complaints of some other reviewers, the grammar-based approach employed by this text is here executed almost flawlessly. Fundamental vocabulary and grammatical pinciples are provided in seamless order and are explained thoroughly. The workbook, of course, is an essential companion to the text--the two are sold as a pair for a reason. As with any inflected, grammar-based natural language, repetition in reading explanations and completing drills and exercises is essential. And it cannot be repeated too often that Latin was at one time a spoken language, thus repetition is a necessity. Having used other texts, I can say without hesitation that this text best provides a strong foundation for reading Latin literature at the intermediate and advanced levels."},{"Title":"Learn to Read Latin (Paper Set) (Yale Language Series)","review":"This is a thorough introduction to the classical Latin language.

It is up to the instructor (or the self-taught student) how much should be required to learn, because it really is quite a lot, being modeled on the Greek and Latin Intensive courses.The textbook is actually appropriate for three whole semesters, because of (1) its thoroughness, and (2) the readings. The reason this book is so long is the enormous number of readings all along, but especially from chapter 8 on (to 15). There are many pages, from prose and poetry, of various authors, all with glossed vocabulary (but not grammar, see below). This means that a Latin class can \\"slow down\\" in the second semester a bit and do a lot of reading. The last four chapters have \\"continuous readings\\" from four major authors (Cicero, Caesar, Sallust and Catullus, I think), that that can take up the end of the second semester and a lot of the third.The workbook is truly great, as well. There are far more (twice as many, three times?) exercises as can be gone through, so there is flexibility. Some can be done in class at sight, some done for homework, and there will still be ones available for additional work one-on-one if needed. In addition, there are at least 75 drill sentences per chapter that carefully reinforce all the grammar, syntax and morphology from the chapter.After teaching from this book for a semester, my main suggestions would be:1. Add grammatical (in addition to the vocabulary) notes to the longer and continuous readings.2. Offer, as an option, artificial Latin, perhaps in the form of a continuous story (cf. the \\"reading method\\") from the beginning. The nearly universal \\"complaint\\" from my students was the \\"drudgery\\" of nothing but disconnected \\"drill\\" sentences in the first semester. It isn't until chapter 7 or 8 (i.e. the second semester) that the readings at the end of each chapter become long enough to be \\"interesting.\\""},{"Title":"Learn to Read Latin (Paper Set) (Yale Language Series)","review":"The book Learn to Read Latin is a great textbook for young Latin students. It teaches the language intuitively and moves at a steady pace which allows the student to understand the language. Conjugations, declensions, and other Latin syntax is all gone through systematically, as opposed to the confusing way that the Cambridge Course uses. The book also gives insight into, and information about, everyday Roman life through actual readings of Cicero, Sulla, and many other figures in Ancient Roman history. Lastly, I found that through the process of learning Latin, my ability to understand and use the English language was vastly improved. All in all, the textbook provides an excellent learning experience for anyone interested in learning Latin, whether on the beginner or advanced level."},{"Title":"Learn to Read Latin (Paper Set) (Yale Language Series)","review":"Wonderful!

I'd estimate about 30+ short drills per subsection and around 60+ drill sentences at the end of each chapter.I am currently learning with this text in a small university class but I would guess that if an independent learner contacted the publisher for a workbook answer key, the text would be great for independent learning as well."},{"Title":"Learn to Read Latin (Paper Set) (Yale Language Series)","review":"I have recently begun studying latin on my own and is half-way through Wheelock's. I like it, but when I had a few seconds the other day to flicker through Keller, I realized that this book would probably have been the better choice. Perhaps I'll start with it after having finished Wheelock's. I have a question, though: is there a key to the workbook that independent learners can use?"},{"Title":"Learn to Read Latin (Paper Set) (Yale Language Series)","review":"I just finished my first Latin course at the undergrad level using this book. The book provides enough grammar points and vocab to get the student reading fast, but most of the essential information is relegated to the footnotes (a pain when reviewing for exams). I don't think I would have been able to understand the text without review in class. The book charges ahead without repeating lessons and it rarely makes the point to build on information already learned; it poses few juxtapositions what would be helpful to understand new concepts and it introduces vocabulary that isn't fully explained until the next chapter. The grammar notes are extensive, but they obscure key information by grouping it with the rest of the notes. The \\"real Latin\\" passages at the end of chapters are entertaining to puzzle out, but aren't the focus of the text. Unlike Wheelock's, it doesn't include helpful phrases or fun Latin facts and modern applications (although it does include lists of derivatives and cognates).The workbook is essential for drills. It provides many Latin to English but few English to Latin sentences (a problem for those taking exams, maybe not for other readers). Finally, the lack of an answer key makes home study near impossible.However, it is well organized in terms of subject headings and groupings of (some) concepts, making it easy to flip through and find topical information. The pull-outs at the back of the workbook review the major concepts in each chapter, helpful for quick review. The book is compact enough for easy carrying, but the workbook can be awkward at times. At least the pages tear out well.Not such a great book, all in all. Ok for students in a classroom environment, but I think it would be awful for the independent learner."},{"Title":"Learn to Read Latin (Paper Set) (Yale Language Series)","review":"This is the best Latin grammar out there, I have 6 different Latin grammars and I just wished I had found this sooner.

At first glance it looked complicated. In practice, however, the author's instructions were easy to follow and apply. Davidson is a very clear writer and walks you (the parent or teacher) step by step through the process so there is no ambiguity about what to do and how to do it.We started our daughter on this material when she was three and a half. She already knew her alphabet and a basic sound for most letters. We used Leap Frog Word Whammer/Fridge Phonics, which gave her a great start with no work on our part (it works like a game she could play herself). We also read to her a lot, filling her mind with drama and a love for stories. I think these two things set the stage for the next step with Davidson's book.Our daughter responded very well to Number Phonics, even though we were not very consistent with our lessons (not even once a week). We were very relaxed in our approach, especially since she was so young. We only did as much as she was interested in at the time. Two-thirds of the way through her fourth year she had a breakthrough and took off on her own, more or less. She seemed to be able to read anything basic--street signs, menus, advertisements, most of her books, even the summaries of the sermons in the church bulletin. In fact, we never actually finished Number Phonics because she seemed to be doing so well on her own.We credit Numbers Phonics with the rapid increase in her reading ability, and had we been more consistent (which is what we recommend) I think the results would have even been better. There are gaps in our daughter's ability that would have been filled had we followed the plan. Even so, we are thrilled.I'm convinced that this training material will enable any child to read before they start first grade if Davidson's clear and manageable system is put into practice and if there is a positive, supportive attitude towards books and reading in the home. This book is a great investment in your child's future."},{"Title":"Number Phonics: Basic Reading Instruction Made Easy for Children in Homeschooling, Private Tutoring Title I, Lap, Special Education, ESL, And Elementary School (Skills for Life)","review":"I have been using this book to teach my 5 year old to read, she was having a hard time with reading until we started using this book.

While some revere Johnstone as a guru, others mention his sometimes inflexible attitudes. Some follow his lead while others choose their own path. This book is an interesting read, in that it gives you the opinions of those who are actually involved. It is not, however, a book about acting technique.

After reading this book that will not happen. Chris Emmett wrote a 3,000 page manuscript to produce this 436 page book, having exclusive use of the Arrott archives that had been collected over the years. Beginning in 1956, Mr. Emmett set aside two full years at Las Vegas to research this book published in 1965.The U.S. government had starting paying serious attention to the trade and commerce at Santa Fe by the year 1825, however, Fort Union as such did not come into establishment until 1851. Between then and 1891 when abandoned, Fort Union was a presence or 'focal point' and a supply post for both Mexico Territory and much of the west in general.Seeing service during the Civil War years its importance in the Battle of Glorieta Pass is noted, and following the War years the fort 'was charged with maintaining peace among the Indian tribes of the area until its detachment was transferred to Fort Wingate in 1891.\\".By 1954 Fort Union, or its remains, was declared a National Monument coming under the care of the National Park Service. At that time a museum was opened on the grounds of old Fort Union, New Mexico.Though released in January, 1965, this is still a very interesting work on a subject to which not too many writers have given attention.

This close proximity coupled with my Mom reading me a kid's version of \\"The Conquest of Mexico\\" (the old and wonderful 'You are there' series) resulted in myself embracing Mexican history as a hobby and side-line for historical research which has consumed more and more of my time as I get older.One of the first things that becomes quite apparent when researching the history of Mexico is the lack of comprehensive non-politicized material about Mexico or the Mexican revolution. Virtually everything you're going to read this side of the border has a leftist slant that often borders on Cuban style communism.This has always irked me because Mexico is NOT Cuba and the Mexican revolution and it's origins are unique to the Mexican people and their culture. American University professors with their archaic leftist 1960's view of Latin America often color and frequently ruin what would otherwise be good accounts of the revolution by injecting what is now a bunch of out-dated Che Guevara style \\"new-speak\\" into the conversation. It's particularly insulting because the Mexican revolution took a distinctly Mexican form which is fascinating to research. The Revolution wasn't some Marxist-Leninist approach to social inequality, it was a very unique, often innovative Mexican response to a system of painfully unequal, soul-crushing social dis-enfranchisement of everybody save the very wealthy that literally took about a hundred years to manifest.Marx didn't inspire the Mexican revolution, Juarez, Madero, Zapata, Pancho Villa and Carranza did. None of these men, including Zapata, were Marxists. They were Mexican Patriots who developed a unique Mexican social revolution...a revolution which although flawed, ultimately succeed, with Obregon and Elias Calles stabilizing the war-torn nation.My search to find a \\"facts only\\" approach to Mexican history which emphasizes the Mexicans and not Marxism lead me to this wonderful, concise book by Juana Vasquez-Gomez.Her \\"Dictionary of Mexican Rulers\\" avoids the American University Latin American studies pit-fall completely and is a refresing, facts only approach to Mexican history which is also very user friendly in that it traces the entire course of Mexican history, beginning with the Aztecs, through to 1997 by focusing on the individuals ruling Mexico during this period of time. This is accomplished by setting up a dictionary that is in historically chronological order. This makes it easy to find who you are looking for, and put that person into a historical context.This set up also makes it ideal for the Non-Spanish speaking Mexican American (yes, there are a lot of you out there, I know) to find out more about their own fascinating history while simultaneously reading the life stories of everybody who ruled Mexico beginning with the legendary Tenoch and ending with Ernesto Zedillo.Sadly there are no illustrations in the book, but the very good, digestable summations of specific Mexican historical periods more than makes up for this. For example, at the start of the book you get a marvelous, detailed, easily accessable summation of Aztec culture, including their religious institutions and (important from my slant...I'm a military history guy) their military organization! There is also a summation of the Conquest and the colonization of Mexico. And remember...this is all on top of a running chronology of the individual persons running Mexico! It's really an amazing approach and one I'd like to see other dictionaries of this sort use.The uniqueness of this approach literally allows you to read through ALL of Mexican History up to the revolution while living through and understanding the lives of all the rulers who are guiding Mexico towards this unique historical flash point. And all this is in a book only 191 pages long! (The average college text book trying to attempt this would be at least 500 plus pages.)What makes the book even better is the fact that Vasquez-Gomez also includes sketches of important people in Mexican history who, while technically speaking were NOT rulers, were very influential in the course of Mexican history. (Two stand outs here are Emiliano Zapata and Doroteo Arango (Pancho Villa) both of whom are covered in the dictionary.)Sure there are a couple of omissions...I was hoping there'd be an entry about Pascual Orozoco, the infamous leader of the Colorados but there isn't. However, given the fact that Vasquez-Gomez had to cover all of Mexican History in only 191 pages, this is understandable. In addition, there is enough information about Orozoco under other entries in the dictionary to help the researcher to establish a starting point for research on this movement.I strongly feel that the few omissions that Vasquez-Gomez made are quite understandable given the concise format of the dictionary and do not detract at all from my evaulation of the text.If there is any drawback to this book, it's the fact that many vendors charge way, way too much for this book, especially a new copy.I believe that this book would be a good investment only if you buy it at a REASONABLE PRICE! Some of the vendors really, really overcharge you for this book. So click on that vendor list and do some comparative shopping and don't hesitate to buy a used copy. I bought a used copy that is in \\"like new shape\\" for $15.00! If you can find a copy at a reasonable price it's a great gift for the young Mexican-American student in either Middle or High School who is becoming interested in their homeland's political history.One final thing, in this age of politicization of virtually everything, Vasquez-Gomez is to be applauded. She is a true historian...neither a leftist nor a right-winger. All you get are the facts, which is all any historical researcher ever truly needs.But remember!!!!!: When ordering this book from Amazon.com check ALL the vendors that are listed. While new copies of the book are very, very expensive, you can get this book for a very reasonable price if you buy it USED! I got a wonderful copy which is almost good as new for $15.00. So remember..click on that vendor list and compare the prices."},{"Title":"How to Write a Book Proposal","review":"I was interested in this book, as a blogger who some day dreams of writing more than just snippets of my thoughts.

We are not friends. I have never met him. I don't even know what he looks like. I am not getting paid to write this review. Mr. Larsen doesn't even know I am writing it.Three years ago I had an idea for a book. It wasn't a passing idea that just tickled my curiosity. Rather it buried itself in my subconscious keeping me awake at nights. Finally I decided to dig it out and see if there was any merit to this festering nuisance.I didn't have a clue about what it took to get a book published, so I started by browsing the internet for books on just that. I researched many books, read many reviews and many review comments. Next I went the book store to get a better idea of what these books were all about. (I appreciate the \\"look inside\\" feature on the web, but if at all possible I prefer to get my hands on a book before deciding to buy it). The book I decided to use was How to Write a Book Proposal by Michael Larsen.I started by reading the book from cover to cover. For me it was easy to read and the information was clear and concise. After that, I took the advice from the book and began researching my book idea. With How to Write a Book Proposal sitting open on my desk, I started writing my query letter and proposal, continually using the book as a reference. (I wish I had the book in front of me now to be able to reference specifics, but I gave it to a friend once I had used it).Relying only on the steps, advice and tips from this book I sent a query letter out. Twenty-four hours later I was asked for a complete proposal. One week later I had a book contract. Now I have a book published.I know it doesn't usually happen this way. But it happened, and largely in part because I followed the advice from this book.That is my review based on my personal experience from using this book. I have read the bad reviews, and I cannot discount them because they are the writers own personal experiences. I will address a couple of specific criticisms.\\"What I found was a list of reasons that authors should not bother submitting books unless they either are celebrities or well established speaking professionals, with track records of successful book sales for at least 3 years (keep your receipts!)\\"I am none of the above (Let me rephrase that. I was none of the above. Now that my book is published I am on my way to fitting into the last two categories.) I did have personal experience and knowledge of my books topic and played to my strengths, just as How to Write a Book Proposal says.\\"I could not believe that they actually said you should use the phrase: \\"this book will be the FIRST to blah blah blah.\\" You never want to assume your book is the first to do something.\\"If your book will be the first on a given topic, say so. If you have a new twist to an old topic, say so. But, do your research to back up your claim. For my book, it was the first to address a specific event that thousands of people face each year. That is one reason I received a book contact, and so fast.\\"This book, as well as nearly all others on the subject of non-ficiton writing, is highly misleading. It hides, as do all other manuals, the dirtly little secret of non-fiction wrting: research. It takes years to do research. You do it on your own time, on your own dime. Worse than that, there are thousands of people who have done such research during the course of their graduate work, and have been unable to sell their non-ficiton books. What makes you think you can slap something together in a few months and sell it?\\"How to Write a Book Proposal is very clear that you must research. For me it provided the information on what I needed to research for a successful proposal, and I did it. And not in years, but months. (After I received the book contract many more hours went into researching my book topic). On top of that I found the advice to be realistic and yet positive at the same time. So much so that I spent my time researching, writing, researching more, re-writing and finally submitting with great success.\\"If you think you can sell something simply by following the advice of this and other similar manuals, you shall find yourself sorely dissapointed.\\"I can say without fear of contradiction, that if I hadn't followed the advice from How to Write a Book Proposal, the nagging idea that kept me up at nights would never have become the published book that now sits on bookstore shelves everywhere.Notes: My book is non-fiction. It was not self-published. It was not published through a vanity press. It was published (and still is) through a small specialized press with a great track record.I am currently preparing ideas for new books. Because I gave my copy of How to Write a Book Proposal to a friend, I will be buying another copy. However, I see that a new addition is coming out this spring, so I think I will wait until then."},{"Title":"How to Write a Book Proposal","review":"This should say alot: the author of this book actually ENCOURAGES you do something like send a pair of baby shoes to an agent/editor with the note 'now that my foot is in the door.' This isn't even an example--this is something that someone actually did and the author thinks its a good idea to lead off with jokes. You don't want to make agents/editors laugh--you want to prove to them YOU CAN WRITE.This book made me laugh for all the wrong reasons. The most appalling part of this book is that the act of writing a book or book proposal that will get you signed or published seems like an afterthought. I could not believe that they actually said you should use the phrase: \\"this book will be the FIRST to blah blah blah.\\" You never want to assume your book is the first to do something. There's so much talk about finding famous people to write a forward, movie deals, absurd plans for promotion and basically everything one wishes for AFTER you get published that there is not much about writing a solid proposal and an even more solid book... this book makes it sound like the marketing angles you choose are the main factors in getting published.Also, there were few examples and the ones they do use are very week. To sum up how i feel about this book in one word, it would be 'untrustworthy.' The bottom line is i cannot honestly believe that the main points stressed in this book are what agents and publishers are really looking for... this book could be dangerous to a new writer.I laughed out loud when an example was given in the movie rights chapter--the author was so proud that one of the writers he signed made alot of money on a big movie deal, and mentions (as an afterthought) 'but we never could sell the book to a publisher.' That sure says alot, because its supposed to be this authors job to find good writers with good manuscripts and get them published... this shows that the author, in his real job, didn't pick a good writer and didn't get a good manuscript... but that doesn't seem to matter to the author...There is a ton of stress on using your 'networks' (translation: spam your friends and your friends friends over email. I have to believe that all these five-star reviews are from people in this author's 'network.' There is no way that this book gets a young writer a book deal. This book is a joke.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!I HIGHLY recommend reading 'Give them what they want.'

Even though I have sold three previous business books without an agent, I feel like the topic of this book requires a top agent if the book is to sell to one of the leading New York publishers and receive the attention it requires from them. I reread my old stand-bys among books that have helped me in the past to write successful book proposals. I realized that those books are more aimed at the average non-fiction book rather than one that has the potential for a wide audience.On my fourth trip to find a book to help me with this proposal, I found the 3rd edition of How to Write a Book Proposal by Michael Larsen. That was a momentous day for me as a writer! This book made it clear how to make the case for a major publisher to take on a non-fiction book and give that book full support. In addition, the book assumes that the reader is capable of producing such a proposal and book. What a breath of fresh air that was! I found myself both informed and motivated to create a wonderful proposal.In the process, I learned some excellent tips for writing query letters to agents, preparing mini-proposals and packaging the final proposal. Although I am experienced in this area, I found Mr. Larsen's many detailed descriptions and examples of what is needed to be very helpful and stimulating.I also recommend that you visit Mr. Larsen's Web site for his literary agency where he provides excellent information for how to work with him as an agent.Even if you think you have a book with limited commercial potential, you would do well to read and apply this book. You may be able to switch your focus to create a book with much more potential as a result.Good luck with your next proposal!"},{"Title":"How to Write a Book Proposal","review":"I used this book 4 years ago to write a book proposal for my book of technical mysteries, \\"If I Only Changed the Software, Why is the Phone on Fire?\\"As I'd never written a book before, but I had extensive writing experience, I needed guidance on the mechanics of the proposal. This book does a great job of listing the different sections needed in a clear manner. It also includes recommendations on how to phrase information for clear readability.There are many books on the market to help with proposals, and I used several in my research - this was a good one.

Wander the hundreds of agent and literary sites, and one book comes up over and over again, Michael Larsen's. It's essential. A proposal is sometimes harder than writing the book itself, but Larsen takes you through the process step-by-step, explaining why each section is critical and how to do it right.I spent three months putting together a proposal for a non-fiction book. While I was finally convinced that the subject matter for the book wasn't going to sell, many agents commented on the excellent proposal and suggested I find another topic and get back in touch with them. That would not have happened without Larsen.One warning: It's primarily for non-fiction, but check out Larsen's website for a very simple process for submitting fiction.

I had to read it! Michael Larson does an excellent job explaining to the reader the various intricacies of getting a book published. It is written in plain English, so someone as simple-minded as I can easily understand it.If you don't know much about the process of getting a book published, this is the book for you. However, if you compare this book to other books, there are some things that this book teaches as necessity that you must quickly determine to be optional. One example of this would be sending the publisher a suggested piece or example of cover art. Larson believes this is a very good thing to do, but I unless you are a great artist, I would strongly discourage you from doing so. A distasteful or downright ugly piece of cover art will get your book proposal tossed in the trash before it is even read.Above all, if you want to get a book published, the best way to start is to find a personal connection to a publisher. If you are one of the lucky few who has such a connection, allow them to give you some insight and advice on how to publish a book through them.I recommend this book, but keep in mind, some of the advice that Larson gives is according to taste, and should not be taken as fact.This title was given to me free-of-charge by the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review."},{"Title":"How to Write a Book Proposal","review":"I have been in process of writing my first book but uncertain of how to go about it.

Michael Larsen's is a textbook, and a reference manual for those who've embarked in the journey of writing and wish to make a career out of it. The table of contents as well as the reference index, make it easier to find specific topics, carefully developed in the chapters that break down to the maximum level of detail in a very eloquent style, deprived of unnecessary academic jargon, not only the steps to follow to produce a marketable book proposal, but also the philosophy that any aspiring or established writer needs to embrace should he/she decides to make it in the business as a writer. Mr. Larsen does away with false modesty by encouraging the writer to pour out from his bones his/hers skills as well as his/hers particular style, starting with the author's biography. I enjoyed to the fullest how Michael Larsen gives a little bit of history in order to contextualize the Praxis of Writing. As working artists/writers, we need to embrace the fact that \\"Like other arts, writing is also a craft that also requires an apprenticeship (...) If you have a lifetime's worth of ideas for books you want to write, then you have to learn your craft. And you don't have to create a masterpiece to prove you're ready. Having a job that requires you to write may suffice.\\"Another feature that I appreciate in reading and studying HOW TO WRITE A BOOK PROPOSAL by Michael Larsen, is the abundance of \\"Hot tips\\". They often act as a cut-to-the-chase summary of the particular subject matter, or specific aspects of writing and/or the business of writing, developed through the chapters in this excellent book. Michael Larsen demystifies the craft of writing, and how and author can become successful in the business of writing, by providing us with practical information and easy-to-follow steps in order to get the work done, and sent out to all the constituencies set in place by the business of writing. However, Mr. Larsen does not hesitate to explore new venues, and keep authors up-to-date on the fact that the business of writing is not just changing, it has already changed. There was a need for this 3rd edition of HOW TO WRITE A BOOK PROPOSAL by Michael Larsen.

I was in the process of writing my first book, but I could not find this book to be of much practical use to my book writing project. The title of the book to me did not relate to the contents and the flow appeared haphazard.

I read this book having completed reading another one entitled \\"Writing Nonfiction- Turning Thoughts into Books by Dan Poynter\\". The contrast could never be starker.

The book is extremely thorough and gives plenty of advice on how to make the proposal stand out from the crowd.

There is also a style guide included to help focus the attention of the writer onto \\"action\\" words and active voice constructions that will help make the proposal more dynamic. The appendices in the back of the book are helpful, if somewhat intimidating. The examples of proposals seem to be almost as long and involved as the books themselves! For instance, a sample proposal includes a table of contents, an overview of the work, outlines of chapters and selections from the proposed book. The proposals also include suggested markets for the work, overviews of competing book, a mission statement and suggestions for future \\"spin-offs.\\" I really had no idea that so much had to be included on a proposal, or that the finished product was so involved! One thing I liked about the book was that each chapter began with a \\"Golden Rule\\" which offered a short snippet of advice from the chapter, and each chapter has relevant \\"Hot Tips\\" scattered throughout. One thing I found odd with the book is that in several places cartoons were described in detail (including where it appeared and who the author was) -- why not just include the cartoon itself?

The intent is to teach you to be an \\"Authorpreneur (r).\\" Yes, Larsen has registered this word. You'll learn such gems as everyone has 250 friends, and each of them has 250 friends, so you can \\"spread the word\\" about your book to more than 62,000 people by e-mail. I think there's a word for that -- spam. Larsen also says to include your promotion plan in the book proposal, including pushing \\"the paperback edition as hard as you can\\" when it's published a year after the hardcover edition. I'm not an agent or editor, but I'd think that an agent would giggle quietly to themselves if you were so presumptuous as to include a marketing plan for the paperback edition. (To the author's credit, he doesn't say you should suggest which actor should play the main character in the movie version of your book.) Then there's the chapter about including illustrations and cover art. Excuse me, I thought the editor and art director develop the cover art? I can't imagine creating the book cover to include in the proposal. And the author recommends including a \\"surprise,\\" such as a baby shoe with a note saying \\"Now that I have a foot in the door.\\" The book has one good piece of advice: pick a good title. For example, \\"How to Write a Book Proposal\\" is a title that will make 100,000 aspiring writers buy your book, regardless of how awful the book is.\\"78 Reasons\\" was good. Some sections are wrong, such as #38 and #39, which correctly advises against paying for a vanity press to publish your book but confuses this with self-publishing. I've successfully self-published two books, and unsuccessfully self-published one book. The correct answer is that if you have a niche book in a niche market you know well, self-publish. Self-publishing mass market books is a recipe for disaster. Some of the advice is excellent, such as #16, about \\"killing your little darlings\\" (a scene you think is brilliant, that you build the rest of the book around). While most of this book is sound advice to a novice writer, as an experienced writer I didn't learn anything new.\\"The Complete Idiot's Guide\\" covers the entire process from thinking of an idea through book proposals, book contracts, publicity tours, etc. It's a good overview but each chapter is too short. You'll need to buy another book about book proposals, etc. I'm keeping my copy as a reference to turn to occasionally but it's not the last word.\\"The Forest for the Trees\\" starts with six essays about writing, with topics such as alcoholism, self-promoting poets (starting with Walt Whitman), the childhood of famous writers, writers who are too successful too young, etc. These are interesting reading. The second half of the book is essays about publishing, starting with literary agents. One paragraph describes the plethora of surprise gifts writers include with their query letters. She's received baby shoes, presumably from readers of Larsen's book. She says: \\"Please resist the temptation to do any of these outlandish things...a simple, dignified letter with a clear statement of your intent and credentials will win more affirmative responses than any gimmick or hype.\\" If you read Larsen's book, read Lerner's book as the antidote. The next essays are about dealing with rejection, the life of editors, what writers want from editors, how book covers are designed, book titles selected, etc. This book is descriptive, not proscriptive, so you'll learn how the world of books operates, if not be told how to write a book and get it published. I enjoyed the author's \\"voice\\" and I recommend this book.The best book is \\"Thinking Like Your Editor.\\" The first half of the book is about preparing your book proposal. Unlike the other four books, reading this book made me completely rewrite my book proposal. The author begins by emphasizing the three most important things about a book: audience, audience, and audience. Who is going to buy your book? Not who might be sort of interested in your book, but who will feel that he or she must read your book. I'd thought about this before, but reading Rabiner's book made me think lucidly about this. She then walks you through the elements that must be in a book proposal, such as your thesis, or what makes your message unique and new and challenging; why is now the time to publish this book; and why are you the person most qualified to write it. The second half of the book is about writing your book, including the importance of narrative tension in non-fiction writing, and of presenting a balanced \\"argument\\" to make your views more convincing. The other four books made me say, \\"uh-huh, uh-huh\\" and not do anything. Rabiner's book made me spend several days working on my proposal.

Read and toss!&quot;I read this book cover to cover hoping to find the correct methods of writing a proposal that would stimulate editors to take notice of a book.What I found was a list of reasons that authors should not bother submitting books unless they either are celebrities or well established speaking professionals, with track records of successful book sales for at least 3 years (keep your receipts!) The essence of this book is that if you have achieved a level of celebrity where you really do not need an agent or publisher to sell millions of copies, then an agent or publisher is for you. The rest of you are just wasting their time.The writing style is authoratarian and tired. It is not a very fun book to read, and the constant references to how successful you need to be in advance of findding an agent or publisher quite litterally screams out &quot;Don't waste our time!&quot;I can highly recommend Jump Start Your Book Sales by Marilyn & Tom Ross instead. Save yourself the punishment. Or, read this book and lose any interest in dealing with agents and publishers."},{"Title":"How to Write a Book Proposal","review":"After finishing my first non-fiction book, I decided to write a book proposal. Problem was, I had no clue how to do it. When I read Michael Larsen's book, I was amazed at how detailed he was about each step in the book-proposal process-everything from the contents page to the outline to the sample chapters. He even provides examples so that you are clear on how to apply the lessons in each chapter. All I did was follow his simple instructions, send out my book proposals and, in less than a few months times, I got an agent. On my first try."},{"Title":"How to Write a Book Proposal","review":"This book is straight to the point and gives great insight into the process of writing a book proposal. Advise for first-time authors is planted throughout to help you make your proposal, and your idea, stand out.I used this book and successfully landed a publishing deal within weeks. However, I had a manuscript half-way done and I used the proposal as a means to gauge interest before investing too much time for nothing. I would suggest the same, if not a full manuscript, since many publishers want a good sample of the work you intend to submit."},{"Title":"How to Write a Book Proposal","review":"Literary agent Rita Rosenkranz introduced me to Michael Larsen's How to Write a Book Proposal about ten years ago. Since then, I've recommended the book to hundreds of people, including many book-coaching clients who've subsequently landed publishing deals or contracts with a top literary agents.There are many books about how to write a book proposal. Recently, I've ordered a few just to compare and they don't. They may add a few interesting ideas, but Michael Larsen's is the most comprehensive, in the most valuable format, and--I have to say--agents and publishers love this thorough and clear format.I can't tell you how many people spend time on a mediocre proposal only to get rejected because they are missing key elements such as market statistics, a comprehensive book promotion plan, a captivating first paragraph, or true chapter outlines (as opposed to summaries). Don't know the difference between chapter outlines and summaries? Then you need to get this book.If you want to get published by a traditional publisher, Larsen's book is a must-have. What more can I say?"},{"Title":"How to Write a Book Proposal","review":"This book is full of helpful information, but man is it boring. Every chapter is about twice as long as necessary, the text is dry and bland, and whole chapters seem completely uneeded.If you are writing a nonfiction book, however, this would probably be a very smart book to read. If you can slog through it, there's a wealth of useful information hidden inside.And if you're writing fiction...eh...this probably wouldn't be so useful then. There's not too much on fiction in here."},{"Title":"Ford Ranchero Muscle Portfolio 1957-1979 (Muscle Portfolio Series)","review":"Well, how can one top Ford's original 1957 jingle(my title)? I LOVED this book, great pictures of EACH era of the ranchero from the roots('57-59) to the falcon, torino, LTD II, and fairlane body's. They had everything from the stock performance specs/options/trivia to enthusiant created street rods. At least two competition type rankings against the elCamino to boot. Maybe I'm a little partial, as I own a 57 ranchero but I say if you own or love rancheros, you NEED this book!"},{"Title":"Chef Manager, The","review":"Excellent! Long overdue. Culinary Art Schools are rolling out baby chefs in record numbers and although they may have the culinary knowledge, only time and experience will give them the managerment skill needed to operate a first rate, organized, efficient and effective restaurant. Management is tough in any field, but particularly so in the restaurant business and I hope Chef/Owner Managers will read and apply the management practices discussed in this book. Chef Mangers who did not have the opportunity to get formal culinary training may also find this book useful. The information on Total Quality Management could and perhaps should have been a separate book. Simply written, The Chef Manager deserves two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Catriona","review":"I really enjoy Robert Louis Stevenson. Like Arthur Conan Doyle, he's got a surprisingly timeless voice. \\"Kidnapped\\" was my first introduction to R.L.S., and from the moment David Balfour met the narcissistic highlander Alan Breck Stewart, I was hooked. The plot was exciting, adventurous. The characters were surprising and fresh. When I heard there was a sequel, \\"Catriona\\", I settled in for what I imagined would be more swashbuckling, more pirates, more Scottish political intrigue.There's a fair serving of the latter, I suppose, but the vast majority of this book is a plodding romance between David Balfour and Catriona, daughter of rogue MacGregor James More. It's love at first sight for David, and the next 200 odd pages are rife with manufactured subplots and artificial bickering to keep them apart until the final chapter. (Yes, she's a Highland lass with a renegade father, but David, being an orphaned laird with a considerable inheritance, doesn't exactly have a lot standing in his way.) I spent much of the time waiting for the return of Alan. There'll be the excitement, the adventure, I thought. But nope. He just showed up as a perfunctory cameo, and played the role of matchmaker. Yeesh.If you're looking for a tidy historical romance, \\"Catriona\\" might just hit your fancy. If you're looking for something more in the line of \\"Kidnapped,\\" it's predecessor, you'll probably be disappointed. Apart from some crossover characters, there isn't a lot to tie these two together."},{"Title":"Catriona","review":"Picture an upright, law-abiding young man as just about alone in the world, thrust into an unexpected fortune and a friend's rebel scrapes. Picture a bonny highland lass, the essence of innocence and loyalty. Picture Jacobite struggles, a negligent father, and a situation in which the only honorable course of action is that which appears the least honorable. Stevenson has done an exquisite job of weaving Davy's heartstrings into a knot--and, of course, the reader's as well. Can the tangle be unraveled without damage? By whom?I rarely enjoy a sequel as much as the story before it, but keeping Kidnapped and Catriona divided into two books is the same as slicing a standalone in half and buying both pieces separately. Kidnapped reads much more quickly, with a lot more fast-paced action. Catriona introduces more complex relationships. You can't have one without the other--they're opposite ends of the same arc.So if you're a fan of R. L. Stevenson, please do yourself a favor and find a copy. If you haven't read Kidnapped yet, then do yourself a different favor and find them both. Best read out loud in a Scots brogue."},{"Title":"Catriona","review":"Having enjoyed Kidnapped very much, I wanted to read the sequel too but found it rather tiresome in the end.The beginning and and ending are pretty good, and the characters are well-developed, but the author seems to be fabricating and drawing out the tension in rather contrived ways for nearly the entire book. The hero's foolishness gets him and Catriona into an awkward situation, at which point her highly unlikeable father comes on the scene and makes the final chapters very tedious reading."},{"Title":"Catriona","review":"This sequel to _Kidnapped_ does not start out as well as _Kidnapped_; however it soon makes up for it. _Catriona_ takes up the story of David Balfour only one or two days after _Kidnapped_. He must now try to clear his name and the name of James Stewart of the Appin murder. This will not be easy because the Campells want James Stewart to hang."},{"Title":"Catriona","review":"Nearly as interesting as Kidnapped, but with quite a bit more romance"},{"Title":"Kasserine Pass (Tower book)","review":"The painful defeat of the US Army in the battle of Kasserine Pass is recounted by Blumenson with exceptional clarity and powerful prose. The author is very critical of some commanders )like Lloyd Fredendall of course) but he pays tribute to other American officers who fought with exemplary courage. The book covers more heavily the US side than the German but it remains one of the best for anyone who wants to analyze that terrible campaign. There is a useful background to the battle, with reference to the status of the old French colonies in North Africa and some material for the role of the British Army. Blumenson prefers to write history seeing the big picture but he does not ommit the view of the common soldier and his experiences. The book loses the fifth star because it does not contain enough maps (although the necessary to follow the action are included) and most of the times the various units are not described with their official designation, for example there is Lt Colonel X's battalion but not its number. There are some black and white photographs of rather mediocre quality."},{"Title":"Kasserine Pass (Tower book)","review":"Blumenson writes an outstanding history of the battle from the point of view of commanders from platoon level to Corps level, stressing the problems facing them and the means by which they arrived at their decisions. The best acount of the US army's initiation to combat against the Germans that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Kasserine Pass (Tower book)","review":"Rommel's carreer has always fascinated me. He seems to personify the near perfect leader, although he of course has his flaws. His own account (Rommel Papers) of the Battle of Kasserine is a fascinating story and this book by mr. Blumenson adds perfectly. It gives a good account of the activities from the staff down to the common soldier, but only for the U.S. side. No personal German accounts are used and the scope of vision is never switched to this side, except for the commanders. This gives a rather impersonal ghost-like picture of these \\"professional veterans\\". Hence the four stars instead of five. Kasserine Pass has been a wonderful read and a thrilling experience."},{"Title":"Kasserine Pass (Tower book)","review":"This narrative is American driven and consumes much of the book but the other four combatants - British, French, German and Italian- are still reasonably represented. Since Kasserine Pass, Kern's Crossroads, Thala, Hamra and Tebessa are in the American sector. where much of the action is, it seems reasonable the Americans receive the greatest attention. I learned more from this book than the other three books read on the topic. Without being caustic, Mr Blumenson clearly describes the problems a new army never in battle faces. The US II Corps' commander, MG Fredendall, as well as his troops were new to battle and the chain of command and the commanders' control of their troops were sometimes found wanting. Their tactical decisions weren't always the best. Besides Fredendall's lack of battle experience, his personal idiosyncrasies were also detrimental to the cause.Before starting the battle action, a deliberate introduction is provided that starts with Operation Torch landings on French North African soil and the delicate negotiations by Eisenhower and Clark with Darlan. The French were still angry with the British for sinking their key ships and killing their sailors back in July 1940 and it was a major accomplishment to succeed with the landings with little loss of life. Once landed, the author moves on to build profiles of some of the key commanders. With Eisenhower stationed in western Algeria, Fredendall will receive a lot of the attention and there is much warranted criticism bestowed on his command ability. Anderson of the British army is next in line for review then Juin of the French forces. There is much discussion of the friction and command differences of Rommel and von Arnim on the axis side. The lack of a clear cut command structure for the Axis and the interference of Mussolini as well as the hatred and jealousy of Arnim for Rommel will be major stumbling blocks that will cause the Germans to fail in taking the Western Dorsal.Throughout the book there are probably 20 commanders down to company level that are covered. The inclusion of these key people during battle is what makes the book as good as it is. After the people, the key battle sites, the distances and relationships to each other and the rugged terrain is then covered. Maps, presented throughout the book along with these descriptions, help the reader follow the narrative and understand the significance of each of the battles. The combination of extensive coverage of the key commanders, chain of command and an accurate description of the key towns, passes and battlefields prior to the campaign allows the reader to gain a better appreciation of this relatively complex campaign.The battle for Kasserine Pass was actually a small portion of the offensive. The Axis offensive started days earlier at Faid, Pichon, Fondouk and moves on to Sbiba, Sbeitla, Sidi bou Zid, Lessouda, Ksaira. In the southern sector, Gafsa, Marknassy, Sened, Feriana, Thelepte, Bou Chebka, El Abiod and Tebessa are discussed. You then have Kasserine, Kasserine Pass, Kern's Crossroads, Thala, Hamra.The battle action while not in exacting detail was very good and was presented in interesting prose. Since defensive positions were so important for the Allies, the author presents an interesting sidebar on the different mines, constructing and placement and protection of mine fields. It is also shown how poor supply lines caused great troubles for the Allies despite General Eisenhower working hard to improve them.Its also shown that the British, French and the Americans couldn't work closely together, that each commander was more worried of his position and troops at the expense of the others. This relationship won't be improved much for the rest of the war.In Aftermath the cost of the campaign is presented for both sides. The Axis had relatively few casualties while the Americans had much heavier casualties in men and tanks. A thorough evaluation was performed and much was learned. General Eisenhower quickly set out to have the shortcomings of the Americans and the other Allies rectified. New commanders replaced ones found wanting, new and improved equipment and tanks were sought and the men would have better training. The US intelligent officer had grossly misjudged Axis intent resulting in poor deployments and was replaced.Rommel was physically and mentally burned out and was hesitant and over cautious. He was also angry how he was being treated. Ever since the defeat at El Alamein, Rommel's star had fallen drastically and he no longer had preferential treatment that he was used to.After Rommel called off his offensive, the author briefly describes the last two months in Africa when Patton, Juin, Anderson and Montgomery closed in on the Axis. Also in Aftermath, the author briefly describes how key officers like Patton, Bradley, Anderson, Kesselring, Rommel and others fared throughout the rest of the war.I found this book highly engaging and informative and is highly recommended for anybody wanting to read about the finally months of the war in North Africa."},{"Title":"Kasserine Pass (Tower book)","review":"\\"Kasserine Pass\\" is an in depth study of the events leading up to and concluding with the battle of Kasserine Pass. The work is much broader than the title would indicate. Author Martin Blumenson sets the scene by describing the forces, military and political, Italian, German, French, American and British which would lead to the dramatic battle.The real action of the book picks up when the focus of the forces shifts to Tunisia. Germany, looking for a victory to compensate for losses at El Alamein and in Russia, decided to take on the green Americans coming from the West. Blumenson tells how Rommel set up the attack and how American blunders set the Americans up for defeat. U. S. General Frendendhall is shown as having deployed many of his forces to hilltop locations where they could be isolated and destroyed. The fighting is shown as having occurred over about a month, not in a single, decisive battle. In a series of attacks, the Germans handed the Americans a thorough thrashing and a well heeded wake-up call.Victory brought Gen. Rommel little to celebrate. In the wake of victory, German supplies to North Africa were restricted to support other theatres. Rommel was called back to Germany to be saved for battles to come.For the Americans, George Patton was brought forward to remold the ruined units into the army that would drive across Africa and Sicily.Martin Blumenson's work is a well written account. It provides a detailed account of the personalities and events involved in the first major American battle of the War. Of particular interest is the occasional reference to prior armies, particularly Carthaginian, who had fought over the same ground. This is an enjoyable and valuable resource for anyone with an interest in the North African theatre of World War II."},{"Title":"The Myth II Handbook","review":"The author is probably the most talented writer in the Myth online community, and combining his wit with his knowledge of the game and as one of the &quot;insiders&quot; to the Myth world, this is an excellent book to get to know the world of Myth and Myth II. This book is good for the &quot;newbies&quot; as well as veteran addicts who can't even go to the &quot;reading room&quot; without having something to read about concerning Myth :)"},{"Title":"The Myth II Handbook","review":"Amateur publisher J. Charles Holt has created a gem of a book here, one that's sure to please any Myth II fan from newbie to hardcore cartographic wizard. No other electronic gaming book I've read has come close to the breadth and depth of topical coverage contained in this beautifully designed and written handbook. All topics are given due attention, from clear explainations of game concepts and controls, to advanced strategies for network play, and on into in-depth map making. Like a literary juggler, Holt manages to keep all these balls in the air with wit and elegance, keeping the reader entranced and amused at the same time.Personally, I found the map-making section most helpful--within a day after receiving my copy I found the information I needed to solve a particularly mystifying mapping problem. That solution alone justified the price of the book in terms of number of hours saved futzing around with a problem that had been nagging at me for weeks. Also, after reading the map scripting section, I can't wait to dig into scripting my own map actions. Thanks for such a great book!"},{"Title":"The Myth II Handbook","review":"A treasure trove of all things Myth II. This is one of the best buys for any serious Myth fan because of the vast wealth of knowledge it contains and displays with our beloved Myrth humor.

His clear and witty style takes you through the annals of MythII. From 3rd party editing to strategy and more, this handbook is the best resource a Myther could want."},{"Title":"The Myth II Handbook","review":"All in all, I liked the Myth II Handbook. The author says at the beginning: &quot;Some of you Myth 2 old-timers may feel the urge to skip by sections . . . however, I think you'll find if you take the time to read them you'll learn things you didn't know. . . .&quot; He was right as far as I'm concerned. I don't think a chapter went by that didn't show me something new. Package a mother-lode of information in easy, comfortable style, and you get something really special. I haven't actually played Myth II for months, and in short order my appetite had been whetted all over again. If you've never finished the solo game, if you've turned into a single-map squatter on bungie, or if you think you might be interested in trying your hand at customizing the game, this book is a great reference."},{"Title":"The Myth II Handbook","review":"Despite my possibly inflated ego from all these great reviews, I did not in fact write them myself.

Had I seen it, I would have never bought it. It has many more words than numbers, although it claims to be a math book. The stories are extremely boring and the problems are not at all creative. If these are supposed to be \\"inventive excercises\\", I can't imagine how real textbooks are. No wonder so many kids are bad at math.The math problems are not very advanced.

Kennedy into a major portion of a tremendously profitable nostalgia industry. The authors of &quot;Jack Ruby&quot; are not so much concerned with the activities of presumably sinister entities, be they Masons, Mafiosi or renegade CIA operatives.Rather, Wills and Demaris are more interested in Texas in general and Dallas in particular as unique cultural institutions and how they shaped the attitudes and behavior of a small-time Chicago-bred nightclub owner who eventually got the public adulation he so desperately craved his entire life, but which quickly degenerated into historical infamy. The authors explain Dallas is a highly stratified, ethnocentric, self-consciously &quot;new money&quot; city obsessed with gaining positive cultural acknowledgement from the rest of urban America but is also planted firmly in the brash, no-holds-barred, us-versus-them frontier assertiveness that is Texas legend.This, they claim, is what ultimately led to that live televised shooting in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters and the initial hailing of Ruby as a hero and then his pillorying as a murderer. Put simply, Ruby's &quot;hit&quot; was pure Texas, while his plaintive cry of &quot;You all know me, I'm Jack Ruby!&quot; to the police officers who cuffed him represented the secret yearning of many Dallasites who looked enviously upon the burgeoning cities of the Northeast (or even to their better-off neighbors) for social acceptance.The book's only flaws are the lengthy parade of supporting characters and situations which are erratically introduced and dismissed and a writing style that often lapses into near-stream of consciousness. This can cause a newcomer to the already confusing world of JFK assassination historiography some distress, but the thesis and the evidence to support it are a refreshing alternative to what has become accepted (or not accepted) about the events in Dallas during the last week of November, 1963."},{"Title":"A Guide to the Pentateuch (Exploring the Old Testament)","review":"I ordered this book for my class for college.

The characters and the landscape are full of dreams that mock their inability to know what they want from life, let alone have the courage to strive for it. The girl is in the same mould - although more \\"feral\\" than the older inghabitants of the valley (portraying the reality that each generation is gettting less \\"fit\\" for any life). The fear of the other feral, the big cat, also drives the characters to even more callow behaviour.All the characters such pathetic creatures that their death or probable future imprisonment seems meaningless.Without one character to care about, I did not care for the book despite its powerful prose and clever swapping of narrator as the action unfolds"},{"Title":"In the Winter Dark","review":"This book was a complete waste of time and money. It not only lacks direction, but it appears that Tim Winton was unsuccessful in even figuring out the point of his own story. This was the first book I read of his - and definitely the last.

Mr MacDonald, a veteran of the Ardennes and Siegfried campaigns and a recipient of a Purple Heart and a Silver Star has written several books as well as being a historian for the US Army. If you have read \\"A Time for Trumpets\\" you will have an idea how thorough this book is. It covers the big event and the small. It covers the tactical / operational events of the war as well as many examples of individual bravery.This relatively large book of 670 pages covers the events of Sept thru mid Dec and includes in addition to the Siegfried Line penetrations, the events of Market Garden as well as the clearing of Antwerp and Albert Canal. The book begins with the strategic dispositions of Allied armies, the relationships of the Allies, the need for greater seaport access as well as a discussion of the German status after the recent setbacks at Falaise etc.There are nine black and white maps which are very good and will help the reader follow the action. There are also a number of interesting photos, an Appendix and Index.If you're seriously interested in the Siegfried Campaign, this volume is a must read and worth the investment; its highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Siegfried Line Campaign","review":"Really just a heads up for anyone looking for this on Kindle. The e-book is some kind of primtive auto-digitalization of the original, with zero quality control - so barely readable in places. Footnotes are squished into the body of the text and there are OCR failures everywhere.It also includes a non-digitized image of each page; the results are too small for me to read, but at least you get some idea of the illustrations.Really wish Amazon itself had a QC layer to prevent people selling this kind of mess.The book itself is a classic."},{"Title":"Smoking Collectibles","review":"This beautiful 202 page 8 x 11&quot; softbound book has been revised with 1999 prices.

If you are very interested in London (living there would count) and architectural/city planning oddities, this is the book for you. There are whole chapters about how best to rebuild the city after the Great Fire of 1666, alternative monuments to Nelson and other famous British heroes, and (my favorite) an ambitious man's attempt to outdo Paris with a tower better than Eiffel's. The book is full of architect's drawings and sketches (black and white only), all by the original planner or others from the period. This book is very hard to rate on a 1-10 scale because it's either something you are really interested in, or it's incredible boring. I gave it a seven, because the authors came up with a unique subject and cover it with as much interest and detail as is possible. However, you have to be VERY interested in the subject. As an non-architect American who is fascinated with the U.K. and has done my fair share of reading about Victorian (and before) design, but has only visited London once, I was lost at many points. The book has endless references to various concepts of how St. Paul's cathedral might have been or how it could have been improved, but it makes the assumption that the reader is intimately familiar with its current appearance. There are no comparisons with its present form, just the alternatives. And the architectural drawings and discussions about the placements of buildings were sometimes too much for me. I bought it hoping for a leisurely read about grand schemes for London filled with humorous stories about the failed plans for a &quot;railway down the middle of the Thames&quot; (as indicated on the back cover), and got more detail and specifics than I expected. However, if you are a Londoner (and I would welcome your second, much more authoritative, opinion), historical architect, or other interested someone who isn't put off by the above warnings, this is the best (if not only) book on the topic."},{"Title":"London; As it might have been","review":"London is a city filled with iconic buildings, monuments, and locales, all accumulated over the centuries of its existence. Yet for each of these there are dozens of unrealized designs, alternatives that were considered and, for one reason or another, then discarded. In this book, Felix Barker and Ralph Hyde examine some of the alternatives that were offered over the past four centuries, presenting the different plans and proposals that would have made for a much different city than the one that exists today.The various ideas described in this book make for fascinating reading. Some of them consisted of palaces intended to rival their greatest counterparts on the Continent, while others, such as a mid-eighteenth century plan for a Palladian-style Parliament, might have created a different city architecturally than the one that exists today. Many of them, such as the proposal for a massive pyramid designed to house five million dead Londoners or some of Wren's designs for St. Paul's Cathedral, thankfully never progressed beyond the drawing board. All of them, however, reveal a great deal about the ideas that went into shaping London, and the desire of their proponents to create the grandeur that the city and its people deserve.In describing the different concepts and why they never became reality, Barker and Hyde shed light on an often-overlooked part of London's history. Well-written, it is supplemented with dozens of images of the various designs, which help readers visualize how the city might look today had the schemes of their originators come to pass. Yet what makes this book such a pleasure is the sense of fun that permeates its pages, both in the speculation it inspires and in the humor with which they address some of the more ludicrous ideas. This is a book for anyone who is interested in the history and architecture of London, one that sparks the imagination of its readers for the city that \\"might have been.\\""},{"Title":"BizTalk(tm) Server Developer's Guide","review":"This one is an impressive and detailed guide for the BizTalk developer.

Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"I was in religious life for six years during the 1990's. My experience is that about 50% of the Catholic clergy are \\"gay\\" and many of then actively so. Yes, there is a \\"Lavender Mafia\\" in the Church. It is widespread and extends to very high levels. Within it the gay lifestyle is the \\"god\\" that is promoted and defended at all cost.In this book what I experienced in religious life is clearly reflected. The gays are firmly in control in most religious orders, and God help the heterosexual man who wants to become a priest. As things are are currently unfolding the priesthood will be a gay profession. I am not talking about homosexuals living a chaste life. I'm talking about an openly gay priesthood.If you want the truth on this matter I very strongly recommed, GOODBYE! GOOD MEN."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"This book hits the sweet spot for non-fiction.It is a topic that needs to be discussed, discovered, and generally known so it is very timely considering recent controversies over sex abuse and priest shortages and, to some extent, liturgical abuses.But, moreover, it is a real page turner as anyone, but in particular practicing Catholics, will be gripped by the narrative of so many good men that were turned away at a time when the Church so needed them.Lastly, while one could argue the book has an axe to grind, the author never lets his viewpoint get out in front of the facts he presents.Required reading for both devout as well as fallen away Catholics considering a return to the faith."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Hundreds of priests molesting Catholic boys over half a century, debilitating financial settlements to victims of clerical sexual abuse, cardinals facing depositions and worse, outraged laypeople with-holding money - nothing made the Pope angry enough to order American cardinals to Rome until the scandal of the seminaries became known. This book is the first serious book for lay people and priests to say what really went wrong with the Catholic priesthood in the United States, why there are so many bad priests and so few good ones. Through the stories of seminarians, ex-seminarians and a handful of priests who survived the poisonous atmosphere of modern American seminaries Michael Rose says the unthinkable but true. Not suitable for hypertensive Catholics."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"In this book, Michael Rose says that the root of sexual abused in the Catholic Church is the homosexual subculture that has been going on in American Catholic Seminaries for years and years. American Catholic Seminaries, M. Rose says, have been infiltrated by homosexual network since 1960-s. Ever since there were many gays who became priests, bishops and even theologians. Most likely, using the frame of reformed Catholic, they are the ones who staunchly defend or promote that being gay is not wrong but good, normal and healthy. Michael Rose says that since 1960-s there were many heterosexual seminarians who had no choice but abandoned their vocation because American Catholic Seminaries were dominated by homosexual seminarians. Heterosexual seminarians, M. Rose says, were persecuted, ridiculed and taunted in many ways by gay seminarians.Article in Fatima Crusader Magazine, published in Autumn 2002 Issue 71 under title \\"Clerical Scandal and the \\"Negligence of the Pastors\\" written by John Vennari also indicates the same thing. This article also is a must read.It is good also to read a book written by Enrigue Ruada in 1982 entitled \\"The Homosexual Network: Private Lives and Public Policy\\". E. Rueda documented in this book in 1982 that homosexuals successfully targeted religious organizations for infiltration, especially the Roman Catholic Church.I believe what Michael Rose, John Vennari and Enrique Rueda saying their books is true since most boys sexually abused by priests were not under 12 years old. This is tragedy that all Catholics should know and start doing something to save the Church from within.Why is homosexual subculture wrong?Well, if we are faithful to the tradition of faith of the Catholic Church, there are 3 classic standards applied by the Church to determine whether or not a seminarian is eligible to be ordained into priesthood. They are scientia, sapientia and sanitas.First Scientia. Sciencia means science or knowledge. In order to become a priest, a seminarian must be intelligent and knowledgeable in the Catholic Faith and other human sciences such sociology, anthropology, psychology etc. And in other to get this knowledge and intelligence a seminarian must accomplish full time philosophical and theological studies for about 8 years.Second Sapientia. Sapientia means wisdom or tactfulness. In order to become a priest, a seminarian must have a certain wisdom. He must be a good and dedicated person. He must have a strong faith. He must have a good spiritual life.Third Sanitas. Sanitas simply means health. In order to become a priest, a seminarian must have a good health both physically and psychologically.The disabled, accordingly, can not be ordained into priesthood, no matter who good they are spiritually and psychologically. The reason is because they can not carry out a ministry as a shepherd. Thy are not ordained for themselves but for the Church.A seminarian also must be healthy in his sexual orientation. His sexual orientation must be normal or natural. Under this requirement, then, a gay and impotent person can not be ordained.In regard to this, about 3 years ago (1999), more than one year before the crisis in our Church broke out, I found out in a magazine saying that about 1% of priests in the Catholic Church and also the ministers in many other denominations are gay. I was very surprised when I knew this for the first time and I asked a friend of mine as to how this could happen. He simply said: \\"Well, in this country, because of the human rights and human freedom, we can not impose the strict teachings of the universal Catholic Church. In addition, he said, if we prevent a gay from becoming a seminarian or priest simply because he is gay, we will be accused of being discriminating or racial. What we need to do is that we ask them not to act it out...\\" By in my opinion, a priest having sex with a woman still better than a priest with other men or boys. A priest having sex with women is wrong but at least it is still natural. He is wrong because he violates the law of the Church, violates what he has promised, but it is not against natural law.\\"Goodbye Good Men written by Michael Rose is a must read but it is quite expensive."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"It wa sabout time that a book like this laid out the way it is. The Second Vatican COuncil did nto create a \\"reform\\" fo the Church. What it did was to open the Gates of hell allowing the entrance of every perverted thought into the bride of Christ, the Holy Roman Catholic Church. It is unfortunate that so few catholcis are catechized enough to realize the damage the Council did tot he Church. We are now reaping the infiltration of the Church by its enemies: homosexuals, ecumenicals, dissenters and communists.Perhaps this book will aid in clarifying the war of the Council's children against those who daily defend the Church.It is time to empty out the seminaries of the corrupters and have the American hierarchy resign."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"While reading the book, I noticed two things one of which was stated by another reviewer which is that the problem may not be orthodox/liberal but rural/urban dioceses with their differing cultures that is the primary cause of a lack of sufficient vocations. The other aspect which I believe requires further exposition for clarification is the research method used. The author interviewed \\"dozens of seminarians, former seminarians and recently ordained priests, seminary faculty and vocation directors\\". He then write that he \\"interviewed 125 seminarians from 50 dioceses, and 22 major seminaries\\". This means he interviewed about 2.5% of the approximately 5000 seminarians which is not a particularly high sample rate. Also from the statements he makes it appears that the vast majority of those interviewed were \\"orthodox\\". We do not have any statements from the so-called \\"liberal\\" seminarians. However, to his credit he does quote many so-called \\"liberal\\" priests. Many of the stories he writes about are truly evil to be taking place in seminaries dedicated to the education and formation of priests. I do believe Mr. Rose has provided a great service for the Church. With what I perceive is a study lacking in some detail, it nevertheless provides a starting point for serious discussion and perhaps a more comprehensive research study because this problem must be solved for the sake of the Church in America."},{"Title":"Goodbye!

And seminaries can make no statement about individual cases, no matter what lies disgruntled ex-seminarians may spread.'My' seminary is mentioned in the book as one known for its thriving gay subculture. I've been here three years and not seen it. There are gay guys here--many among the most theologically conservative members of the community--but that is okay by Rome, which matters more to me than whether it's okay with Michael Rose. I've yet to be propositioned, and no one I've met here in three years has complained of any sort of harrassment.What Rose gets entirely wrong is this. Some people who hold traditional/conservative views are dismissed from formation for OTHER reasons. For example, two guys who live around the corner from me claim to hear from the Blessed Mother on a regular basis. She \\"tells\\" one what color pants and shoes to wear and the other how to decorate his room. Their theology is sound, but I'm not at all sure they are. If they don't mature, they'll be asked to leave--and rightly so--and even though they're conservative, that won't be the reason.For the record, 'liberal' guys are also asked to leave seminaries.Rose is biased and talks only to biased people. It may be true that this country's Catholic seminaries are turning away 'good men' but it would be wrong to conclude that on the basis of this book. Again, just because someone is sound theologically, it doesn't mean they should be ordained. Think of all the losers who yearn to be cops and soldiers, wash out, and forever after complain that the brass had it in for 'em from the beginning. As the old song says, \\"It ain't necessarily so.\\""},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"This is a sad, but excellent book documenting how homosexuals have nearly hijacked the Catholic priesthood. They were able to do this in the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council, the greatest disaster in the 2,000 year old history of the Catholic Church.We have Christ's promise that the gates of hell will not prevail against the Church, but it is sure getting a beating at the hands of its Judas bishops and priests. Michael Rose does a great job of telling this story in his book. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those Catholics with their heads still in the clouds (the pay, pray, obey variety, who think the pope and the bishops can do no wrong)."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"I was in a seminary before the time Mr. Rose describes. My experience was just as debilitating but in the opposite way. At the that time, during and right after Vatican II, the seminary professors were aloof, cruel, disrespectful of students, poor teachers and very emotionally immature men by every measure. They saw their job as not to help and support young guys in discerning a vocation but instead spent most of their time disciplining us for every minor violation of the Holy Rule. I also realize now that many of the seminarians and also the professors were working-class guys who had little or no spiritual preparation for their vocations. It was a sort of \\"club\\" that they were being initiated into. Lucky for me I left before the horrors of the 1970s and 80s. If people really want to know what caused the breakdown of the seminary system they should look to Rome and the Vatican. A corrupt clerical leadership created the atmosphere where power and secrecy were the basis for decision-making, and where the pope and the Curia could not or would not reform themselves in a way to truly make the church relevant and holy. No surprises here. Just a lot of mistakes by those in positions of authority."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"This book definitely nails the topic right on the head. The authority and influence of religion as we typically think of it is definitely eroding, especially with younger folks today. There are huge cultural changes going on, but only a few small groups and thinkers - LiveReal.com and Ken Wilber come to mind, from what I've found - are truly addressing them at all. Definitely a compelling and incisive look at one of the most important issues of today."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Michael Rose has discovered the hidden virus which has produced a generation or two of destroyed vocations, disillusioned and demoralized clergy and even some cases of psychological, emotional, spiritual and sadly even some cases of sexual abuse or misconduct. As a someone who endured 12 years of high school, college and major seminary, I can attest to the fact that me and my colleagues experienced the best and the worst. \\"Goodbye! Good Men\\" exposes the triad of the evil beast, namely, BAD theology, BAD liturgy and BAD morals. The present climate and media frenzy focuses exclusively on the sex scandals but that is only one third of the monster. Heterodox theology taught by dissident theologians, combined with liturgical abuses and irreverence have given the green light and philosophical imprimatur for immoral behavior and activity. If the Magisterium can be disregarded and if the rubrics of the Mass can be discarded, then it is only logical to proceed and violate the natural law as well. SAD REALITY is that there were MANY good, holy, orthodox and very moral priests, professors, rectors, faculty and seminarians in all the seminaries I attended but their legacy was eclipsed by the dissent, disobedience and immorality of a few of their own colleagues. I had several exemplary priests at Saint Marks and at Mary Immaculate, both Diocesan and Religious, but it was some of their contemporaries who distorted doctrine, diluted morals and treated the Sacred with disdain who left a lasting wound on many GOOD MEN. Thankfully, in my case, the culprits are gone (left the ministry, the priesthood or are no longer alive) and the former institutions who employed them are no more or under new, improved, reliable and better management. This is not the case in all seminaries and dioceses, though.Those 'good men' whose vocations were destroyed, those of us who were persecuted for our fidelity to Rome and the good priests who tried their best to faithfully teach the truth and who actually gave good example by living holy lives; all these are also victims along with the People of God who are subjected in many places to heterodox homilies, liturgical nonsense and inappropriate behavior from some of their priests.Abandoning celibacy, ordaining women or any of the other pseudo-panaceas will not treat the disease and neither are they valid cures or treatment, either. Sound doctrine, reverent worship and an enforced moral code of behavior will produce healthy, balanced, safe and dependable priests to serve the Church and her faithful members. Anything less is a disservice to the seminarians, the bishops who sent them and the people they will hopefully serve one day as spiritual shepherds. \\"Goodbye! Good Men\\" just doesn't identify the tumor but it proposes the cure as mentioned above. Instead of attacking the messenger and the message, we should look at the situation as it is and realize that the problem is an old one, a painful one but it is still, by God's grace, one that can be corrected and conquered."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Most books on controversial subject matter embody a certain element of overkill to prove their point but Michael Rose is 'shockingly on the mark' with, Good Bye! Good Men. Many in Detroit have lived through what Mr Rose describes in his book. A close friend was subjected to professional psychological counseling for a year (at his own expense) and needed none. The final report read, This client did not need counseling and has no sign of pathology or abnormality. Basically, he was just too Catholic. The current sexual crisis in Holy Mother Church clearly shows what the Liberalism of 1960-1985 produced. This brand of mis-guided and unholy leadership never results in reform or progress. Through the concerted efforts of current Rector, Bishop Allen Vigneron, Sacred Heart Seminary is healing from what I call \\"Metastatic Liberalism\\" and today continues to heal and grow in Grace and in Favor with God and Man.

Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"This book gets at the hidden roots of the spiritual malaise in American Catholicism, especially in the priesthood. It notes the sexual decadence and theological heresy that has suffocated many a seminary and many a diocese. The extensive documentation is often painful reading of a spiritual and academic elite that has completely lost its moral bearings. Most heartbreaking are the accounts of sacerdotal vocations destroyed by a formation bureaucracy that will only award dissent and moral laxity. The proposed remedy of genuine moral reform is as convincing as is the portait of the decadence of Amchurch."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"This is a book not to be dismissed lightly. The author doesn't engage in name-calling or finger-pointing. He makes his statements and backs them up carefully - so much so that it's hard to imagine that anyone could dispute his findings. Mr. Rose has done the Church a great service by shining a spotlight on a very unpleasant problem, and one that needs to be addressed immediately."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Michael Rose could not have put together a more timely book. Goodbye! Good Men exposes the degradation and immorality found at several Catholic seminaries and through first-person accounts explain how faithful priestly candidates over the past two decades have been turned away.Rose, familiar to most through his work profiling the \\"wreckovations\\" performed in Catholic cathedrals and parishes in his books, The Renovation Manipulation and Ugly as Sin, does a bang-up job profiling the depths of sexual perversion rampant in major U.S. seminaries. The book is not for the faint of heart.The book goes a long way in explaining the recent sexual scandals plaguing the Church. Those shocked by the scandals, will be even more shocked when they read the book. If even a portion of what Rose documents is true, the worst is yet to come."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Rose has brought back the inside story on the collapse on vocations within the Catholic Church in America. He has provided overwhelming documentation on how the elite centers of American Catholicism, especially the most presigious seminaries, have fostered moral depravity and religious dissent over several decades. He also shows that the few seminaries showing signs of demographic and spiritual vitality are those that adhere strictly to the doctrinal teaching of the magisterium and to the ascetical traditions of Catholicism.His book is a call to renounce the fatalism that has clouded American Catholic thinking over the decades. Our problem is not simply the materialism and skepticism of our coulture. Our problem lies in ourselves, in our refusal to embrace a roubst Catholicism with all of its moral demands and all of its spiritual beauty. Rose is exactly on target in arguing that the solution to our crisis is not the failed effort to refashion our faith in the image of liberal Protestantism. The solution is a militant, prophetic Catholicism capable of sustaining the sacrifice of an entire life."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Michael Rose's devastating reportage on the moral and spiritual implosion of many Catholic seminaries confirms anecdotal evidence I have gathered by talking to ex-seminarians and orthodox Catholic pshychologists. Many seminaries are hot houses of sexual activity where orthodox heterosexual men with genuine vocations are distinctly vulnerable. These good men are often treated in a manner reminiscent of how the Soviet Union once dealt with dissidents. This is not an exaggeration. Many bishops have been grossly negligent in their oversight of these institutions. The more people who read this book, the more likely it is that something can be done."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Thank God that this book has finally been written. Scripture says that the truth will set us free. For the young men, the heterosexual/orthodox seminarians like my son(who are in the minority in some seminaries), I pray that every Catholic will read this because this book shows it like it is.... perhaps not in every seminary but in some and that is too many lost vocations. The crisis in priestly vocations in America will not abate until and unless the seminaries here are purged of the teachers sowing dissent and seminary formation staff members which crucify orthodox seminarians.

It's all true. I experienced most of the horrors detailed in this book at a seminary located on the campus of the University of Notre Dame in the early 1980's.

Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Someone had to write this book. The Church has been infected with a cancer called the homosexual agenda and Rose exposes it at its source - the Catholic seminary where priests are formed.In a brutally candid style, Rose uncovers the depth, breadth and intensity of this 'gay agenda' that will be at times difficult to read, even for those who have recognized its impact in many of today's Catholic parishes and liturgies.Half way through the book, one has to wonder how the Church can recover from the relentless efforts to erode all that Catholics believe. However, there is good, reassuring news as you continue to read to the end. This book you cannot put down and it is in my opinion a 'MUST READ' for all Catholics and non-Catholics interested in the true battle raging inside the Catholic Church today."},{"Title":"Goodbye!

Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"A few years ago I asked an orthodox priest whether a devout young man who believes he has a vocation would likely get turned off by the seminary experience. He told me \\"If he's smart he'll keep his mouth shut until after he's ordained.\\" I didn't realize how true those words were until I read this book.Reading the accounts of pious young men turned away by agenda-driven screeners, facing a moral cesspool among their classmates, being subject to psychological abuse, and dealing with theology instruction that denies even basic tenets of the Catholic faith, I found myself getting depressed for the future of the Church. The book ends with a hopeful message though, pointing out that vocations can still thrive under strong, orthodox bishops.I often get angry when liberal priests bemoan the \\"vocation crisis\\", saying we need to pray harder for vocations (as though it was caused by us not praying enough!). Now I know where I need to focus my prayers - that we will be blessed with good bishops who have the courage to fix the priestly formation programs."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"This is a very good book which has come out at a difficult time in the Catholic Church. I agree whole-heartedly with the book's premise, that the true &quot;Vocations Crisis&quot; is actually a part of a much larger crisis in fidelity; part of this being agenda-driven &quot;liberal&quot; Catholics who did severe damage in the way priests were formed or which candidates made it through to ordination. Now faced with numerical and behavioral problems among the clergy, they actually point to a further &quot;liberal&quot; agenda as the solution! My only critique of the book is its often sensationalist tinge, and, in my opinion, an occasional lack of clarity on when one of the decribed incidents occurred (it makes a big difference if something happened during the kooky 70s or in the 90s when things were generally being cleaned up). As far as Rose's work being called into question in recent months, mostly due to the questionable credibility of some of his contributers, whether this is well founded or not, the book is still an invaluable resource for those trying to make sense out of how the scandals have come about and, as I stated above, the book's basic premise is developed in a very convincing manner. I highly recommended this book for priests, seminarians, and any Catholic who wishes to gain insight into the foundational problems in priestly formation that have led to the sad situation in the contemporary Church."},{"Title":"Goodbye!

Trigilio.GOODBYE! GOOD MEN is good bedside book for every bishop and Chancery employee."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"With a multitude of sterling examples, details, and references, Mr. Rose condemns liberalism for the loss of post-conciliar church vocations. Pass&eacute; 19th and early 20th-century popes had continuously warned Catholics of the dangers of modernization. And today, as Mr. Rose meticulously narrates, heretics have indeed gained control of the church. Are the data presented 100% accurate? Elitists can argue that as they attempt to obfuscate, impress, and mystify us all. It really doesn't matter. The demise of the church speaks for itself. Those heretics, who effected the Vatican II changes in canon law, liturgy, and ordination rites should have had the decency to profess their newly-envisioned religion in their own venue with their own duly selected rituals and prelates, as Martin Luther once did, instead of revising the teachings, traditions and essence of the one, holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.Traditional and orthodox Catholics, who have been excommunicated thanks to the Novus Ordo doctrine of inclusiveness, should read this book. They won't find any new reasons explaining the post-Vatican II church's demise. They can, however, commiserate with Mr. Rose's anguish and laud his demand for a reconversion of today's church. Persons, who have no clue as to what happened to the Catholic Church but believe there is something fundamentally wrong, should read this book to find another piece in the puzzle.Mr. Rose proposes concrete solutions for today's abuses. He understands that the post-Vatican II church is in survival mode. It is bearing identical fruits already borne by earlier 20th-century Protestant liberalizations: lack of vocations, divided denominations, and liturgical inconsistencies. Einstein said, \\"Stupidity is the repetition of the same experiment and expecting a different outcome\\". Did the Vatican II Illuminati expect a different outcome in their attempts to modernize the Church? Or was their goal the total revamping of the Church into their own secular, humanistic, and prideful self-image? Wasn't it even more ludicrous to expect dogmatic consistency after offering positions of authority and vocations to Protestant ministers who may have engendered, or at least not prevented, the demise of the Protestant Orthodoxy? Mr. Rose is right.While buttressing his position with numerous specifics, Mr. Rose could have cited subtle changes in canon law enacted by his liberals that would have further supported his case, (1917 Code of Canon Law, Canon 2359, Section 2 versus the 1983 Code, Canon 1395, Section 2, regarding penalties for pedophilia by religious). Why these paradigm shifts in canon law and dogma? Is dogma mutable?After centuries of heretical attacks, the essence of Catholicism remained immutable under the auspices of the great Doctors of the Church and a plethora of devout religious vocations. We truly were standing on the shoulders of giants. Today's Novus Ordo church navigates a Diluvium sea of moral consensus and feel-good psycho-doctrine and rituals and definitely needs more people like Mr. Rose.The paucity of vocations is only one tumor, albeit a major one, asphyxiating the church today. Mr. Rose states that vocations can only be engendered by a return to true sanctity and orthodoxy by both the apostolate and the laity. I would add that the repudiation of heretics and the humble acceptance of pre-Vatican II dogma are also essential.Critics may say Mr. Rose has further destroyed the church from within. Considering what some of Mr. Rose's Novus Ordo bishops have done to the church, this author merits sainthood. And why not, the current pope has canonized more saints in the last 10 years than were canonized in the first 1,960 years of the Church's history. We must truly be living in saintly,...or is it sanctimonious, times?"},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Nothing in the book has not been known for some time, EXCEPT the breadth and scope of the gay subculture within our Church blows my mind! Nevertheless with all the accompanying sadness, after reading a few of the beginning pages and the story line continuing throughout, one big question stands over and above everything else in the book: Why has the Vatican tolerated this horrible condition for so long a period of time????? Again nevertheless, I submit the problem is much more sinister than the gay subculture problem that we now know about from this book and the media attention to priests we have been reading about. This book proves to me that ever since certain bishops (I would love to name some, but perhaps my review would not be acceptable) took control of the National Council of Catholic Bishops immediately after Vat II their primary goal and agenda was to break away from the Roman Catholic Church and establish their own American Catholic Church, which would mean a new religion. What better way to do this than in the seminaries, and the correct assumption that most of the \\"good\\" bishops would be insipid and apathetic to the obvious masterful scheme of this satanic element taking over the Catholic Church. (Imagine, one of these now dead cardinals was being touted to be a Saint!) The grip is loosened but the sinister elements are still in control of the NCCB. Since the Vatican remained and still remains silent, although hurtful and sad, the revelations by the media of the amazing and almost unbelievable conduct of our priests and bishops will prove to be a singular blessing affording a glimmer of hope for our Church in the United States."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"The horrors of what some seminaries/teachers let happen during the late 60's thru early 90's has given us much of the corruption we see today. It was mentioned by another reviewer that Rose(author) was blaming Vatican II for many of these problems. In reading the book my take was Rose was blaming a convenient misinterpretation of what Vatican II was actually saying. This book needs to be read by Catholics! For those who innocently propose a liberal or secular agenda without understanding the damage they are doing to their faith and Church, need to have their eyes opened. There is so much spin out in the media it is very easy to misunderstand the difference between unchanging truth and contemporary culture.This is no small matter.Just last week a newly appointed Nun to the parish introduced a new CCD book that would be teaching our children Catholicism. One of the themes is how we need to be thankful for the \\"women's movement\\", references to Mother Earth/Father Sky,and a continual litany of New Age mumbo-jumbo.Read also \\"The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow\\".Catholics for a Free Choice and Dignity, although made up of supposed Catholics, preach lifestyles that do not follow Catholic teaching, is political and very in your face(both have web pages) The Church is where one receives spiritual food not the latest political agenda. If this element is so anti-Rome/anti-Church, why don't they go off and start their own Church or join the many Protestant Churches that embrace their thinking? Why do they feel they have a responsibility, a mission, to destroy or change to their liking what many of us hold dear? Martin Luther when he strongly disagreed with the Church left and started his own. Another eye opener is \\"Harmful to Minors\\" by J. Levin treating us to a indepth study of the much needed sexual liberation of our children and teens. Her book refers in glowing terms to Catholics for a Free Choice and I believe Dignity. If not Dignity I'm sure it was an oversite. As my mother would say, Birds of a feather, flock together."},{"Title":"Goodbye!

The world is not as dark as is portrayed by this book. Yes there are dark spots and something needs to be done. But the book does not strike me as balanced or thorough journalism"},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Using the worst of tattletale journalism's expose tactics, Michael Rose provides a voice for disgruntled seminarians. By documenting their grievances against seminaries from which they've been refused admission, expelled, dropped out, or quietly endured, Mr. Rose offers their complaints as fact. He neither substantiated them or provided the targeted individuals or organizations opportunity to rebut or respond to the charges!Then, he attempted to associate correlations with causation, using the unscientifically and unvalidated information obtained from these grievances, combined with other statistical data, to support a weak &amp; controversial hypothesis that reduced vocation rates are linked to the problems described by the disgruntled seminarians.While Mr Rose may well have identified issues of concern in seminaries, it is impossible to discern whether the issues he reports are as widespread as he'd have you believe. Unfortunately, his tabloid approach fails to support his conclusions, and judging from public statements released from schools since the books release, it would appear that schools themselves disagree with Mr. Rose's portrayals!Such sloppy reporting leaves Mr. Rose's primary thesis with little credible support, and leaves the Church further wounded, again from the inside.I feel badly this book played into so many people's phobias and has been so widely accepted. At a time when it really is important to focus on improving seminary education and training for our priests...this homophobic diatribe only serves to call attention to a minor part of the work the Church must yet do to restore trust!"},{"Title":"Goodbye!

Since then I have remained a Catholic and have read much on the subject of Church, and Church History, and on the present-day crises. Sorry, but Michael Rose did not hit on the right answer for a lack of vocations. He started with a conclusion and worked backwards. His conclusion is that orthodox (conservative) vocations are being turned away, and that the liberal institution is the one turning them away, and he uses some very flimsy criteria to prove it. One only has to look at the dioceses he cites as being low in vocations versus the ones that have higher perentage rates, and one can see that one of the critical variables is urban versus city, instead of orthodox versus liberal. This was just not good journalism. Sorry, the problem goes much deeper than that."},{"Title":"Goodbye!

We need to ask the question &quot;Why are our best and brightest not going into the priesthood and religious life&quot;? Some of the seminaries that are very clerical and afraid of questions raised by the broader Catholic community draw many effeminate and immature candidates. This will just make the current problem worse."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"This author doesn't explore the real issue of what the church considers valuable, instead, he stays mired in the same old sacrifical muck. He tries to explain that the liberal years of the 60's through the 80's caused much of the church's decline, but many of us life-long Catholics in the real world have a somewhat different viewpoint. Narrow minded thinking and the belief that only men can run the church, has now caught up with us. But this off-limits subject certainly isn't explored. Now with the harsh light of truth shining on the recent ugliness, perhaps men with power in the church will listen, and perhaps now they'll start to widen their outdated stance about women taking larger roles. And maybe someone will even have the courage to write a book about it! If you want to read the same old stuff on Catholicism, only with a dramatic twist, then this is your book."},{"Title":"Goodbye!

Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Michael Rose has hit the nail on the head! I was appalled at what is being promulgated at many seminaries in this country which is exposed in this book. I was shocked by the blatant immoral attitudes and behaviors of the powers-that-be at these seminaries. You can spell it this way: DISSENT! I was so dismayed at what I read I contacted a current priest and current seminarian who both attended the same seminary which my diocese sends men to (one which Rose zeroes in on in his book), and they both said that the contents of this book are absolutely true! You want to know what the problem is in the Church today? It is called the \\"feminist, homosexual agenda\\" it IS NOT pedophilia. This book is NOT about promoting homophobia. It is about HETEROPHOBIA and HETERODOXY! Satan has entered into the sanctuary of the formation of our priests. Pray, pray, pray that our bishops and the Holy See clean out the blatant snubbing of the teachings of Holy Mother Church. It was the fastest 351 pages I have ever read. However, the content of this book WILL HELP the Church in the long run even though the content of it is troubling."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"I can't thank Michael Rose enough for his carefully documented expose of what is happening in many seminaries across the country. It puts the sex scandals currently plaguing the church into their proper context. It's not the celibacy requirements, it's the immorality that is running rampant in the seminaries!I completely agree with Mr. Rose that orthodoxy is the only path toward a resurgence in vocations in the Catholic Church. I was raised a Catholic in an urban parish in Minnesota and, quite frankly, I was more than a little disaffected with my faith until I hit my mid-thirties. The reason for my cool attitude was not that the Church was too rigid, but because the priests and religious I encountered didn't seem to believe what the Church taught. It was not until I moved to rural Minnesota about five years ago and met a young priest who was enflamed with a love for the orthodox teachings of the Catholic Church that my own love for the Church was rekindled to the point that I became a secular Franciscan. Such is the power of sincere faith.I think the current scandals have woken up enough orthodox Catholics so that the seminary reforms proposed by the Pope recently will be far more successful in comparison to the abortive reforms that were ordered back in 1981."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Michael Rose has done a tremendous service to the Church in his expose of the destruction of the Catholic seminary system as a result of unchecked dissent from Church teaching since Vatican II. In particular, it is very clear that the present crisis in the Church as a result of this dissent has spawned a gay subculture that must be rooted out if there is any hope of it being resolved. Rose, thankfully, pulls no punches in putting the blame where it belongs, on those responsible, clergy and laity alike, primarily those wearing miters, who, for the good of the Church, should be removed from their bishoprics for their culpability in being the primary cause of the present difficulties. Catholics in more than name only who give this book an objective read will be saddened, and then angered at what was allowed to happen by those claiming to be their Good Shepherds, but who were really Judases. The extensive documentation of the promotion of homosexuality in Catholic seminaries is incredible give the well know inordinate correlation between homosexuality and child sexual abuse when compared against similar incidences in the heterosexual population. We're talking about boys being abused here by men, which is homosexuality. What I as a Catholic find incredible is how this mindset was allowed to proliferate as described by Rose given the Church's clear teachings against the homosexual lifestyle, which the Church considers an intrinsic moral evil, with the inclination accordingly being objectively disordered. Rose is to be commended for hopefully waking up Catholics as to the attempting hijacking of their Church by militant homosexual advocates who would destroy it from within. He makes it very clear that good role models are needed for vocations with orthodoxy in the faith being the primary catalyst. Those dioceses which are loyal to the Magisterium of the Church, Rose shows, are where vocations are plentiful while those dioceses which could care less are dying. There needs to be a general housecleaning in the Catholic Church to remove the rot that has infested it. And that housecleaning starts by the realization that a problem exists, not denying that it doesn't. Rose has made us aware of the problem. The solution, as he suggests, will be up to the laity in support of orthodox clergy, particularly given the fact that many in the Church hierarchy have demonstrated that they can no longer be trusted. A Catholic priest, upon receiving the Sacrament of Holy Orders, is supposed to act as an alter Christus, another Christ. How is that possible by ordaining individuals who openly flaunt Christ's teachings? Easy answer, as Rose's book clearly points out, \\"It's not.\\" The consequenses for ignoring this seminal truth are being seen daily in the news."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"This busy mother who struggles to complete a book managed to finished this compelling expose in 3 days. Rose does a superb job at writing with a style that engages the reader while offering the facts of the matter with the documentation to substantiate his findings. After alerting us to the problems in some seminaries today, the author exposes the whole truth and shares with us a few current seminary success stories. The providential timing of the release of this book in the midst of a great crisis is confirmation that the continued purging of the Catholic Church is essential to carry out Her evangelical mission - to draw people to the heart of Jesus."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"This book gets right to the heart of the vocation crisis in America. Many vocations here are destroyed by a formation faculty that promotes back-stabbing and tattle taleing rather than fraternal charity. This same faculty also promotes psychological \\"counseling\\" as the cure-all rather than fostering spiritual and community support which also destroys many good vocations. This craziness is why there is so much bitterness between and among faculty members and seminarians and the reason for many departures from the seminary (including my own in recent years)."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"As a former seminarian who just left a well known Seminary in Indiana, reading Mr. Rose's book was like going back and reliving some nightmares I experienced in the last two years. Not all of my seminary experience was bad. But it is true that there is one priest there who runs his classes with intimidation and fear and thinks nothing of embarrassing the older or not physically attractive seminarians with the crudest remarks. Not to mention the fact that during his lectures he uses profanity in almost every other sentence. Yet, this man has been regarded as \\"brilliant\\" by the formation staff and has been allowed to continue in his position, \\"weeding out\\" the seminarians who are just \\"average\\" (by looks and what he prejudges as inept intellectual capability) and giving all the As and Bs to the young, cute guys who are afraid to stand up to his intimidations. It was MY choice to leave the seminary because I didn't feel I had a vocation to the priesthood. But this is one aspect of Mr. Rose's book that is certainly true. Seminaries are undoubtedly filled with priests as instructors who care nothing about properly forming good, honest, orthodox men who are truly serious about a vocation. I know. I experienced it."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"I do believe that the material in this book is accurate. I was a girlfriend of someone who had gone to Sacred Heart Seminary high school (otherwise called the minor seminary) in the late 60's. I met him after he had decided not to continue on in a vocation. Anyway, we went to visit some friends of his who had continued on to major seminary there. One of the guys who stayed (at least the first year) made a statement way back then that to continue on in the seminary at Sacred Heart you had to be either queer or neurotic. Another person who had gone to the high school had been very serious and studious when he started out. He was written up as being a troublemaker. When he changed his ways and got wilder he was considered by teachers and older students to be a model seminarian."},{"Title":"Goodbye!

Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Rose's book is a blockbuster expose of the roots of the current Catholic priest pedophile scandal. Rose brings all of the pieces together so the practicing Catholic can have a frame of reference to understand where some of the ambiguous theolgy being used and taught in Catholic religious education classes comes from.Althought very depressing for the reader to see how orthodox priests have been excluded from priestly ranks, the final chapter offers a grand solution for what appears to be a very deep seeded pathology infecting the Catholic hierarchy and clergy."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"A must Read for Catholic's and Non-Catholic's who wish to know just what is going on behind the \\"so called\\" pedophillia scandal.Michael Rose does an excellent job of whinnoing down the vast amount of information available in order to highlight the liberal ideological crises that is behind the homosexual crisis in the Church today. He took a ton of data avialable from various periodicals, news sources and internet sites and brought it together into a dynamic tour de force!My only criticism of the book is that in cutting the information down it made it appear as if his sources for the goings on behind the scenes of the Catholic seminaries for the last 3 decades was limited to only a handful of seminarians.All in all a Must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Michael Rose explains very well why the Church is facing the sexual scandals it is. What I find interesting is some recent comments by a few Cardinals concerning US Seminaries. Those comments indicate they have read the book also. A good read that I should have put down as it got late...but I couldn,t."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that this book is interesting, raises important questions and red flags, but is too full of anecdotal evidence to be considered a real resource. It's a whistle-blowing book, not hard journalism or serious, rigorous research. What the book reveals is infuriating, and Rose's interpretation of where the problems came from is persuasive to a point. But the really rigorous, seriously researched book on this topic has yet to be written. That said, Rose should be praised for inciting and directing furor. I, for one, hope the offenders are defrocked, the so-called \\"sex ed experts\\" thrown out, and the shameful seminaries are cleaned out by bishops who actually have a spinal column."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Michael Rose is one of the stars in the new generation of Catholics coming into their own. He is unafraid to simply tell the truth. Unlike many of the Bishops who are no longer Catholic, Rose writes from the stand point of obedience.Since the Pope and Bishops have not run away from the problem and refuse to state the cause of the scandals, it is up to faithful laymen like Rose to help restore the Church to Her Glory.For any young man considering the priesthood, this book is a must read.Without obedience to Church teaching, no plan for reform will be successful and Rose exposes that reality."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"In an informative and well-written book, Michael Rose has given what is, to date, the best reasons for the present priesthood crisis.The author claims that the reason we have a shortage of priests (at least, in many dioceses) is because for many years qualified candidates in those dioceses have been turned away. He claims that those who hold true to the authentic magisterial teachings of Holy Mother Church are, in those places, rejected in favor of men who oppose Her, especially in teachings concerning homosexuality, celibacy, an all-male priesthood, divorce, and contraception. This predictably has resulted in scandals, heterodox teachings from the pulpit, and less reverence in our houses of worship and in our liturgies.He further claims that the reason qualified candidates are rejected is because those who would want to overthrow Holy Mother Church have made their way into powerful positions in many (but certainly not all) dioceses and seminaries, including many bishops. These people have in turn become \\"gatekeepers\\"; filtering out the qualified candidates and welcoming the unqualified. The stories that some of his interviewees tell about what goes on in heterodox seminaries are incredible.The author has hit the nail right on the head with this book. It does not take a genius to see that the overall quality of our priests has gone down significantly in the last 30 or so years, and that the quality of the liturgy and the reverence shown by the faithful has gone down with it (but make no mistake - there are still plenty of faithful, reverent Catholics out there, and faithful priests and bishops who maintain loyalty to Rome; they are just getting fewer and further between).And the answer the author proposes to this crisis is just so obvious; any faithful Catholic could tell you. More orthodox Catholicism, NOT LESS! We do not need to trash Vatican II; that council did not encourage disobedience and irreverence - rather, it reaffirmed them.An excellent book - five stars easily."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"I am writing in response to some of the other reviewers' refutation of Rose's indeniable truism that those dioceses that promote orthodoxy also receive abundant vocations. They claim contrary to the book's claim that the rate of diocesan vocations are linked most heavily to the rural/urban demographics of the diocese, rather than to a diocese's loyalty to the Church. This claim of theirs is absolutely unsubstantiated nonsense; major urban dioceses of Atlanta, Denver, Bridgeport CT are flourishing with vocations as are the rural dioceses of Lincoln, Omaha and Peoria...all are orthodox. Conversely, liberal dioceses that are rural like New Ulm MN, Saginaw MI, Des Moines IA AND the to varying degrees like-minded urban dioceses of Milwaukee, Los Angeles and Providence often resort to sponsoring whacky MTV-style gimmicks as attempt to fill their largely empty seminaries.Also, who's to say that Rose should have interviewed many if any liberal seminarians for this book in order to validate it as proper journalism when it is open fact that liberals have the run of most seminaries? Few have even disputed that, especially that the book is about the victims of being orthodox, not about some of the liberals and their gay flings. This book is very solid if that's the best critics can rebutt of it..."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"The current crisis in the Catholic Church as portrayed by the media obscures the real issues, this book present what is one of the real issues at the heart of the current crisis - the corruption of the seminary from vocation directors, to the culture at seminary, to the content of teaching. P>This well researched book by Michael Rose documents the abuses that have spawned the current crisis (although researched and written before the outbreak of the current crisis).The focus of this book is about how men who express a desire to live a manly total self-sacrificial life of priestly celibacy are persecuted by heterodox agendas be they feminist, homosexual or what have you. The greatest role model for the priesthood is John Paul II. Read 'A Witness to Hope' or get the video to learn who this man really is. His witness to the mystical connection he has to Christ is inspiring and calls forth vocations sleeping dormant. The only tragedy is that the best example of manly sacrifice is so far from the daily contact of seminarians, instead they have gay mentors who try to seduce them and convince them of 'theologies' that amount to rebellion against the faith . . . and who is the inspiration of rebellion? The dark one, satan.How could it be that men who profess a commitment to the Catholic Church, Her teachings and the leadership of the Pope are deemed ill-suited to priestly life?The Gate-Keepers are corrupt. This book documents the evidence."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Those of us who have been following the deterioration of the Catholic Church in America in The Wanderer, New Oxford Review, Catholic News and World Report, and similar publications are more surprised by the shock in other Catholics than by the legal scandals or the documentation in this book. My only comment to those who find it unbalanced is \\"Prove it wrong.\\" What was documented in the seminaries is exactly the same as what has been happening in chancery offices and parishes for the last 35 years. Really, are you surprised at anything done by people who systematically despise authority, tradition and moral duty, and whose calls for tolerance and diversity pay homage to everything EXCEPT orthodox Catholic teaching and morality? No, this book is a microscope sample of a massive infection.I do wish that more supporting evidence, such as school documentation and denial of interview requests were included in the book to add credibility. However, none of the assertions made by Rose is strains credibility.Except one...that there are still young men with strong orthodox faith and good character who want to be Catholic priests, and that there are strong priests and bishops who are drawing them into the priesthood, so that the Church in America will not go the way of the Church in Egypt and New Testament Asia. It is the only assertion that evokes in me any willing suspension of disbelief."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"Mr. Rose's book should be read by every Catholic. I've heard critics dismiss this book as homophobic, full of outdated thinking, contrary to Vatican II, etc. The book is none of these things. Rather, Mr. Rose points out how the REAL principles of Vatican II, which are readily discernable to anyone who actually reads the documents. The \\"outdated thinking\\" that critics dismiss are the very same ideas that fill the catechism and the documents of Vatican II. In other words, the teaching of the Church.Mr. Rose builds an impressive case to back up his points: statistics (e.g. numbers of seminarians by year and diocese), case testimonies from former seminaries (some of them now priests), quotations from vocational directors, bishops, etc.The books is incredibly timely, especially in light of the recent scandals where priests have been sexually involved with teenage boys. (The book went to the publisher before these recent scandals broke, making the timeliness all the more surprising).The book may shock and anger you (it should), but it will also give you hope, as Rose documents signs that the movement to return to orthodoxy and loyalty to Church teaching is gaining momentum (orthodox seminaries are filled to capacity). If enough Catholics read this book and act on it, that return to orthodoxy and the legitimate teachings of the Church, as found in the catechism and the documents of Vatican II, will happen much sooner."},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"As is now sadly evident, this book hits the mark on the condition of seminaries in the U.S. Having been privvy to this issue before the book was published, I rarely discussed it in the open because people did not believe it. Thanks to Mr. Rose for shedding some light on this horrendous situation, and for giving many of us some credibility.Maybe Mr. Rose will next investigate the state of the American Catholic heirarchy!"},{"Title":"Goodbye! Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood","review":"The Catholic Church of only forty years ago is hardly recognizable compared to the Church of today. Sadly, humble reverence for God and His institution and understanding of what is sacred have significantly diminished. It appears another cycle of decay and decadence has entered the Church's history.Michael Rose has laid bare the reasons for today's catastrophic decline of the Catholic Church in America. In Goodbye! Good Men, Rose has unveiled the arrogance of a large faction of the Catholic hierarchy which has unilaterally abandoned the Church's precepts while facilitating the corruption of its clergy. Philosophically, many in control of advancing the priesthood have championed self-fulfillment over the spiritually moral ideal of self-sacrifice. In essence, the Church has cultivated a cadre of wolves in sheep's clothing while it has turned away true shepherds.Rose outlines a politically correct mindset which has taken precedence among many bishops (and ultimately, cardinals) and their seminary proxies. He links a widespread sexually promiscuous ethos which has embraced homosexuality among the clergy to the problem of pedophilia. He exposes the chasm that exists between the orthodox priesthood and an extreme liberal wing which has denied tradition-oriented heterosexual men from entry into their ranks. In addition, Rose examines feminism and other politically-charged issues contrary to the Church's traditional teaching and moral values that have taken root. This is a must read for every Catholic who takes his religion seriously."},{"Title":"The Gerbil: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","review":"This book so far I think si one of the best gerbil books I have read so far.

Beware only of one thing: it is true what i read on another review about the fact that gerbils might be awake by night, but in the book it is said that they are supposed to sleep by night.. What i can say from experience is that my gerbils tend to sleep by night and if they wake up they are generally quite. In a few occasion it can happen that they go crazy by night, but i guess that i hear them only because i live in a loft and i sleep upstairs while their cage is just downstairs, without a wall separating us (which is a quite uncommomn situation i believe!)."},{"Title":"The Gerbil: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","review":"i found this book to have a lot of useful information, both background and caregiving. it spent a lot time selling the gerbil as a pet instead of just being an informational tool, this could be tiresome if you've already decided on a gerbil as a pet. overall, i would buy again."},{"Title":"The Gerbil: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","review":"I got this book from the library after my mouse died.

So they form an investment club and, after seeking professional advice, decide that they can figure out where to invest their money themselves. Their market research methods are really amusing and the book gently proceeds to a happy conclusion.The group of women we *meet* and get to know quite well is delightful.

They were bored with their husbands' devotion and preoccupation with Sunday t.v. sports -- and would not be moved, come hell or high water.A new, younger member, Skye, comes up with a big, bright idea. Instead of gossip and exchanging recipies (why couldn't they read books and review them?), they use her knowledge to get into the investment game. The pink-haired rebel suggested that their first 'go' should be Microsoft run by a youngish man named Bill Gates.They changed the name of their club to Larksdale Ladies Investment Club and, as their financial future improves, they find that they have more control over thier lives and involvement in community affairs. No one pays attention to you when you're poor, especially in a small town, particularly in my hometown. In Knoxville, we have a white-hair woman on City Council who now runs the whole town. She makes all the motions and the men all bow to her 'knowledge' on each and every issue which comes before them. She has wound up making all the decisions as she eats at all the restaurants which sell beer and stronger drinks and recommends them before the beer board. She won't ever shut up, having opinions on everything -- and they let her hold full reign. It has come to the breaking point. She has been in that position for only five years, winning by only a few votes. Yes, she is wealthy.In Larksdale, they come to each other's aid during family striff which helps they cope with their \\"scoundrel\\" mates. The richer they get, the wiser they appear; and, soon, find themselves stepping in \\"high cotton.\\" According to this writer, the wealthy are more \\"fulfilled.\\"I just thought they ate better, as they can afford to buy their hearts' desires and imbibe with the rest of the world.

The only thing I didn't like was the glaring inaccuracies: the stock market crash was known as 'Black Monday' not Black Thursday as described in the book, who on earth was drinking Starbucks in the 80's, and who is always in the right place at the right time? It's very far fetched. But the story is still very enjoyable. I know it's fiction and being accurate is not neccessary, but it makes the story better if the author appears credible.

One thing leads to another and...well, read the book.In the course of their marvelous adventures, the reader learns, almost as asides, the details of the characters' private lives and personalities.

Rest assured, everything works out in the end in a most satisfying fashion, but on the way we are treated to ups and downs ranging from the merely comic to the hilarious. Hartwick also peppers the narrative with a menagerie of witticisms, including a few puns that are real groaners.

Told from the perspective of their lawyer, and daughter of one of the housewifes, the story is both unbelievable and funny.What would you do if all of the sudden you had a couple extra million to spend at leisure? That's what the book's about, of course. The book is just so very fun to read, with a touch of romance and characters that seem real. The escapades of these ladies are hillarious. You'll be amazed at what a bunch of old ladies can do when they put their minds to it.I recommend this book to everyone. It's positively delightful, and you won't regret reading it."},{"Title":"Ladies with Options","review":"In early-'80s Minnesota, some small-town women decide they're tired of living life on the margins, so they start BUYING on margin&#65533;stocks, that is. Thanks to their pink-haired tech guru, Skye Terrell, they latch onto winners like Dell and Microsoft&#65533;and boy, do they get rich.Getting rich means the chance to turn the tables on all the bosses, neighbors and family who&#65533;ve dissed them over the years. But it also means the chance to rise above the way they've been treated, and much of the fun comes in the inventive ways the Larksdale Ladies deal with treacherous boyfriends, crooked accountants, envious husbands and, finally, the rust belt threat to their whole way of life.One of the cable networks, naming LADIES to its summer's-best reading list, called it &quot;Bridget Jones meets the Beardstown Ladies&quot; and that sounds pretty fair. The plot's a comic romp like an old-time screwball comedy; but the narrator, a newly-minted lawyer named Sophia Peters, has a hip, modern way of laughing at the whole world, herself included. The result is admittedly pretty light stuff (with heart), but also a very upbeat, jolly read. Perfect for chasing the summer&#65533;or winter&#65533;blues.I loved it!"},{"Title":"Ladies with Options","review":"In 1983, it came to the attention of the Mostly Methodist Club, a group of eight mostly middle-aged, married Larksdale, Minnesota women that it was time to take charge of their lives. Between pensions, social security and meager savings, these ladies were looking at a pretty miserable retirement and old age. So with a little research and self teaching, they organized themselves into the Larksdale Ladies Independence Club (LLIC), put up $1500 each and carefully and cautiously began investing. But, when their youngest member, Skye, befriends a computer geek who tells her all about this amazing Seattle software company that is going to revolutionize the whole industry, they decide to buy Microsoft on opening day and the rest, as they say, is history. By 1986, the LLIC had over 1 million in their account and things were really beginning to take off for everyone..... Cynthia Hartwick has written a delightful and entertaining novel that pulls you into the story from page one and doesn't let you go until the very satisfying end of the novel. Her fast paced plot is full of great, witty writing and vivid scenes. But it's her strong, endearing and unique characters that make this novel stand out and you'll find yourself rooting for these mid-western ladies to the end as they take control of not just their financial lives, but their entire lives and make all their dreams come true. Told with insight, wisdom and laugh-out-loud humor, Ladies With Options is a winner."},{"Title":"Ladies with Options","review":"What if a group of women friends in a little mid-western town pooled their cookie-jar money and invested it in the mid-1980's stock market and secretly became millionaires? All the fun of rags to riches Cinderella transformations. And blowing husbands', families' and friends' minds. This is a hilarious, heart-warming read. A complete hoot and a joy ride. If you missed your chance to get rich then, live it now. Pick up an option on the ladies. It'll pay off big time. You'll be glad you made this investment."},{"Title":"Ladies with Options","review":"By nature and training,I am polite, and always raised my hand in school and do not talk above a whisper in the library, opera, or in church. On the plane reading &quot;Ladies&quot;, my laughter uncorked, drowning out the crying child in the second row. People turned. I managed to limit myself to perioding chortling. People noticed. Some perhaps considered a misplaced peanut would require the Heimlich maneuver and they were dutifully trying to remember their last date of certification. Others knew it was not alimentary but literary. The woman next to me noted the title &quot;Ladies W/ Optns&quot; in her PDA. The man across the aisle, dodging the patroling flight attendant, leaned over, squinting to see the page in the bad plane lighting, and withdrew at page end, muffling his guffaw with a paper napkin. Just other &quot;eavesreader&quot; drawn to the wit of Cynthia Hartwick. (I left &quot;Ladies&quot; open on the seat when I went to the restroom. Discrete sharing seemed polite). Cynthia Hartwick has a knack for hitting on the sublime humor in lives of &quot;our sort&quot; of real people. She takes average moments in fairly normal (but quirky) lives and, with the skill of a diamond cutter, makes them sparkle by adding just the right angle. The book is hilarious and moving, novel yet strangely nostalgic, and leaves readers satisfied yet hungering for more. (Reminds me of that dessert my aunt makes!) I hope Ms Hartwick obliges her fans. I love to laugh!"},{"Title":"Ladies with Options","review":"&quot;Ladies with Options&quot; breezes by with laughs on every page. Every character is an individual, and most are much like someone you've known, but the humor is never at their expense. Many of the laughs are in the way Sophia, the narrator, tells the story -- she's smart (a lot smarter than she lets on, in fact) and a little amazed at the unlikely success of the Larksdale Ladies Investment Club, for which she is the attorney. In some ways she's just along for the ride, but because her mother is a member of the club, she has more than just an attorney's view of the goings-on. She sees a group of rather conventional women growing into their new roles as stock market winners, and she sees how old ways of thinking begin to bend and break under the pressure of new ways of conducting their lives. The humor is not condescending, however. It is as if these ordinary people have had extraordinary abilities waiting to be released by new circumstances. The new circumstances are not an unmixed blessing, though, and marriages, friendships, and careers have to be adjusted. We see how even changes for the better can have unexpected consequences -- sometimes hilarious, but sometimes not entirely pleasant. Although you're never far from a quip or falling-down funny turn of events, you're also seeing real people cope with their own self-discovery. &quot;Ladies with Options&quot; is a funny book that reads in a whirlwind of good humor, but you'll also remember it for its lessons about the fast-changing world we all live in."},{"Title":"Ladies with Options","review":"The story is told by Sophia (with a long I) Peters, whose mother belongs to a loose-knit group, the Mostly Methodist Club, in Larksdale, Minnesota, 1983. The ladies of the club come to a realization that they are not well-prepared for retirement, and so they begin a gradual transformation into the Larksdale Ladies Independence Club, the hottest little investment club you ever heard of. Using some unorthodox methods of stock-picking they are soon making money hand over fist. When they invest in a little-known company called Microsoft--well--the sky's the limit.But, there is more to life than beating the stock market. There are families, relationships, husbands with fragile self-esteem, tyrannical bosses, men who are jerks, social change, economic change, and possibly the end of the little town of Larksdale. How will &quot;the ladies&quot; meet these challenges? Will money spoil them? Will their men be able to cope with their success? Will Sophia ever find true love? Will they all survive the economic down-turn? You will just have to read the book to find out.This is not a perfect book. There are too many lovable, warm-hearted characters, too many improbable situations, too many miraculous escapes from disaster, too many problems too easily solved, too many cute one-liners, and yet--the book works.

Hartwick uses extremely short chapters with very little character development. Hot issues from the 80s- homosexuality, HIV, divorce, domestic violence, Reagan- are woven into the story without much thought. Instead of spanning nearly a decade, Hartwick would have been better off focusing on two or three years. Some characters were extremely promising: Skye, Carter, Deb, Sophia. I could really relate to Skye's character in the beginning. Deb had her moments, but I felt like I didn't really know her. Sophia's character shares her life with us in the middle of the story. (In the beginning, she's simply a stressed out law student witnessing her mother's ladies club.) Profanity thrown into the dialogue seemed forced- as though Hartwick felt she had to include something vulgar in her PG story.I became bored with story at the introduction of PMT company. The ladies went from middle-class nobodies to wealthy do-gooder- a bit contrived. I was annoyed.Three stars because there is hope for Ladies With Options as a series. Hartwick should release a novel for each, 1983- 1991. I'd be most interested in the early years, as that's when the story and its characters are believable and likeable."},{"Title":"Ladies with Options","review":"Ladies With Options is a winner.The Mostly Methodist Club, in Larksdale, Minnesota, 1983, is a delightful group ofendearing and unique characters.If any of you enjoyed financial success during the dot.com era (I did, albeit briefly) you'll enjoy (and know) this may be written as fiction, but it did happen to many.This feel good story about a group of women who choose to take charge of their own lives and those around them, had me hooked from the first page.Funny, smart, and witty, Ladies With Options (all but two of them of them approaching retirement age) shakes the theory that only men in suits were making it big with IBM and Microsoft. These women become smart, business savvy risk-takers, saving the town's economy by dealing with the Wall Street big shots.Our lady's marriages, friendships, and careers have to be adjusted (sometimes with a rude awakening) but you'll remember this era and can't help but ponder our ever-changing world and wonder what's next?Looking forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Ladies with Options","review":"I cannot believe that one reviewer gave it one star.

Look up a word, and it will tell you each and every location where that word can be found, by chapter and verse. Obviously, this means that in some places listings will be different from one concordance to another depending on which translation was used to make it. This one is based on the Challoner-Douay-Rheims version, an excellent, literal translation of the Latin Vulgate. For a long time this was THE Catholic Bible in English, and is still one of the best translations you can commonly get. Since this concordance is based on a Catholic Bible, it gives references to all the books of the Bible, including those from the Deuterocanon (those also included in the Church's canon, but often rejected by protestants). So it includes books like 1st and 2nd Machabees, but not 3rd Esdras. It uses the Catholic titles for the books (e.g. Apocalypse instead of Revelation). This concordance also shows part of the surrounding verse to help you determine which entry you actually want without opening your Bible to every location listed. It lists numbers appearing in the text at the end after the alphabetical listing, which can be handy. Imprimatur from 1945.As I said this is a big book (1900+ pages), and appears quite complete. It is not very portable, but a great reference to have around.

When I was packing a few weeks ago for an annual vacation,I chose this large volume and a smaller O.Henry Prize Stories 2005 volume.I have now finished the O.Henry volume and am halfway through the Pushcart.The difference is significant. Out of the 20 O.Henry pieces, maybe 40-50% were successful for me.One or two drew from me my greatest homage, an unsolicited \\"Wowwwwww\\"followed by a long stunned silence filled with feeling and thought(Sherman Alexie, Wendell Berry). The lesser 50-60% were disappointing or even angering- in their reader manipulation or other weaknesses.The Pushcart experience has been quite different. So far, after 18 pieces, I have experienced only one piece of lesser quality. Otherwise, each has been very very strong. Authentic is the operative word here. No tricks or manipulations. Authentic true stories, essays, poems. A.Van Jordan has taken my breath away and Cynthia Weiner has given me more pleasurable chuckles and hoots than anyone since Jonathan Tropper. Edward Hirsch, Donald Hall and Rick Bass have mesmerized me.And there are so many more pieces to come. I've tried to analyze the 'why' between the difference in O.Henry and Pushcart.It is true that I have read other more successful O.Henry volumes.But Pushcart seems to involve many more editors/nominators and, given the enormous impossible task of sifting through so many submissions, this may be the key to Pushcart's success.I for one am most appreciative and excited."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Good simple story. An intimate look at the personal motivations that made Clark Kent become Superman. I really enjoyed the first part of the story. It got a little cliche' when Superman has to fight (again!!!) with the droids created by the evil genius Lex Luthor. Overall a good read!"},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"With SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT, author Mark Waid (with strongexpressionistic art from Leinil Francis Yu and fine lineinking from Gerry Alanguilan) addresses the all-importantissue of cultural identity, and delivers one of the mostvital sagas in the character's hallowed mythology. Yu'sangles and perspectives provide an essentially differentworldview which is -at the same time- uncanninglyfamiliar; a striking value of this Sequential novel'sgreat appeal in placing a new vision upon one of thegreat tales in American fiction.Here, the themes of alienation vs. participation,loneliness vs. solitude are boldly explored, notonly in the soul of Clark Kent, but in the troubledmind of one Lex Luthor.One is an alien who desperately strives to participatein the upliftment of Humanity, while the other just asdesperately wants to overcome his loneliness by showinghis genius at the expense of all around him... evenhimself. As every effort to impress his peers alienatesall around the young Luthor, one can discern broad issuesabout our educational system, and how order and disciplineare not always balanced with insight and compassion. Asthe tale demonstrates, the loss is to the greater societyas much as it is to any one person... or any onefriendship.As the Jeph Loeb-Tim Sale SUPERMAN FOR ALL SEASONSsuperbly incorporated elements of THE ANIMATED SERIESfrom the 1990s, so does SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT bringelements from the exceptional TV series SMALLVILLEinto its blend of personal quest and goals in theair, with tremendous results.Too, Waid does wonders with the familiar cast ofthe Superman legend. Jonathan and Martha Kent,perhaps the strongest elements of the mythossince the 1980s, each receive major focus here.Perry White gets quite a boost as the nail-chewingnewspaper editor we always knew he could be, andLois Lane gets perhaps her finest depictions asthe tough-but fair reporting ace who backs downfrom no one.And, ah, that Jimmy ...!Best of all, Waid and company display a deep respectfor decades of SUPERMAN storyline, while making whatchanges are deemed fit to up the Kryptonian ante.Unlike the disappointing revamps of John Byrne inthe 1980s, full of ideas but with no follow-throughwhatsoever, Waid doesn't settle for a smilingSuper-yuppie full of material whims, culturalsterility, and little -if any- ethical virtue.Anyone who truly thinks that roots are unimportantin the telling of a great inspirational tale hasbeen asleep through the most epic sagas of thepast century, or is dangerously aloof regardingits pertinence to the here and now, real as wellas imagined.In placing the hero's focus on the vitality ofheritage, Waid lines up with Roger Stern, JohnOstrander, Louise Simonson, Dan Jurgens, JerryOrdway, Marv Wolfman, Gil Kane and many otherswho have tirelessly chronicled the Man of Steel'sfinest adventures since the 1980s.In this, one cannot overstate the impeccable touchof zeroing the young Clark Kent's world quest upona troubled African nation at saga's beginning.As a fledgling reporter in the midst of a bloodyconflict stemming both from tribalism andeducational indoctrination (reflecting boththe vested devastation of the Congo and theinstitutional cancer which South Africa hasonly begun to recover from), Clark receivesan invaluable education in the worth ofknowing who you are, respecting one'sroots, and making this work for the goodof all.Equally important, Clark is shown the differencebetween the fruitful diversity of cultural identity,and the fundamentalist waste of bigoted jingoism.This is a point which becomes very important in theunveiling of Superman's first efforts as a crusaderfor Justice; efforts which do not sit well with theutterly opportunistic, empire-building Luthor, ashe uses Superman's extraterrestrial roots to painthim as the proverbial \\"menacing outsider\\", one of\\"them\\".How Superman suffers through all this (inboth identities), overcomes his own doubts,and achieves breakthrough with the citizensof Metropolis and, in turn, the world, is whatmakes SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT such a landmarkachievement.The story of Kal-El is the tale of all outsidersstriving to stand tall, work humbly, and earntheir rightful place in the world. It's quiterefreshing to see the co-author of KINGDOM COMEmake this point so convincingly, in such abreathtaking fashion.After all, what is it to be, if not to beall that you can, and all which you must?That is the value of heroism.This is the precious lessonof SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT.Read it whole.Learn it well."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"If you just like to see superheros punching things, Birthright isn't for you.However, Of the origin/year one comics I've read, this one has a special place in my heart.The pre-Superman experiences really capture the character, but it was about 1/3 the way through that I realized Birthright is a Superman collection must; as Clark is about to make his debut as Superman, he says to himself, \\"God... please don't let me look ridiculous.\\" Clark Kent is fleshed out as a real person, not just a convenient disguise, in a way that really began with Superman: Man of Steel.The problem with Superman is, that sometimes he's just way too much flying muscle and not enough actual thought. This Superman reacts with more than just a formidible uppercut.Superman is a good guy because of the luck of finding loving parents and experiencing the best parts of life. He's often compared to Batman as the other side of the coin this way. Birthright really fills out why. It adds tremendously to not only a stand-alone story, but motivations that are taken for granted in many stories in Identity Crisis, the new Infinite Crisis story arc, and other stories that touch on Superman's personality.There's action, sure, but this is what you really come away with the story with. How many stories have a superhero playing with his powers just for the sake of it, enjoying the experience of flying and sharing it with family?If you're a fan of the show Smallville and have never read comics before, this is a good introduction; the author borrowed a lot from the young Clark Kent of the show. With some changes in the plot, it could be read as a continuation of the characters."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"A good story that resonates with the Superman Returns film. All of the adventure and fun of a superman story are present, but I just didn't like the characterization very much. Clark seems a little cocky and arrogant. Confident in his powers and his ability to just change the world. To me, Superman is by nature a brooding and solitary figure who is struggling just to fit in. I didn't like all the side-panel smirks he was giving people who said ironic things about his identity every four or five pages.Other than that, there are some real genius innovations in this retelling of the origin of the Man of Steel, including showing Clark's formative years as an investigative reporter prior to working at the Planet. Commentary on Clark's university years, and early run-ins with Lex Luthor.This retelling makes a lot of sense and it updates the Man of Steel for the 21st century, but he deals with no large scale personal problems. Everything seems external and epic, which is the story's saving grace. Luthor's research into Kryptonian technology is well told and his intellectual stature is appealing. He is portrayed as the smartest man on earth, certainly a more worthy adversary for Superman than a bumbling old man whose only power seems his ability to spend ungodly amounts of money on anti-Superman research which always seems to fail."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"If anything shows how tired the comic book version of Superman has become, this is it. Waid, a talented and prolific writer, simply doesn't do much of anything with this retelling of Superman's origins. The redesign of Krypton is superfluous, as is the de-aging of the Kents. The mid-80s reimagining of Superman had its faults, but it also had a lot of character; twenty years later we're stuck with a new origin that could just as easily have been of any other superhero. Clark has very little character, except for his continuous feelings of displacement, and he seems to only to adopt his superhero identity as a way of fitting in (he ends up with dual roles, one as a distanced protector, and the other as an unremarkable Everyman--are either of these really fulfilling?). Also, the opening bits of Clark pursuing both heroics and journalism in Africa smack of political \\"relevance.\\"Luthor's insertion into Smallville seems to just be a nod to the TV show, and it unfortunately appears to have erased a violent and dramatic character who rose to corporate power through some very dark means. The \\"Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography\\" TPB was a great noir-ish reinvention of what had previously been a nutty and ostensibly evil scientist. Waid tries to make him a brilliant scientist who attempts to prove the existence of alien life while at the same time retaining the business suit. It doesn't quite work. You can see Waid explain his changes in the back of this collection.Unfortunately, Superman is a character that has been used and reused more times than King Arthur, and he's wearing thin. Also unfortunately, he's DC Comic's highest seller, and there's something just vaguely mythic enough about him that people keep coming back to a well that's creatively dry, both in the comics and in film. They would do better to recreate Superman entirely, to take a risk and start again from the ground-up. They made a half-hearted attempt at doing this in the 80s, and a quarter-hearted attempt with \\"Birthright.\\" For instance, try making Superman the last in a line of alien knights, who follows a code of chivalry among the relatively weak Earthlings even though he's lost from his homeland. This would retain the moral core of the character, and also many of the mythic undertones.But please, let Jimmy Olsen rest in peace."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Superman is the classic all American hero whose origin desperately needed a new millenium upgrade. Superman : Birthright does exactly that without compromising any of the critical fascets that makes Superman the great hero we are all familiar with, while adding new twists to keep any reader glued to the pages wondering what will happen next.The book starts on Superman's homeworld, just before the planet explodes, and allows you to feel the heartache and desperation Kal-El's parents go through in sending their only child off into the unknown universe alone. You feel for his earth parents, and their fear of Clark's secret being known, and possibly having their adoptive son taken from them.Lex Luthor has always been an intriguing villian, and he is never more so compelling, and brilliant, and dark as he is in this book. Lex's genius is the key in helping Superman understand his true origin and background, which Lex also uses to his advantage to make the citizens of the world fear and distrust the man of steel. It's a great plot, in the story, which just intertwines the two bitter enemies even more.This book is a classic story re-told, and upgraded wonderfully. It's a great read, and comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Most of the time I dont care for Superman books. With the exception of when he died and returned and Kingdom Come i dont really enjoy Superman. I think he is terrific in the SUPERMAN/BATMAN arcs but superman is almost too perfect. I really enjoyed this story though. Waid is an excellent writer and the artwork is top stuff. The plot is really cool. after reading this I like Superman more and even have started reading All Star Superman which is also terrific. Good Stuff"},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"This hardcover edition of Mark Waid's SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT looks and feels beautiful but the story only simplifies the classic characters while attempting to blend in TV's Smallville. The first chapter is truly fresh with a look at how young Clark is influenced to assume a new identity and become a role model for others, but then the story's focus switches to unoriginal action & dialogue. Some character relationships are changed from the current DC history to closer resemble the popular Smallville storyline but nothing truly original is added. It should also be mentioned that the ink on the pages easily smudged from simply touching the page.Mark Waid has previously co-written one of comics top three greatest works; KINGDOM COME. With artist Alex Ross, this future storyline features an older Superman returning to lead the Justice League against the threat of a new generation of reckless heroes. Waid and Ross no longer speak to each other because of disagreements as to who exactly was the true author of the tale. Most fans believe it is Ross with whom the story resonates more personally with his past, and after reading Birthright the differences in the quality of storytelling becomes obvious.SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT feels more like the work of a company changing its image to please TV fans who might buy a comic instead of being what it could have which is the writer combining the best elements of all versions of Superman. For Superman's origin story I suggest reading John Byrne's MAN OF STEEL, which is beautifully drawn, has original yet logical changes, and overall is closest to what Superman means."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"I'm not necessarily a traditionalist when it comes to Superman, as I have a great appreciation for other books that add a twist to the Superman story. Lex Luthor: Man of Steel and Superman: Red Son come to mind. I am also a fan of some of Mark Waid's other work, like Kingdom Come and Irredeemable.But Superman: Birthright gets some things wrong that I can't get past.The first thing that comes to mind is that it misses the mark on Superman's humility. Even the title of the novel, \\"Birthright,\\" plays into this. Clark Kent would not become a superhero because it was his \\"birthright\\" to do so, but because he felt obligated (and, as a result, burdened) to use his gifts to benefit the people and world that adopted him. The idea in \\"Birthright\\" that he is following in the footsteps of a Kryptionian heritage of righteous warriors flies in the face of this. This lack of humility is also evidenced early on, as we see a pre-Superman Clark Kent wrestling with a lion in Africa. This shows us a Clark Kent that desires to use his powers to be dominant, which is something I cannot accept as a good interpretation of the Man of Steel.And there's one more specific sequence in this book that upset me. After Superman stops a shooting at a school, he pays a visit to the gun dealer that sold the weapons to the students. Superman pulls a gun on this man, points it straight at his face, and pulls the trigger. But, using his super-speed, he whips around behind the man, and catches the bullet in front of the man's face before it splatters his brains all over the store. I read this as way of Superman saying, \\"Remember, I have the power to kill you, I simply choose to stop myself from doing so.\\" This frightening mentality of man who is on the brink of vigilante justice might be appropriate for Batman, but it does not belong in a Superman origin story.So while the story was adequate in and of itself, I think it falls very short of being adequate reinterpretation of the Superman story. It misses, or misunderstands, some core points of what makes this character who he is."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Ultimately, this is a decent story. It does contain elements that I strongly feel should not be part of Superman lore. Having Clark Kent know Lex Luthor when they were young is absolutely absurd. It's simply bad storytelling.This story borrows far too heavily from the hack show Smallville, one of the worst and grossly overrated adaptions of the young Clark Kent mythos to date.This starts off an interesting, even an excellent read, becomes ridiculous, and ends in an entertaining way. DC removing this from continuity was a smart idea."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"I am surprised by the other, less positive reviews, because I thought this book was superb. I am not a huge Superman fan, I don't get excited by \\"Smallville,\\" and in general my comic book shopping cart is mostly filled with Marvel titles, but I think this has got to be the best Superman book I have ever read. It does a little of what Jeph Loeb did in \\"Superman For All Seasons\\" and picks up the clumsily discarded torch of \\"Smallville\\" to create a beautiful, modern Superman.The art is definitely among the most striking Superman art ever drawn, taking the best elements of manga and American comics to make a brightly colored and appealing book. For those of you familiar with \\"Invincible,\\" it has a similar look except with more sheen, and more primary colors.This Superman is certainly a different Superman, and some people will take issue with the fact that he is, among other things, a vegetarian. This discrepancy Mark Waid makes up for it by his awesome portrayal of Clark, a confident and popular guy who has to hide his talents under the false guise of a wallflower in order to maintain his secret identity. Best of all is the ending, which is poignant, ironic, and will quite possibly make you cry."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"When Mark Waid and the editors at DC Comics first announced their plans for Superman: Birthright, I was excited. From all accounts, it looked like it was going to be the continuation of the Smallville Superman, taken out of the TV show and moved forwards eight or ten years, and the story of how that Clark Kent first came to put on the costume. Which I was quite excited for; the tying in of this newest part of the legend back to its original format seemed like a very good idea. By the end of the first issue, it was somewhat obvious that it was more Ultimate Superman than Smallville; while taking elements from the TV show, it was clearly set in its own universe.But then came the big news; the sources from on high had ruled that, after seventeen years, Superman's origin had grown stale and needed revision - and that Birthright would henceforth be the origin of the one, true Superman. For a while, it seemed like the entire Superman universe was in limbo; was the S-man about to be rebooted? Were nearly two decades of history about to be written over? Well, yes and no.It ended up that this story was designed to be a sort of prequel to the current Superman's history, that they were rewriting his history from the present but that it was actually to take place in the past. Unfortunately, either someone forgot to get Waid the memo or the story was too far along to change, as the entire run seems more like the first 12 issues of a new continuum than the rewriting of Superman's past in a way that would make sense in today's continuity. For example, in the first issue, Lex Luthor is clearly shown as he is in Smallville, as the rich, bald young hotshot; however, when we finally learn the truth, he ends up being an alienated, whiny red-haired arrogant youth who Clark befriends out of sheer pity (and who in the future becomes a wisecracking evildoer straight out of a James Bond flick). In issue 3, Clark refers to Lana as if they had been together (which the picture he has seems to validate), but again when we see the flashback, Clark has been reduced to geeky waterboy and Lana to airhead cheerleader. Superman has retreated from his kind, Boy Scout attitude into a silent, cursing vigilante who could probably clear up a lot of the trouble about him if he would just take the time to act pleasant and let the world know that he's just there to help. Lois Lane is written as an arrogant hothead who seems ready to fly off the handle at any moment, while Perry White seems to have left said handle a loooooooong time ago. The only characters who recieve any improvement of their character are the Kents and Jimmy Olsen, who has finally shrugged his Howdy Doody persona for something more mature. These characters deserve far more than this. Clark Kent, Superman, Lana Lang, Lois Lane, and the rest of the cast are heroes and idols for people the world over; they deserve to be known as more than stereotypes.In addition, if the story is supposed to take place before the entire current continuity, then why does Waid seem intent on beating us over the head with references to modern times? Superman is only 25 here, just beginning his career, and yet we have camera cell phones, yellow alerts, internet news organizations, instant messenging, the Department of Homeland Security, e-mail - heck, the year 2004 is even specifically mentioned on a very prominent newspaper! It's clear that Waid originally intended this to be something more along the lines of Marvel's Ultimates series, a seperate continuity to exist alongside but never meet with the regular books.This is not to suggest that I was completely unhappy with the story; far from it, it is actually quite enjoyable - so long as you make sure to take it on its own and not make anything more of it than it is. The relationship between Clark and his parents has been tightened, and many of the scenes between them are classic. Clark's efforts to divide his two identities are presented excellently, and the sense of isolationism that comes along with it is shown perfectly in the scene when...well, I don't want to give it away. Yu's artwork also delights at times, but his style is better suited to a smaller scale; while many of the scenes where two or three characters interact work well, many of the more complex action shots later in the book are slightly jumbled and confusing.Overall, Superman: Birthright is an interesting take on the Superman mythos, one that is certainly worth reading. Get it, and form your own opinions about it - don't take what I have to say as gospel. It's a good story on its own, just not a necessary after-the-fact retelling of the \\"true\\" Superman's past. But certainly give it a try."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"At 54, I hadn't read a Superman comic for 42 years, though I have a fine collection of several hundred. I saw the movie, missed the TV show, missed all the updates etc. My (US) kids, all born in the 80s, devoured my collection of 10- and 12-cent comics.Then a teenager from Ghana urged me to try this comic novel reconsideration of Mr. S. I found this to be very operatic and heart-rending. The artist/observer's POVs were fantastic and each panel seemed frameable, making the oldies I remember seem so quaint and camp. Operas get updated in similar ways, and it's risky, but this team pulled it off to one reader's complete satisfaction.The process of updating/adaptation/re-imagining reminds me of the saying: ''If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.'' --Tancredi, the young aristocrat in Giuseppe di Lampedusa's novel, ''The Leopard\\""},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"This is my personal favorite Superman tale (yes, even over \\"Red Son\\" or \\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tommorrow?\\", though on equal footing with \\"All-Star Superman\\") and my preferred version of his 21st-century origin story.

Forget the New 52 and the \\"Earth One\\" garbage.Alas, this will probably never happen, but I still wonder if the publisher will see the error of its ways and restore Waid's continuity. Perhaps in a nice one-shot? A man can dream..."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"\\"People know now, it stands for courage. It stands for hope. It stands for SUPERMAN.\\"What makes the Man of Tomorrow take his stand? What goes through a young boy's mind that causes him to don tights and a cape and a big red \\"S\\" and stand up to fight for truth, justice, and the American way? These are questions that get asked when the real question is, \\"Why should we care about a man who cannot be hurt?\\"These are the questions that Mark Waid and Leinil Francis Yu set out to answer in Superman: Birthright.This book was the big effort from DC to bring the Man of Steel into the 21st century, and it was the job of the writer, artist, and the rest of the collaborators to accomplish this while keeping true to the spirit of the character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster. A new view of a familiar origin was needed, a new perspective on characters that had been loved for over six decades, and Superman Birthright accomplishes all that and more.We first see Superman as Kal El, infant son of Jor El and Lara during Krypton's last dying hours. The familiar elements are there - his parents will send him to earth where his Kryptonian biology will gain incredible powers from the radiation of Earth's yellow sun, but before he goes, he is wrapped in the Flag of Krypton and given a recordings of its history. This is where Waid and Yu really start to dig into the mythology and explore some new motivations. The \\"S\\" symbol is not just the El family crest, not just a sign on a blanket sent with the last son of Krypton to his new home - it is a reminder of his heritage, a symbol of his people and what they stood for, and something that Clark Kent will always carry with him.When we first meet Clark, adopted son of John and Martha of Smallville Kansas, he's in the middle of tribal war that's broken out in Ghana, and trying not only to protect a charismatic civil rights leader, but also find his purpose in the world. Any time he tries to use his powers to help someone, he ends up distancing himself from people who fear his strength, his. . . difference. Clark has spent years traveling the world trying to find himself, and trying to find a connection to his otherworldly birthplace. When he decides to take on the identity of Superman, it is not only as a way of helping those in need and honoring the lessons his adopted parents taught him, but of honoring the memory of his native people.This is what Birthright really plays up - what it means to be a symbol in a world where symbols are corrupted every day, what it meas to use power for good when power is only used for selfish corrupt means, and what it means to truly inspire people. These are ideas that Siegel and Schuster used when creating Superman, and they're called to the fore again to reinvigorate the character when cynicism and corruption are more pervasive than ever.Of course, when Clark moves to Metropolis and starts displaying his awesome abilities, his alter-ego attracts the attention of Lex Luthor. Keeping the suave businessman version of the character, complete with a closet of dirty secrets, Birthright echoes TV's Smallville in that Luthor and Clark knew each other as kids back in Kansas. However, Birthright's Lex is a twisted bitter sociopath, alienated from a world he feels he has outpaced, and disgusted with the city's fascination with a muscle-bound alien. With various criminal schemes foiled by the Man of Steel, Luthor wages war against Superman for the trust of the city, playing on Metropolis' fears of a man with so much power and about him they know so little. This culminates in a climactic clash between Superman and a climactic \\"invasion\\" that tests our hero not just physically, but emotionally as well.The classic standbys all play a part here - Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Perry White at the Daily Planet (the last honest newspaper in the city), Ma and Pa Kent back home on the farm, and all stay true to the spirit of the characters that have been in comics for so long (even if Ma Kent is pretty computer savvy and has a thing for alien conspiracy web sits). But they all have their moment to shine, especially Lois, who defends the intentionally meek and quiet Clark against mocking coworkers and marvels at Superman - a man who shatters her preconceptions about what Prince Charming is really like.All this is drawn in Yu's bold, thick strokes, and while the characters tend towards the more simplistic style favored in many comics today (a bit more John Romita Jr. than John Cassidy), they still have fine detail and incredible emotion on the page. And the colors, whether in the smaller \\"in between\\" panels or on the huge full-page action spreads (and there are some images so incredible that they will stick with you forever), pop out and shine with beautiful clarity.Whether you're a long-time fan of Superman, or are looking for a good introduction to the Man of Tomorrow, Birthright is a great book. The Daily Planet may have a web page and digital cameras, but it's the same bastion of decency trying to report the truth to the world, where a mild-mannered reporter watches for signs of trouble. For anything that might be a job for Superman. Because it's his birthright, his legacy, his duty, both as a decent man in an indecent world, and as the last son of Krypton. And he will never forget."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"I am a big fan of the Superman world but it was only during this summer that I shelled out money to buy Superman products after seeing the latest movie. Two dvds of the Reeves movies snowballed into seven comic books. This was one of the seven. Out of all of them this one really stood out. I just love the first few pages. It is a given that it talks about his parents and how they sent him to earth in a pod. How they drew and colored and placed the panels and used them as part of the title and credit page and then a time transition....wow. Its like a openning title sequence for film... so beautiful. I'm like YES!!! THIS IS WHY I LOVE COMIC BOOKS! This story talks about a part of Clark's life that is rarely if never addressed. Life after Smallvile but pre Daily Planet. I like it for its youthful hip energy and the addressing of problems in a different country. Lois Lane is a big reason I follow this franchise. Seeing the many incarnations of her is watching the evolution of the independent modern woman. Some depictions leave more to be desired than others. The way they introduced her was refreshing. Her intelligence and her courage has a slightly new flavor. I'd like to see a follow up of this story arc. I recomend everyone pick up a copy and take a good look. I don't regret buying this one. I enjoy looking at it over and over."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"As I wrote in my previous review for \\"The Kingdom\\", Mark Waid is THE child of the Silver Age. There is an obvious love for the imaginative, dream-like and child-like stories of heroism from the Silver Age in all of Waid's writings. That's the reason Grant Morrison credits Waid for ending the all-pervasive grim-and-gritty mood that dominated comics since the mid-1980s. \\"Kingdom Come\\" (and \\"The Kingdom\\") is very much the last word on the Silver Age. In \\"JLA: Year One\\" and \\"The Brave and the Bold\\", Waid takes us back to the Silver Age to revisit that era one more time and to be inspired once more by the heroic spirit of John Broome and Gardner Fox one more time. And if you're looking for more of that here in \\"Superman: Birthright\\", you'll be sorely disappointed...Waid does with \\"Birthright\\" in 2003/4 what Frank Miller did with \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" in 1986. It's a statement about an icon to fit the times. And we all know that Silver Age is really in the past. We live in different times altogether. Miller told us that in the late 1980s. Waid is trying to do that for today. I can't read \\"Dark Knight\\" these days without a backward glance to 1986. In the same way, I think future readers will say that \\"Birthright\\" is really a product of the early 21st century, the post-9/11 world of camera-phones and real-time news media.Therefore, like Miller's \\"Dark Knight\\" it shares many of its strengths - \\"Birthright\\" attempts to be the DEFINITIVE statement on \\"who Superman is and why he does what he does\\". The whole thing reads like a philosophical inquiry into the Superman-mythos and is much like an amalgamation of everything that makes Superman great (from the Siegel/Shuster activist to the Fleischer animated champion of humanity to the Mort Weisinger sci-fi Kryptonian to Christopher Reeve and, of course John Byrne's \\"Man of Steel\\" and the current \\"Smallville\\").However, the book also share many of the flaws of \\"Dark Knight\\" - it comes off more as a definitive VERSION of the character than a true representation of the timelessness of the original myth. Like I said in the above, \\"Dark Knight\\" is so '80s and in the same way, this work is sooooo 2003/4! Also, there is also the feeling that \\"Birthright\\" at times tries too hard to be great - even at the expanse of the story!All in all, despite its flaws, the work is noteworthy for its sharper redefinition of the young Superman trying to find his place in the universe (for can \\"our\\" world, whether it be Smallville or Metropolis, truly contain him?). It gives us a Kal-El who honors his Kryptonian heritage as much as it gives us a Clark Kent who believes in his Smallville upbringing. Much has been made about how Waid ignores established continuity as well as accusations of trying to plagiarise the \\"Smallville\\" Lex Luthor. My opinion? Sometimes a comic work comes along that's so big that it transcends \\"smaller\\" (I say that as a continuity-freak myself) things like \\"continuity\\". After all, the Superman myth is more than the comics. Heck, it's more than the movies and action figures and TV shows. It's pop-culture. It's mythology-for-the-masses. It's truth-and-justice-and-humor-and-romance. It's science fiction and the world of tomorrow. And you'll find it all here in \\"Superman: Birthright\\"."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Superman:Birthright is a great book that reimagins the origin of a great hero. Mark Waid, I think did a very good job in writing this book. Whe he said it was \\"a very Siegel and Shuster friendly story\\" he was not lying. This Superman is tougher than the average Superman but is still no Batman. He hates the evil that the person is doing and not the person. You kind of agree where he's coming from when his pushes a conspirator in a murder into an wall. Waid also writes him as a person who is concerned about people and how they see him. He wants to help the misguided people of Metropolis.The people of Krypton are presented here in a MUCH different way than John Byrne portayed them. This Krypton exhibits pain and emotion. There is color to Waid's Krypton. There is a richness in this place that has never been seen. Also, these people mirror humans in the sense that they feel that they are the only beings with intelligence in the universe. They are also plagued by a sense of vanity and a sense of superiority but you feel bad for them because, like Jor-el said, Krypton achieved miracles and wonders no one will ever remember.The setting that Mark Waid gave in the beginning mad so much sense when I read through it a few times. The setting is in Ghana, Africa for two issues. When I studied the history of Africa in Global History I began to understand why Waid chose to put Clark here. He put him there because, like Clark, Africa has problems with cultural identity. They have been ruled by so many people they have forgotten their true \\"birthright\\" just like Clark. He is an alien with human morals. Which heritage do you come to accept when both families love you so much. Which brings us into the costume. The costume design was very smart and the reason Jonathan kent was against it made sense. How would you feel when your adopted son from another planet, who you raised and loved like your own, left you to join his \\"real\\" family. It might seem selfish but it is the truth and Waid deals with this wonderfully.Lex luthor is also presented in a fun and sad way. It's fun because we don't see the business and the scientific Lex Luthor that much and it's sad because in this origin Lex Luthor and Clark Kent were portrayed as friends in Smallville who broke apart due to a tragic accident.The only reason why I give this a 4 out of 5 is because the art was not great. It was good from issue 1-5 but dimmed in quality in the rest of the issues with the exception to #8 and #9."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"I read all of the bad reviews before picking up this trade, believing that it would pale in comparison to the John Byrne modern-age revamp of the character back in the 80s. I was almost tempted to tell the clerk at the store as she was ringing up the trade that I had changed my mind on buying it, thinking it might be a waste of $20. I sat down for a couple hours and read it front ot back, which is something I usually don't do for something 12 (comic) issues in length, and I found this instantly became my definitive origin for the Man of Steel, despite my love for Jeph Loeb's interpretation in his \\"Superman: For All Seasons.\\" He wasn't instantly accepted by society as a savior, instead having to prove himself the hard way, against the machinations of a (for once) truly menacing Lex Luthor. This was the first trade in a while that I felt compelled to pick up again to flip through on the same day I read it. I'm generally a Marvel fan, but in these handful of instances such as with \\"Birthright\\" and \\"Batman: Year One\\" where DC publishes a gem that shines above the rest, at least within my opinion."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"In 2004, with the success of SMALLVILLE and the forthcoming release of SUPERMAN RETURNS, the good folks at DC Comics decided it was time for Superman's origins to be re-invented for the first time since John Byrne's popular THE MAN OF STEEL series in the 1980's. Mark Waid was given the task of writing the new series and re-thinking the Superman legend; and re-think it he did. While the essential elements of the Superman mythos are left intact, much of Supes' history is re-written. In a wise move, Waid borrows from the SMALLVILLE storyline by having Clark Kent meet Lex Luthor while in high school. The Lex of this series, however, is very different from SMALLVILLE's version of the character; Lex is a heartless fiend even as a youth.BIRTHRIGHT begins with Clark on a freelance writing assignment in Africa. The violence Clark witnesses while there lead him to wonder if there's a way he can use his powers to benefit mankind. So he returns to Smallville, where - with the help of his parents - he creates the Superman costume. From there, it's off to Metropolis.Flashbacks show us a young Clark befriending Lex, but we see nothing more than that. The rest of the graphic novel is set in the present, where Clark searches for his place in the world while battling the evil Lex Luthor. Much is left out that could have enhanced the series; for example, Clark discovering his powers. Instead, we get an over-the-top storyline which is neither new nor exciting.This series' redemption comes from Leinil Francis Yu's excellent artwork. It's strong and colorful, but rarely is it bright. It fits the story perfectly. For this reason I would recommend this comic. I found it interesting to see a writer attempt a new take on Superman's origins, but in the end I was left thinking, \\"That was okay\\", rather than, \\"Wow, that was great!\\""},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Mark Waid accomplishes something intriguing here, and that's to show us not simply why Superman is the way he is -- his background, motivations, his doubts and his certainties -- but also why he is a relevant hero today. Some readers may not like what Waid's done, or the way he's done it, but it's well done none-the-less. Reading the extra pages in the back, which are part of Waid's original statement of purpose and proposal for the series, pulls everything together, and gives you the greatest ability to decide for yourself whether Waid accomplished what he and DC set out to do.I've never been a fan of \\"Smallville\\" on TV, and if you view this work only through that lens, you're missing something. It stands well on its own, and if you're a fan of the man in the big red \\"S\\", you should definitely check this book out. As a long-time comics reader (better part of 30 years, since I was 10), 'Superman: Birthright\\" is more than worth reading; it's staying in my collection."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Superman Birthright is a great book. If you're like I was and look at the graphic novel section of the local book store with a feeling of intimidation, then this book should help break the ice. It plays out very much like a superhero origin film, taking us from Kal-El's arrival on Earth through his adulthood as Clark Kent, where we see him decide to become Superman. It's overall a well paced and enjoyable read with high quality, slightly stylized artwork that'll be sure to keep your eyes on the pages.I've only a few minor complaints with this book-- one is that the Clark Kent side of Superman's persona takes on a much less active role in the story after he dons the costume (although this isn't as big a deal as it sounds since there are flashbacks of his adolescence that keep things in balance)-- and the other is about a new super power introduced for this book that has gained notoriety amongst fans. I won't bother explaining the intricacies of what it is or how it works, but it can be summarized with a single, stupid sounding name: \\"super-vegetarianism.\\" It's hardly a deal breaker, but you will roll your eyes during that part of the book.Overall, this is the perfect place to start if you are new to Superman comics, or if you are just looking for an enjoyable book to read. If you were hoping that the last Superman movie would be a new origin for the character instead of getting Superman Returns, then you'll probably love this book since it's basically an origin reboot movie on paper."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"This is a fantastic read and a great retelling of Superman's origins.

I took to reading Superman Birthright with a sense of skepticism. Could this story be retold yet again from a different angle and still do justice to the character. Well reading through the first few pages, all doubts were lifted as the story that unfolded was not only great drama but I felt really hit a home run for what Superman really stands for. Highly recommend this book.Secondly, the ART, although I have some minor issues with some of the inconsistencies between the characters facial appearance from one page to the next, the ART is really fantastic. The coloring even more so. Lately, in a lot of comic books the coloring I've feel has gone overboard and become distracting. This is definitely not the case, the coloring is fantastic, really pops out and does justice to the Icon that is SUPERMAN."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"After reading it, I felt that it is a real shame that Birthright wasn't used as the reboot canon that it was originally intended to be.

It is just brilliantly done and has things that I haven't ever seen before, or have rarely seen at the least.The story itself is very interesting, and adapts the Superman mythology from a lot of sources-including the Lex/Clark friendship similar to what is seen in Smallville the TV series. I just gave it four stars since it does have a couple of slow parts, but it is overall really amazing. Superman looks really threatening in some panels, and it is good to see that Superman is a force that isn't to be taken lightly."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Very interesting story of how and why Clark Kent becomes Superman.

Over the course of this book Superman learns some very valuable lessons. Like the fact that he can't save everyone, but that saving everyone isn't what's important. What is important is that you don't give up, and Superman is a hero because he stays in the fight, even when it seems impossible to win.My only complaint is that the book breaks a bit with some of the traditions of Superman, but that is forgivable given the excellent story telling.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Growing up, I was never a big fan of Superman - he was always too perfect, too dull, too infallible.

Not only is Superman nigh on omnipotent with his invulnerability, super speed and near limitless strength he is also essentially omniscient with his super vision, super hearing and x-ray vision (In Birthright Clark Kent uses all three to spy on his coworkers from blocks away). So how do you create a compelling story when the protagonist is invincible? The other problem is that his most frequent antagonist, Lex Luthor, is nothing more than a regular old human (albeit with an astounding intellect). Luthor taking on Superman is like a little league team taking on the Boston Red Sox AND NEARLY WINNING.Writers have relied on three techniques to limit Superman. First is to have Superman conveniently forget his own powers in particular his near light speed movement. The second limitation is Superman's own Boy Scout morality and third is the annoyingly excessive use of Kryptonite. Mark Waid employs the second technique and is particularly egregious on the third. Luthor literally bathes the city in low level Kryptonite reducing Superman's powers to a more manageable Spider Manish strength. I think it's a testimonial to the skill of a writer if he/she can compose a Superman story and NOT employ Kryptonite. On the other hand Waid does an excellent job of establishing Luthor as a credible threat to Superman.Despite the tweaking to Superman's origin which he establishes as occurring today, rather than in the 1930's or 1950's, the author really doesn't break any new ground. Luthor's scheme, if you can call it that, is so over the top that it reminds me of the Super Friends episode where The Toyman builds a robot planet to trap the heroes. I mean, if you can build an entire robot planet... uh well. Apparently aware of the absurd scale and unfeasibility of Luthor's plan the author tries (and fails) to rationalize and diminish what's going on. In the end I have to consider Birthright to be a mild failure. There are so many plot holes that it becomes a distraction. There is no explanation on how the faux Kryptonian Van-Gar was able to go toe to toe with Superman even if you account for Superman's diminished powers and why would Luthor compose such an extravagant plan only to leave the lynchpin of his scheme available for anyone to walk in and steal. The ending was meant to be poignant but it really made no sense. I mean nothing about it made sense. Birthright was also a case where the crimes of the villain are so heinous that they would undoubtedly merit the death penalty for the perpetrator yet it's implied that Luthor will get off on a legal technicality.I have to wonder if there's any writer besides Alan Moore capable of writing a truly great Superman story."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Comic book fan or not, most people seem to know the basics of Superman's origin. He's an alien sent to Earth from a doomed planet, he lands in Kansas and is raised as a farmboy. How many times would this story need to be told. Well Mark Waid totally justifies this re-telling and does a terrific job of portraying Superman in ways I haven't seen before.It begins with a 25 year old Clark Kent as a freelance journalist in Africa. It's clear that Clark wants to help people, but isn't sure how to, since his powers usually lead to people not trusting him. I love this part of the story as it shows how Clark comes to realize that his Superman side isn't something he can deny or hide. It is his destiny to help the world. The Kents are also used well in this story, with Martha urging her adopted son to follow the path laid out before him, while Johnathan is skeptical that it is the right decision.My favorite part of this story, however, is Lex Luthor. His origins aren't as well defined as Superman and Waid details the events that led him to become a super villain beautifully. We get to see Lex as a tormented teen, simply too smart to fit in with most of his peers. Lex and Clark actually spend time together as teens in this book and it is easy to see that if things had happened a little differently the two could have been great friends and allies.This book sticks to the basics of Superman's beginning while still letting itself get creative around the edges. Long time fan or curious beginner, I would point anybody with an interest in the Man of Steel towards Superman: Birthright."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"This is the first Superman graphic novel I read. It's a great place to start. Art looks great, only complaint is they make Clark/Superman smile goofy sometimes. But this is a pretty big graphic novel for the price. It was a fun read and I'm glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"If you have ever felt that Superman has become an icon rather than a character, this story is a breath of fresh air. You actually get to see Clark Kent as a person, a fallible person, and how he constructs both the \\"Clark\\" and \\"Superman\\" personas. It also deals with the secondary characters intelligently. The Kents are real people with thoughts, feelings, and flaws rather than just paragons of American parenting. The reporters in the Daily Planet bullpen are well done as well, especially Lois. All in all, if you are a die hard Supes fan, or have never been able to connect with him as a character, this is worth a read."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"While this Origin of \\"The Man Of Tomorrow\\" isn't in the current DC Comics continuity, I think that this is one of the greatest rendiitions of Superman that I have ever been exposed to. Mark Waid has again crafted a masterpiece that is not only a treat to read, but Lienil Yu's art is visually exceptional also. I have heard that some people bash his artwork, and for the love of all that is holy, I can't understand why. \\"Superman Birthright\\" is a fresh re-telling of the origins of one of earths greatest heroes."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Five-six years ago I was bored and went to the local Barnes & Noble. I found this, sat down, and was unable to walk away from it until I finished it. (No, I didn't BUY it! What do you take me for?) Recently, I've had the opportunity to take full advantage of my local library and, in between actual books, I've read something like 25 graphic novels over the last three months. Many of them are Superman stories. And nearly all of them were gawd-awful, and for mostly the same reasons: they relied on boring staples such as destroying the Fortress of Solitude or bringing some Kryptonians into play; they made Superman into a whiny wimp who cries all the time about how no one understands him; and/or they stretched reality farther than they reasonably should in a story about a human-looking alien who is bullet proof and can fly and completely destroy any chance of me taking it seriously. I began to wonder if that \\"retold Superman origin story\\" I had read all those years ago was nearly as good as I remembered it, in light of the awfulness of its peers.Well, it absolutely was.The ONLY issue like that I have in this is (spoiler!) that it doesn't easily make sense how Luthor has the resources to create a mechanical spider-like monster that is taller than most buildings in Metropolis. The whole fake-kryptonian invasion thing would have worked a lot better (with the hired thugs and reliance on holograms) without that. But that's the ONE flaw that I've found in this and the rest is so good it's hard to hold it against them.If ever there was something in Superman's origin that made you roll your eyes or just didn't make sense, THIS one gets it right.* His reason for doing what he does makes sense. He's a good soul with good intentions, nurtured correctly by his upbringing from the Kents, but also sees and recognizes his place in an honorable family line, as viewed through the Kryptonian . . . iPad . . . that was stored in the rocket with him when he was a baby. This, by the way, is where the title \\"Birthright\\" comes from--he's mostly driven by his deep understanding that he has a valuable role to play in the world that is not about his personal gain.* His disguise as the bespectacled Clark Kent makes sense. We see that he has a difficult time in getting people to trust him once they find out what he can do. This makes him understand that he needs a secret identity, but the trust issue makes him shun the idea of a mask, so he has to make Clark the mask, resulting in a squirrelish demeanor, different hairstyle, baggy clothes, poor posture, and unattractive eye ware. I'm still not convinced it would work in real life, but they at least go beyond the minimum in justifying it.* His feelings for Lois seem real, and Lois falling for Superman is convincing. Over the decades, justifying the Lois and Superman/Clark relationship has seemingly been difficult, and lots of times writers tend to assume it rather than show it. Here, they really establish it. Clark is interested in her via her writing, and then clearly smitten when he meets her in person. She is intrigued by Superman and has followed his pre-Metropolis appearances with great zeal, even to the point of nearly damaging her career for chasing \\"alien stories,\\" therefore meeting HIM in person makes her schoolgirl-like weak knees all the more believable. Their spark is solidly established. His sense of satisfaction of impressing her via the cape really comes across, too, so that you get easily that he doesn't mind Superman getting the attention over Clark.* Lex Luthor's motivations are made crystal clear. I'll even quote the line where, if you hadn't picked it up before, he lays it out for you. Page 215. \\" . . . You deliberately humiliated me. You looked at ME like *I* look at the ANTS. You don't get to do that. Period.\\" He's a genius, he's rich, and he's a complete, self-absorbed egomaniac. This also brilliantly helps establish how Lex can't recognize Superman as the only boy he was friends with in Smallville--his ego gets in the way.* He's confident. One of the problems I've had with so many incarnations of Superman is that in an attempt to make him more human and relate-able, they make him wimpy and whiny. Well, relate-able and \\"human\\" are great traits to give to him, especially when he's starting out in the blue suit and red cape, but at the same time Superman should be SuperMAN, and he should have a maturity, intelligence, and confidence that is noticeable and likeable. I wish I could easily put my finger on exactly what it was that the writers of Birthright did to get this right, but I can't. It's subtle--he's clearly not Super-Emo-Man, but he's also not coming across like he's compensating for anything.It breaks my heart that this great origin story has been put on the shelf in favor of one that involves Superboy (sigh . . .), and has further convinced me that as much as I like Superman's potential (fully realized in this graphic novel/collection), those who write the character refuse to let it be any good.I certainly hope that those behind the upcoming Superman movie draw from this graphic novel a lot . . ."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"I started a new job about six months ago, and a coworker got me hooked on comics. I immediately gravitated to more mature titles, but I did enjoy some of the superhero titles. Superman never interested me, and I hoped this would be the title to draw me in.It wasn't.There isn't anything particularly wrong here. My coworker - an avid comic fan for more than three decades - even said he enjoyed this title. The story has fun elements, treats its subject with a full characterization and has a quick, adrenaline-induced final act.However, I found the dialogue very PG and the artwork very \\"Saturday-morning cartoon\\". Combined with a story written in an obvious attempt to become iconic and to be taken seriously, the book feels awkward.Fans of Superman will more than likely enjoy this retelling, as my coworker did.As for casual fans or for a reader looking for an entry point, this book may leave the reader unfulfilled."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"I've recently rediscovered my love for graphic novels that I thought had long since passed. Although I've never been a huge Superman fan (outside a few of the films), I was intrigued enough by Amazon reviewers to pick this book up. I am a lifelong Spider-Man and Batman fan. If this had been my first introduction to the superhero world, Superman might very well be my favorite of all.Updated and somewhat modernized for the 21st century, this story introduces us to Clark Kent. We're given background on his adolescence, his drive to find out who he is, where he's from, and what his purpose is. We're given a great back story on Lex Luthor, and the events that shaped who he is as well.A few days before reading this, a friend who also reads graphic novels told me his biggest complaint about Superman is that his emotions never change. I now find that comment ironic, in that we see a wide range of emotions from the character in this book. Emotionally, Superman seems more (dare I say it?) human than he is usually presented to be, and that is a great strength of this book. We see Superman/Clark Kent move between rage and defeat, and many emotions in between.This 21st century re-imagining of Superman's origin would make a fantastic motion picture. Several times throughout the read, I wondered if Zack Snyder has been exposed to this story, and if he would consider adapting it into a screenplay. The only drawback that I could see is that audiences might want a fresh villain, rather than the fifth appearance by Luthor in what will be a sixth film.The artwork is amazing, and the story is fantastic. I give this book a very strong 5-star recommendation to Superman fans, and to casual fans (such as myself) alike."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Waid has taken the classic tale of Superman's origing, put enough of a fresh spin on it, while keeping it faithful to the original story and created just what is a great book here.

Mark Waid, Leinil Francis Yu, & Gerry Alanguilan did an outstanding job in bringing their updated vision to one of the most classic origin tales of our time. It's an awesome origin tale of the iconic super hero & some of Leinil's best art.

It shows Superman more as a person than the legendary icon we've grown up knowing."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"This is shocking because i expected this book to be crap.

It is a great book and should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"I have been a long time Marvel fan, and when I do stray into DC it is usually somewhere in the Bat family. Superman has never held much appeal for me until recently. I read somewhere that Mark Waid had done a revamp of the Man of Steel, and one of the changes was to make him a vegetarian. Intrigued, I gave it a shot.In this origin story Ma Kent is a conspiracy nut who watches the X-Files and convinces her son to fly her into Area 51, fitting for a mom raising an adopted alien. Pa Kent has a strained relationship with the son that he felt surpassed him early and slowly grew more distant- any son will recognize a piece of their relatoinship with Dad in this. Clark takes off early in life to travel the world, developing a passionate love for the people of his adopted homeworld. Lois Lane follows the rumors of the miralce man who appears in the nick of time to avert disasters, always one step behind Clark.Then, of course, there is an invasion of giant robots and crap tons of supercombat.Birthright is great modern retelling of Superman's origin, and the first comic in nearly 30 years of collecting to make me interested in Clark Kent."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"While I do prefer Superman: Secret Origin as the definitive Superman Origin, this is a close second. I liked how the relationship between Lex and Superman was definitively explored and how it showed that even as a young boy, Lex was destined for villainy. The story moves along well and the characters are very memorable. The one thing that I feel was a big drawback was the art. I am not a fan of Francis Yu's art style. But even still, I liked the story so much that I didn't even care. This is a good Superman story and I fully recommend it."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Anyone who ever has doubts on how Superman/Clark Kent can operate in a modern setting, will rethink that idea after reading this book."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"This is an excellent read of the classic.

This is one of the best (if not the best) origin stories for Superman that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Superman: Birthright","review":"Mark Waid has always had such a good grasp of what makes Superman and Clark Kent cool. Here he reinvents one of the most classic origins of all time and does it really well. The art by Leinil Francis Yu is very good, however I'm still not sure its a good fit with Superman. The dark sketchiness doesn't always mesh well with Metropolis and Smallville. Waid's Luthor is ne of the best and I think this would make a really good animated movie. Overall, really good stuff!"},{"Title":"Who's Who in the Bible","review":"No mysteries to this title. It does exactly what it says. It explains who's who in a very logical manner.

It is an instant favorite with the kids. They are facinated with the meanings of the names listed with other interesting facts, such as to whom they are related,where they can be found in the Bible and short paraphrases about their role in the Bible.

In it, a senior devil gives continued advice to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; on how best to tempt his victim and keep him from salvation.Lewis does not propose any concrete doctrine on devils here, and this is not his point. Rather he focuses on highlighting the ways, both large and small, that Christians are distracted from God. Lewis explores the dangers of not being purposeful toward God and life, as well as what happens to people when they give in to temptation.The book is presented as a collection of letters, all from Screwtape to Wormwood. But Lewis does a good job of making the conversation not feel one-sided, and he does a fantastic job with the devils' personalities. In fact the book is rather deeper than this, as there are two other plots going on. First is the fate of Wormwood's man. Second is the relationship between the devils, and the fate of Wormwood.The Screwtape Letters is deeper than it appears, and is thoroughly thought-provoking. Most every reader will find elements in it to which he or she can relate.

The novel is a collection of letters between a demon named Screwtape and his uncle. Lewis focuses on how evil spirits use sublety as opposed to outright possession to draw people from God. Every Christian should read this book to learn the enemy's plan, knowing your enemy is one of the greatest weapons one can have.

As is usual for Mr. Lewis, the charm in which these articles were written make them all the more worth while when you realize how pertinent they really are as they relate to human interaction with fallen angels. Whether or not you agree with his contructed world and society of the demons within this book will not matter concerning how utterly useful it is in its' intended purpose: opening our eyes to our tempters. There are 31 chapters (called letters), varying in length, but averaging 4 (give or take a page) pages long (pending on edition).Here's a brief quote:&quot;...your man has now discovered the dangerous truth that these attacks don't last forever; consequently you cannot use again what is, after all, our best weapon - the belief of ignorant humans that there is no hope of getting rid of us except by yielding.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This is in my opinion, Lewis' greatest work (while I do wish it was a longer book). The book is about letters from a senior demon (Screwtape) to his junior nephew and lesser demon, Wormwood. Srewtape is Wormwood's uncle and supervisor and he is the Undersecretary for the Infernal Lowerarchy.In this book he is trying to present the temptation from the 'other point of view' - the demons. It is through this unquie approach, that we find out about ourselves and our struggels with sin. The story is set in the Second World War where there is a fight for a young Englishman's soul.This is just an outstanding work and while insightful, still very entertaining. Masterful stroke of genius!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"\\"My Dearest Wormwood...\\" Thus opens each letter of the senior demon, Screwtape, to his nephew, a tempter in training. Set in Britain during the second world war, this epistolary novel follows the attempts of Screwtape to teach his young relative the finer points of temptation as Wormwood works to ensnare the soul of a young man in England. His letters are insightful and searing, opening the reader's eyes to the frightening world of demons that exists around us, despite the fact that we often try to ignore its reality. Each lesson in temptation is a lesson to us as well, revealing how easily we can be led astray and how many of our apparently spiritual actions and beliefs are really self-deceptions and lies. Screwtape illustrates how man can be drawn away from God because of the cultural environment he lives in and the innate sinful tendencies that lie hidden in his heart. By painting this picture of the demonic point of view, Lewis provides a helpful guide to avoiding the very pitfalls that we may encounter in our daily lives.I don't believe I've ever been as convicted by a book other than the Bible as I was by this one. Screwtape's descriptions of Wormwood's \\"patient\\" and of other humans who have fallen prey to subtle demonic influences felt like mirrors of my own soul. Some passages seemed as if they had been written especially for me and I found myself cringing over the truths that they revealed. I left this book with a clearer vision of my own condition - one that hurt and made me feel ashamed but also drove me closer to God and forced me to renew my commitment to Him. If you come to this book with an open mind and an open heart, I believe you'll find yourself to be as altered as I was. It is a powerful and convincing read that will stay with you for a long time after the final page."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote this great book in 1942. Do not dismiss this fictional account as mind candy or rubbish. It is simultaneously amusing, instructive and imaginative.The premise is that Lewis is reprinting letters written by Screwtape, a veteran devil, to his nephew, Wormwood, a novice demon. Lewis indicates in the preface that these letters fell into his hands and he has no intention of telling the reader how that occurred.The series of letters is designed to assist Wormwood in tormenting and distracting a young man who goes through daily life stumbling in and out of the Christian faith. It is educational and humorous to read how a demon might easily dissuade a human from following Christ and encourage a man to focus on himself.While experience with the thoughts of demons are rare, Lewis summons a very plausible outline of the contemplations and musings of Satan's minions. Such a believable account of the demonic is provided that the reader can find himself fearing for the author's psyche. In the afterward Lewis comments that his excursion into the minds of demons was an unhealthy trip he did not desire to duplicate.Screwtape cheers as the man falls into temptation and jeers as the man progresses in his faith. While nothing in the book is foul or vulgar, it is admittedly a touch disturbing to wonder through the thought processes of a demon. If only to obtain a glimpse into the plausible mind of the enemy, this book is a worthy read and deeply engaging."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The first time I read &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; I discovered the reasons behind behavior flaws in my husband, daughter, boss, co-workers, neighbors, parents, and finally, myself.

BRAVO!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"C. S. Lewis is considered one of the greatest apologists and Christian writers of the twentieth century. His originality, imagination and trenchant wisdom have enamoured millions of readers for more than 50 years. The Screwtape Letters is certainly in the top tier of Lewis' works.The book is a compilation of letters written by Screwtape, a senior demon, and addressed to Wormwood, a lesser demon and apprentice of Screwtape. In each letter Screwtape offers Wormwood advice for the effectual corruption and moral degradation of his human subjects. Not only does his advice give insight into the character and possible strategies of demonic beings, but it also delicately reveals the essence of virtue: the desire to please God. Screwtape encourages Wormwood to hide from his subjects these nuggets of spiritual wisdom by offering instead specious substitutes. In short, The Screwtape Letters is a treatise on the deceptive arguements used by Satan and his contemporaries to prevent humans from receiving the knowledge of God.Lewis' ingenuity and cleverness captivate the reader by opening a window to the mind of the enemy, replete with all of the posturing, hatred, and horror that is characteristic of those not only seperated from God, but willingly engaged in opposition to Him. This is a must-read book for all those that are actively participating in the daily battle."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This book is considered to be a manual on how to escape the snares that Satan and his following angels lay for us. It agree that it can help. However, I would warn readers that describing what the legions of darkness do can never be done entirely. Do not think that what C.S. Lewis thought they were trying on him is what they will try on you. They know each of us better than we know ourselves.I think that the chief value of the book is that it shows us what the perspective is of those who reject God and his purposes. We can gain a new appreciation of what the apostle John said in his first epistle: &quot;God is Love.(I John 4:8b)&quot;Don't miss &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot;.

It was a change for me to read a book that shows me Satan's side, and how he tempts us. It also showed me what Satan and his followers do to tempt us, and how they feel when a person gets closer to God.This book gives good details. For example, when someone became a Christian, Uncle Screwtape ( one of Satan's higher followers) yelled at the follower in charge of keeping that person away from God. He was also giving advice on how to pull the person back away from God.One of the things that I didn't like about this book, was the fact that the whole book was set up as letters. There wasn't really any narraration. It got boring for me to keep reading the same beginning of\\"My Dear Wormwood\\", and the same ending of \\" Your Affectionate uncle Screwtape.\\" Personally I think it would be better if some of the chapters started and ended different, and if there was some narraration.Overall this was a pretty good book.

Lewis had a gift for being able to see human nature, and he is at his peak with this book. It is a fairly short book, and an easy read, but it has so much power in its approximately 150 pages.

S. Lewis is a series of letters from a senior experienced demon, Screwtape, to a minor inexperienced demon, his nephew Wormwood. In these letters, Screwtape is trying to help his nephew by giving him advice on how to better tempt those people that Wormwood is trying to bring damnation upon. The letters mainly discuss a range of human behavior and how Wormwood can exploit it. To demonstrate this, here is an excerpt that I found very interesting:To keep this game up you and Glubose must see to it that each of these two fools has a sort of double standard. Your patient must demand that all his own utterances are to be taken at their face value and judged simply on the actual words, while at the same time judging all his mother's utterances with the fullest and most over-sensitive interpretation of the tone and the context and the suspected intention. She must be encouraged to do the same to him. Hence from every quarrel they can both go away convinced, or very nearly convinced, that they are quite innocent. You know the kind of thing: \`I simply ask her what time dinner will be and she flies into a temper.' Once this habit is well established you have the delightful situation of a human saying things with the express purpose of offending and yet having a grievance when offense is taken. (p14)This excerpt is a perfect example of how Lewis describes human behavior and the book is full of them. This is why I suggest that this book could be considered religious or secular. Lewis does such a wonderful job on explaining in detail the \\"progress\\" Wormwood is making and the things that he can improve upon. As I read, I could relate to some of the things that Screwtape was explaining to Wormwood, as I have experienced similar situations.I have throughly enjoyed reading \\"The Screwtape Letter\\" because it has helped me see and understand some of the things that I struggle with. Especially at the angle that Lewis comes from, demons trying to bring damnation upon us, really makes me want to change and try harder. I think this is a book that everyone can learn something from. Whether religious or not, this book is for everyone."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This book was given as a gift, however, I didn't expect the book to be so beautiful!

I haven't heard that the book has been read, up to this time."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" written by C.S. Lewis made me really think about Christianity from a different perspective. That's actually what the book is doing for us-showing the other side of Christianity. In this book Screwtape is one of the many devils whose purpose is to ensnare humans in the ways of evil. Screwtape writes several letters to his nephew Wormwood, who is also one of the tempting devils, and gives him advice on tempting humans. Wormwood is specifically working with one human that Screwtape calls his \\"patient.\\"Throughout the book Screwtape writes in response to Wormwood's explanations of what transpires between him and his patient. The patient is a man who is trying to make it through the trials and tribulations of life amidst war-torn England in the 1940's. Screwtape and Wormwood work together to manipulate this man by their evil scheming. They discuss several themes that are significant in Christian belief and life in general.One example that Screwtape uses is the principle of prayer. He explains that when humans receive answers to their prayers, they think to themselves that it was just coincidence, whereas when they don't receive any answer they claim that God isn't there. Screwtape advises his nephew to use that as one way to confuse his patient. Some other weaknesses that Screwtape addresses are humans worshipping idols, thinking it is God (Screwtape is happy when that happens), human sexuality, and war. Screwtape and Wormwood use these to target this man, but in the midst of all their attacks, this man finds one thing that they despise. Love. They are not able to achieve their designs because of the power of love. I think that this is one of C.S. Lewis's reasons for writing and he does a good job with it.Overall I think the book was enjoyable. Lewis helps us to see the strength we can find when it gets hard. He gives us an idea of what we should be looking out for. Lewis shows us that things are not always as they seem; it is not always black and white. On the other hand I think that for a non-Christian audience this book might be a bit difficult to understand, so it would not be one that I recommend for the entire world.One line that I enjoyed from Screwtape was \\"It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things out.\\""},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This book is AMAZING!!!

It address so many important points that it can't be overstated. No Christian of any stripe should be without it. It's letter by letter method allows one to skip to various lessons as they apply to daily life. The final toast is an amazingly accurate prediction of where education would be. One would almost think that he actually intercepted these letters instead of writing them. For they who distain religion, it is a not only a fine treste on morality but a great read, entertaining, amusing and so enjoyable I'm shocked it hasn't been made into a movie yet.

Lewis novel is a moral satire about an old experienced demon, Screwtape, and his letters trying to help his young nephew Wormwood, a rookie demon, to lead humanity astray. Wormwood's work is focused on a particular young man, whose heart he will try to convince. The idea of a little devil sitting on your shoulder that some people might instantly think of is adequate, but in this case, there is no little angel. We get to see the fiend trying to lead astray the poor man's soul, but we never directly see the forces against him, only his annoyance at how they seem to be pushing them out of business.The way the demons seem frustrated and the way they behave and relate between themselves is in one word, comic. Screwtape might at times seem extremely dedicated to his nephew, showing some kind of love, but a few letters ahead, when his apprentice is screwing up, he is almost odiously ready to punish him in some sort of demonic betrayal, turning him in as incompetent. Not even a demon can trust another demon. Lewis also had fun making up some sort of hierarchy and all the bureaucracies demons have to face, having to explain their failures, make reports and all sorts of problems you might have at work, in this case, one can clearly say \\"work is Hell\\", complete even with a secret service department (which always seems to frustrate poor Screwtape, since those incompetents never really manage to find out what God is up to).Lewis obviously focuses the whole work on Christianity. Screwtape is clearly referring to the Christian God as \\"the enemy\\", but this book will be interesting to anyone curious about the spiritual warfare that we all have to face everyday, no matter how we see it or what we call it; Atheists and followers of other religions will probably still find it amusing and interesting. Some thoughts of Screwtape might be a bit dry, but most of the book is a delightful voyage into the human soul and its potential dark side of pride, hate, envy, self-importance, resentment and how it all conflicts with some sort of set of moral laws. When I read it, it was interesting how Screwtape tells his nephew to attack flaws in humane nature that I thought I probably had myself, that's part of the brilliance of C.S. in this clever book; he will not only amuse you, but he will make you stop to question your own behaviour and the way you deal with other people.You will never look at that little devil on your shoulder in the same way again. :-)"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"An must-read for all Christians, new and old alike.

Originally a series of columns in a church magazine, Lewis' hope was for modern people, especially believing Christians, to understand the spiritual dimension of thoughts and actions by way of a reverse description. Seeing Christianity as it ought to work by way of its converse reactions, Lewis showed that evil is not the opposite of good, but the corruption of good.Influenced by Medieval thought, Lewis plays on much of the traditional view of subtle temptations that would most often afflict believers. But more importantly, Lewis writes for the modern ear. The letters to Screwtape from Wormwood are really an exercise in the doublespeak that has become all too common in modernity. By using this type of doublespeak, Lewis achieved a familiarity with modern readers that made this collection of essays on temptation acceptable and appreciated. As literature, the Screwtape Letters is unique in its class, but more importantly it is a modern presentation of the type of thinking that most Christians, especially during the early centuries of the church, were constantly aware of - that we live in a world where we only see dimly the present spiritual reality that makes up our universe. By presenting the issues of the unseen battle in a form modern man can understand, Lewis throws cold water on sluggish men to wake them from their slumber.The letters are contemporary to the time they were written. They take place within the confines of everyday life for an ordinary young English middle class man living in England during World War II. In a sense, he is the central character to the letters, though he plays no active part. Everything we learn of the man is based on one side of an exchange of letters from Screwtape, and even then it is all second hand from the tempter Wormwood. Because the events that are discussed in the letters occur almost exclusively based on the reactions and motivations of the young \\"patient's\\" psyche, Lewis places the illustrations of events wholly in the mind of the patient.For the contemporary church, the Letters warn of us the spiraling trap of the need for the spectacular, the need to out-do God in spiritual success. The patients early temptations to be frustrated with how little he has in common with the churchmen and how the church is at times slow and inefficient are there to play into the mind of the church and the individual within the organized church that her problems are so great that they show that the church needs something else besides being just the church, and relying on the Word of Christ.Accompanying philosophy (church and social work), and outside activity (science) are there to show that the church is a failure and does not provide what the individual believer needs. This is a sophisticated way of acknowledging the unseen realm, while denying the Creator. For since the Church has no other option than to rely on its Unseen Author, its success is guaranteed, but it is attacked fiercely as well. Because of this, by opposition, the Letters call on the church to pray constantly and to be focused on the clear thinking of Screwtape's Enemy."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"It's awfully hard to criticize anything Lewis writes. I wish there were \\"half stars\\" to give, as I'd like to reserve 5 stars for mind-blowing, life-changing books; Screwtape isn't that, although at times it comes close. I've also read this before, so perhaps its effect was lessened in the re-reading.In any case, Lewis' use of the devil-to-devil communication as a way to approach truth and sin is wonderful, fun, and a bit disturbing at times. In other words, it was everything a good book should be. As always, I have to take some theological issue with Lewis' views on the eternal security of the believer, as well as the Catholic and Anglican doctrines of purgatory and limbo; but these are small issues, easily discerned by even fairly new Christians.At its heart, Screwtape is a cautionary tale of good things gone wrong. Over and over, Lewis paints a good thing abused and turned into a bad thing. It's like a handbook for modern culture, even written fifty years ago."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Wow!

Lewis has presented to us one side of a correspondence between two fictitious demons. Screwtape, a demon with a high position and good standing with the one they name as their 'Father below', writes to his younger nephew Wormwood, teaching him in the methods of temptation. In this unique way, Lewis reveals not only temptations themselves, but also the way to overcome them through Jesus Christ. In addition, it is a highly entertaining read, sometimes depressing, at many times humorous, and always insightful, as we follow two demons' plot to ensnare the soul of a new Christian.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I often say that almost all of my theology comes from reading \\"The Narnia Suite,\\" which I read for the first time at the age of eight, and more than a dozen times thereafter. I was particularly taken with The Last Battle, in which some people are very surprised indeed to learn that those they thought wouldn't be admitted into Aslan's Land because they fought on \\"The Wrong Side\\" of the aforementioned last battle, were in fact instantly admitted because it was their intention and their heart which was judged.When I was a little older, someone gave me a copy of \\"The Screwtape Letters,\\" and I have read it probably a dozen or more times over the years as well. Brilliant, allegorical, hilarious in parts, and filled with gentle wisdom, it is a theological masterpiece. I recall the first time I the letter in which one devil brags that he will soon win his first soul for the devil because although the man continues to pray, he doesn't believe what he says any longer. The older, wiser devil releases a stream of invective and explains the younger devil is an idiot, because doesn't the know that \\"those are the prayers that God loves best!?\\" How relieved I felt, as a young person, that there was a possibility God might still embrace me, even with all my doubts.

In it, a senior devil gives continued advice to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; on how best to tempt his victim and keep him from salvation.Lewis does not propose any concrete doctrine on devils here, and this is not his point. Rather he focuses on highlighting the ways, both large and small, that Christians are distracted from God. Lewis explores the dangers of not being purposeful toward God and life, as well as what happens to people when they give in to temptation.The book is presented as a collection of letters, all from Screwtape to Wormwood. But Lewis does a good job of making the conversation not feel one-sided, and he does a fantastic job with the devils' personalities. In fact the book is rather deeper than this, as there are two other plots going on. First is the fate of Wormwood's man. Second is the relationship between the devils, and the fate of Wormwood.The Screwtape Letters is deeper than it appears, and is thoroughly thought-provoking. Most every reader will find elements in it to which he or she can relate.

I love reading, don't get me wrong, but in this new age of self publishing the literary world is beginning to feel a lot more like Wal-Mart or Sam's Club rather than the institution that I fell in love with.Recently, I was packing up my office and preparing for yet another move and as I took one last look around the place to say goodbye, I noticed a little dusty old book lying on the floor where my book case once sat. I walked over and picked it up, dusted it off and realized it was one of my favorite books in the world, The Screwtape Letters by C. S. Lewis.The Screwtape Letters is a collection of letters written by a senior devil to his junior tempter Wormwood. Wormwood is an apprentice demon and his Uncle Screwtape is mentoring him on what it takes to capture a human soul who Screwtape refers to as Wormwood's patient. According to The Screwtape Letters, each one of us is assigned a demon at birth whose job is to bring us into the dark and Satan. Demons who fail and allow their patient to move into the house of their enemy, God will suffer great and painful torments.When I first began college I had not read anything since high school. Actually, all of the reading that was going to be expected of me was one of the things that scared me the most about college. A few days before Christmas one of my friends gave me a small paperback copy of The Screwtape Letters. She told me if I would just read one letter a day that I would finish the book in no time but as I began reading I could not put the book down. It felt as though I had found some sort of secret document teaching me the ways that a demon will come after a person's soul.After reading The Screwtape Letters I craved all things Lewis. So I rushed off and purchased a copy of The Great Divorce\\".The Great Divorce"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This is one of those books I could read a dozen times and still get new insights out of. Anyone who at all enjoys satire, humor, or psychology should read it--Lewis' grasp of what makes us tick (for good and bad) is just brilliant.

These letters are advice on how to keep the patient (a young man) from salvation.DISCLAIMER: I am a Christian, and this review is written for people who have been crucified with Christ (gal 2:20) Others can read at their own risk :-)I was blown away with this book. I'm kind of new to Lewis in that I haven't read much of him (other than the fact that he is quoted all the time in all the other religious books I've read since I was converted). I decided to read this book hoping to familiarize myself with Lewis since he supposedly (from what I've heard) had so much insight.I didn't want to read a book that is just kind of funny and about demons (that would seem to me to be a waste of time). I loved this book because it is packed with totally awesome insight/truth. I suppose you'll have to read for yourself to see if you agree. However, I just want to tell you how PRACTICAL this book was........I felt that in almost every chapter I was learning about how foolish I AND YOU can be. I always realize that I need to be on my guard agaisnt satan (1 Peter 5:8) but this book opened my eyes much wider to see what that means in so many clear ways, and it is filled with practical examples of how satan decieves us.I would seriously recommed this book to anyone who truly wants to serve God and grow in grace (2 peter 3:18). Read this if you really want to see Jesus increase as you decrease (John 3:30) and if you want to think about the REALITY of the spiritual war. This book is full of wisdom from Lewis and it could actually be used as a small group study. The reality of every one of these temptations that Lewis talks about could be discussed in a small group of Christians to their great benefit.God bless you as you are transformed by the renewing your mind (Rom 12:2)"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The Screwtape Letters is, I think, the best introduction to Lewis; that is, if you haven't read anything by him, this is the one to begin with. It's entertaining, thought provoking, and insightful. As with all his works, turn to any page, and you're liable to find a timeless Truth worthy of quotation:\\"He cannot \\"tempt\\" to virtue as we do to vice. He wants them to learn to walk and must therefore take away His hand; and if only the will to walk is really there He is pleased even with their stumbles. Do not be deceived, Wormwood. Our cause is never more in danger, than when a human, no longer desiring, but intending, to do our Enemy's will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.\\"\\"It does not matter how small the sins are provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing. Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick. Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one -- the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts\\"Wondering how anyone could not like this book, I read some of the 1- and 2-star reviews. Some of them, presumably non-believers, comment that this work was too Christian or only of interest to Christians.What puzzles me is that many atheists and agnostics argue that 'right' and 'wrong' are not the sole province of Christianity; that Western Civilization today does not owe its current sense of what is good (like equal treatment of women and minorities, or treating each other as brothers and sisters, etc.) to Christianity. Then, in the very next breath, they'll reject a book about 'right' and 'wrong' behavior as being only of interest to Christians."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is one of the most profound and unique works by C.S. Lewis, himself a profound and unique author. The startling originality of \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" remains as fresh today as it did when Lewis first published it in the 1940s. Every C.S. Lewis work I've ever read is filled with amazing spiritual insights expressed in memorable and forceful language, but in \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" Lewis is at his best. As most readers know, \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" consists of letters written from a superior devil (Screwtape) to a junior devil (Wormwood) about how to lead a subject away from The Enemy (God).Some may choose to read \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" for entertainment, and it is a quite entertaining book. The task of reading what Screwtape writes and then reversing its meaning to be able to apply it to one's life is a delightful process. But I find that the book is best read in small doses, a chapter at a time, and in a devotional way. Each chapter has at least one spiritual truth that it would be good for us to eat and digest slowly. Because of both its literary and spiritual genius, it will forever remain a classic of the English language. If you have not read \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" before, you owe it to yourself to read it slowly and with great relish.Here are some of my favorite insights from the book:In Chapter 2 Lewis dissects the way Satan uses the disappointments in our lives to lead us away from God. Screwtape writes: \\"If once they get through this initial dryness successfully, they become much less dependent on emotion and therefore much harder to tempt.\\"Lewis continues to reveal the temptation to rely on emotions and our inner states in Chapter 3. Screwtape counsels his junior devil to keep the mind of the man on the inner life so that his mind is turned to something inside him. \\"Keep his mind off the most elementary duties by directing it to the most advanced and spiritual ones.\\" I know many Christians who have been tempted in this way.In Chapter 4 Lewis addresses the subject of prayer through the pen of Screwtape. The first goal is to distract the man from prayers, but if this fails, he should \\"Keep them watching their own minds and trying to produce feelings there by action of their own wills.\\"It's amazing how often Lewis (through Screwtape) attacks our dependence on our emotions. Chapter 6 finds Screwtape counseling Wormwood to keep the \\"patient\\" in states of uncertainty, suspense, and anxiety. This plan appears to be working all too well in the lives of the Christians I know. Fear, in particular, is useful to the Enemy: \\"It is your business [Wormwood's] to see that the patient never thinks of the present fear as his appointed cross, but only of the things he is afraid of.\\" The key Spiritual Law we may derive from Chapter 6 (translated into the positive) is \\"be self-unconscious with things of God; be self-conscious with things of sin or devil.\\"Chapter 7 is one of the most important. Lewis' discussion of the \\"Materialist Magician,\\" the man worshipping what he vaguely calls \\"Forces\\" while denying the existence of \\"spirits,\\" is a very timely one for our culture today. It reminds me of the theology of Star Wars. Screwtape believes that when the demons can produce such men, then the end of the war is in sight. Lewis' discussion in this chapter of how temporal affairs are the primary material for obedience was also a very important one.Chapter 8 is another brilliant one, in which Lewis describes the Law of Undulation - that life has ups and downs. There are peaks and troughs in life, and God uses the troughs more than the peaks. One of the most profound and useful things of all that Lewis says is that the best prayers are those carried out when one is no longer desiring but still intending. I find this concept very helpful in the spiritual life, and not just when it comes to prayer.Along the way, Lewis also deals with moderated religion, humor and flippancy, gluttony, love, sex, hopelessness, and feminine beauty.By presenting truth in such a remarkable manner, Lewis allows his reader to apprehend some of the most important spiritual truths we all need to learn. This is one of the few books in life that bears repeated reading!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"C.S. Lewis triumphs again in one of his many insightful writings. The Screwtape Letters is as inspired a work as Bunyan's Pilgrims Progress. The book is written on an eerily accurate level, even amongst skeptics. The work details the how and why behind that feeling - how sometimes we \\"just know\\" that there are forces out there that influence behaviour. The subject of demonic interventionists is one that not many can make a convincing case for in this day and age, but Lewis does so in an artistic and articulate way-not soon to be forgotten. Lewis falls in a category of literary genius from Aristotle to Shakespeare, to Dickens. I wish we could have had him longer."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"There's not much that can be said that hasn't already been said about C.S.

Lewis depicts to illustrate how the devil operates to tempt us. The background is World War II England. The object that the devil preys on is a young Christian. The circumstances of temptation; all of which are something we can relate to everyday, vary from personal devotional time, personal relationships, romance, and vocation to culture, worldviews and the war itself which the readers would discover to be the means to a happy ending for the young Christian, not a usual one, however. The appendix entitled, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\" deals with a more general strategy that the realm of evil formulates in their quest to ruin mankind by pushing them to the deepest abyss their depravity is capable of, \\"to harden these choices of the Hell-ward roads into a habit by steady repetition, ... to turn habit into a principle.\\" Another interesting strategy is to wreck havoc in the culture by twisting the meaning of the word \\"democracy\\" from a narrow strict sense to a broad one.The reason why Lewis does an excellent job in giving us the insights on the operation of the realm of the devil is because he understands human beings and culture well, which makes this book deeply personal, worth reading and learning from."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"In Traditional Judaism, there is a school of thought called the Mussar Movement, which emphasizes self-evaluation and self-examination. Of the works of Mussar (ethics and morals) that I have studied over the years, I have not found a work that affects me so profoundly as \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\" As an Observant Jew, you might find it funny that I recommend the Screwtape Letters, a book ostensibly, about Christianity. Yet, if you can look beyond the frame of Christianity (and if you can't, don't read it), the book is really about human nature. It teaches us about the subtle way the psyche (or in Lewis' terminology, the devil) convinces us to abandon the eternal and spiritual in pursuit of the etherial and physical. Yet, the technique of the exchange of letters gives the reader a perspective we never consider: the side of us that wants to be bad. Once we understand how our own \\"devil\\" really works, that awareness can make us that much more diligent in overcoming his temptations. Time and time again throughout my reading of this book I find myself saying, \\"I do that all the time.\\" All of us do, which makes this book so compelling. The reader should be warned: this is not a book to be read and relegated to the bookshelf. It's a book that must be read and periodically reviewed, to encourage self-examination and evaluation. Each time I return to The Screwtape Letters, I know that I put it down with a chance to become a better person."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"In older editions of this book, there's a fascinating preface by Lewis in which he talks about, among other things, his view of the nature of demons and angels and how they have been mis-portrayed in popular art and literature. That preface is not included in this edition."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"By means of correspondence between two devils, Lewis describes the invisible reality of spiritual warfare, as well as the temptations facing believers in a hostile well. The variety of temptations gives much food for thought about the spiritual warfare that is going on in the reader's own life (Eph. 6).The premise of this novel has been used by Randy Alcorn in his recent book &quot;Lord Foulgrin's Letters&quot;. Although I haven't read Alcorn's book personally, it's my understanding that this is a readable and successful contemporary version of the Lewis classic.Nobody, not even Alcorn, however, can expect to surpass the shining literary and theological achievement of C.S.

The Screwtape Letters, including \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" is one of the most amazing books that I have ever read. I think that it is still totally applicable to the world today, and I feel that no person who reads it will leave it quite the same person.Most people know the concept of the book. Screwtape is a retired and wise \\"devil,\\" or tempter. He is writing a letters to his less-experienced nephew who is trying to tempt a human soul away from God, the Enemy. The book is the collection of those letters.Each letter itself is a small masterpiece. Lewis uses this reverse theology to enlighten so many aspects of man's spiritual life. Lewis knows the daily temptations and urges that man must face before opening himself up to God. Lewis examines each of them with a large dose of irony and wit, imparting immeasurable insight on the reader. It is evident in the letters that Lewis discerned the trends that would shape the rest of the century, and the book can be so useful for combatting them and gaining individual salvation. The Screwtape Letters should constantly be read and studied. Its wonderful influence is already enormous and should be encouraged to grow."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Because of the ingenuity required to merely have the idea for this book, C.S. Lewis showed what a brilliant and creative mind he had. This is one of the few books that insightfully delves into answering the question &quot;What does Satan want our lives to be like?&quot; Lewis answers this question by writing from the point of view of a demon--so the language we are used to seeing in Christian books is reversed. God is the Enemy, people are encouraged to end up in Hell, and virtues are turned to vice. It is fun, convicting, poignant, and delightful all at once. While reading through it, I found several times that subtle lies Screwtape (the guide to a younger demon, Wormwood) was encouraging Wormwood to feed into his human's consciousness, are lies that have subtly made their way into my mind as well. So this book definitely has the capability of convicting of sin, and of revealing incorrect paradigms that we hold about what our lives are about. What I enjoyed most about this book was that it was almost entirely focused on heart condition as opposed to action. As an experienced demon, Screwtape knew that to really turn a human to the dark side you need to focus on his view of the world and his internal motives. This book is short, and it's well-worth at least one read through.As one additional bit of info: if you sometimes have difficulty understanding C.S. Lewis' writings, or just worry that you might be missing something, there is an older version of this book with a study guide by Walter Hooper in the back that is very helpful."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Did other readers respond as I did? Did they throw this book across the room, finding the ideas written here exasperatingly true? Lewis makes clear challenges about how Satan insidiously, yet effectively ensnares our sensibility. These letters exchanged between a demon and a disciple learning how to defy God and defeat a man's devotion to Christ, readers will be drawn in by Lewis' creative accessibility to our inner life. I found my thoughts and motivations so frustratingly twisted by Satan as I considered the truth in &quot;Screwtape.&quot; This is a good choice for &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; fans as they discover living a godly life is more than just wanting to do God's will. Be ready to be humbled as you discover how carefully Satan's minions work to have us believing we are living righteously. Any cynic of Christianity might find this refreshing fodder of thought as well."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I don't know how well this great book translates to agnostic readers, but for me it was a very enlightening and concrete way to understand what it means to try to be a good man in a world of temptation.In keeping with the time period, I believe it was Winston Churchill who said \\"All evil needs to triumph is for good men to do nothing\\". In the Screwtape Letters the senior tempter, tells his apprentice, it is just as affective to get a man to stare into a fire until it turns to ash, as to get him to commit some great sin, because either keeps him from doing what he should. I wonder what Mr. Lewis would have thought of digital cable television? I am as guilty as anyone of staring at that box instead of doing good.So here's the deal.This is an excellent book for any believer from High School on up, that wants to be good and avoid evil.But that's just me."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The wry and ironic Uncle Screwtape, an adminstrator in Hell, sends helpful missives to his demon nephew Wormwood regarding the temptation of souls. A tyro, Wormwood consistently fails to tempt his charge into abandoning the enemy (God) - the artifice employed to justify ongoing avuncular assistance. Through this series of 30+ letters, C.S. Lewis provides the reader an opportunity to look at the machinations of sin from the opposite angle. Like a film negative, this view provides an entirely different perspective in which darker, dimmer shadings come starkly to the fore.A political message is appended with Screwtape Proposes a Toast. In a departure reminiscent of Toqueville, Lewis presents at least one danger inherent in democracy: the egalitarian trend towards mediocrity. This lesson is as crucial today as it was when Lewis composed it.The Screwtape Letters give a reflective reader much reason for pause. This is no doubt the author's intent. Accordingly, it easily merits 5+ stars."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Facinating book writen from the perspective of a corruptor. Very easy to read, the chapters are remarably well focused and they all interconect. This doesn't deal so much with what people think of as the great sins. Instead it deals with how smaller things become greater over time. It deals with how people look at only their own good, and often think only in therms of gaining at the expence of others; Judging themselves as somthing only because others are not.For nonbelievers it should be just as interesting, not as a religious text, but as a book about how to keep from becoming preoccupied with stuff that really doesn't matter. Nonbelievers should find this message just as relevant. It also talks a great deal with the problems with many churches, and how elitism of the faithful can in fact become a huge vice.One of the book's greatest messages is to look at the basics of things, is it righteous? as opposed to, is it with the times?"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The Screwtape Letters, which consists of an older Devil, Screwtape, instructing his newphew in the art of temptation, is a brilliantly original way of magnifying the more wily schemes to which the Devil (referred to in the book as 'Our Father Below') resorts.

While still being the best book I have ever read, it is also one of the strangest. Screwtape, an experienced devil, teaches his nephew, Wormwood, how to win a soul over from the so-called &quot;Enemy&quot;, who is the Lord Jesus Christ. While he is doing this, he teaches the reader about the techniques that Satan uses to distract Christians away from God. Therefore, he is teaching us how to live better Christian lives and avoid giving in to temptations. He shows us through the example of his nephew, Wormwood, trying to win over a particular Englishmen. He tries to make him think that what he is doing is not sin. Even though, in the end, the man is not won over, we see how so many people go astray without even realizing it.

In it, Lewis shows us a rare clarity of thought about the Christian faith in its daily struggles... with a brilliant sense of humor. This book is good for believers who are lazy or unchallenged by their faith. It also can give us a glimpse of the arguments which compelled Lewis, an atheist, to accept Christianity as true; however, for a non-fiction and more in-depth look at Lewis' Christian apology, see &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; ... or ... if you have the will power to read really meaty thought try his book &quot;Miracles.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This is my second reading of the book - about 15 years since my first reading.

I recommend it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I read this again and again, never failing to marvel at the incredible insight CS Lewis has about becoming muddled by the world. Some of his views on women and sex are a bit outdated and misogynist in my opinion, but the overall lessons are still as true as ever. Despite the humour, it is a scary book at times. In the end, despite it all, Screwtape ends up giving a glorious homily to God. I recommend this even to non Christians, as a wonderful way at looking at human fraility."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Screwtape's instructive letters to a young devil on how to successfully corrupt a human are smart and enjoyable, and more importantly will make you aware of your own foibles and all the ways in which we humans can be less than holy and Christian. I can practically hear Screwtape making fun of me sometimes as I go about my day - and that serves to make me a more self-aware, better person. Lewis' deceptively easy treatment of the subject matter makes this a fast, breezy read despite the dark subject matter."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"C.S. Lewis' Novel the Screwtape Letters Is a fictional work set in the time period of World War II. The book is written in an unusual way. It is made of up letters between two of the devil's minions, Wormwood and Wormwood's Uncle Screwtape. Wormwood is a relatively new minion of the devil who is put in charge of an unnamed man who joins Christianity and later falls in love with a Christian Woman. Screwtape (an experienced tempter) writes letters to his nephew, coaching him on how to deceive the man he is in charge of. Lewis uses this scenario to educate Christians and all men, on how to avoid the traps that the devil uses to make us eternally unhappy. For example Screwtape says the following to his nephew in speaking of ways to get churchgoing people to falter, \\"The real fun is working up hatred between those who say \\"mass\\" and those who say \\"holy Communion\\" when neither party could possible state the difference between.\\"The interesting format of this book really makes you pay attention and think. Having been written from the point of view of those who want to ruin the lives of humans, you have to translate what Screwtape says as good, into what we see as bad. The book is super effective at making you do some self-evaluating. Every time you pick it up, you are basically holding a mirror up and seeing your flaws as well as you good characteristics. Something truly useful about the book is that it doesn't focus on the obvious sins, but rather; on follies in the way we pray, our obsession with having to get exactly what we want, or even vanity.The only complaint I would have about this book is how it is written. The words do no flow extremely well, so it must be read slowly, but the content makes it well worth the effort.Overall, I recommend this book to all Christians as well as any person who want to better themselves. The insights gained can really be helpful no matter what phase of life you are in or what struggles or imperfections you have."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This classical book by C.S. Lewis was well worth the read. Lewis is equal parts wise, witty, funny, and insightful about modernity. This series of letters from one evil spirit to his nephew are amazing for their ability to highlight the very things that continue to be faults and weaknesses in our culture.My only criticism is those times when C.S. Lewis hints at what can be called mere Christianity. Lewis seems to have a tendency to want to reduce things down in Christianity, not totally understanding the fullness of the Christian faith."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Much good stuff had been said about this book and I am sure I cannot write one praise better than most of other reviewers. So, to add value, I would like to quote a passage of Philip Yancey on his book \\"How Good is God\\" of how Lewis, quoting the reply of William Booth, Founder of the Salvation Army, to Rudyard Kipling, responded to criticism against his unconventional books including this: \\"If I thought I could win one more soul to the Lord by walking on my head and playing the tambourine with my toes, I'd learn how.\\" In short, a must read.p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.In civilized life domestic hatred usually expresses itself by saying things which would appear quite harmless on paper but in such a voice, or at such a moment, that they are not far short of a blow in the face. Pg13There is nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a human's mind against the Enemy. He wants men to be concerned with what they do; our business is to keep them thinking about what will happen to them. Your patient will, of course, have picked up the notion that he must submit with patience to the Enemy's will. What the Enemy means by this is primarily that he should accept with patience the tribulation which has actually been dealt out to him - the present anxiety and suspense. It is about this that he is to say \\"Thy will be done\\", and for the daily task of bearing this that the daily bread will be provided. It is your business to see that the patient never thinks of the present fear as his appointed cross, but only of the things he is afraid of. Let him regard them as his crosses; let him forget that, since they are incompatible, they cannot all happen to him, and let him try to practice fortitude and patience to them all in advance.....An important spiritual law is here involved, I have explained that you can weaken his prayers by diverting his attention from the Enemy Himself to his own states of mind about the Enemy. Pg26We want cattle who can finally become food; He wants servants who can finally become sons. We want to suck in. He wants to give out. We are empty and would be filled; He is full and flows over. Our war aims is a world in which Our Father Below has drawn all other beings into himself; the Enemy wants a world full of beings united to Him but still distinct. Pg39All we can do is to encourage the humans to take the pleasure which our Enemy has produced, at times, or in ways or in degrees which He has forbidden. Hence we always try to work away from the natural condition of any pleasure to that in which it is least natural, least redolent of its Maker, and least pleasurable. An ever increasing craving for an ever diminishing pleasure is the formula. It is more certain, and it's better style. Pg44Talk to him about moderation in all things. If you can once get him to the point of thinking that \\"religion is all very well up to a point\\", you can feel quite happy about his soul. A moderate religion is as good for us as no religion at all - and more amusing. Pg46Let him do anything but act. No amount of piety of in his imagination and affections will harm us if we can keep it out of his will....The more often he feels without acting, the less he will be able ever to act, and, in the long run, the less he will be able to feel. Pg66-7You must therefore conceal from the patient the true end of Humility. Let him think of it not as self forgetfulness but as a certain kind of opinion (namely, a low opinion) of his own talents and character. Pg70The Enemy wants them to attend chiefly to two things, to eternity itself, and to that point of time which they call the Present. For the Present is the point at which time touches eternity....the duty of planning the morrow's work is today's duty. Pg75Because what she wants is smaller and less costly than what ahs been set before her, she never recognizes as gluttony her determination to get what she wants, however troublesome it may be to others.....The woman is in what may be called the \\"All I want\\" state of mind...because her \\"properly\\" conceals an insatiable demand for the exact, and almost impossible, palatal pleasures which she imagines she remembers from the past.... Pg88In the long run either Our Father or the Enemy will say \\"Mine\\" of each thing that exists, and specially of each man. They will find out in the end, never fear, to whom their time, their souls, and their bodies really belong - certainly not to them, whatever happens.

The demons are trying to tempt an English man away from God (who they refer to as \`The Enemy'). Athough Lewis often falls prey to excessive pomp and wordiness, the book is witty and well organized. The letter format makes for easy reading.As an atheist, my enjoyment of this book really hinges on how literally I choose to read it. On the one hand, I find the theme of this life as a divine God-sanctioned test complete with demonic supernatural opponents as unfounded, superstitious, and resultant in unnecessary fear and stress. If I instead choose to read the book metaphorically, Lewis makes some brilliant observations about human vices and virtue (and how the latter too often lead to the former) amongst the religious clutter.If you're going to be a Christian, you could certainly do far worse than the Christianity of CS Lewis."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"My Dear Wormwood;Congratulations on your graduation from the Tempter's Training College for young devils.

The Screwtape Letters is an effort by Lewis to address many concerns and issues within the context of a morality play. Whether it's suffering, casual religion, interpersonal relationship issues, war, or cynicism, Lewis provides compelling insights into the origins and effects of these issues. In describing in a fictional way why demons encourage or discourage certain things, the reader begins to see how they are being tempted in their own life and the kinds of effects certain actions and thoughts have. Within this context, Lewis cleverly provides fitting commentaries on people's attitudes and the current state of human affairs relative to their relationship with God. Assuming that the morality play presented here is valid and that demons are indeed trying to encourage or discourage things in people, I found the overriding theme of this book to be that absent a deep relationship with God and continual reinforcement of Godly values and living in a person's life, a drift away from God and toward harmful attitudes and actions is inevitable. Lewis clearly tries to demonstrate that there is an absolute good and an absolute evil in this book, and that while good and evil are not always easily discernible, it is in our interests to keep our guard up and not be fooled by the notion that good and evil are defined by our own feelings (which lead to many of the negative consequences described in this book) instead of a transcendent and universal standard upon which terms like &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; can be uniformly defined. This is a message that is more applicable today than it was even when Lewis wrote this book, in my view. It is therefore highly relevant and applicable to the human condition in the new millenium."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I am not christian or even sure i believe in god, but this book is immeasureablely deep and insightful none the less.

It is perhaps the most concise masterpiece I know, can be devoured in one evening or in a few quick breaks, and is so packed with insight that you can find fresh ideas in it even after multiple re-readings. Best of all, this book can give you a new perspective on the little ways evil can manifest in some of the most seemingly innocent aspects of everyday life. That Lewis could make all this accessible and humorous at the same time is what sets SCREWTAPE apart. The addition of &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot; adds to the wisdom, as well as the fun, of this marvelous book. The all-too-believeable character of Screwtape grows more real in the &quot;Toast&quot; -- because he's even more clearly a reflection of the corporate/political/social evil we've come to accept as part of our world. If you haven't had the pleasure, you owe yourself this one."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Lewis gives us excellent insight and perspective on the nature of temptation and how Satan works. The work is set up as correspondances between a beaucrat in hell and his nephew Wormwood. The letters are advice and training for Wormwood who is given charge of luring certain people down to Hell. The book is entertaining, humorous, but also deep and should strike a chord with those expiriencing strong temptation in their life towards some form of evil. The best way to fight your enemy is to know him, and this book is an theory on how the devil and his angels might work to take souls away from God. The book is also very easy to read, and without the pretentious philosophical jargon that theologians use. It's down to earth, common sense theology taught in story form. An excellent work!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The Screwtape Letters is a timeless satire.

Lewis had a masterful grasp of the human condition, and the place that faith and evil play in a constant battle for our broken souls.

What is good to Screwtape is bad for us.

Years ago, I discovered The Screwtape Letters and was blown away. The other day I found myself skimming through it again, then settling down to dig deeply through this treasure trove of misinformation.A senior demon, Screwtape, is writing letters to an underling and giving advice in the ways of bringing down mankind one person at a time. He speaks with disturbing clarity, marked insight, and insidious desire. He wants to feast upon the souls of all of us, while serving Our Father Below. In this twisted world, we see life from the side of evil. From this framework, God is the Enemy, and so the reading requires a constant attention to the subtle lies Screwtape is mixing in with his letters.The insights we discover through this flipped script are unsettling and important. We see the follies of self-righteousness and even unselfishness. We see through the schemes used to divide man and woman, the ploys of twisted pleasure, and the cyclical trap of pride/humility/pride. Every page brings revelation in this ultimate cautionary tale.I'm a fan of Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, Space Trilogy, Mere Christianity, and The Great Divorce, but this title is still one of the most mind-blowing, yet accessible, books I've ever read.

It was in thinking about what to write in this review that I have come to this conclusion.C. S.

In it, a senior devil gives continued advice to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; on how best to tempt his victim and keep him from salvation.Lewis does not propose any concrete doctrine on devils here, and this is not his point. Rather he focuses on highlighting the ways, both large and small, that Christians are distracted from God. Lewis explores the dangers of not being purposeful toward God and life, as well as what happens to people when they give in to temptation.The book is presented as a collection of letters, all from Screwtape to Wormwood. But Lewis does a good job of making the conversation not feel one-sided, and he does a fantastic job with the devils' personalities. In fact the book is rather deeper than this, as there are two other plots going on. First is the fate of Wormwood's man. Second is the relationship between the devils, and the fate of Wormwood.The Screwtape Letters is deeper than it appears, and is thoroughly thought-provoking.

I thought it was great then and even better when I just reread it.Written as a series of letters from a senior demon, Screwtape, to his nephew, Wormwood, this book paints an amazing picture of the tactics used to divert people from their walk with God.As Screwtape writes: 'You will say that these are very small sins; and doubtless, like all young tempters, you are anxious to be able to report spectacular wickedness. But do remember, the only thing that matters is the extent to which you separate the man from the Enemy (Christ). It does not matter how small the sins are provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing. Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick.'Lest anyone come away with the false impression that Lewis is condemning card playing, that is not the point at all. He is talking about anything diverting one from his/her relationship with God being a potential problem.This book is full of brilliant dialogue from the senior miscreant to the junior.

C.S. Lewis' intellect, satirical humor and creativity make this a great book to read. It is a good combination of Christian theology and fiction -- much like his Chronicles of Narnia.

What should have been a quick ~150 page read, wound up being an enormous, but fulfilling project. To read this book is to learn a great deal about one's self, human nature, God, and all that is spiritual.This is one book that noone ever regrets having read. It is similar to some books of the Bible, in the sense that it uses a ficticious, third-person point-of-view to describe something that is not only highly realistic, as a story, but is extremely revealing of what IS real, in general"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The Screw Tape Letters is one of the most intriguing books that I've ever read. It is a rather difficult book to read and it took me a longer time to complete it than the usual book, but it was definitely worth the wait. Some people think books that are somewhat religious are boring and can't possibly be very good. However, The Screwtape Letters proves that mentality quite wrong.If you haven't read the book, it is a book about a graduate from a \\"devil college\\" (Screwtape), who writes letters to his \\"still in training\\" advocate (Wormwood) on how to steer his human subject away from Christianity. This book is great in the sense that it really makes you think and wonder if there is anyone in your life that resembles Screwtape's advocate, Wormwood. It makes you more aware of common, day-to-day situations and helps you think about what you're doing before you regret it.Through out the letters, Wormwood reports to Screwtape on how he is coming along with his subject. I found some of the responses quite humorous in there irony and some were rather frightening to think that things like the church and my own friends could be used against me. However, no matter how disturbing the letter were, in the end they will help you out when you are in doubt. I definately recomend this book to anyone who is down for a little brain stimulation."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"In The Screwtape Letters CS Lewis writes of devils and their work, appealing to anyone with an intrest in the purpose of life and in how to succeed in that purpose. In his preface he explains that many symbols of devils and angels produce an undesirable effect. He gives examples such as, \\"The humorous, sensible, adaptable Mephistopheles has helped to strengthen the illusion that evil is liberating.\\" (9; Revised Edition Preface) It was Lewis' intent to avoid this error. While CS Lewis's depiction of devils is not proven to be true, he successfully uses diction and characterization to appeal to our emotions to build a sense of the evil of devils and appeals to the readers' logic to guide us to our own conclusions on how to protect ourselves from the devils.Lewis's first appeal to emotion is made in the effective diction of Lewis's preface, \\"Readers are advised to remember that the devil is a liar,\\" (6; preface) The connotation of the term devils is distinctly evil, thus Lewis gives us a prejudice toward them. Lewis furthers this prejudice with his use of the term liar, indicating that the devil is not to be trusted.Lewis's second appeal to emotion comes in his characterization of the devils as prideful. In the 31st chapter Screwtape expresses his victory over Wormwood \\"I have always desired you, as you (pitiful fool) desired me. The difference is I am the stronger,\\" (145; ch.31) through this Lewis shows us one form of Screwtape's pride. This pride, the pride of one looking down on another, leads us to further distrust Screwtape.It is easy to see the pride of one looking down on another, thinking himself better, but Lewis doesn't confine the devils to a single form of pride. In the 1st chapter he introduces a more complex form of pride, \\"...oh, that abominable advantage of the Enemy's!\\"(8; ch.1) Here is shown the pride of the weaker or lower resenting the greater for his strength, and making excuses for his own weakness or failures. This pride shows us another shortcoming of the devils, thus Lewis deepens our distrust of them.A second characteristic, which Lewis reveals in Wormwood's attempt to send the \\"Secret Police\\" after his uncle and mentor Screwtape as displayed in the 22nd chapter is disloyalty. This quality is echoed by Screwtape, \\"Love you? Why, yes. As dainty a morsel as ever I grew fat on.\\" (145; ch.31) he further explains that because Wormwood had failed he, Screwtape, would get to in some way consume Wormwood. Screwtape displays his disloyalty as he is not upset at his nephew's failure, nor interested in his defense, but rather pleased at the prospect of gaining from Wormwood's punishment. Thus Lewis continues to build our feelings of the evils of the devils right through the final chapter.Through the words of Screwtape, Lewis appealing to our logic explains the immediate goal of the devils, \\"the only thing that matters is the extent to which you separate the man from the Enemy.\\" (56; ch.12) One such example is given in the first chapter as Screwtape relates a story of one of his \\"patients\\" who he almost lost. This patient, prompted by God, had begun to think religiously, and instead of arguing Screwtape just convinced the man that he needed to go for lunch, thus breaking the line of thought(9;ch.1). Lewis uses this as an appeal to logic, leaving us to conclude that this separation is to our detriment, as it is what our enemy, the devils, desires. This is how Lewis continues to build a foundation for the views he would have us develop.Lewis again appeals to our logic to guide us to a conclusion showing that the methods by which the devils produce their desired effect are numerous and varied; Lewis, through Screwtape, gives an example of just how varied they can be, \\"All extremes ... are to be encouraged. Not always, of course, but at this period. Some ages are lukewarm and complacent, and then it is our business to soothe them yet faster asleep,\\" (33; ch.7) the methods given are opposing, so Lewis builds the logical basis for the belief that the devils will do it any way that works. Throughout the work Lewis gives many examples of possible methods of the devils such as, \\"tortured fear and stupid confidence are both desirable states of mind,\\" (67; ch.15) the devils would encourage either state of mind. So the logical conclusion is that we will be face a wide array of methods of temptation depending on the age in which we live, and the temptations to which we are most susceptible.Lewis presents another method of the devils as Screwtape warns Wormwood of \\"strengthening in [his] patient the fatal habit of attending to universal issues,\\" (8; ch.1) and that he should not argue about \\"doctrines as primarily \`true' or \`false,'\\" (8; ch.1) thus we may logically conclude that in order to overcome the temptations of the devils we must think upon the eternities, and consider what is true and what is false. Perhaps this is why Lewis writes in such a way as to require personal thought, so we will think of what is true and false and thwart the devils.Lewis gives further insight into the methods of the devils through the words of Screwtape, \\"The safest way to Hell is the gradual one--the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts,\\"(56;ch.12) So we know that the devils are not going to be overt. \\"Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick,\\" (56; ch.12) Lewis, through the words of Screwtape, explains just how small an effective attack can be. Lewis's use of cards as a sufficient method shows just how subtle the way to Hell can be, as many would argue that the use of cards is not wrong at all, but it is what it leads to. If cards are all it takes to get someone to put God out of his mind, to disregard God's word, then it is sufficient, and the devils know it. So again he leads us to a logical conclusion: to protect ourselves from devils we must be aware of the small things that separate us from God.Through all of this Lewis makes no conclusions. He leaves that to us. As we consider such things as, \\"So do not allow any temporary excitement to distract you from the real business of undermining faith and preventing the formation of virtues,\\" (25; ch.5) we may learn more of how we should act, perhaps that we should do the opposite, but Lewis never says it. By leaving the conclusions to us Lewis helps us to form our own personal methods of protection, suited to our own strengths and weaknesses.In his book, The Screwtape Letters, CS Lewis successfully instructs us how to protect ourselves from devils. He carefully appeals to our emotions through his use of diction and characterization of the devils to convince us of a need to protect ourselves. He then gives us logical instruction, but he leaves the conclusions to us, allowing us to form our own methods of protection."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"the person that sold me this book was a pleasure to buy from.

As Lewis points out, the path to hell is a gentle slope.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to differentiate between God's thoughts and the lies of evil. &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; pulls back the curtain and reveals evil's best kept secrets and oh-so subtle tricks."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This book was assigned reading when I was in 8th grade at a Catholic school. I remember I had no appreciation for it whatsoever at the time. I couldn't relate to the protagonist or his travails in wartime England. Perhaps one needs a little time in this world to appreciate the delicious simplicity of Lewis' allegory. Having read it recently I was struck by the wisdom, strength and genuine spiritualism this book exudes. One needn't, as commented upon elsewhere, be a believer to appreciate this work. Lewis never tries to foist any doctrinaire agenda upon the reader. Neither is he didactic. All that comes across (to this reader, at least) is a sense of hard-won wisdom. It offers some hints about how we might find a bit of peace and happiness on this earth if we are willing to think a little less selfishly and are able to set our powerful egos aside for awhile. I wish that those readers who wasted their money on The Celestine Prophecy and thought it provided wonderful spiritual insight would turn their attention Lewis' way. Here is the matter simply stated, without some wayward attempts at new-age jingoism."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Who can deny the insidious whisperings that infiltrate the noblest heart and penetrate the most virtuous mind?--those subtle impulses that beckon hither and thither to paths we ought not to travel upon. How often have we vowed never to yield to some enticement, only to succumb moments later to the very vice we had pledged to eschew? Whether manifested in the final, luscious slice of a calorie-loaded pound cake or in the tantalizing allure of a forbidden passion, temptation to choose wrong over right is ubiquitous in our lives as we daily make decisions of both trivial and profound significance. Yet while many have denounced the depravity of sin, C.S. Lewis, a mid-twentieth century British theologian, took a much more innovative approach - through the eyes of the devil himself. The resulting correspondence written between the seasoned devil Screwtape and Wormwood, his inexperienced nephew, is an insightful training manual on the art of human subjugation. In his masterful commentary The Screwtape Letters, C.S. Lewis effectively employs satire, irony, and appeal to logos to enable his adult Christian audience to recognize and understand the devices of temptation.From the beginning, Screwtape's writings unveil the real roots of temptation through satire. Wormwood's task is to bring about a soul's damnation, but as his uncle quickly observes, the newly christened tempter is prone to error. Critiquing his understudy, Screwtape chides, \\"Are you not being a trifle nave? It sounds as if you supposed that argument was the way to keep him out of the Enemy's clutches... Jargon, not argument, is your best ally in keeping him from the Church\\" (p. 1). This passage is satirical because it exploits Wormword's fallible use of argument to undermine his patient's faith when mere diversion would be sufficient. It is a direct critique of the book's adult Christian audience who allow meaningless \\"jargon\\" to distract them from their faith. As evident in this example, C.S. Lewis masterfully uses satire to establish lesser temptations as valid components of sin in the reader's mind.Additionally, the satire in Screwtape's letters provides valuable insights on the tactics employed by the beguilers. After offering a slew of tips for diverting people from their prayers, Screwtape states, \\"It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality, our best work is done by keeping things out\\" (p. 15). Here he is specifically referring to the spiritual distance fostered by casual or self-promoting prayers, but the technique of distancing his patients from \\"the Enemy\\" characterizes all the devil's efforts. This example is satirical because it largely implicates the tempted - not the tempter - for planting seeds of temptation through a careless relationship with God. It reveals the devil's tendency to not only entice, but to encourage conditions where such enticements will be most compelling. By critiquing the audience's possibly cavalier approach to prayer, satire teaches the reader to recognize the devil's underlying tactics in temptation.In addition to satire, C.S. Lewis uses irony to explore temptation's appeal to human flaws while simultaneously undermining the demon's methodology. On page 37, Screwtape writes, \\"Their nearest approach to constancy, therefore, is undulation.\\" Wormwood's patient had recently dropped into a spiritual trough, and Screwtape cautions that such deviations do not of themselves lend to damnation. His statement is ironic because it underscores change as mankind's only dependable feature. But the true irony is that Wormwood's efforts to discourage ultimately undermine his objective because they humble the patient to rely wholly upon \\"the Enemy.\\" Lewis' irony reveals both human flaws and demonic arrogance associated with sin. It enables his Christian audience to better understand temptation by concisely illustrating both its strengths and failings.Another example of irony is Screwtape's inability to comprehend love. Referring to God as \\"the Enemy,\\" he writes, \\"All His talk about Love must be a disguise for something else - He must have some real motive for creating them and taking so much trouble about them\\" (p.100). Because, as a devil, he is himself incapable of virtue, Screwtape incorrectly assumes that all righteous actions must also have ulterior motives. This non sequitor fallacy is satirical because it exhibits the tempter's deficiency in understanding, while reinforcing to the Christian audience that love really is \\"the Enemy's\\" driving motive. This satire provides dramatic insights by suggesting that temptation is only a pervasion of virtue which cannot supplant righteousness. Through this satirical device, Lewis convinces the reader that while Satan can mimic love as lust and induce man to commit all manner of sexual transgressions, he can never understand the true nature of love. This conundrum is further reinforced by the statement, \\"We know that He cannot really love: nobody can: it doesn't make sense. If only we could find out what he is really up to!\\" (p. 101). By satirically emphasizing Satan's misunderstanding of truth, Lewis establishes in his reader's perception the subtlety of sin as a perverted reflection of truth.Lewis's irony is further bolstered through the use of distorted diction. The polarity of his word choice is best exemplified on page 117. Describing one particularly righteous girl, Screwtape writes, \\"Not only a Christian but such a Christian - a vile, sneaking, simpering, demure, monosyllabic, mouse-like, watery, insignificant, virginal, bread-and butter miss.\\" The contrast between this vitriolic stream of adjectives and the virtuous purity of Christianity is deliciously ironic. God becomes \\"the Enemy\\" while Satan is tenderly patronized as \\"Our Father Below\\" (p.2). This ironically polarized diction reinforces the audience's understanding of sin as corruption. What Screwtape loves we should disdain, and Screwtape loathes we should embrace. By intensifying the contrast between good and evil, the irony of Lewis's \\"black is white\\" diction immediately alerts his reader to recognize temptation.Finally, Lewis' rational dissection of temptation as a systematic progression appeals to the reader's sense of logos. Defining his intentions on page 44, Screwtape gloats, \\"We always try to work away from the natural condition of any pleasure to that in which it is least natural, least redolent of its Maker, and least pleasurable. An ever increasing craving for an ever diminishing pleasure is the formula.\\" With this object established, the devil then works systematically toward his victim's destruction. First he plants doubts so that a patient will question the value of religion. He then lets the person acclimatize to a lowered spiritual condition and finally moderate into complete religious complacency (p. 45-46). This progression toward captivity appeals to the reader's sense of logos because it follows a coherent chronology. By understanding the general logic of temptation and the ensuing misery, the audience is empowered to identify similar patterns in their own lives.The appeal to logos is similarly employed in Screwtape's discourse on the sin of \\"fashion.\\" On page 137, the devil lays out the consequences for yielding to fashion in an orderly, logical manner. First, an obsession with novelty \\"diminishes pleasure while increasing desire.\\" Second, it costs money. Third, it leads to \\"excesses of lasciviousness, unreason, cruelty, and pride.\\" And ultimately, it \\"distracts the attention of men from their real dangers.\\" This appeals to the reader's sense of logos because it clearly illustrates the sin-driven regression from desire to danger. By appealing to logos, Lewis clearly displays the mechanics of beguilement to his audience.As a whole, The Screwtape Letters provide invaluable insights into the world of temptation. From sensual passions to trendy fashions, and distracting jargon to cavalier prayers, C.S. Lewis thoroughly exposes his reader to the twisted realities of the devil Screwtape and his minion Wormwood. In so doing, he empowers his adult Christian audience to resist temptation when it strikes. The scathing satire, delicious irony, and rational appeal to logos unravel the tangled intricacies of temptation by defining its roots, devices, and systematic methodology. In a world filled with temptation, this book is a must read for any Christian adult eager to avoid an unpleasant reunion with \\"Our Father Below.\\""},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"&quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is one of those books that teaches you a lesson without you even realizing it... or even if you do, it's in the most non-threatening manner imaginable. It's akin to learning about duty and loyalty from watching &quot;Star Wars.&quot; The work takes the concept of &quot;the Devil's advocate&quot; to a whole new level. By a strange set of circumstances (covered in the book's Introduction/Forward), we are privy to private written correspondence from one devil to another devil on the finer points of directing their &quot;patient&quot; to think evil thoughts and to commit evil deeds.The concept of a little devil sitting on your shoulder is magnified by the dubious fiends whose ultimate goal is consume the souls of those they lead astray as though they were food. Lewis brings forth several ways of re-thinking how we think and addressing the real heart of the matter. The book is an easy read and is entertaining to boot. Lewis intended this work (as his other books such as &quot;The Narnia Chronicles&quot; and &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;) to be a fantasy that teaches, not a dramatized version of doctrine. Regardless of your background or your beliefs, the book's underlying themes concern the true nature of good an evil and how we use our will to apply good or evil onto those we care about and onto those we don't."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"&quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is the absolute best book I have ever read.

While still being the best book I have ever read, it is also one of the strangest. Screwtape, an experienced devil, teaches his nephew, Wormwood, how to win a soul over from the so-called &quot;Enemy&quot;, who is the Lord Jesus Christ. While he is doing this, he teaches the reader about the techniques that Satan uses to distract Christians away from God. Therefore, he is teaching us how to live better Christian lives and avoid giving in to temptations. He shows us through the example of his nephew, Wormwood, trying to win over a particular Englishmen. He tries to make him think that what he is doing is not sin. Even though, in the end, the man is not won over, we see how so many people go astray without even realizing it.

The first letter begins with Screwtape chiding Wormwood for allowing his &quot;patient&quot; to become a Christian.Lewis was given a fair amount of criticism when these letters first were published in the &quot;Guardian&quot; in the 1940's. Most of this criticism was from somewhat dense people who didn't realize Lewis was joking. They actually thought Lewis was trying to get people over to the Devil's side. Lewis' intent was just the opposite.I enjoyed the book, but found it somewhat scary. I am also a government bureaucrat and some of Screwtape's verbiage is very familiar to me!The best insight I gleaned from the book was one passage where Wormwood is complaining his &quot;patient&quot; is not committing any large, grandiose sins. Screwtape advises his nephew that it doesn't really matter how bad the sin is, only that it is a sin.

S. Lewis found a wonderfully entertaining way to advocate just the opposite: the appeal of a committed religious life. Lewis formulates several \\"spiritual laws\\" in the book. Here's a memorable one, taken from chapter six: When we find ourselves in the grip of a toxic emotion (for example, anger), we should attempt to be self-aware and to focus on the fact of our anger, rather than on the object of the anger (e.g., some other person). On the other hand, when we find ourselves under the sway of charitable feelings, we should try to do the opposite-- we should try to fix our attention outward, on the person who is the object of our positive feelings, ignoring the fact that we are feeling charitable, and striving NOT to be self-conscious. It is a simply stated law. But it goes so much against our natural inclinations that if we somehow managed to apply it consistently, it would be radically transformative. (Maybe that's just another way of saying that it is a true spiritual law.)"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"&quot;the safest road to Hell is the gradual one--the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.&quot; -ScrewtapeThe Screwtape Letters, originally published in The Guardian in 1941, is an epistolary novel in the form of Letters from the demon Screwtape to his nephew, the apprentice demon Wormwood. Each Letter is a beautifully crafted description of how the forces of evil seek to subvert good men and turn them away from Christianity. Take the following example:My dear Wormwood, So you &quot;have great hopes that the patient's religious phase is dying away,&quot; have you? I always thought the Training College had gone to pieces since they put old Slubgob at the head of it, and now I am sure. Has no one ever told you about the law of Undulation?Humans are amphibians--half spirit and half animal. (The Enemy's determination to produce such a revolting hybrid was one of the things that determined Our Father to withdraw his support from Him.) As spirits they belong to the eternal world, but as animals they inhabit time.This means that while their spirits can be directed to an eternal object, their bodies, passions, and imaginations are in continual change, for to be in time means to change. Their nearest approach to constancy, therefore, is undulation--the repeated return to a level from which they repeatedly fall back, a series of troughs and peaks.If you had watched your patient carefully, you would have seen this undulation in every department of his life--his interest in his work, his affection for his friends, his physical appetites, all go up and down. As long as he lives on earth, periods of emotional and bodily richness and liveliness will alternate with periods of numbness and poverty. The dryness and dullness through which your patient is now going are not, as you fondly suppose, your workmanship; they are merely a natural phenomenon which will do us no good unless you make a good use of it.To decide what the best use of it is, you must ask what use the Enemy wants to make of it, and then do the opposite.... in His efforts to get permanent possession of a soul, He relies on the troughs even more than on the peaks; some of His special favourites have gone through longer and deeper troughs than anyone else.The reason is this. To us a human is primarily food; our aim is the absorption of its will into ours, the increase of our own area of selfhood at its expense.But the obedience the Enemy demands of men is quite a different thing.... He really does want to fill the universe with a lot of loathsome little replicas of Himself--creatures whose life, on its miniature scale, will be qualitatively like His own, not because He has absorbed them but because their wills freely conform to His.We want cattle who can finally become food; He wants servants who can finally become sons. We want to suck in, He wants to give out. We are empty and would be filled; He is full and flows over. Our war aim is a world in which Our Father Below has drawn all other beings into himself: the Enemy wants a world full of beings united to Him but still distinct.And that is where the troughs come in.... Merely to override a human will (as His felt presence in any but the faintest and most mitigated degree would certainly do) would be for Him useless. He cannot ravish. He can only woo....Now obviously I like that because it jibes with my view of the Human Dilemma. Even better is this, from Lewis's Introduction:I live in the Managerial Age, in a world of &quot;Admin.&quot; The greatest evil is not now done in those sordid &quot;dens of crime&quot; that Dickens loved to paint. It is not done even in concentration camps and labour camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice. Hence naturally enough, my symbol for Hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the offices of a thoroughly nasty business concern.This metaphor, of course, proved to be more prescient than even Lewis could have forseen. For as the Letters were being published, bureaucrats in Berlin and Moscow were exterminating humans by the millions and the Depression and the War would give rise to increasing huge and intrusive Welfare State bureaucracies, bent on destroying Religion, Family, Community, any institution which could rival the power of the State. All the while, and ever so gradually, citizens were willingly ceding more and more of their autonomy (their hard won Free Will), as we slid into the modern Liberal godless Hell.To read Lewis now is to realize that things could have been different; that a few voices, crying in the wilderness, warned of the authoritarian netherworld that Western man exiled himself to for much of this Century as he abandoned God and Christianity in favor of the State and statism. We are now in the midst of a twilight struggle that will decide whether we retain sufficient confidence in our ultimate godliness to reclaim our freedom from the grasp of the State, or whether Western man's crisis of confidence will lead us back to the Garden of Eden, with our needs taken care of and our souls extinguished.There is no better way to gird yourself for the battle than to read this book.Grade: A+"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"&quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is one of the more bizzare and popular books in C.S. Lewis' long list of literary accomplishments, but for those of you who don't know the book's premise, it's a simple one. A demon experienced in the art of temptation who calls himself Screwtape corresponds with his up and coming nephew, an apprentice minion named Wormwood.If this sounds a bit strange to some of you folks, rest assured, it is. But don't give up just yet. Lewis puts together a quick and witty story of the fragile human will and the devils who seek to destroy us. He mentions temptations of sex, of vanity, of money, and pride to name just a few.The book also gives insight into the motivation of hell's corruptors.Fear.A simple and effective tool used by who the reader naturally assumes is Lucifer(he's mentioned by Screwtape as &quot;Our Father&quot; and there's reference to the conflict between him and God a.k.a &quot;The Enemy&quot;)as an encouragement or motivation for each demon to work. There are no failures of corruption allowed. Ever.I guess the best way to describe this book would be as a &quot;tap on your moral shoulder.&quot; Lewis believes that the world is destroying itself(there's no coincidence in the book's print timing-during the second World War)and that a slip in conscience warrants the blame. He goes out of his way to warn readers against selfish and superficial acts, and expertly weaves in an entertaining collection of narratives along the way."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This is a fun light read that serves a different purpose whether coming from inside of or outside of the mythology.From outside of the mythology, it gives an intriguing look into the mind of the genuinely deeply religious, and how they construct their reality. The reader gets to see the world through the eyes of people who believe in daemons and gods and angels and all the rest, specifically people of a Christian persuasion.Basically you have a story where the god of ultimate good and the god of ultimate evil are fighting over the loyalty of an ordinary joe. Since this fellow can never be as good as the god of ultimate good, if he conducts himself as a normal rational being then that means that he is automatically loyal to the god of ultimate evil. So, all that he has to do is *believe* the story, and if he truly believes in his heart of hearts then of course he will be loyal to the god of ultimate good. So, as you have probably surmised, the reader gets to identify with the ordinary joe and be loyal to the god of ultimate good, confounding the rotten god of ultimate evil, simply by *believing*.It's a bit like the book Peter Pan. All babies can fly and speak to fairies, until one day they get too old and practical and forget. But when tinkerbell gets injured, you...*you reader* can save her life by clapping your hands.As the book continues, it quickly turns into a discussion on how to believe and how not to believe. The reader learns to be wary of believing in and being loyal to imagined gods of his own construction (the irony is apparently lost on C S Lewis), and we learn all kinds of things about how not to let his (and the reader's) belief falter.It's a short book, but despite that, I found my attention already beginning to waver at around the 40% mark. I think that's about where I left the bookmark when I was first given the book by a Christian years ago. This is about where the novelty factor drops off. Coming back to it I was able to press on and ride the book to it's conclusion. If rating the book purely on entertainment value, I'd probably drop a star, but as a resource for finding out what theologians considered intelligent and reputable by both moderate and extremist Christians are saying, it's a valuable resource, so I split the difference at 4 stars.While I'd declare it light and not terribly challenging, I can perhaps see how someone who sees the book as a representation of reality, no matter how liberally applied, could get wrapped up in maintaining the standards of belief described by the book, and find it to be driving them even deeper into the fantastic world described. Also, it's much better than the The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe series, my review of which is also available on amazon."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"C.S.

C.S. Lewis subverts every cliche concerning demons and gives us Screwtape: the most unpleasant character in all fiction.So unlike the charming Mephistopheles of Goethe or the brave Lucifer of Milton, Screwtape is a dour, joyless misanthrope with not even the driest hint of humor. The only quality that he has in common with other literary demons is his cleverness, but even this is often thwarted by an overweening cynicism that denies even the possibility of love and kindness in others.I came away from this book with a grudging admiration for Lewis' insight into human nature and a bewilderment over his religious convictions.

It's a humorous tale of an experienced devil (Screwtape) and his inexperienced nephew (Wormwood), who are trying to secure the damnation of a young man. Fortunately, they fail.The book is a series of letters from Screwtape to Wormwood, telling him how to tempt the young man (e.g. by appealing to his pride, by confusing him, through sexual temptation, etc.) God is referred to as \\"The Enemy\\" and the devil is referred to as \\"Our Father Below,\\" so the reader must interpret what is called good as bad and bad as good, since it's from the perspective of the devil.For instance, at one point, Screwtape notes, \\"To us a human is primarily food; our aim is the absorption of its will into ours, the increase of our own area of selfhood at its expense. But the obedience which the Enemy demands of men is quite a different thing. One must face the fact that all the talk about His love for men, and His service being perfect freedom, is not (as one would gladly believe) mere propaganda, but an appalling truth. He really does want to fill the universe with a lot of loathsome little replicas of Himself...We want cattle who can finally become food; He wants servants who can finally become sons.\\"It's a thought-provoking book that forces you to take a look at your own life and determine whether you are living it in the way God intended."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"In the preface to Lewis' final appearance of Screwtape, Screwtape Proposes a Toast, the author provides a terrific description of what his previous involvements with Screwtape included. Referring to his time authoring The Screwtape Letters, Lewis states \\"The world into which I had to project myself while I spoke through Screwtape was all dust, grit, thirst and itch...It almost smothered me before I was done. It would have smothered my readers if I had prolonged it.\\" After reading this work, it is plausible that many would see the truth in these statements.As humans, it is relatively easy to recognize when one is acting, thinking, or living inappropriately. This might be true because of the concept of the human conscience. Lewis, however, brings a new perspective to the human conscience while offering the idea that it is driven by purposeful direction guided by the influences of good and evil. Although, in this particular work, the words good and evil might be more subjective than one is accustomed to.Reading this work is a rare opportunity to reflect upon the choices made by each individual as life is lived through the means of a brilliant author speaking as a diabolical fiend. The idea of reading the letters of one tempter to his apprentice seems reminiscent of childish fantasy. Quite to the contrary, this work is powerful on level after level and certainly intended for mature minds. This work is yet another masterpiece in Lewis' collection and, if fully appreciated, has the potential to change lives."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Some books can only be read once and then forever forgotten.

Is a simple yet captivating book in which Screwtape attempts to accomplishes his goal through an exchange of letters focusing on a young British man, deemed \\"The Patient\\" as their subject. Screwtape Letters as ironic as it is, acts as a very informative testimony of our sinful desires; how we are tempted to commit sin, or to run away from God. Lewis' purpose of writing from the perspective of the devil is to struck awareness within the reader's that will lead to change. In other words, as Screwtape is telling Wormwood what to do, he is also telling us what not to do.The back story behind the letters is that of a seemingly normal young Englishman in the 1930s and 1940s who becomes a Christian, struggles to maintain, sustain, and cultivate his young faith, falls in love, serves in the home guard during the war, and eventually learns to throw off demonic influence altogether. Over all the story results in failure for the young demon, Wormwood, who is assigned to the young man. However the \\"patient\\" proves to not be the main character, neither is Wormwood. Screwtape's letters addressing Wormwood's attempts to cause the protagonist to stumble in his faith are merely a catalyst for Lewis to play devil's advocate, and through that role, to make it clearly seen how demons can play with the modern human heart with relative ease. Besides advising Wormwood to use all of the young man's fallacies to their advantage, Screw tape also advocates the use of new cultural ideas, such as the de-feminization of women in the 1930s and the loss of fixed concepts of truth. Needless to say, the devils appeals to the human soul through worldly attractions and mankind's inherent selfishness.C.S. Lewis, a master at insight into human nature and even more so in discerning the ways of the devils. Born in Ireland with a natural talent towards storytelling. Lewis was raised in the Church of Ireland, while putting on a facade of belief, he became an agnostic, regarding all religious belief as superstitious nonsense. Lewis possessed a unique insight into the human character. He also become possessed of a strong faith in God during his thirties. It was during WW2 that C.S. Lewis began to write Mere Christianity another famous book in which C.S. Lewis provides an insightful view in to the world of Christianity. Lewis wrote this book almost as a mock guide on how to live life, in attempts to teach a lesson through a backwards system and really forcing the reader to think and reflect upon their own life and to expose the ways of devils in relation to man.Lewis creates a theologically challenging and issue raising situation through the exchange of letters, instructional in nature, between Screwtape and Wormwood. Through Screwtape's letters Lewis provides a sometimes frightening window into the human mind. For instance, he describes an interaction between the man and his mother, while they are each annoyed with each other. He manages to pinpoint exactly how each feels he or she is right, when neither really are. He explains to Wormwood how he can use his influence to reinforce the nature of pride and rightness in the man, and in turn drive an even larger wedge between him and his mother. As the book continues, we soon begin to get a clearer and clearer picture of this man. It becomes clearer and clearer that he could be any one of us. Many traits in which the man possesses I saw in myself. And in Screwtape's instructions to Wormwood, I saw many of my own failings. I saw where I had focused on myself while creating an illusion of worshiping God. I saw my own shortcomings, and the wedges I brought upon myself, driven in between relations with my loved ones.Through a conversational almost didactic tone, and are easy to follow taken separately. Told as simple back and forth banter between an elder and his lower subordinate Lewis is able to deliver a deep insightful story about human nature with Screwtape's letters.Lewis' insight and understanding of the human mind alongside unique usage of letters , allows The Screwtape Letters to accomplish its' purpose. Forcing readers to think in retrospection about their own lives, making the shortcomings of men known, and showing just how easy and influential the devil can be in our everyday lives. I highly recommend this book to everyone, regardless of their religion and what their personal beliefs may be, this book still contains immense value. Whether you are Atheist, Muslim, or devout Christian this book provides a character lesson in which we all can learn from."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Everyone touts the Narnia series as Lewis' best work, particularly since it has been transcribed into an extemely sucessful film series. However, Screwtape is a far more original concept. The point of view, one side of the corespondence going between a fallen angel and his demonic mentor, is so unusual, that it quickly becomes compelling reading for anyone, regardless of your spiritual inclinations. The fact that we are only able to view Screwtape's letters, and are unable to see Wormwood's written responses, only makes the story more fascinating, allowing the reader to really use their imagination to fill in the gaps.It is one of the amazing books like, \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", where you wonder if it will ever be made into a feature film. It is such an amazing book, my own feeling is that a film could never do it justice.The is the best and most expensive current edition of the book, and it is great for collectors: however, you can probably pick up a used paperback copy for less than $5 ( I paid $2). The John Cleese audio book edition is nice, but the best \\"unorthodox\\" edition of Screwtape is the graphic full-color novel put out by Marvel Comics in 1994. It boasts very creative comic book interpretations of the wild images from the novel."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"A delightful philosophical, moral and social analysis that still resonates sopowerfully in 2012 that it confounds the fantasy of human progress. Even though a monologue it evoked comparisons to the style of platonic dialogues, or even Thus Spake Zarathustra. The content echoed Machiavelli in presenting a detailed manual for the manipulation of weak humans to the ends of others. Each letter skewered some social habit or tendency that drifted into evil. The overwhelmingly common and mundane nature of evil (i.e. doing deliberate harm) is instructive in a world where the word is rarely used at all even for the most vile of human acts. Still stands as a wonderfully effective moral primer after so many decades."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The book The Screwtape Letters from author C.S. Lewis is a great novel for anybody at all interested in the subject of morality and the theme of good vs. evil. It's a novel comprised of fictitious letters written from one demon (Screwtape) to his demon nephew (Wormwood). Throughout the entire novel, Screwtape instructs Wormwood on how to best tempt and eventually lead astray a human that Wormwood is responsible for. The human is a convert to the Christian faith and keeps his faith throughout the novel, despite the demons' best efforts.It is interesting to note that the demons have a perfect knowledge of truth and what is right or wrong. They know what brings peace and happiness to people, though they still choose to bring misery to the lives of their patients. They know of their powerlessness next to God so they try at all costs to keep the patient away from things relating to religion. One of the more noteworthy quotes from Screwtape to his nephew states, \\"Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one; the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.\\"Though the letters seem to become redundant as Wormwood attempts to lead his human patient astray, I think C.S. Lewis makes a point that evil never gives up. It will do anything in its power to achieve its goals, and the book illustrates all of the different tactics that the forces of evil incorporate.Although the novel coincides with Christian theology, it accurately exposes source of the thoughts and actions of all people, regardless of one's philosophical beliefs. Through the demon's unrelenting efforts to fill the patient's life with evil, the reader gains knowledge of good things with which evil cannot coexist. It was a very unique lens through which to view humanity's moral dilemma. It was a very unique lens through which to view humanity's moral dilemma. I would recommend this book to absolutely anybody, religious or otherwise, as a way to learn about truth and lie as well as good and evil."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"The Screwtape Letters by C. S. Lewis (1898 -1963), published 1942This is an entertaining piece of satire full of meaningful lessons on God and the work of the devil. It is in the form of 31 letters by Screwtape, a worldly-wise assistant to \\"Our Father Below,\\" written to his demon nephew Wormwood, a novice in the art of securing the damnation of an ordinary young man, new to Christianity. Lewis had commented on a couple errors that people make in regard to devils: \\"One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them.\\" This great book delves further into the subject and I have liberally quoted from it.Screwtape: \\"Jargon, not argument, is the devil's best ally in keeping people from the Church. Don't let him think of doctrines as \`true' or \`false' but as \`academic' or \`practical', \`outworn' or \`contemporary,' etc. Draw attention away from universal issues and focus instead on \\"the stream of immediate sense experiences.\\" Call it \\"real life\\" and don't let him ask what is meant by \\"real.\\"Later in the book, he suggests that the word \\"phase\\" is a good one to nurture in feeling superior and patronizing, as with one's former \`religious phase.'Screwtape: \\"Thanks to the processes which we set at work in them centuries ago, they find it all but impossible to believe in the unfamiliar while the familiar is before their eyes. Keep pressing home... the ordinariness of things. Above all, do not attempt to use science... as a defense against Christianity. They will positively encourage him to think about realities he can't touch and see.\\" Lewis recognizes that the real sciences, like physics rather than sociology, indicate an intricate and phenomenal world beyond complete understanding.Screwtape: \\"One of our great allies at present is the Church itself.\\" Lewis suggests that attitudes within church experience can do much to learn self-righteousness, superficial and misdirected prayer, and a focus on feelings. Screwtape is absolutely frightened should anyone consciously direct prayers: \\"Not to what I think thou art but to what thou knowest thyself to be,\\" Once a man discards his subjective thoughts and images and \\"thrusts himself to the completely real, external, invisible Presence, there with him in the room and never knowable by him as he is known by it - why, then it is that the incalculable may occur.\\" Screwtape then suggests that avoiding this situation \\"will be helped by the fact that the humans themselves do not desire it as much as they suppose. There's such a thing as getting more than they bargained for!\\"As this was written during the early days of WW II, Screwtape counsels Wormwood on the value of making the \`patient' either an extreme patriot or an ardent pacifist. In the business of \\"undermining faith and preventing the formation of values\\" either extreme is beneficial to Screwtape's cause. \\"All extremes, except extreme devotion to the Enemy, are to be encouraged.\\" Screwtape's enemy, of course, is God.Screwtape promotes suspense and anxiety as a means of \\"barricading a human's mind\\" against God. And while God \\"wants men to be concerned with what they do\\" Screwtape's business is to \\"keep them thinking about what will happen to them.\\"Screwtape says some important things regarding war, with application in the 21st century: \\"Let him begin by treating Patriotism or the Pacifism as a part of his religion. Then let him, under the influence of partisan spirit, come to regard it as the most important part.\\" Religion then becomes, \\"merely part of the cause, in which Christianity is valued chiefly because of the excellent arguments it can produce\\" in favor of either supporting the war or pacifism. \\"The attitude you want to guard against is that in which temporal affairs are treated primarily as material for obedience. Once you have made the World an end, and faith a means, you have almost won your man, and it makes very little difference what kind of worldly end he is pursuing.\\" Lewis shows a very funny side to this seriousness: \\"Provided that meetings, pamphlets, policies, movements, causes, and crusades, matter more to him than prayers and sacraments and charity, he is ours - and the more \`religious' (on those terms) the more securely ours. I could show you a pretty cage-full down here.\\" I was struck by the idea that all temporal affairs are merely raw material for obedience.More humor from Screwtape: \\"to us a human is primarily food; our aim is the absorption of its will into ours, the increase of our own area of selfhood at its expense.\\" But God's demands of obedience are \\"quite a different thing. One must face the fact that all the talk about His love for men, and His service being perfect freedom is... an appalling truth. He really does want to fill the universe with a lot of loathsome replicas of Himself - creatures whose life, on its miniature scale, will be qualitatively like His own, not because He has absorbed them but because their wills freely conform to His.\\" God wants a world full of beings united to Him but still distinct; to be one with Him, yet themselves. And He does this by wooing, not by ravishing or by overriding human will.Screwtape likes the idea that God \\"cannot \`tempt' to virtue as we (devils) do to vice... \\"Our cause is never more in danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending to do our Enemy's will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.\\"On the subject of sex, Lewis says that God made all the pleasures! Screwtape says, OFB and all his little devils haven't produced one pleasure. \\"All we can do is to encourage the humans to take the pleasures... at times, or in ways, or in degrees, which He has forbidden... An ever increasing craving for an ever diminishing pleasure is the formula.\\"Screwtape comments on the sort of people he wants the patient to know: \\"... rich, smart, superficially intellectual, and brightly skeptical about everything in the world.\\" Oh! It sounds like most of the people I know (save a very few). It sounds like who I might be (except for the rich, smart and intellectual part.)Screwtape says that should the patient recognize the true nature of his \`friends' he can be induced to live \\"two parallel lives... a different man in each of the circles he frequents... He can be made to take positive pleasure in the perception that the two sides of his life are inconsistent\\" Yep, I recognize this; it's my vanity.Lewis criticizes modern Christian writings. There are, \\"few of the old warnings about Worldly Vanities, the Choice of Friends, and the Value of Time.\\" Such teachings would be labeled \\"Puritanism,\\" a word Screwtape sees as \\"one of the really solid triumphs of the past hundred years\\" for what it has come to mean rather than what it is. To me, labeling a position \\"intolerant\\" seems to be the modern version of creating automatic dismissal of any conscious discriminating thinking.Screwtape: \\"Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one... the only thing that matters is the extent to which you separate the man from the Enemy. It does not matter how small the sins are provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man... into nothing.\\" Screwtape wants to hear upon a human's arrival in Hell: \\"I now see that I spent most of my life in doing neither what I ought nor what I liked.\\" Regarding doing what one likes, Screwtape notes that someone shouldn't read a book for enjoyment but rather to make clever remarks to his friends!Screwtape: \\"... damn your patient by the World, that is by palming off vanity, bustle, irony, and expensive tedium as pleasures.\\"Screwtape: \\"All virtues are less formidable to us once the man is aware he has them, but this is especially true of humility.\\" In other words, taking pride in ones great humility! God wants man to be in a state of mind where he recognizes his talents but also that he can \\"rejoice in his own talents as frankly and gratefully as in his neighbor's talents - or in a sunrise, an elephant, or a waterfall... to be able to recognize all creatures (even himself) as glorious and excellent things.\\"Lewis offers a doctrine of God on the subject of pride: That humans \\"did not create themselves, that their talents were given to them, and that they might as well be proud of the color of their hair.\\"Humans live in \`time' but God destines them to eternity. God therefore wants humankind to attend to the \`present' and to \`eternity', i.e. Him. The \`past' is history; it is \\"frozen and no longer flows\\" while the future is full hope, worry, fear and unrealities. The present is \\"lit up with eternal rays.\\" And the only way we can affect the future is by our actions today, one moment at a time. Right thinking would lead man to be \\"aware that horrors may be in store for him and is praying for the virtues, wherewith to meet them, and meanwhile concerning himself with the Present because there, and there alone, all duty, all grace, all knowledge and all pleasure dwell.\\" My words: The past is history, the future mystery, the present is the \`now' where we live.Screwtape talks about encouraging the patient in searching for a \\"suitable\\" church; man as \\"critic\\" rather than \\"pupil.\\"Lewis's discussion on the gluttony was interesting since it was about the gluttony of \\"delicacy\\" rather than the gluttony of \\"excess.\\"Screwtape's \\"best weapon--the belief of ignorant humans, that there is no hope of getting rid of us except by yielding.\\"\\"Men are not angered by mere misfortune but by misfortune conceived as injury.\\" An ill-tempered manner is the consequence of a growing resentment regarding so-called \`legitimate' claims denied. Screwtape encourages the zealous guarding of a personal birthright--\\"my time is my own.\\" However, man \\"can neither make, nor retain, one moment of time; it all comes to him by pure gift; he might as well regard the sun and moon as his chattels.\\" Lewis comments that references to what is \`mine' (my wife, my boots, my dog, my God) will ultimately be settled--our time, our souls, our bodies do not belong to us--since God made it all, we belong to him. Ayn Rand had a very different view. Hmmm.Lewis has an interesting perspective on \`noise' and Heaven is defined as \\"the regions where there is only life and therefore all that is not music is silence.\\" Nice phrasing.The search for the \\"historical Jesus\\" is to be encouraged, according to Screwtape! We thus get bogged down in theory about the documents or the missing documents instead of thinking about who He is and what He did! I think I know what Lewis would say about The De Vinci Code and the Jesus Seminar.Re: using Christianity as a means--even to social justice--won't work. For God \\"will not be used as a convenience. Men or nations who think they can revive the Faith in order to make a good society might just as well think they can use the stairs of Heaven as a short cut to the nearest chemist's shop.\\"Screwtape: \\"The horror of the Same Old Thing is one of the most valuable passions we have produced in the human heart.\\" The demand for novelty, fashion, what is in vogue, for \`change' is ST's solution. The relevant questions of God are: Is it righteous? Is it prudent? Is it possible?I love this one: \\"She's the sort of woman who lives for others--you can always tell the others by their hunted expression.\\"\\"Prosperity knits a man to the world. He feels that he is finding his place in it, while really it is finding its place in him.\\"To God, \\"human birth is important chiefly as the qualification for human death, and death solely as the gate\\" to another kind of life. That kind of puts it in perspective.One of God's motives for creating a dangerous world: It is then \\"a world in which moral issues really come to the point... A chastity or honesty, or mercy, which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions.

It is a rather quick read, but one could definitely read it slowly and let the message sink down into their innermost being. This is one of those kind of books - one that will (if allowed) sink into the innermost being of the reader because it exposes cons that demons and the Devil use (which a lot of us do seemingly unknowingly).This is a great book, and I highly recommend that you buy it, read it and share it with your friends!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"I read \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" for the first time when I was in high school many years ago, and I finally got around to rereading it. And I appreciated it just as much this time. I have read many of Lewis' books, and I enjoy almost everything that I've read, but this one ranks near the very top.Though at first glance it would appear otherwise, I would suggest that this book is not ultimately about demons. Instead, I think that this book is primarily about the complexities of human nature. The basic premise is ingenious, a series of letters of castigation, critique, and \\"encouragement\\" to a novice demon (Wormwood) from his experienced, accomplished uncle (Screwtape). Under the guise of this imagined correspondence, Lewis takes aim at a host of foibles and vulnerabilities of humanity. He tackles countless issues including war, friendship, marriage, sex, pride, idleness, vanity and many others, revealing our propensity for foolishness and sin from the inverted perspective of hell. And through it all, the reader cannot help but understand the power of temptation and the power of God to withstand those temptations in completely fresh and eye-opening ways.To be sure, this book isn't an easy read, because it requires a completely different and upside-down vocabulary. Good is bad, bad is good, the Enemy is God, Father is Satan, wickedness is victory, and commitment to God is abject failure. But once I settled into that framework, the book is very accessible and utterly fascinating. Most importantly, Lewis offers poignant and challenging insight into the human condition that warrants significant reflection. This isn't the sort of book that offers one or two simple take-away messages, but I feel that I now have a fresh and more articulate understanding of why we sin and how God offers us an escape from the clutches of sin. This book probably deserves to be reread every several years, so I look forward to the next time I tackle it. And I am happy to recommend it to anyone interested in an intriguing and stimulating analysis of what it means to live as fallen creatures who are deeply loved by God, in light of the destructive designs of the Evil One."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"It doesn't get better then this book. It's an excellent book for current times. America needs to read this book."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Where there is temptation, there is also triumph over it. In The Screwtape Letters, C. S. Lewis masterfully presents the struggle between good and evil as he depicts Screwtape, the seasoned old devil, writing letters of instruction to his inexperienced demon nephew, Wormwood. The characters come to life in one's imagination: a Grinch-like old devil licking the tip of his feathered pen before dipping it into the ink to scrawl yet another word of evil encouragement to an immature imp, who is often scolded for his poor results, thinking highly of himself as he attempts to carry out his commander's orders and become an accomplished devil.C.S. Lewis'writing style, steeped in theology, is very complex at times with sentences that become paragraphs and that are sometimes difficult to comprehend. The book is also filled with humor during this conflict to weaken the faith of the \\"man.\\" Lewis opens the reader to the world of spiritual warfare that every Christian encounters. The reader can relate to trials that the man has confronted.The book is a must read for the spiritual truths that it contains and the brilliant way it is presented. It will challenge oneself in the way he or she thinks about temptation and evil. The book was compelling in exposing evil through attempts to misguide by deception. C.S. Lewis had become well known for his writings of children's literature, fantasy, and popular theology books. The Screwtape Letter's are faith based and contain examples of good versus evil in a fantasy setting. It clearly depicts spiritual warfare on a daily basis in everyday life. It is truly an unforgettable book that spoke to me in many ways, one I will never forget.The publisher is Zondervan Publishing House. The copyright of The Screwtape Letters was published in 1942. ISBN # 0060652934.

In O'Reilly times, serious-minded newcomers to System Administration have been able to quickly and usefully equip themselves with a wide range of tried and tested admin (and utility-gadget) scripts from celebrated titles like _UNIX_PowerTools_, etc.Over the course of win32/win64 evolution, MS eventually gave SysAdmins a real command-line interface, an assortment of command-line admin tools and the ever whiz-bangy WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) interface. Very, very recently, MS has even begun to pull together the many pieceparts of MS-authored admin (and utility) scripts into downloadable Scripting Guides and the MS Script Center Repository. While these last efforts are all well and good, (no matter how late they are being brought to the table,) there are still too many things, scripted, that are missing in action in MS-land.In this powerful, yet underserved, context, Robbie Allen's _Windows_Server_Cookbook_for_Windows_Server_2003_and_Windows_2000 (along with his equally impressive earlier effort, _ActiveDirectory_Cookbook_) is a very happy development. In _Windows_Server_Cookbook_, not only does Allen arm Windows SysAdmins with more than 500 genuinely useful, pre-rolled scripts, he *also* goes over the equivalent tools/steps in the Windows Graphical User Interface *and* even provides references to many powerful, specialized and (mostly) free tools that are to be had from the very good folks at SysInternals/WinInternals.(Now, if only O'Reilly can find some equally good folks to kick out a _MS_SQL_Cookbook_...)"},{"Title":"Windows Server Cookbook for Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2000","review":"Does the complexity of a program ever decrease?

He was one of those Englishmen who are happiest when living far away from the comforts of modern life in dangerous surroundings with seemingly \\"primitive\\" people. Following many years living with the Bedu of the Empty Quarter, Thesiger traveled to Iraq to immerse himself in the life and culture of the Marsh Arabs.What he found was a fusion of Arabic/islamic culture into a older life style which had existed for well over three thousand years, hunting and gathering within the Marshes which form the end of the Tigris and Euphrates river systems. What he found was a culture which was rich in protocols and customs, no less advanced than that of modern man, but rather a culture superbly adapted to the life within the marshes, a culture whose key feature of hospitality which is seemingly lacking from our modern life.And ultimately he finds the tragedy of a society which in the short term was being subsumed by western value and greed for possessions and which would ultimately be destroyed by a dictatorial government who would drain the Marshes in retribution for the locals support of an attempted coup."},{"Title":"Marsh Arabs","review":"Thesiger's account of his visits to the marshlands in the 1950s and early 1960s, though perhaps not as well written as his crossing of the empty quarter or Gavin Maxwell's own account of the Iraqi marshlands, still remains a classic of modern exploration literature. His presage about what would soon happen to the marshes and their inhabitants is haunting, for as Nik Wheeler (photographer in Gavin Young's \\"Return to the Marshes\\") recently wrote in my \\"Wetlands of Mass Destruction: Ancient Presage for Contemporary Ecocide in Southern Iraq\\": \\"Wilfred Thesiger was unfortunately quite prescient when he wrote in the mid-sixties that 'Recent political upheavals in Iraq have closed this area to visitors. Soon the Marshes will probably be drained; when this happens, a way of life that has lasted for thousands of years will disappear.'\\" And tragically, it has."},{"Title":"Marsh Arabs","review":"Wilfred Thesiger led a remarkable life, and through his books has bequeathed an important legacy- the documentation of ways of life that are gone forever. His book, \\"Arabian Sands,\\" which describes his two crossings of the Rub al Khali (The Empty Quarter) in the late \`40's is more famous, but this book, which documents his time with the Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq, from 1951 to 1958 should command equal attention and respect. In terms of explorers, he is unique as the \\"Lone Ranger,\\" traveling without Western colleagues, relying almost exclusively on the inhabitants of the remote and often desolate areas he chooses to explore. Whereas \\"Arabian Sands\\" details two epic journeys, in \\"The Marsh Arabs\\" Thesiger lives with the native inhabitants in their unique environment, and develops relationships which span the better part of a decade. While he is meticulous in describing the conditions of the natives, only occasionally does he reveal his true motives for such a life. An exception appears in \\"The Marsh Arabs\\": \\"My own tastes went, perhaps, too far to the other extreme. I loathed cars, aeroplanes, wireless and television, in fact most of our civilization's manifestations in the past fifty years, and was always happy, in Iraq or elsewhere, to share a smoke-filled hovel with a shepherd, his family and beasts. In such a household, everything was strange and different, their self-reliance put me at ease, and I was fascinated by the feeling of continuity with the past.\\"As Thesiger elsewhere states, he was probably the first (and sadly, the last) outsider with both the inclination and opportunity to live among the Madan (the natives of the Marshes), as one of them, before Saddam Hussein irrevocably ended their way of life by draining the marshes as a grand reprisal for an attempted revolt. Their way of life had been largely unchanged since the fifth millennium B.C. In another chapter on the historical background he states: \\"Other races too, had invaded Iraq during the same two thousand years.\\" He did not live long enough to add to his list... \\"and the Americans and their so-called coalition..\\" One would think that the book would be more widely circulated today for that reason, and the fact that Thesiger \\"does nuance.\\"Thesiger states that he is not a specialist in any given area, and therefore can, in my opinion, convey the life of the people of the marshes in a more genuine way. He gained the initial trust of the inhabitants in the most unlikely way - although not a trained doctor, he safely performed circumcisions on the adolescent boys. He also carried a bag of medicines that he could properly administer, much to the gratitude of the natives. By sharing their hardships, way of life, and mastering the language, he further ingratiated himself with them. He documents an Islam that is anything but monolithic in its beliefs. He states that in Southern Iraq far more pilgrims had been to Meshed (in Iran, where the shrine of Imam Ali Ar Ridha, the eight Imam, is located, gaining the honorific \\"Zair.\\" As a non-Muslim I was denied admission to the shrine, and I suppose the honorific, in 1971.) Furthermore, he makes the interesting point that the Hazaras of Central Afghanistan do not earn an honorific for the pilgrimage to Meshad, but do for going to Karbala in Iraq, and the reverse is true for the Shia of Iraq. As Thesiger states: \\"It appears to be a question of distance.\\"Thesiger describes family life, the tribal feuds, and the dependence of the agricultural economy on the annual floods, with the winners and losers, depending on the height of the floods. There are (dangerous) wild boar hunts. He describes the \\"mustarjil\\" who are born a woman, \\"...but she has the heart of a man, so she lives like a man.\\"The book contains numerous extraordinary black and white photos whose uniqueness and quality exceed the ones in \\"Arabian Sands.\\" Of particular interest are the ones of the \\"mudhif,\\" a large community structure build entirely of reeds, which can be disassembled and moved. The \\"Gail at Hama\\" (#41), and \\"In the Heart of the Marshes\\" (#27) are also brilliant.Thesiger's perspective was partially formed at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford, and his \\"fading days of the British Empire\\" attitude mars an otherwise excellent account. For example, he travels with a \\"young Kurdish servant\\" from Kurdistan, and is given to blanket assertions like \\"All Arabs are snobs\\" (p 52). He shows particular affection for his \\"canoe boys,\\" which is reflected in numerous pictures.Overall though, an extraordinary feat, and a solid book that should be read by all who now have an interest in Iraq."},{"Title":"Marsh Arabs","review":"Having lived in Arabia for many many years, I was fortunate to be in the area before Saddam wiped the Marsh Arab culture out. Thesiger took beautiful photographs and wrote wonderful stories of these people. All I have is his books and one of their hand-woven fish baskets -- they would send fish to our local markets in them. How sad this world is that few even know this culture existed...and, really, such a short time in the past."},{"Title":"Marsh Arabs","review":"An excellent read; the writing style is both descriptive and engaging, and the story itself fascinating. The book includes over a hundred photographic plates which augment the story tremendously, especially for the amazing reed mudhifs which are frequently the setting. (The photos and more can be found in the Pitt Rivers Museum collection).I have not yet read Arabian Sands but reviews of that earlier work complained about Thesiger's primitivism and romanticization of the Bedouin - I didn't see much of that in this book, only shades, and overall the telling is fairly forthright and balanced. Clearly Thesiger is no fan of modernization, but relative to the conditions in more urban Iraq at the time, there are no clear \\"rights\\" or \\"wrongs\\" on this position. In any event, it doesn't get in the way of the narrative, which captures a disappearing culture in rich depth and perspective."},{"Title":"Marsh Arabs","review":"Thesiger is my personal favorite when it comes to travel/exploration etc. writing.

While there is no arguing the excellence of that book, \\"The Marsh Arabs\\" is also an outstanding work of travel writing. It may be as wild or adventurous as \\"Arabian Sands\\" (that would be hard to top), but I actually enjoyed reading this one more. To me, it gave a better insight into the lives of the local people that Thesiger met. Thesiger travelled by canoe through the marshes of Southern Iraq as he methodically dispensed medicine to villagers, and performed a mind-numbing number of circumcisions (yes, even though he wasn't a doctor, Thesiger was surprisingly prolific at this operation), or shooting crocodiles, wild boar, and other wild animals that posed a threat to him and his companions. Remarkably, Thesiger seemed unfazed by the dangers and discomforts surrounding him. He was truly the last of a generation of intrepid travelers. This book is a fascinating and valuable account of an amazing part of the world that has been irreparably changed over the years. Armchair travelers can read about Thesiger's adventures thanks to books like this, and we gain an added appreciation of those travels and the people he encountered thanks to the many stunning Black & White photos that illustrate the books."},{"Title":"Marsh Arabs","review":"I first discovered that there was a man named Wilfred Thesiger one day in 1967 when I was browsing through the shelves of the English library near the Royal Moroccan Naval Academy.

Some of my American associates teased me about certain photos in the book, which are not in the American edition, although one of them is on the cover of the French edition. Some years passed, and I wrote to Thesiger. I received two letters from him, both nearly indecipherable. I had to stare for two hours at one letter before I could understand even one word written in his impossible handwriting. When I read The Marsh Arabs, the society which it described was still flourishing, I think, but not for long.

Whilst the models in this book are for the most part very adept in their asana practice, some of the asanas translate very well for the over 50 year old that has not had much exposure to yoga. The triangle is a nice example of this and the standing twist with one foot on the chair.I think the book is an inspiration for student who is open minded. Many of my senior students laughed when I showed them some of the poses in the book saying \\"I can't do that\\". Yet in that same class they did do some of the asanas,and with integrity too.This was a great psychological boost for them. We are never too old to learn new things, only too old in the habits we have cultivated. An added bonus was seeing British actor Terence Stamp in some of the photos.

GB: Answers to Questions about Gay and Lesbian People (Plugged In)","review":"Eric Marcus has written this wonderful book for middle and early high school kids about homosexuality. Written in a question and answer format in larger print, this book tells the TRUTH to kids who might be questioning their sexuality, or might have a gay friend or family member, or are bigoted about gays. For older kids and adults, read Eric's book, &quot;Is It a Choice?&quot; It covers the same territory but in greater depth.Homosexuality is usually not discussed at a middle school level, although children can sense sexual identity differences at this age between themselves and others. This often leads to shunning, confusion, prejudice, bullying, harassment and beatings. Some gay kids even have urine and feces thrown at them or are spit upon. If you condone or excuse this behavior you become part of the problem of gay harassment and hateful behavior.The best way to avoid negative, bigoted behavior toward gays is to be proactive: buy this book for your child, your church, school, and home library. Homosexuality is a normal, natural expression of human sexuality. Let's take the lid off the pressure cooker of bigotry and become lesbigay advocates for all children everywhere. All straight, gay and questioning kids need this book's truth desperately. I highly recommend it as an educator and Lutheran church librarian."},{"Title":"What if Someone I Know Is Gay?

Miller, ISBN: 0872202917, HackettPublishing Company,1996. 258 pp.)Though many of these lyrics and fragments have beenpublished in other editions, by other translators --and each has its glories -- this edition is very wellformatted, pleasing, and very accessible to the eye andmind. Each poet is preceded by a short piece ofbackground, then the poems are numbered, spaced, andlisted (with interspersed, but unobtrusive notes inthe text).The scope and purpose of the volume is stated byMiller in his \\"Preface\\": \\"This anthology of translationsis drawn from the little that remains of the lyric poetryin the Greek world during the seventh, sixth, and fifthcenturies B.C. Following ample precedent, it includesnot only monody and choral lyric but also short poemsand fragments in the elegiac and iambic meters, eventhough the latter do not fit the etymological definitionof lyric as -- 'poetry composed to be sung to the lyre.'\\"The poets included in this volume are: Archilochus,Tyrtaeus, Callinus, Semonides, Mimnermus, Alcman, Alcaeus,Sappho, Solon, Stesichorus, Theognis, Ibycus, Anacreon,Hipponax, Xenophanes, Simonides, Corinna, Pindar, andBacchylides. Since the poems still remaining by Pindarand Bacchylides are more numerous than those of many ofthe other poets, Miller says that his selection foreach of the two latter poets has been made with anattempt to choose examples which best show \\"varietyof scale and treatment.\\" For Pindar, the selection is:Olympian 1, 2, 12, 13, and 14; Pythian 1, 3, 8, and10; Nemean 5, 10; Isthmian 5, 6, and 7; Paean 4,Dithyramb 2, Partheneion 2, Enkomions for Theoxenos,Thrasyboulos, and Xenophon, and Threnos 7. ForBacchylides, the selection is: Odes 2, 3, 5, 6, 11,13; Dithyrambs 17, 18; and an Enkomion for Alexandros.As example of Miller's translations, here is anexcerpt from Bacchylides' Dithyramb 18: \\"Theseus\\":He is a boy,on manhood's very verge;the sports of Aresare what his mind is fixed on, warand battle with brazen din;and what he seeks is splendor-lovingAthens.-- Robert Kilgore."},{"Title":"Greek Lyric: An Anthology in Translation","review":"This book translates these early Greek poems with helpful footnotes, a glossary of terms and explains the known background of the poets. It is a complete anthology of these lyric poets which is very enjoyable to read especially if you like Greek myth."},{"Title":"Greek Lyric: An Anthology in Translation","review":"Used for a class in Classics on the Age of Homer.

Featuring a wealth of simple ways to make money at home and teach financial responsibility to kids, as well as being a highly practical resource to cutting costs without scrimping on fun and simple pleasures, Frugal Families is confidently recommended for anyone seeking to make the most of their financial resources while thoroughly enjoying all aspects of family life."},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"I wish I had this book 20 years ago when I started my family, it would have saved me thousands of dollars over the years. As a budget and debt counselor, I will recommend this book to all my clients. Additionally, I plan on giving it to any couples I know who are getting married. This book is truly a one of a kind resource with help for the family in over a dozen areas. I will keep this book within easy reach so I can access the hundreds of phone numbers, addresses and E-Mail addresses frequently. Using just one of the hundreds of tips will more than recoup the cost of the book. Personally, I found help with the life insurance tips and the auto maintenance tips. It is a tremendously valuable resource and a very well written book."},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"The book itself is in good condition, however I found most of this information to be self-explanatory.

Sorry Amazon, I love you for many other purchasing choices...but rarely for new books."},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"I ordered this at the same time that I ordered \\"Miserly Moms\\" and this was the first one I received. I think MM will be more useful for my purposes. The first two chapters had a couple of recipes and web-sites that I may use, but it focused mainly on bigger ticket items such as vacations, furniture and computer repair that I did not really find useful. If you're looking for tips on how to save money on everyday living, this probably isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. In the gift suggestion section many of the gifts suggested giving things that you needed the recipes from one of her other books.

I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"In true miserly fashion, Jonni McCoy makes saving money a trill and an adventure in Frugal Families.Whereas Mrs. McCoy&#65533;s previous books (Miserly Moms and Miserly Meals) have focused on how a mom or a person can save money, Frugal Families is a compilation of how an entire family can get into a lifestyle of frugality. I especially enjoy this, as it&#65533;s easy for one person (the mom) to do what she can to pinch pennies; but it&#65533;s refreshing to see that life-long learning and behavior is possible with our children. Additionally, Frugal Families offers an extensive resource collection at the end of each chapter, in case you want to look for more information on various topics.Jonni&#65533;s book is a great inspiration to those of us who do not use coupons. It details ways to save money in practically every manner of family living. Need window treatments? No problem! There is an entire chapter devoted to beautifying your house on a budget. Thinking about taking a family vacation? Make sure you read Chapter Six, complete with toll-free phone numbers and hotel alternatives. There is even a chapter on how you should budget your money, and how to work at paying down your financial obligations so that you can live a debt-free (and stress-free) life! But, don&#65533;t stop there! Once you learn how to live more frugally, then you need to read the next section on how to save more of your money and how to invest it wisely.There are many uncertains in life today, especially with job insecurities, economic recessions and the threats facing the international fronts. But, when you are in control of your money &#65533; and you make living frugally a part of your life, you are able to feel in control of your financial well-being. By doing this, your turn the tables on uncertainty and take your money back into your hands. To do this, make sure you take the time to read Frugal Families, it&#65533;ll give you many options to taking the stress out of your family finances."},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"I have read this book more than once and I enjoyed it very much!

I especially appreciate the long lists of recommended resources---a great list to take with me to the library to find good reading on the topic of frugality!While McCoy's first book focused mainly on saving money on food and groceries, this new book deals with other subjects barely touched on in her first book: kids, gardening, vacations, insurance (LOTS of insurance information), electronics, appliances, home furnishings, cars, computers, and more.I think it's a worthwhile volume to have on the shelve. And if you haven't read McCoy's first book, Miserly Moms, be sure to read it! It's one of the most helpful books on frugal family food expenses I have on my bookcase--it's definitely a five star book!"},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"I was really disappointed with this one-her first book is so much better.

But, Miserly Moms is definitely worth the money, I use it all the time."},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"This book is not nearly as helpful as her first book, Miserly Moms. Much of the information is freely available elsewhere, including the author's own website. Further, she repeats, in most cases almost word for word, lots of information from her first book. She also refers you to her first book for &quot;more information&quot; more than once. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this book. I was expecting a volume as useful as Miserly Moms. To say I was disappointed would be a gross understatement."},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"I purchased \\"Frugal Families\\" because I am already a stay-at-home mom and already have a large family, thus I skipped \\"Miserly Mom.\\" Based on McCoy's references to \\"Miserly Mom\\" in this book, I bought the wrong book. I expected some tips on saving money everyday and instead got tips for decorating for the holidays, buying a car, purchasing insurance and electrical appliances. Not what I thouht I was getting and practically useless to me."},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"For families trying to survive on one income in a two income economy, this book is a must. The set of both of McCoy's books should be in every home's frugal living library. I especially appreciated the sections on teaching kids financial responsibility and saving money on pet care. With three kids and four pets, those were topics I needed information about--and quickly! I think a set of McCoy's two books (Miserly Moms and Frugal Families) would make a welcome gift for new parents or even newlyweds. A great way to help them get started on the right track financially."},{"Title":"Frugal Families: Making the Most of Your Hard-Earned Money","review":"I love Jonni McCoy's first book, Miserly Moms!

It covers most technologies built into Oracle Application Server (by the way, the name of the book is &quot;Oracle 8i web development&quot;, not &quot;OAS web development&quot;), and does it in details.However, the author(s) practically altogether miss the concept of EJB, the most valuable part of Oracle 8i/OAS. There are better technologies to do server side scripting than Java servlets. OAS cartridges aren't the best solution in most of the cases either. EJB is the technology that makes many shops install Oracle8i/OAS, and it is _not_ described properly in the book."},{"Title":"Oracle8i Web Development","review":"This is a great book on OAS 4.0.7 new features with respect to PL/SQL cartridges. The author's previous book covers OWAS 3.0 so this can be considered as the second edition. I would give it a 5-star rating if the title is along the line of &quot;Oracle OAS 4 PL/SQL Cartridge Application Development&quot;. The author gave detailed tips and techniques on writing PL/SQL stored procedures that dynamically generate HTML web pages using Oracle database, and every new feature in OAS 4.0.7 PL/SQL cartridge is covered. It also boasts excellent sections on JavaScript, WebDB, OAS installation and configuration, security, and design and development tools.However, the same cannot be said about the coverage of Java-related features of OAS 4.0.x. There are only less than 50 pages in a 1000-page book titled &quot;Oracle8i Web Development&quot; that deal with Java in some detail. Maybe this book was written when OAS 4.0.8 was still under development, and the author did not cover the JWeb and JCORBA cartridges available with OAS 4.0.7, probably knowing they will be deprecated in OAS 4.0.9 and up. So don't be misled by the book's title - it has little to do with Oracle 8i!

Brown, published by McGraw-Hill companies, Inc. copyright 2000Sequels are sometimes a mere shadow of the original. Could this be true of Brad's second book, Oracle8i Web Development?The original book, Oracle Application Server Web Toolkit Reference, was written in early 1998 by Bradley, Richard J. Niemiec and Joseph C. Trezzo of TUSC and is an incredible value with its vast quantity of Web information. So how does Brad's new book stack up to the first?It took me several weeks to review Brad's first book due to the enormous amount of material and this one took longer for the same reason. This book took has an incredible amount of web development information, in fact I refer to it as the A to Z , numbers included, Oracle Web Development Manual.But the question is, did I like it and would I recommend it? The answer... absolutely. Because it covers just about everything you would need to know about developing an Oracle based web site. It starts with an well-itemized list of contents, which is 26 pages long, followed by 1050 pages of web development content as listed below.Hardware and OS considerations, specifications and installation of the web server, OAS configuration, web database, HTTP Listeners and Oracle8i built-ins are some of the topics discussed in the early chapters. Tuning, uptime and web server version differences are also covered to help educate the reader. There are several chapters on development tools and their differences, including many examples. The tools and languages covered at length are HTML, JAVA, XML, PL/SQL,PERL, cartridges, and Oracle Designer.Designing the site is thoroughly addressed, including discussions for a commerce server. Something I had not thought about until I read this, then realized \\"of course, makes a lot of sense to have a commerce server.\\" The book goes on to describe utilities and offers troubleshooting tips , debugging code and security; an extremely important topic when you deal with your customer's information, like credit card processing. Need I say more, other than you are not getting a book with boring narrative, but one filled with page after page of code examples, topic tips, screen shots examples, diagrams and flow charts. In fact when I went back and looked at the layout of the book I realized it has an extremely good page layout and use of white space. In other words the layout appears to be &quot;designed&quot; rather than happenstance where many writers place diagrams and charts near pertinent text. It is not an easy task to keep the interest of a reader in a highly technical book, but my hat's off to Brad's accomplishment in doing so.The book concludes with a 38 page index and a 26 page appendix of great web sites. When I contacted Brad about the extremely helpful web sites to find his source he told me he had to compile the list. When you see the list you will know that that alone took a while to research not to mention that list is only the tip of the ice berg of the wealth of information, or should I say tip of the &quot;gold&quot; berg.If Brad intended to establish himself as a web authority, he has done it and this book demonstrates just that. What a nice gift to the community of web developers Brad has given us by sharing his wealth of knowledge on the subject. Thanks Brad!"},{"Title":"Oracle8i Web Development","review":"Mr. Brown,Great job on the book, I have been in this field of development for awhile now and your book is the first of it's kind.

None of Ms. Tyler's characters are believable, including the lover/sleuth protagonists (for example, they were by turns inexplicably meek and then overly aggressive). Also, while the lover theme can be wonderful, in &quot;Missing Links&quot; the female was on a relentless quest to get her partner into bed, a tendency I found distracting and unnecessary.Further, the plot lacks cohesiveness and perhaps even more unforgivably, the purported motive for the primary murder is legally untenable: Ms. Tyler obviously failed to research California separate property law before committing herself to this theory.And finally, although the tone of the book was apparently intended to be funny and quick-paced, in actuality it was uneven, exaggerated, and not amusing in the least. It's sole appeal is the setting - the beautiful Monterey Peninsula.If Ms. Tyler is going to continue with this series, I respectfully request that she refrain from inflicting such farcical material on her readers in the future."},{"Title":"ATTACK OF THE MONSTER PLANTS (Choose Your Own Adventure, No 34)","review":"A book for younger readers this story is pretty short.

It touches on a variety of aspects of phraseology from the earlier East European research to more recent Western ones. Although the language, in some articles,is necessarily technical (as for instance Igor Mel'cuk's contribution) it is nevertheless written so that any student can benefit from this textbook. The various subjects, from definitions via functions and collocations, cultural significance, automated research and especially the significance in education, are clearly arranged. The article on Language and Culture by N. Teliya et.al. is of particular interest for my studies, bringing into focus a much neglected interdisciplinary connection between language and culture; between phraseologisms and the cultural prerequisites for understanding and using such. The section on Foreign-Learner Language addresses the need in language teaching to consider phraseology as part of the subject. A comprehensive up-to-date bibliography assists the reader in further research. The book is solidly bound in black [linen?] and pleasant to handle with clear typeface."},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Idiots","review":"Those who see, within the world's great religions, traces of representations of inner truth and methods of attunement toward it, among great blank spaces filled with outworn ritual and self-serving platitudes, may find that Wisdom of the Idiots goes a long way toward filling in the blanks. Wisdom of the Idiots is full of tales and narratives, most under two pages long, showing religious psychology in action. More than that, they shift our perspective for a moment so that we can see more clearly how attitudes and assumptions disable perceptions and thwart development, in the individual, the group and the community. Once we see this, the way toward a more realistic perception of humanity is left open."},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Idiots","review":"This collection of 94 concise tales trains a spotlight on an array of human foibles and follies, and one reading of them is just not enough. You'll find yourself opening the book again and again--to savor the delicious humor of some selections, to study others you seem to have missed before, to ponder the significance of those whose interpretation isn't obvious. Gradually you realize that the tales have multiple levels of meaning, that they open up new pathways of perception, and that they promote insights not only about other people but also about your own patterns of thought and behavior. When you find yourself wondering just what &quot;wisdom&quot; really is and just who the &quot;idiots&quot; in this world really are, you'll realize how great an impact on your consciousness this little book has made."},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Idiots","review":"Sufis have been called idiots because their knowledge can appear idiotic to peole who are limited to appearances. To learn from this &quot;idiocy&quot; one must go deeper into matters. Wisdom of the Idiots seems to me a course on how to be a successful student. It is also an introduction to Sufi experience. Shah has crafted his book from teaching stories, essays, explanations and quips of Sufi teachers of the last 1,000 years. He works with and through this material producing a Sufi document usable and useful to people of our times and culture.The material is non-dogmatic and non-moralistic, by turns gentle and gritty. It is thought provoking and funny. I recommend Wisdom of the Idiots if you are a student, formal or otherwise, or if you are considering becoming one.Excerpts:FidelityNajmaini ('The Man of the Two Stars') dismissed a student with the words: 'Your fidelity has been tested. I find it so unshakeable that you must go.'The student said: 'Go I shall, but I cannot understand how fidelity can be a ground for dimissal.'Najmaini said: 'For three years we have tested your fidelity. Your fidelity to useless knowledge and superficial judgments is complete. That is why you must go.'FantiasiesO man! If you only knew how many of the false fantasies of the imagination were nearer to the Truth than the careful conclusions of the cautious. And how these truths are of no service until the imaginer, having done his work with the imagination, has become less imaginative.

Timur Razil"},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Idiots","review":"This is a collection of Sufi (Islamic mystics) teaching stories. Shah is famous for his many collections of them. I've read 10 of his books. They are invariably entertaining. The Sufi masters are referred to as idiots--they can appear as such to the uninitiated. Reminds one of the story of Elijah and the Hasidic master who asked to accompany him. The proviso was that the Hasid couldn't question Elijah on what he did--or he couldn't continue. They visited an old, poor couple who nonetheless shared what little they had with the visitors. So, Elijah prayed for their only asset (a cow) to die. Then they visited a rich man who treated them poorly, so Elijah fixed a wall in the man's house which was about to fall down. After a number of these episodes, the Hasid broke down and asked how Elijah could act as he did. Of course, Elijah had good reasons (e.g. the wall contained a treasure that the rich man would have found had the wall collapsed and the cow took the place of one of the couple who was about to die). Similarly, the Tibetan Buddhists have had masters of Crazy Wisdom. Some of the stories in this particular Shah collection (and the others too) are understandable; some are more like Zen koans. I found this book among the best of the ones I've read of his. You might also try his Nasrudin books; my favorite is: \\"The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin.\\""},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Idiots","review":"Notwithstanding his claims as a sufi, and one one who mediated new forms of knowledge to the West, Shah was one of the great stylists of modern literature. &quot;Wisdom of the Idiots&quot; is one of his greatest books; lucid prose and clear thinking are not usually associated with mysticism but these are consistent elements in Shah's books.As well as tales which report interchanges between sufi masters and enquirers there are evocative stories. Some such as 'Hope' establish the connections between inner qualities and success; others such as the evocative 'Paradise of Song' suggest 'more selves than one, more hopes than one, more chance then one - up there in the Paradise of Song.'"},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Idiots","review":"Wisdom of the Idiots is a collection of \\"holy fool\\" stories from the Sufi tradition where the holy fool is not Mulla Nasrudin - an important distinction only because of Idries Shah's Mulla Nasrudin stories which are better known.These stories in general are more developed than the Mulla Nasrudin stories as they do not play off a known \\"holy fool\\" character but must set their context within the story itself. The result is a wider range of tales and a more frequent \\"teaching\\" context.If you enjoy religious teaching stories, this collection is well worth picking up."},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Idiots","review":"Sufi stories have, for centuries, been recognized as techniques in applied/narrative psychology. Their design, as I understand, is to subtly de-amplify the &quot;noise&quot; that is introduced by egoic distortions in order for us to &quot;liberate&quot; our pure, inner dynamism. IMO, the notion is for the introspecting seeker to tone up (or down) the amplitude so that there is harmonization with Truth. A caveat, however, is that one cannot perform this feat by oneself. A guide is necessary for there to be any &quot;sweet fruit&quot; to &quot;taste&quot;.Through &quot;Wisdom of the Idiots&quot;, and other similar titles, Shah delivers these ancient stories (techniques) into the English language for a modern readership. There is alot of spiritual territory to explore here, and it behooves us, at least to try, finding proper guidance so that our &quot;adventure of Being&quot; doesn't become darkly-complexioned as a &quot;waste of time.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Idiots","review":"My own practice is Zen. But, Idries Shah's translations of the words of ancient Sufis reveal teachings that are sometimes indistinguishable from those of many ancient Zen masters and Christian hermits. I recommend this book to Christian contemplatives and Zen practitioners. It was my first taste of Sufism and it opened my heart and mind, fostering the path at my own feet.The Sufi Sheikhs, the Chan and Zen masters, the Christian Desert Fathers ... their writings show that, depending on where you stand, one teacher's finger may point east and another's point west, yet both still point to the one Moon. All who seek glimpses of truth on any contemplative, mystical, meditative, or silent path should read what the sheikhs have taught."},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Idiots","review":"This book contains stories you should set aside your first few minutes of the day to read, in order to reset your thinking so that all you experience, you embrace."},{"Title":"Northern Voices: Inuit Writings in English","review":"Northern Voices, now in paperback, offers an multi-dimensional perspective of Inuit culture. The literature comes from various places in the Canadian Arctic and from different times, before contact to the present. The genres are as diverse as the historical representation. There are selections of stories that have been passed on for generations in the oral tradition. Other selections are of poetry, diary entries, short narratives and excerpts from longer works. Taken as an entirety, however, the work can be studied from colonial and post-colonial, gender, and ethnographic perspectives. Essential reading for Canadian and Northern Studies as well as Canadian Literature."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"This book should come with a warning label on it saying: \\"If you want to destroy your life go ahead and read this book!\\" This book absolutely destroyed me in every way possible. I remember recieving this book from a friend in Philly and was in a bad season in my life and also remembering being scared to read the book. No wait I wasn't scared to read it I was absolutely terrified, and my pre-concieved notions were correct. Once I picked up that book I was as good as dead. I began to weep and groan for weeks and weeks. The burning words in those pages completely consumed me and scathed me. I was skinned and hung up for death. Everything in my life was burnt up and left in an ash heap before my feet, so that I had to turn to God and say what now? He replied and said do what I have always wanted you to do, die! Everything changed for me, prayer life, ministry, preaching, relationships, church, conduct, and everything else. I walked away broken, battered, and bruised from this book and have never been the same. So with that read this book unless you want to live in your 'normal' Christian life, but if you have enough guts to actually do what the bible says, let Ravenhill expose your fakeness and start all over again from step one!"},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"Leonard Ravenhill was a man of passion. His books represent just a taste of that passion. No other book in the 20th century so captured the heart of a man like this book. Brother Leonard longed for revival. He believed that the Church was playing games with a holy God and that the need of the hour was for genuine revival praying.This book is not a how to of prayer. It is much more. It is a call to prayer. It is a much needed rebuke of our spiritual laziness and apathy (Amos 4:1). We need men and women of faith to rise up and pray with all their might (1 Samuel 12:23; 1 Thess. 5:17). The sad reality is that the early Church was birthed in prayer (Acts 1:14) but today's church knows nothing of prayer. The prayer meeting, writes Ravenhill, is the Cinderella of the Church.Let this book go through you and may God use it to spark a hunger for Spirit-filled praying (Eph. 6:18; Jude 20)."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"This book was written in 1959, and 45 years later, what Ravenhill writes is still applicable today! This book is a prophetic call to the Church to wake up and be the Church of God. I picked up this book as it was highly recommended in another book that impacted me (Growing Deep in God by Edmund Chan), and I have found it deeply ministering.Ravenhill writes with many one liners that cuts to the chase in the heart of the matter that he is communicating. Phrases like \\"No man is greater than his prayer life. The pastor who is not praying is playing; the people who are not praying are straying\\", \\"Many pray, but few have faith\\", \\"God does not want partnership with us, but ownership of us\\", and \\"Our eyes are dry because our hearts are dry\\" are just some of these phrases that speak mountains of the situation in the Church today.I do not agree with everything Ravenhill writes about, but I read beyond the words and understand his heart from which he writes this book. Ravenhill's desire for God comes across strongly, and anything that is apart from God or does not seem to fit into his godly values would seem as \\"sin\\" and hence to be dealt with. Hence, I recommend this book to your reading (and read beyond the words to catch the fire that burns in Ravenhill's heart), and also Edmund Chan's Growing Deep in God. I find that as I read these 2 books, it is like God doing an open heart surgery on me, revealing the true nature of my heart so that I can repent and have God place a new heart in me (Ezekiel 36:26)."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"My prayer life slowly dwindling into obscurity, regulated to 5 minute sessions here and there, I knew I had to do something to revive my prayer life.

If it doesn't do the same for you, you are either an Elijah in prayer or your heart is calloused. Either way, you still need to be pray. Very brief yet potent!

And as the man is, so are his writings. If you can read this book and not be driven to your knees, even as you rend your clothing, then buddy you're dead already!A condensation of &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot; into a few words would yield the truth that it's Man's fault alone. You see, God wants to pour out revival, to set all of us ablaze with the fire of His Spirit, but we are so oblivious to the truth that our hearts are totally turned away from Him that we cannot begin to acquire what He is so richly wanting to shower us with.It starts with repentence - and not your mamby-pamby, watered-down 21st century style repentence, but the kind that tears a man or woman down to the soul, only to allow God to rebuild and reshape. Ravenhill argues that this is not something that happens overnight. If the Church wants revival, it's going to come with a cost. He proceeds to layout a compelling vision of that cost and the crucibles needed to hold what God will pour out.No Christian library is complete without the works of Leonard Ravenhill, and the best place to start is with &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot;.

Why Revival Tarries? carries a lot of passion and practically demands that the church of Jesus Christ wakes up to the reality that there is a disconnect from the early church. Sometimes Ravenhill can be a bit radical, but that's what set him apart from other preachers of his time (as well as today). He was unashamed to call it like it was and he was not ashamed of the truth. This book is no different. A must read for any believer in Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"No single book has proved more foundational to my Christian life and ministry than this."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"My husband was given a copy of &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot; and &quot;Revival Praying&quot; when he joined a men's Bible Institute several years ago at a Baptist Church that we were in at that time. My husband read the book and would read certain passages out loud to me and I couldn't wait to read the books myself. We both have the books well underlined in several places and I have purchased the book since then for several people. A few years before we read these two books, I was listening to a Christian radio station on my way to a friends house. The preacher I heard on the radio was so powerful, that I literally had to pull over to the side of the road. The preacher was Leonard Ravenhill. He was preaching on America and television, etc. and he was so right about what he said about Christianity today. I beleive this is a life changing book and should be read by every Christan. Each time I reread the book, I am convicted again and long to be the Christian he speaks about and would love to see that kind of revival take place in our churces. You will never be the same once you have read what this tremendous man of God has said."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"Outside of the Bible, the most powerful book I have ever read. If you are \\"comfortable\\" in the pew, don't read this book. If you are wondering why God has not moved on this earth, then read this book!!! Written in the 50's you would think Ravenhill was sitting across the table from you today! If you are stagnet and want refreshing, then \\"buy the book\\" POWERFUL POWERFULL POWERFULL."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"A phrase kept coming to me early in 2008 - \\"Why Revival Tarries\\", \\"Why Revival Tarries\\". I actually thought that was a book by Charles G. Finney, and that the Holy Spirit was prompting me to order it. I was surprised, and yet not surprised when I saw that Leonard Ravenhill was the author. Approximately twenty years prior I had received some material from Last Days Ministries in East Texas (The ministry Keith Green started); and it was from them that I first heard the name Leonard Ravenhill.Sadly, it wasn't until 2008 that I actually ordered the book from Amazon and read it.I inhaled it! It was a breath of fresh, holy air.I consider it a modern day classic.Somewhere along the way, I discovered that the books available in our modern day christian bookstores are not necessarily acollection of \\"The Greatest Hits\\" of all time. Just as you have to dig for precious metals and jewels, you have to dig for truth and the anointing. It doesn't just fall on you like rain from the clouds. Though very thankful for the lighthouses christian bookstores are in a dark world, sometimes you have to hunt for hidden treasures that are no longer seen on the shelves.I began watching video segments of Ravenhill on youtube and ordered the interview of him that was taped shortly before his death. Since then I've been hoping that a biography would turn up, and now it finally has. \\"In Light of Eternity\\", the life of Leonard Ravenhill is a book that you might like to get. It's on my list of books to acquire.In the meantime, \\"Why Revival Tarries\\" is the definitive book that expresses the ministry of Leonard Ravenhill. Please get it, and get ON FIRE FOR GOD!"},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"Fifty years ago Leonard Ravenhill wrote Why Revival Tarries. It is now a modern classic. It has sold over half a million copies, and is translated into numerous languages. It is still widely available today.This book is a devotional classic because its author is one who was more concerned about the verdict of the Almighty than his own reputation; more interested in holiness than happiness; and more interested in the glory and honour of God than the praise and applause of men.It is actually composed of various articles he had written earlier, but because it flows from a heart on fire for God, and a life dedicated to holiness and sanctification, the words contain fire and power. No one who is sick of the ordinary and is desirous only of God and his best will be untouched by this powerful book.How can one adequately review a book such as this? Every page has memorable ideas and burning words. Perhaps the best way to present this book to others is simply to feature many of its valuable quotes.Ravenhill argues that we do not have revival for the simple reason that we really don't want revival. We are simply too contented, to smug, too self-satisfied, and too carnal. Our hearts are not broken and we do not earnestly long for a powerful move of God.\\"Revival comes as a result of a cleansed section of the Church, bent and bowed in supplication and intercession,\\" says Ravenhill. \\"The price of revival,\\" he says, \\"is travail.\\" But where is the prayer, the brokenness, the seeking after God?As he says elsewhere, \\"\\"The only reason we don't have revival is because we are willing to live without it!\\" That is our problem. We have become too comfortable, too lazy, too apathetic and too indifferent. In other words, we are neither hot nor cold, but, like the Laodicean church, are simply lukewarm, and we deserve to be spewed out of the Lord's mouth.Prayer is the key to revival, and Ravenhill speaks as much to our prayerlessness as anything else. Unless we get serious about prayer, and forget our trivial pursuits and worldly amusements, we simply will not see revival break forth.Prayer is the key says Ravenhill: \\"No man is greater than his prayer life.\\" Our greatness for the Kingdom will be directly proportional to our greatness in prayer. \\"To be much for God, we must be much with God.\\" The praying man is unstoppable: \\"He who fears God fears no man. He who kneels before God will stand in any situation.\\"Ravenhill reminds us that \\"As the Church goes, so goes the world.\\" The world is in a mess because the church is in a mess. And the church is in a mess because so many of its leaders and preachers are in a mess: \\"The tragedy of this late hour is that we have too many dead men in the pulpits giving out too many dead sermons to too many dead people.\\"If our churches are not full of dead men and women, they certainly seem to be full of sleeping men and women. \\"In the church pillars have given place to pillows.\\" How can God move in such a situation? How can God work when the material in his hands is hard, unwieldy and crumbling?Until we start to see our spiritual need, and start to cry out to God, revival will elude us. \\"If the Church today had as many agonizers as she has advisors, we would have a revival in a year.\\" Where are the men and women of God who travail and agonize over the woeful situation we find ourselves in?Until we are broken and repentant, we will see no fresh move of God's Spirit. \\"The church must first repent; then the world will break! The church must first weep; then our altars will be filled with weeping penitents.\\" Ravenhill goes so far as to suggest, \\"This generation of preachers is responsible for this generation of sinners.\\"Strong words, but true. Our problem is ourselves and our spiritual leaders. We need to break up the fallow ground and seek for the new rains. We simply cannot keep blaming the world for all our troubles. In many ways we have only ourselves to blame:\\"I do not marvel so much at the patience of the Lord with the stonyhearted sinners of the day. After all, would we not be patient with a man both blind and deaf? And such are the sinners. But I do marvel at the Lord's patience with the sleepy, sluggish, selfish Church! A prodigal Church in a prodigal world, is God's real problem.\\"He reminds us of 1 Peter 4:17: \\"Judgement must first begin in the house of God.\\" This is where we must begin. It is long overdue. If we do not act, and act soon, then the chances of revival - at least in the West - look very slim indeed.This book is spiritual dynamite. Those who already have it should pull it off the shelves and reread it. Those who do not yet have it need to go out and get it. The revival we all so desperately need basically tarries because of us - because of our coldness and hardness. This book will go a long way in helping to melt the ice and soften our hardened hearts."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"Ravenhill says it like it is, and will bring you to your knees if you have any reverence to the Lord. This is just what anyone who claims to be a Christian should model themselves after. I highly recommend it to all who say they believe in God."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"So wrote Charles Grandison Finney in his book &quot;Lectures on Revival.&quot;Seeing that there was indeed a &quot;declension&quot; in what the New Testament Church should be, Leonard Ravenhill wrote this jeremiad over 40 years ago, yet his observations and his call to repentance remain ever so true today.From unctionless preachers, to self-satisfied, pew-warming church members, Ravenhill spares no one has his words cut like a flaming sword at the rampant sin that is in the church today.No one with even a modicum of spiritual understanding can read this book and not be committed to repenting, and making a decision to serve Christ Jesus more fervently.Doesn't He deserve our best?"},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"This book will pierce your heart and give you a burden for prayer and the heart of God.

The author's insight into the different aspects of revival is well-elaborated.The author ground his point of view on the Scriptures. It deals with the status of the church in England and America.

Basically, th author centers his view on praying, obedience, and self-denial.I highly recommends this book to every one trying to anyone seeking to understand revival.The books is an easy-read. The author is faithful to his style."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"Sometimes you need an author that will jolt you out of your spiritual lethargy. Leonard Ravenhill will never fail you at such a time. I'm thinking now of 2 of my favorite Ravenhill titles: \\"Why Revival Tarries\\" and \\"Sodom Had No Bible\\".In \\"Why Revival Tarries\\" there are 20 chapters with a page of fantastic quotes at the beginning of each chapter. Imagine being a preacher as I am and being hit with:\\"One does not need to be spiritual to preach, that is, to make and deliver sermons of homiletical perfection and exegetical exactitude...Preaching of the type mentioned affects men: prayer affects God. Preaching affects time; prayer affects eternity.\\"That is paragraph two of chapter one--See what I mean! Or how about this:\\"No man is greater than his prayer life. The pastor who is not praying is playing; the people who are not praying are straying.\\"Yes he is eminently quotable, likes a rhyme, yet is never corny. I could provide many other great quotes, but I am far too slow a typist to reproduce the entire book here.

I'm not sure I could have taken it if I had read this in one sitting. It's too powerful.

It was the first Ravenhill book I've ever read and it certainly won't be my last."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"Leonard Ravenhill was a powerful preacher. He never minced words. He ALWAYS told it like it was. This book was probably his greatest book ever. He shows the cost of revival as well as how to get it.

You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"I was introduces to Leonard Ravenhill via youtube.

True revival is for the BELIEVER in Christ Jesus. Someone must be at least barely alive to be revived. Bro. Ravenhill pulls no punches but 'goes for the throat' of the problem of 'Why Revival Tarries' for as the scripture says, \\"Open rebuke is better than love that is hidden\\" (Proverbs 27:5 KJV).

Leonard Ravenhill wrote things that may be hard to take, but what good is Christianity if God is not in it? He issues a call to abandon the empty ways we do church, and to seek God with passion. We must return to holiness and do things God's way if we want to see the church come alive."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"This book will rattle followers of Jesus Christ to their collective core.

I have read and re-read this book. It is what it is. It's a violent call to repentance and seeking the Lord. it means to get in your face and challenge your indiffrence. Of course it needs to be balanced with other books, (namely books on grace).This is meant to start a fire in you, not to give some theology on how to pray.

I had to repent after nearly every chapter! I consider Leonard Ravenhill to be my spiritual grandfather. He discipled most of the men who discipled me. To say that Bro.

Pick up this book today, or any book he's written for that matter, and get ready to be challenged and convicted!"},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"This book is a powerful tool in the hands of a Christian who desires to grow spiritually and rise above mediocrity.

He calls for a life that is without compromise, being set apart for the Lord. He calls for people to go deep in prayer, and often. He calls for prophets to rise up and speak a message accompanied only with the unction of the Spirit.Just on a side note, this book is a little old. Communism is still a very real threat at the time of the writing. Also, Ravenhill condemns evangelists of his day for buying \\"$3 steaks.\\" That tells you how old this book must be :) If somebody knows where I can buy a steak for 3 bucks, drop me a line...shoot, drop me a line if you know where I can go out and eat steak for under 10 bucks :)"},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"Leonard Ravenhill truly understands the concept of revival and why it is so needed today.

Ravenhill's cry to the church should either elicit a cold-hearted scoff at what he says is necessary for revival, or a definite call for christian's with the fire still burning to fall upon our knees and begin to plead with God for a change in the American church. If you can read this book without having an emotional response then luke-warm christianity is your disease and you may not even know you need a remedy."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"In this book Leonard Ravenhill states that prayer and not \\"any dead mans echoed words\\" would provide the path to Christian revival. Leonard has since passed away and yes, some of the examples given in this book are outdated but his deeper message is timeless.Skarp-Hedin, I too am a Catholic Charismatic Christian that felt somewhat offended by some of the text in this book. I challenged myself to see God through Leonard's eyes. If you take the time and pick it back up you will see that Leonard's sword cuts both ways and spares no Christian Denomination.His call is for all to account for their time spent here on earth and how Prayer focuses us in that pursuit.Because Revival starts with you and I, my prayer it that we can see through the growing pains and only focus on the God who made us all. I'm sure Leonard would agree."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries,","review":"Unlike the last reviewer I opened the book and read it.

Thanks for the info."},{"Title":"Complete Wilderness Training Book (DK Living)","review":"This is a very readable and enjoyable book, but I found it lacking in some respects. It presents some very good information. Its organization is readable, though not always as logical as it could be; often the captions repeat information found in the main text. Lack of space prevents the book from having large databases of edible plants, venomous animals, etc., so it only displays photos of a few; this seems rather random and unhelpful, especially since edible plants really should be identified by more than the memory of a single photograph. A better method would be to have smaller, more precise illustrations and descriptions of each plant, focusing on those that are commonest, most easily identifiable, and best sources of bulk food. (By the way, I have reason to believe that the book's description of the mock strawberry, or _Duchesnea_, as a deathly poisonous berry is an incorrect piece of folklore; _Duchesnea_ isn't even the complete species name.) Sometimes the book just wastes space on insignificant topics -- like mushrooms, which are a bit dangerous and not of great nutritional value; how to make a Jell-O dessert out of carrageen seaweed (really!); and various animals and their survival adaptions. Occasionally I disagree with the author's chosen method of doing something, or happen to know that there are other ways he doesn't mention. (He could have included the debris hut in his section on shelter, and shown specifically how to twist fibers into cord.) The photos and illustrations are excellent, but sometimes show more than they need to.I've spent a lot of space complaining about the book's shortcomings, but let me add that when I first got this book, towards the beginning of my interest in survival, I thoroughly enjoyed paging through it and learned quite a bit. It's good for beginners, who will be able to browse the book open-mindedly and learn many survival tips at their leisure."},{"Title":"Complete Wilderness Training Book (DK Living)","review":"You'll notice that other reviewers have described this book as a \\"good introduction\\" and I think that's probably an apt description. Yes, there are nice color photgraphs and drawings. The author's described background would indicate that he's qualified to comment at length on the subject. The editorial review states that the book is more international in scope, describing wilderness techniques in foreign lands. It's true that the book talks about survival on other continents, but I have to say that its treatment of those hostile (and likely even more unfamiliar to most of the book's readers)environments is more superficial than its treatment of general survival techniques. What this book does is give a very broad overview of the serious subject of survival. To be well learned and therefore genuinely useful, such techniques require in-depth, detailed study. This book, however, is sort of a coffee table book of survival. I am tempted to say that it is a survival book for people who might rather fantasize about wilderness ventures than actually go on them. I won't go so far as to say that it is a useless book; there is a fair bit of good information in it. But if I were to compile a list of survival books that I've read..which would number closer to 100 than 50...I would put this one near the bottom. It is most useful as a supplement to an established survival library. If you're looking for a good first book on survival I would recommend Wiseman's SAS Survival. I would also advise any novice contemplating a trip into remote areas to find a text dealing specifically with that environment, and to first get REAL experience with a seasoned group of outdoorsmen."},{"Title":"Complete Wilderness Training Book (DK Living)","review":"This book is very good in that it shows exactly how to survive in the wild with illustrations, not just words.

While there is some information of use in the book, in most areas it is sadly lacking (although it has pretty pictures). For example, on page 63, it shows Mr. McManners doing a bow drill fire. I'd sure like to see him do it in person if this photo accurately portrays his technique. Unless he has arms like Lou Ferrigno, that top hand of his is going to be all over the place. Similarly, on the same page, his portrayal of hand drill fire making leaves a lot to be desired. He states that the hand drill fire technique 'only works effectively in hot climates, where the wood is really dry.'It also works very effectively, at least in my area, in the winter, when it also can be quite dry. His drill also looks somewhat top heavy and unbalanced.

I think not. But, now with this remarkably candid and affecting memoir the author of 27 bestselling novels tells her personal story. Not only that, this recollection is related in her own voice, making it all the more meaningful. Rather than through a fictional protagonist she speaks directly to us with words of encouragement and hope.Beginning with a childhood in the Bronx during the Depression Ms. Clark had dreams - she dreamed of becoming a writer, and her mother encouraged her even though the older woman struggled to make ends meet by renting out rooms. A sign was placed by the front door reading, &quot;Furnished Rooms. Kitchen Privileges.&quot;Ms. Clark's days as a student at an exclusive girl's school came to an end; she lost an older brother whom she deeply loved during World War II. She tells with affection and sensitivity of her marriage to Warren Clark, and the birth of their children. A devastating blow occurred when he died unexpectedly leaving her widowed with five young children.Nonetheless, she soldiered on, writing at a kitchen table. For her labors? Forty rejections. Determined to reach her goal and support her family she wrote radio scripts and began work on a novel.The rest is literary history. Ms. Clark generously shares her life experiences, reminding us that dreams can come true when someone is willing to persist and fight mightily for them.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Kitchen Privileges: Memoirs of a Bronx Girlhood","review":"A surprising glimpse into the world of Mary Higgins Clark from her childhood which took a sad turn with the early death of her father. Her mother then was forced to rent out rooms (with kitchen privileges)in order to try to make ends meet. Some of their tenants were interesting to say the least.Before marrying, Ms. Clark was an airline stewardess and she has a few interesting stories about that. She married the man she had had a crush on and was blissfully happy until he suffered a fatal heart attack leaving her with 5 children.She writes about her struggles to become published and also of her fantastic life since.The only thing wrong with the book is that it is so brief. Like I said at the beginning, we only get a glimpse into the life of this fascinating woman."},{"Title":"Kitchen Privileges: Memoirs of a Bronx Girlhood","review":"In Kitchen Privileges, suspense writer Mary Higgins Clark writes about her formative years and the first half of her adult life. She does through through a series of vignettes and stories, showing the places, people and experiences that influenced her.Her tone is honest, but modest, and often funny. Sometimes it assumes the tone of someone recollecting their favorite scenes from life, scenes which have a lot of meaning to the teller, but not so much to the listener. But Clark's spirit dances throughout the memoir, a spirit that gave her the persistence to continue writing despite years of rejections, to write, work and raise five children, to pursue her interests and values in an era where women were not given much freedom, and to continue to find joy even after the deaths of her parents, husband, brother-in-law, and all siblings.The audio CDs are read by Clark herself, making her story very personal. Kitchen Privileges is worthwhile listening (or reading) for Clark fans or for those interested in a woman's life in mid-twentieth century America. For younger listeners, it's an interesting personal account of an era so different from today."},{"Title":"Netguide: Your Complete Guide to the Internet and Online Services","review":"This book is a must have for students of all ages.

This is a fitting tribute to a man who has been shamefully underrated in American life, as well as a probing look at race relations in the past forty-plus years, seen through the prism of baseball and Hank Aaron's breaking of Babe Ruth's record. Like the author, I grew up in Milwaukee, although I am a bit older and so I saw Hank Aaron hit many of his home runs. His dignity and grace are a precious memory of my youth. Also like the author, I wrote Hank Aaron a letter when I learned that racists were hounding him for challenging Ruth, and received an eloquent letter in reply from Mr. Aaron. This book, with its highly personal approach to the subject, is a multifaceted view of a revealing part of American life. I couldn't recommend it more highly."},{"Title":"Me and Hank: A Boy and His Hero, Twenty-Five Years Later","review":"Don't get me wrong -- this was a great read and a provocative book about my favorite ballplayer of all-time. But I thought Tolan was at his best describing the people who experienced Hank Aaron's home run chase firsthand (including himself) and at his worst when his personal memories shifted from fact to opinion.The tale of his encounter with a homeless Atlanta man who attended the game where Aaron hit No. 715 is beautifully told and moving. His personal friendship with a Babe Ruth admirer ignores racism in his hometown and praises Aaron for his accomplishment illustrates how we need inner strength and conviction not to simply march in tune with those around us. Tolan's interviews with Aaron, his daughter Gaile and former teammates reveal the depth with which Aaron had to endure racism as a ballplayer, and his historical portrait of the racial tension in his hometown of Milwaukee is thorough and fascinating.But the more Tolan discovers about how unappreciated Aaron truly is, the more preachy -- and less effective -- he becomes. He hits a low point when he grills three advertising executives on their lack of knowledge of Aaron's hardships as they prepare to pay homage to Aaron in a MasterCard commercial. Are they to be blamed for that? All of these people clearly respect Aaron, and they all interviewed Aaron in preparation for the commercial. If he'd really wanted them to know what he endured, he probably would have told them. He also takes some unnecessary shots at the Hall of Fame because they have chosen to pay tribute to Babe Ruth with an entire room, while Aaron gets only a wall. Sure, Aaron deserves a room to himself, so do Jackie Robinson, Bob Gibson, Curt Flood, and many of baseball's other African-American pioneers. They don't. Deal with it.One need not be a walking encyclopedia of Aaron's life, as Tolan is, to appreciate his accomplishments achieved under extreme duress. Let those who appreciate Aaron for who he is -- a great ballplayer and a great man -- simply be. The irony is, I'm with Tolan on his central argument, that Aaron is one of the greatest and most underappreciated Americans in history. I'll even go far as to say you can't prove Ruth is better than Aaron, because Ruth played an all-white game and didn't necessary play against the best. But Ruth made the game popular. If not for Babe Ruth and what he did to make baseball America's pastime, Aaron's chase wouldn't have inspired the rancor that it did. People wouldn't have cared.Sandy, let's enjoy being Hank Aaron fans by not wasting our time beating up those who don't appreciate him to the extreme degree we do."},{"Title":"Me and Hank: A Boy and His Hero, Twenty-Five Years Later","review":"Me and Hank left me wondering what the author's actual purpose in writing the book was. I am a baseball fan and also had an idol at an early age. His name was Granny Hamner and I visited in the hospital after an injury. It was a disillusioning experience. I made him an album hand crafted from pictures cut out from greeting cards that told about his life. Mr. Hamner pretty much blew me off which was a tough reality for a thirteen year old girl. So I get the fascination with Mr. Aaron as well as the history encompassed in his very difficult public life. Those elements make the book worthwhile. However, the author goes off track in many sections and muddles up the main focus. In particular, including Phil Niekro's story of his father and his knuckleball triumphs detracts from the tribute to Hank Aaron. The only related element to Niekro's interview was that Niekro maintains he had absolutely no knowledge of the racial tensions around the homerun countdown. Sure.I felt the author experienced something similar to me and Hamner when he visited Aaron. Tolan certainly had more invested in the experience than the hall of famer."},{"Title":"Me and Hank: A Boy and His Hero, Twenty-Five Years Later","review":"A moving memoir about life, sports and race relations in the United States written by a master craftsman. Don't miss it -- or the book on which it is based."},{"Title":"Me and Hank: A Boy and His Hero, Twenty-Five Years Later","review":"First, this is not a book totally about baseball. If that's what you're looking for, you will have to look elsewhere. If you want a real life account of what went on while The Hammer was chasing The Babe, this is the book for you. It is well written and has enough facts/stats to interest a baseball fan like myself but it has a lot more. It goes into detail about what was going on behind the scenes. It's not pretty but the truth rarely is. There was (maybe still is) so much hate for Hank due to his color that I couldn't believe it was real. It happened before my time and it was sad to know how he was treated. As sad as it was, I think it is important to understand what went on. You know what they say about history repeating. In this case, I hope it never does."},{"Title":"Me and Hank: A Boy and His Hero, Twenty-Five Years Later","review":"I have to say this is the saddest baseball book that I've ever read. This book really is about the reality of sharp division between two Americas --- the main stream one that belongs to whites and another that belongs to blacks.Being an avid Hank Aaron fan, the author Sandy Tolan does have a strong --- could even say a bit biased --- opinion about how Aaron has not been given proper credit he deserves. As an earlier review points out, he sounds angry at times, but really the whole point in the end is that racism doesn't even take active hatred like those manifested in tons of hate mail Aaron received in his quest for the homerun record. That the main stream America has had so little interest in Aaron's great feat shows the reality of human's natural tendency to unconsciously discount \\"others.\\" In this sense, I don't think Tolan intended to blame the main-stream America for not giving Aaron enough respect; the white people in the States never truly understand what someone like Aaron had to go through and what he meant to those who are considered as \\"others\\" simply because they cannot experience it in today's America. And sure they don't wish to experience if given a choice. I saw much more resignation than accusation in Tolan's narrative.It is only relieving because Tolan, who is white, does treat Aaron's achievements and deeds with such a profound respect and passion. Yet even Tolan could not break ice with Aaron, whose emotional scar has not been healed. It is too sad Aaron had to go through so many negatives for what everyone should feel happy for. But the book tells what he did really, really meant a lot for those who cared about him, and Tolan made sure that those won't be forgotten."},{"Title":"Me and Hank: A Boy and His Hero, Twenty-Five Years Later","review":"Sandy Tolan did a good job interviewing many people, including Hank Aaron, to do this book.

Not only is the photography technically suburb, but the unique ways in which these dogs are portrayed shows you how much Byran loves labs and how much time he spends around them. Mr. Bryan postulates in the intro that people who don't hunt can't really appreciate their lab's full potential. I don't hunt, so our lab is a family dog. But this book allowed me to understand what she's capable of and to appreciate her already fine qualities even more."},{"Title":"Labs Afield: Hunting with America's Favorite Retriever","review":"I used to hunt a long time ago, but have since grown distant from any need to kill for sport ... so, I was initially rather hesitant about this purchase ...

He did a terrific job on research and some of the plot twists were very clever."},{"Title":"Barry Sadler's Casca: The Defiant","review":"Paul Denegelegi's second Casca book is markedly better than the first but still contains a little too much over descriptive passages, making the book a little heavy at times. This story has Casca meeting a young Marco Polo in Venice and then accompanying him to China and the court of Kubilai Khan and he enjoys many adventures there.Dengelegi writes well when battles are decribed but all too often there seems to be a little wandering from the main plot which detracts from the storyline. Sadler wrote in an all-action mode and this is what Casca fans really want, not a ponderous storyline which is why Denegelegi attracts a lot of criticism.One thing I particularly disliked was the final part where the writer attempted to connect this book's storyline with the beginning of his first book and in the process contradicted Sadler's storyline for the character. Careless and with a little more care this would have been avoided."},{"Title":"Barry Sadler's Casca: The Defiant","review":"This 2nd novel of the return of Casca was a better effort than the 1st. I have been reading the Casca novels since it first came out in the early 80's and still own the first 14 novels, after that they fell towards bad writing oblivion for me. Barry Sadler's death was very sad and so was the Casca series for me. I am very glad to see a new writer come in and try to take the reins for the new series, but for some reason I find myself skimming thru lots of paragraphs to the end. I don't want to bash a good writer, but Paul D. seems to bring to life a Casca of old very well. His feelings and his mannerisms are all there like Barry Sadler used to write, but the action scenes to me are not written very well and are bogged down with flat battle sequences. For example, when Casca finally confronted the bad guy who killed his beloved, the build-up of the fight was finished much too quickly and easily. Barry Sadler's fight scenes and his revenge scenes were shocking and well written in an action-type way that left the reader satisfied. Paul is a gifted writer when it comes to the feel of the past and with customs of the peoples in history, but it is too bogged down with nothing really happening. Barry Sadler's books for the most part were less than 200 pages and the fat was trimmed off. I dont see how these other people can give this new Casca book 4 to 5 stars after they have read Barry's books, but to each his own I say. Keep trying Paul, I know these are big shoes to fill but I know you can do it better next time, Casca is too great of a character not to give another try for old time sakes!"},{"Title":"Barry Sadler's Casca: The Defiant","review":"This latest Casca novel, the 2nd in this new authors Casca tryout, is still unfortunately coming up short.Barry Sadler's Casca novels were fantastic pulp hero type action novels, filling a groove for readers that loved such short novels like Conan the Barbarian could truly appreciate.Out of all of Sadler's writing ventures, only Casca really shined like a well polished blade. I still own all of the series.I am glad and humbled that someone has tried to take up the huge writing reins to continue this series. A solid writer could well take on this saga, giving hungry old readers of the series - as well as new ones - new adventures of Casca, the eternal mercenary. There are hundreds of untold times to pick and choose from.As much as I admire someone making an attempt, this author has come up somewhat short of just making a Sadler pulp adventure story. He shows potential, however. Practice makes perfect.Well, one hopes anyway."},{"Title":"Barry Sadler's Casca: The Defiant","review":"I have to admit that this is better than his original attempt at this series. The battles are much improved. The problem is that he is still overly descriptive of areas of the story that really does not require it. I found myself skipping pages again. When a reader has to skip pages for a lack of interest, you loose the reader's attention. Sadler had the ability to reach out and pull you into the story, and when you did come up for air or food you were ready to dive back in immediately. In this book, ofttimes I found myself on the outside looking in, and I really didn't care if I finished. The author also had a tendency to stray from the story and loose the plot for a while, which confused me at times.I'm sorry but if this author makes another attempt at this series I doubt I will read it."},{"Title":"Barry Sadler's Casca: The Defiant","review":"worst casca book ever written. casca is mainly a side bar in the book was so bored did not even finish book . as a fan who is hungry for the next casca book i would starve before buying one written by dengelegi. please get a new author."},{"Title":"Barry Sadler's Casca: The Defiant","review":"Can someone tell me what Goldman and his reading of the Gutenberg Bible in the beginning had to do with this story!!!?????

It will be an essential resource on the full golf swing for all top-flight pros, instructors, and average golfers who dream of breaking 80.My best score on a championship 18 hole course is 83. So I am part of the prime market for this book. I will share with you what I learned from the book in my quest for a slightly lower score.David Leadbetter is one of our most talented teaching pros. If you are like me, you are accustomed to seeing him on television so his ideas will seem familiar.Mr. Leadbetter had a great resource to start with. This book is an update of Ben Hogan's famous book: Five Lessons, The Modern Fundamentals of Golf that was originally published as five articles in Sports Illustrated in 1957. The book, illustrated with drawings by Anthony Rivielli, has been a primary resource for those who wanted to understand the pure ball-striking ability of Ben Hogan. And Mr. Leadbetter was much aided by the recent discovery of the photographs taken by Mr. Rivielli, upon which the drawings were based. Eighty-five new photographs of Ben Hogan are included, which were mostly designed to be illustrative of the material in Five Lessons. So, if all you got were the new photographs, you would be way ahead of where anyone has been before now.The first part of each of the sections in the book (The Hands, Addressing the Ball, Backswing, Downswing, and Summary and Concluding Thoughts) is there to summarize Mr. Hogan's original message, along with the proper illustrations and captions.In the second part of the section, Mr. Leadbetter goes on to describe why Mr. Hogan achieved the results he did with his approach, and what some of the problems are that that approach could present for other players. This section was fascinating. Mr. Hogan had a tendency to hit wild hook shots, and many of his adjustments were to open the club face in order to make solid contact. He had several unusual physical characteristics, including very large and strong hands and arms that presented special opportunities and challenges. This discussion basically contradicts Mr. Hogan's advice in many areas, and points out places where Mr. Hogan's demonstrations of his own style were inaccurate versus what shows in films from the same era.Finally, Mr. Leadbetter takes what the average golfer can use from Mr. Hogan, and adds other elements that are complementary. You will find this material the most familiar to you. It is well done though, because it addresses ways to compensate for current weaknesses in your game.My own lessons from reading the book related to developing a much better understanding the objective one is looking for from a good grip, more ways to adjust the grip than I had ever dreamed of, helpful ideas about how to take the grip properly, how stance affects timing and club head direction, and mental concepts to use in creating better timing and coordination. I think I learned more about these mechanics as variables than I had learned in 24 years of playing the game (and taking more than a few lessons). There is also a lot of good material in here about how to practice, and the value of watching videos of your swing. Most importantly, the book reinforced what I am doing right and made me sensitive to what I need to work on.By the way, breaking 80 requires being as good a putter and short game player as you possibly can be. For those subjects, you need Dave Pelz's Short Game Bible and Dave Pelz's Putting Bible (you can read my reviews of each on Amazon.com). Those will get you under 80 faster than this book will . . . because there are so many more short game shots for average golfers than full swing shots.The main weakness of the book is that Mr. Leadbetter does like to provide lots of detail. Usually, this is helpful. Sometimes, his material for average golfers is a little confusing to me. You may understand it just fine, but I cannot accurately anticipate your reaction.After you finish reading this wonderful book, I urge you to select one aspect of your full swing where you could benefit from a change. Then use the ideas and methods here to start to make that change. After you are successful, pick a second area and continue the process. Now you have the makings of a true Ben Hogan approach, because that's exactly what he did.Hit 'em straight and long!"},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"Three and a half years ago I had the immense good fortune to act as an agent in the sale of the entire contents of the estate of the late Anthony Ravielli. He was the pre eminent golf illustrator of the second half of the 20th Century. I was able to see a vast amount of original drawings and paintings by Ravielli. But what struck me more was the photography. There were literally thousands of vintage photos, as well as negatives, taken by Ravielli, as well as many other famous photographers. I decided to buy the photographs, negatives, and with them all rights to anything that was done by Ravielli. The most interesting items were a group of vintage prints of Hogan in his dress whites, and I also found a group of B+W negatives, which were the original negatives for the vintage prints in the lot. I really was just considering them as old photographs, and was going to reproduce some for sale in print form. In my many hours, actually days, of going through this lot, and studying the images, I noticed a very small B+W print of Hogan with his hands on his hips looking directly at the camera. I knew it looked like one of the illustrations within The Five Lessons. I found the image in the book, and upon close examination, found it to be identical. And furthermore, each image within the famous Five Lessons was actually directly based on the negatives which I had bought. I can't describe the feeling that went through me when I realized what I had found. I am an avid golfer, and always knew about the Five Lessons by Ben Hogan. But, in my dealing with the Ravielli lot, I learned much more. As I read the Fundamentals of Hogan by David Leadbetter, I am still struck by seeing all the photos laid out in proper order, and examined and critiqued by the leading instructor of our time. This book is a great combination of two of the most insightful, and analytical minds in golf. Careful reading will provide the reader with detailed knowledge of what does, and does not occur during a proper golf swing. And, you have to love those photos."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"In addition to the many details in the other reviews, I have a few brief points.THE best aspect of this book are the black and white photos of Hogan that did NOT inspire the graphics in his book, Five Lessons. I remember reading Five Lessons as a teenager and taking Hogan's pointers very literally. The points about ball position (keeping the ball in one place, but adjusting your feet as you change clubs) and the insides of your arms pointing skyward really threw my game for a loop as a teenager. Watching the latter day pros and their technique (where they did NOT follow these points), however, made me realize that either Hogan had an incredibly unique swing or what he was teaching in his book just didn't make much sense today. As Leadbetter points out in his commentary, and as the new photos confirm (the ones taken when Hogan was actually swinging at/addressing the ball--NOT the ones where he stood still and displayed what he &quot;thought&quot; he was doing) Hogan didn't adhere to all of his &quot;lessons&quot;! It was very comforting to finally learn the truth about what Hogan was actually trying to portray in his book as explained by Leadbetter (thank you David!). If you are serious about improving your game, upon reading this and some careful review and study (the text can be a bit laborious at times) you should glean at least a few tidbits that will help you. What helped me the most (besides finally seeing the real photos) were the points about a shorter backswing (mine tended to get too long--like Daly's) and having equal grip pressure in both of your hands (I tended to let my right hand get loose).All in all an excellent book that helps marry older and modern fundamentals of golf. Plus the vintage photos of Hogan make it a great coffe table book."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"Great instructional piece. Leadbetter adds a great deal to the original Hogan work. His ability to explain why certain things worked for Hogan, but may not produce similar results for different types of golfers is of great import. A MUST have for any student of the game."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"Here is a review that I thought summed up my opinion of this book perfectly:Reading David Leadbetter's book \\"The Fundamentals of Hogan\\" was a very frustrating experience for me. On the one hand, there are some excellent pictures, but on the other hand, Leadbetter doesn't teach Ben Hogan's fundamentals, and it shows.I was pleasantly surprised to see that Leadbetter mentioned things about Ben Hogan's swing of which very few instructors are aware, including those who claim to teach Hogan Fundamentals, but then Leadbetter would blow it by always adding that Hogan was unique and that golfers should ignore what Hogan did and instead do it his (David Leadbetter's) way. It was as if Leadbetter were saying Hogan was wrong and that his way is better.This is where Leadbetter's weakness shows with regard to Ben Hogan's fundamentals--he clearly doesn't understand the importance of the movements and how they fit together so tightly. The Hogan swing was essentially one motion from beginning to end, an accomplishment which no other golfer has been able to match! This is the true beauty of Ben Hogan's fundamentals--pure synergy with absolutely no wasted movement! David Leadbetter is throwing a monkey wrench into Ben Hogan's Fundamentals by adding pieces of his own swing theory that do not fit.Let's face it, Hogan was the best ball striker and had the best swing of all time. He may have been a little more flexible than most and he certainly worked harder than anyone else, but as I see it, he had two legs, a torso, two arms, and a head. The fundamentals he applied to his swing were proven in major championships and they apply to all golfers possessing anything related to a typical human physique.For a publisher wanting to sell the largest possible number of books, David Leadbetter was the obvious choice for a new book on Hogan. Combine the biggest name in golf instruction and the newly found photos used to create the illustrations in Ben Hogan's book Five Lessons, The Modern Fundamentals Of Golf and you're guaranteed to have a big seller. Unfortunately, focusing on dollars instead of being true to the subject doesn't do justice to Ben Hogan's fundamentals.So, should you buy the book? If you have an interest in Hogan's fundamentals, definitely yes. The physical quality of the book is excellent and the pictures alone are worth the cost. Unfortunately, if you rely on David Leadbetter's words it won't do much to further your understanding of Ben Hogan's fundamentals."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"I really enjoyed this book, which I read in tandem with the original Ben Hogan \\"Fundamentals\\", which this book is based upon. David Lebetter offers excellent commentary on how and why certain elements of Hogan's technique worked best for Hogan, and why and how these fundamentals might or might not work well for others. Seeing the photos from which the original line drawings were done is both interesting and illuminating. I believe that reading the two books together, which I did chapter by chapter (first reading Hogan, then reading Ledbetter) adds substantially to the reader's understanding and appreciation of both books. Some have commented that the Ledbetter book is too dense or technical, but I found that, for anymore really wanting to understand the dynamics of grip, set-up and swing, these two books are especially illuminating and helpful."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"This a fantastic book for pictures of Hogan demonstrating his swing techniques taken for the illustrations in the \\"Five Lessons\\". Leadbetter makes a very detailed analysis of Hogan's swing and some interesting observations between what Hogan said in his book and how he actually swung. A must for every Hogan fan.However, as soon as Leadbetter starts giving his own \\"My Views\\", watch out. In \\"The Plane Truth for Golfers\\", Jim Hardy differentiates between the one plane (Hogan, Snead) and the two plane (Leadbetter). All of Leadbetter views on how to improve on Hogan's swing are two plane ideas which Hardy points out are disastrous for the one plane swing. Read Five Lessons and this book for Hogan's swing and forget all the sections labelled \\"My Views\\" or you will be swinging the golf club like David Leadbetter, not like Ben Hogan!5 stars for Ben Hogan; 3 stars for David Leadbetter."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"For those are fans of Hogan's masterpiece the Five Fundemantals this book is a must. Leadbetter is able to explain in simpler terms what Hogan was getting at. Leadbetter also explains some of the fallicies in Hogan's earlier work. Hogan did not have the benfit of video tape so what he believed he was doing with his swing and what he was actually doing was different. Anyone who enjoyed or benefited from Hogan's original book should pick this up as a companion piece."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"This is an indepth analysis and interpretation of Hogan's perspective of the golf swing by the best modern teacher alive today. Leadbetter's view clarifies and adjusts Hogan's teachings to modern times eloquently. This book is not for the faint of heart wishing to better understand the essential and detailed bio-mechanics of the golf swing. I would suggest his other books and/or DVD's to get started.With respect, I disagree with Mr. Leadbetter's thoughts on Hogan's own hooking remedies, his grip changes and the \\"secret\\" cupping of the wrist to open the club face at the top. Early in Hogan's career he had an extremely long backswing, prompted by an extremely long hip turn. The result coming down was a very active lower body to compensate for a latent upper body. The club face would arrive from the outside and closed causing the snap-hook under pressure he hated. As his swing became more compact he was able to control it's action much better. D.L. touches on this but emphasizes the different grip and the wrist cupping as Hogan's \\"cure\\".I also disagree with D.L.'s thoughts on moving the head back laterally with longer clubs. It's OK as long as it returns to the same position at address. Just another unnecessary variable IMHO. The head is the fulcrum of the swing. Keep it there.Don't buy this thinking you'll find \\"lightening in a bottle\\". The golf swing takes study, focus and discipline to learn how to properly execute. As Hogan believed, anyone can break 80, even if they devote one-tenth the time he did to being one of the greatest students of the swing and players of all time."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"First let me say that i don't think this is a great book to pick up if you are just begining your journey of learning how to play golf. Leadbetter definitly assumes that you know a little about golf. With that said, i learned alot by reading this book. The entire book gave me a wealth of knowledge to begin incorporating in my lessons. I learned alot through the pictures and assited guidance that Ledbetter incorporated into this book. The author tries to relay Hogan's ideals on the fundementals of golf and then the author tries to relay his opinions on how to do bring these into your gold game.I started this book and realized that there was so much to this game that i had yet to learn, and that was only after the first chapter. This is definitly worth the read. It's a short book with a wealth of info and pictures to help you. Check it out."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"I've only been playing seriously for about a year, and I found this book to be a big help to my game. I was easily able to incorporate several changes into my swing, but I did them without cluttering my head at the same time. I think that is a testament to the quality in how Mr. Leadbetter explains things. I really like how he explains why Hogan did some of the things that he did, and how other golfers do them differently. I read much of this book in the backyard with a club in hand so I could try out different techniques as I read them. That helped me quickly recognize what worked and didn't work for me and retain more information."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"This is a great book. Leadbetter explains Hogan's 5 fundamentals expertly and why Hogan did it this way. Hogan had unique problems to him, mainly a horrible duck hook, a problem that 99 percent of the golfing population does not have. Most people are better off NOT following Hogan word for word, especially if you are a banana ball slicer. Leadbetter realized this from spending most of his life on a range and giving thousands of lessons. He realizes that most golfers need the opposite of what Hogan teaches!It's like Harvey Penick told a student that wanted to learn how to swing like Hogan: Penick said he couldn't teach genius. Out of the millions that have tried to do it like the master, none that I know have made it.I read 5 fundamentals when I first started playing 15 years ago and I struggled. Once I read the Golf Swing by Leadbetter and watched some of his DVD's and applied them to my game, I evenually got down to scratch. After reading F of Hogan, I realized why it was a struggle for me to follow it's teachings.This book is written with great care by a true student and lover of the game. It is beautifully illustrated and well worth the time to read it. We can all learn form Lead."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"This book has saved me $$$$ in lessons. I have been golfing for 18mos. and have been seeing steady signs of improvement in my game. Most of my tips come from others on the golf course.The best tip I ever got on the golf course would be the suggestion to buy this book.I read this book last night- took about 3- 3 1/2 hours to read it thoroughly and the way you're supposed to(make sure club is in your hands). Then I went to the range this morning and worked on my problem areas. This book explained clearly and concisely the dynamics and gist of the golf swing. How to hold the club, how to set-up (address) the ball, coil and uncoil your swing- simply unbelievable.This is the GOLF BIBLE in my eyes right now. Never have I hit so accurately in the range, course, or wherever. It has made me excited to practice.MY SUGGESTION: If you're serious about getting good then read this book, highlight and flag important points then spend time at the range.I have not even brought my new swing to the course yet- and I don't plan to until I can spend 3-5 more practice sessions at the range.I AM A BORN AGAIN GOLFER!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"I've never been a big fan of either Hogan or Leadbetter. For me, Hogan's ideas always seemed too narrow and dogmatic, tailored to his own unique swing and talent. This is the best thing I have ever seen by Leadbetter, and this is the clearest take on Hogan's ideas I have run across. It's a very entertaining read, and it offers lots of good ideas for the recreational golfer who also is a student of the game."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"I HAVE PLAYED GOLF SINCE I WAS 7 YEARS OLD.

When I found out that David Leadbetter had written the new book, I immediately ordered it, hoping it would further elaborate on Hogan's techniques. While Hogan's techniques are well-described, Leadbetter then goes on to explain why those techniques won't work for the average golfer. For example, our hands are not as strong as Hogan's, our left thumb is not as long or shaped the same, we are not as athletic as Hogan. It seems that Leadbetter just took this as an opportunity to use the Hogan name to publish yet another book of instruction in his own name, knowing it would be purchased just because of the panache of the Hogan name. I think we have been had."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Hogan","review":"As a teaching professional for the David Leadbetter Golf Academy, I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of David's new book. David is an inovator and very creative, and he is always in search of new ideas that will enhance his philosophy of teaching. After obtaining photos of Hogan, which were the actual photos from Hogan's great instruction book, David carefully describes in detail Hogan's mechanics and breaks them down into ways no one else can. David is a true genius, and this is why he is and will remain on top of the instructional world. Just to point out a few areas, you will find very interesting details on Hogan's &quot;transition&quot; and his &quot;release&quot; which were very informative. This book will help you understand why Hogan was known as the best ball striker of all time."},{"Title":"Nigel Slater's Real Food","review":"This is an inspiring read. Slater writes about real food the way real people like to eat. His recipes are practical and unfussy. They are irreverent and certainly do not submit to any soul and appetite destroying preoccupation with ersatz low-taste,low-fat food. Worth reading for the description of how to roast a chicken that is almost poetic"},{"Title":"Nigel Slater's Real Food","review":"In Real Food, Nigel Slater manages to invoke the feeling and quality of comfort food but goes beyond that with some of the bold and certainly delicious flavours he encourages us to explore. Every recipe that we have tried out of this book has been a huge success. It's great to find a book where the recipes are simple without being boring. Don't comb through the book looking for the low-fat gems, instead enjoy these delicious recipes in moderation."},{"Title":"Nigel Slater's Real Food","review":"\`Nigel Slater's Real Food' and \`Real Cooking' by Nigel Slater (name above the title, of course) are two great expositions on the real joy of cooking. Slater characterizes his point of view in the motto to \`Real Cooking' as \`There is too much talk of cooking being an art or a science - we are only making ourselves something to eat.' With this sentiment, Slater dismisses the Shirley Corriher / Alton Brown \`kitchen science' camp on the one hand and the Keller / Boulud / Girardet \`haute cuisine' camp on the other. In some ways, this also dismisses the high-end culinary magazine crowd as you may find in \`Bon Appetit', \`Gourmet', and \`Martha Stewart Living'. While this seems to dismiss a goodly portion of the modern culinary establishment, it really does not. Slater is certainly in the same camp as his nibs, Jamie Oliver, his good friend, Nigella Lawson, and Oliver's mentors, Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers of London's River Caf&eacute;. In fact, if I did not know that Oliver was primarily influenced by Gray, Rogers, and Gennaro Contaldo, I would have guessed that Oliver was a Slater disciple from the word \`GO'. I am happy to say that there are plenty of important cookbook writers in the United States who can easily be considered to be in Slater's camp. Leading the list is probably Jacques Pepin, especially with his various quick cooking books such as his latest \`Fast Food My Way'. I do not wish, however, to give the impression that Slater is all about fast cooking. He is certainly about simple cooking in the same sense that Richard Olney describes in \`Simple French Food', but he is a whole lot more about being in love with the sensual qualities of food and how well those qualities of various foods mix together in the most effective way.What is certainly true is that both Slater and Oliver represent the kind of cooking I enjoyed on my two trips to England, primarily the kind of cooking I saw at some of the better pubs in Hampshire and in London suburbs.Both of these books are primarily about recipes and the salient qualities of particular classes of food. For a study of Slater's \`philosophy' of cooking in depth, see his recent book \`Appetite'. These two books are even organized in very similar ways, in that each chapter presents a particular raw material or class of raw material. The more traditionally organized \`Real Cooking' has chapters on:Fish & ShellfishChicken & Other BirdsPork, Bacon, and SausagesLamb and other MeatsPasta, Beans, Rice & GrainsVegetablesCheese, Snacks & PuddingsThe later book, \`Real Food', which is also the tie-in book for a Television Series (not seen in the US, to my knowledge) is more to the point, with chapters entitled:PotatoesChickenSausagesGarlicBreadCheeseIce-creamChocolateThe chapter on bread is a good indication of Slater's point of view, in that he gives us nothing on baking bread, but just about everything you may want (this side of Nancy Silverton's sandwich book) to know about making some really interesting and unusual sandwiches. Similarly, the sausage book says nothing about how to make sausages, only how to make the very best use of them.True to his word in his \`motto' quoted above, you will find not one word about the relative fat content of milk and cream, the emulsifying power of an egg, or calibrating the temperature of your oven. On the other hand, you will find much about, for example, the relative tastes of pork, beef, and lamb fat and the virtues of free range raised poultry. Here is one strong point of contact between the articulate and reflective Slater and the ebullient and emotional Oliver (or our own Emeril Lagasse, if you wish). Both will rhapsodize at length over the qualities of a nice thick layer of fat on a chop from an artisinally raised hog.For those of you who do not like \`chatty' cookbooks, both of these books may be preferable to the very discursive \`Appetite', although both of these books do have their share of culinary poetry before the recipe details. Neither book is as extreme as \`Appetite' in the direction of teaching us to cook without a book. You can easily pick out a recipe from these books and make them without a lot of background reading or culinary skill. But never confuse \`simple' with \`easy' or \`fast'. While Slater may do the Rachel Ray gig in other books, these books have their share of slow marinades and braises. They also have their share of whisking, filtering, and thickening techniques.The other side of the coin is that Slater's palate is extremely simple. Aside from his protein or starch of choice, few of his ingredients go far beyond the simple pantry of milk, cream, butter, basic cheeses, parsley, flour, lemon, lime, bacon, sage, thyme, bay, bread, olive oil, rice, stock, garlic, and mushrooms. Unlike Sir Jamie, Slater is about as down home English cooking as Paula Deen is about Savannah cooking.The biggest difficulty an American is likely to have with Slater's recipes is that they are all make heavy use of metric units for weight and larger volumes in place of ounces, pounds, and cups. Even though I was a chemist thoroughly familiar with the metric system, I had to dig out a good conversion table to remind myself that a pound was about 450 grams. A lesser difficulty may be with Slater's names for common food varieties such as potatoes, although he almost always specifies \`waxy' or \`floury' potatoes rather than the English varietal name.The other main difficulty with Slater's recipes is that they are all paradigms of high fat, high sodium, and high cholesterol preparations. They are definitely dishes to be eaten when the occasion calls for serious comfort food.If you like Jamie Oliver or Nigella Lawson, you will really like Slater!"},{"Title":"Nigel Slater's Real Food","review":"I have four books of Nigel's and this will be my fifth. I love his cook books. I love his style of writing especially when I'm cooking, its almost as if he is standing right beside me telling me what to do next. Alot of the recipes remind me of growing up in England and there is a certain amount of nostalgia associated with the recipes. All in all, a great cook book."},{"Title":"Nigel Slater's Real Food","review":"Nigel Slater writes with a passion for food that is highly inspiring. His recipes are relatively straight-forward, with an emphasis on fine ingredients prepared simply. Everything I have prepared has been delicious first-time and increasingly more delicious with each subsequent attempt. This volume offers some great classics arranged by food type. The downside to this is that there are some key foods that do not feature (e.g. beef, rice), so don't expect this to be your only reference. Be warned: Slater's recipes are not for the overly weight conscious. He puts flavor ahead of everything else, with generous use of fats and sugars (but only the best available of course!)."},{"Title":"Nigel Slater's Real Food","review":"Nigel Slater is a real cook.

They all are wonderful. They assume that the reader knows a whisk from a wine opener and has at least a passing interest in making and eating great food. The health-food craze, the move toward low-fat, low-salt, low-this or low-that (and hence no fun) is acknowledged but not adhered to. Slater's emphasis is on good food. If that means adding a walnut sized knob of butter or eating a somewhat large amount of bacon, then so be it. My one objection, and it's really my own fault (He is from England, after all), is that the version I purchased is the English edition, and all of the measurements are in the metric system. Maddening but not a disaster. I also highly recommend \\"Appetite\\", a similar book...all in all a great book."},{"Title":"Nigel Slater's Real Food","review":"I return to Nigel Slater's cookbook, Appetite over and over again.

The onomatopoeia here I have used with native Japanese speakers and all are understood and expressive.I study Japanese to talk to my peers, to go out drinking, to watch and understand television, to tell jokes and offer conjecture. I don't study the language in order to make hotel reservations or constantly conjugate in an unnaturally polite fashion. Likewise, I spend time in Osaka and Nara, where people say \\"okini\\" and \\"nanbo\\", so the occasional kansai-ben is welcome.Just this week I memorized casual sentances like \\"You don't look so hot\\", \\"When I got up this morning i felt a little woozy\\", \\"yeah, it's the pits all right\\" and \\"It's not like I drank too much last night - maybe I'm getting old\\". Do these really NOT sound useful? Do you never hear this sort of language in English?These dialogues are AUTHENTICALLY casual, and they alternate between male and female. As a supplement that absolutely ROCKS - after all, 99% of Japanese-language learning material is polite and contrived... great for learning grammar and basic structure, but once you get to Japan you realize you can't understand anyone.I was in New York and I used the phrase \\"shimijimi\\" with a Japanese woman and she smiled and asked - \\"How do know THAT? I don't even know how to say that in English.\\" The sentence I used translated as \\"I was getting a little sentimental...\\"This is a SUPPLEMENT, not a textbook, and a fairly advanced one, but emminently usable. It takes work to memorize and put into practice, but when I used 'berobero' and 'gongon' in conversations my friends unanimously agreed that Japanese folks use these phrases all the time. What else could you want?this book was previously published as \\"Flip, Slither and Bang\\", which was a physically smaller edition, easier just to drop in a pocket. I would recommend this if you plan on hanging out in Japan, spending time with friends - it might be too much if you just need ask where the bathroom is."},{"Title":"Jazz Up Your Japanese with Onomatopoeia: For All Levels","review":"Originally published by Kodansha as Flip, Slither and Bang: Japanese Sound and Action Words as part of their Power Japanese series, this volume has undergone a makeover for the 21st century. Fukuda has added a useful overview introduction, and revision quizzes, both of which should help key Japanese onomatopoeia stick in your head.And there's a lot to remember. While Japanese has appropriated Chinese script for most of its conceptual words, and promiscuously borrowed from English and other languages for more recent phenomena such as computers, it can be proud of the homegrown nature of its pervasive onomatopoeia - not to mention their expressive \`punch'. While in English, such words are often associated with animal noises and children's tales, Japanese uses onomatopoeia widely, in anything from literature to everyday adult conversations, and to express everything from a simple sound to a complex emotional state. What English often uses metaphor to express, Japanese gets across with onomatopoeia. Wanwan may indeed be the sound of a Japanese doggy, but mukamuka means seriously cheesed off, gennari means worn out, and sesseto means as regular as clockwork. Adult enough for you?Fukuda's introduction helps the learner contextualise the different forms and uses of Japanese onomatopoeia. This, along with an overall book structure based around situational dialogues, creates a fairly structured learning approach. As usual with a book focusing on one aspect of language, there is the temptation to pack in as many target expressions as possible until the dialogues become a bit buyobuyo (bloated). But apart from this, the language is very natural (in fact, \`too' natural for the beginner, who should first be learning standard Japanese verb forms, for instance). The dialogues are followed by clear explanations of the target onomatopoeia and example sentences. All text is provided in original Japanese (with furigana readings) plus an English translation, while the dialogues also come in a romanised form for the less able reader. Helpful cultural notes are also scattered throughout the text.The quizzes at the end of each section review the onomatopoeia, and the handy indexes allow you to find both Japanese and English definitions, so you can locate a particular expression you've heard in Japanese, or find an equivalent for the English concept you want to get across, independently of the dialogue contexts. Note though that this book is not a substitute for a dictionary of onomatopoeia, as it chooses to be selectively detailed rather than comprehensive.Jazz Up Your Japanese with Onomatopoeia is subtitled For All Levels, which I think is a little ambitious, as much of the material would be overwhelming for neophytes. But this very density of information is a boon for the more advanced student. It will reward close study by significantly enhancing your knowledge of an underemphasised aspect of Japanese language that in many ways embodies the Japanese mindset."},{"Title":"Jazz Up Your Japanese with Onomatopoeia: For All Levels","review":"Great book. It is a small book, but done in a manner that you can very quickly retrieve any information you might need as for all sorts of onomatopoeia and reduplications in modern day Japanese.

The introduction of the book also gives an excellent description and analysis of the nature of Japanese onomatopoeia. Highly recommended.Ivan Rorick"},{"Title":"Jazz Up Your Japanese with Onomatopoeia: For All Levels","review":"This book claims to be &quot;For all levels,&quot; which in my opinion it isn't. It also claims to be a book on Japanese onomatopoeia.The Japanese sentences are in my opinion way too hard to a beginning student, so if your Japanese is still very basic it is of limited usefulness.50% of the dialogue in chapter 2 is in kansai dialect, which i find a bit tedious. If i wanted to learn kansai-ben I'd buy a book on it (infact i'm planning to).The biggest annoyance however is the inclusion of romaji, which is near universal in books on Japanese-language. (but 2 wrongs doesn't make 1 right so i allow myself to complain about this too). Each dialogue is first presented in Japanese script with furigana, then a romaji version, and then English. If there'd been no romaji version in between I wouldn't have had to keep flipping pages all the time to get to the English translation. It's a matter of course that people who don't even know kana can't possibly benefit much from this book. (assuming they're as new to speaking and listening as they are to writing and reading.)That's it for the negative stuff. Anyhow, I do strongly recommend this book to intermediate students of Japanese who're looking to improve both their understanding of the nature of Japanese onomatopoeia, and their vocabulary. I would've given it 5 stars had it not been for the ulcer-inducing romanization, the somewhat lack of focus at times, etc."},{"Title":"Jazz Up Your Japanese with Onomatopoeia: For All Levels","review":"This book can be useful for learning onomatopoeia words but you can quite easily find them in a good dictionary.The big problem with this book is its simply takes the Japanese language and tries to conjure up a sentence so complex that its just boderline stupid. The realtiy is that no japanese person I have ever met talks in such a ridiculous manner and you'll simply make yourself look stupid talking like this.For example a sentence like; \\"my wife always bawls me out because I'm no good at pinching pennies\\"seriously, who talks like that in real life? Nobody. This book could have given examples that made use of the onomatopoeia's without making the sentence sound so ridiculously silly and over the top.Unless you're an experienced student with a desire to conjure up the most silly and ridiculous sounding sentences imaginable you'd be best to avoid this book"},{"Title":"Common Sense of Teaching Reading and Writing","review":"As a School Librarian, I have considered many reading/intervention/incentive programs and always feel that they rely on a kind of magic to stick for new readers and ones that struggle.

Children learn to read \\"despite school\\" rings true for me and I wanted to understand why he thought this. Gattegno also argued that teaching the alphabet is actually a road block to literacy.

Grace is more effective in letting us learn about the other characters than writing in the third person, as the author did for the first book, The Strangled Witness. Grace doesn't hesitate to give the reader her opinion of those around her.Grace is in April Harbor for the summer. Her father was one of the two lawyers who drew up the charter for the April Harbor Association 30 years before. Grace is 38 now, so she's been spending summers here for a long time. Her late husband, Dick, died in a plane crash eight years ago, leaving Grace with two boys to bring up. The boys are now old enough that they're not with her this time, which is just as well.The author is good at sketching out the characters, although the 1930s attitudes about race and social class are grating. Of course the foreign woman that Jim Gould married just isn't as classy as the American girl he was going to marry. (Wait for the village gossip's ideas about what their stillborn child was like...) Then his old love returns to April Harbor with a rich and handsome fiance in tow.Although beautiful Sandra Gould has improved since her marriage, thanks to her mother-in-law, she's not a real lady, which she loses no time in proving as soon as she meets the also beautiful Rosemary Bishop. (Naturally, Rosemary's brand of beauty makes Sandra's look common.)Grace is completely out of her depth when murder is committed. How she wishes that she had agreed to take in an aunt and uncle when the Chetwynds -- who had all of their aunts and uncles come uninvited the same weekend they had invited two guests -- asked her to. No, Grace took in the guests. Some people might think it's very handy to have a couple of special inquiry agents around when foul deeds are being committed. Grace doesn't, and neither does the murderer.This is one of those cases where so many people are busy lying to protect someone else that it's not surprising that Colonel Primrose wishes they'd tell him the truth. I did love the telling off he gave them.He also wishes that Grace would follow his advice. Not even getting shot at seems to really bring it home to her that the killer isn't just probably someone she knows -- that person might kill again.The descriptions are good and -- racism, sexism, & society snootiness aside -- the view into the past is interesting. I got a chuckle out of what Grace tells the colonel at the end. I also like the fact that she's not husband-hunting, no matter what some people might think.If you like old-fashioned society mysteries and can grit your teeth through the displays of unenlightened attitudes, you should find this book fun."},{"Title":"Nonlinear Pricing: Published in association with the Electric Power Research Institute","review":"This is the most detailed monography on nonlinear pricing that one can get nowadays.

It goes on to help you understand some of the basic ways each can accomplish specific tasks. Without going into extraneous details (which would require several books to cover), Ms. Ulrich gives a broad and lucid overview of how to make sense of these programs to create well-conceived website design.This is actually her stong point in this book - the conception of how to create the kind of website which will best express and realize the goal you desire. She helps you visualize (with the help of many good examples) what might or might not work for you, and how to evaluate it for yourself.After having read the excellent &quot;Dreamweaver 4 -Virtual Classroom&quot; which she co-authored with Robert Fuller, and several other Dreamweaver books, I had some of the technical abilities to create cool stuff. However I hadn't had any overview of design, and felt a little overwhelmed by the possibilities. &quot;Web Design - Virtual Classroom&quot; cleared a lot up for me, and I now feel a lot more confident about being able to create sites that won't look like a Jackson Pollock hangover."},{"Title":"Web Design Virtual Classroom","review":"I bought Ms. Ulrich's Using Excel 2000 last year, and found her writing to be very readable, and her knowledge to be extensive.

The book is great, again in her very friendly, readable style, and the CD is informative too. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to design a web site for business or personal use, and to anyone trying to figure out which software to use and how to go about the whole web design process. Her insights and practical advice are terrific, and I really learned a lot about a subject I thought I already knew."},{"Title":"Web Design Virtual Classroom","review":"Just leafing through this book I got so many good ideas.

Now I know some of the &quot;rules&quot; and also know when it's OK to break them. The ideas for how different people and businesses can use web sites was also an eye-opener, and it's clear that this author really knows a lot about marketing and graphic design, not just about the web.

And, in addition to the anger I feel for the endless laziness in this man's attitude toward clarity and punctuation (for example: he either doesn't know the difference between two, too, and to, or doesn't care), I feel a great deal of sadness. The world really needs to learn about this topic and move in this direction. In fact, I spent many months working with an engineer to build a house based on this design, and came to feel that much of what we have believed about solar heating borders on silliness. Last spring I spent many hours reading about all of the sophisticated experiments by MIT, and realized that thousands of hours had gone into experiments with tech-heavy approaches that almost always proved impractical. Then, I learn about earth tubes and little by little come to understand that this is what the MIT faculty and students should have been studying all along. And it is what someone who can write well should have been working on. So, I cannot express my contempt for Hait's writing any stronger without getting obscene (one reason I had to work with an engineer is that it is practically impossible to figure out the details from Hait's book), but I cannot find an alternative.

She gives footnote and reference after reference proving that she was not just spouting this information off the top of her head, she gave a well researched and developed presentation of the materials she researched and I found that that is more than you can say about other books that have been written.

Starkey has gathered myriad sources on the Salem Witch Trials and managed to put together a cohesive account which is neither dry nor dense. Though written in 1949, it is comprehensible to the modern reader and also fascinating. Starkey has taken great care not to fabricate action or dialogue in order to add drama to her tale; she hardly needs to. She has copied entire sections of dialogue from court reports and detailed diaries of eyewitnesses to the trials.Starkey also claims in her introduction that she has tried to apply some 'modern psychology' to the major players in the conflict, but I saw little evidence of that. There was definitely some borderline personality disorder among the 'afflicted girls,' most notably Abigail Williams.Overall, an engaging and informative non-fiction work."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"I liked this book.

One complaint I have seen is the inaccuracy of this book, however, I have seen many inaccuracies in many things.

I very much enjoyed this book, and reccomend adding this to your Salem library."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"First of all, Starkey is not a historian she is a journalist who were interested writing about the witchcraft. The book was more like a novel (with lots of drama) than arguments or explain why did the Salem Witchcraft evoked during the year of 1692. She focused on the trials and what the characters did, but she did not explain or argued why certain characters, such as Ann Putnam, did what she did during the outbreak of witchcraft. If you are interested reading about the Salem witchcraft, instead of trying to understand what really happened, this would be a good book for you. Besides that, I don't recommened anyone reading it unless you like drama, because at the end of her book she complicated the story with her opinions and random facts."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"The Devil in Massachusetts is based on the Salem Witch Trials, one of the most interesting things in U.S. History, the author just made it very boring and from her own understanding of the Witch Trials. This book is designed to be read for college level students. First of all, the different chapters in the book were very confusing, a different character a chapter then bringing back up the same character after many chapters. Although she does provide enough information leading to the trials and what happened afterwards, however it was plain and very hard to follow. For example, who was John Indian? She keeps mentioning him on and off, which got me confused of whom and what he stands for in the book. Overall, Starkey's view of the witch craft hysteria was confusing and very boring; though it had a lot of information, it was inaccurate. I'd recommend this book to college level students and to people who have an interest in the witch trials, not of what really happened and what really went on in Salem Town in 1692."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"I find the Salem witch trials to be very interesting and I love learning about them. After reading this book however, I am starting to become turned off by them. I am a woman and personally find woman writers to usually be enjoyable. This woman should go back to college or maybe even grade school and find out how to write. She uses complicated sentences that make no sense (you'll need a dictionary or another person to help you out with the meanings of some of her 20-word sentences). Do yourself a favor, pick a different book."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"While this book, first published in 1949, is very readable, the serious student will be chagrined by it's factual errors.The writing style makes for a pleasant read, and Ms. Starkey does give the researcher clues where to find the real facts, but for the most part, read this book with a grain of salt.For instance, Ms. Starkey tells us that Lady Mary Phips was the widow of her own father... that the infamous George Burroughs was good at raising molasses kegs with 2 fingers... (the story is a MUSKET not molasses!)The errors continue into even more important realms. (Such as which Nehemiah Abbot was released by virtue of the 'afflicted' deciding they had 'the wrong man' - young Abbot's eloquent defense and calm demeanor should not be negated nor glossed over - or worse - attributed to another man!)On and on, one error after another.Frankly, as often as this book is used as a reference, I'm surprised someone else hasn't pointed out the poor research!"},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"I first read, &quot;The Devil in Massachusetts&quot; in the late1960s as part of a colonial history course. Having also an interest in psychology at that time, I was impressed with the story of the mass-hysteria and the book made a lasting impression on me.I re-read the book following a visit to Salem, Massachusetts this summer. I had noticed the same mass-hysteria involving false charges of child-sexual abuse along with the recovered memory movement during the 1980s an 1990s. Although Starkey necessarily presents her tale against a background of religion and religious delusions, the contempory mass-hysteria has no apparent connection to religion but the reactions of the public (society) shows a distrubing duplication of the process of hysterical contagion.Once a &quot;cause&quot;, whether it be sexual abuse, gun control or other &quot;hot-button&quot; issue, is pushed into the limelight and kept there by fanatics of whatever stripe, abetted and given publicity by the media, the society (public) has almost a religious need to curtail critical thinking, accept accusation as proven fact, believe stories of impossible events and destroy their fellow citizens without compunction.And that is the horror that is demonstrated by Starkey's work; and the naivete of the old, standby reassurances, &quot;It couldn't happen in this day and age&quot;, &quot;It could never happen here&quot;."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"Using her knowledge of psychology and psychoanalogy, Starkey gives us an interesting look at the 1692-93 Salem witch trials. Rather than using a boring textbook format, Marion turns the entire event into a story. A story that, while sometimes questionable, is undoubtedly entertaining.&quot;The Devil in Massachussets&quot; is both a fair resource and a good novel. Put simply, it's worth buying."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"I recently became interested in Salem Witch trials and related subjects, and Starkey's \\"The Devil in Massachusetts\\" was recommended to me as a starting point. And, it was an interesting read. It is the first book to which I would read about the witch trials in 1692 Salem.I also find it interesting to learn about the reactions from the locals and authorities to hysteria or paranoia regarding \\"witches\\" in Salem and relating tales. It involved a look at the social background from both accused and the accusers during this time period. It almost reminds me of reading about the mass hysteria of Chinese society of 1768 in Philip Kuhn'sSoulstealers: The Chinese Sorcery Scare of 1768.This book was first published in 1949, and it is roughly 300 pages with twenty-two chapters. The writing style almost read as a historical scholarly article as it is almost wordy. However, the information lies within interests me to inquire further on the subject to which the \\"selected bibliography\\" was helpful for starting a research.In my opinion, it is very informative reading, and it is certainly shows one example of a mass hysteria that can happen in any town or society."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"I normally don't like books like this, especially books that pass themselves of as scholarly. However, I've always been interested in the Salem Witch Trials, and Starkey's &quot;Devil in Massachusetts&quot; is definitely not to be overlooked.This may not be the best, or the most thorough account of the trials, but if you're looking for the basics, as well as a little background info, &quot;Devil&quot; provides a very intriguing and interesting read. At times, Starkey's wording and verbosity seem a little exhaustive and can be overlooked. But for the brunt of it, Starkey provides enough information to justly conclude what did happen in Salem, what caused it, and the events that followed.Be scholarly, verbose reads your cup of tea or not, if you're looking for some great, solid information on the bleakest event of undemocratic justice ever to stain American history, Marion Starkey's &quot;Devil in Mass.&quot; will definitely shed some reason and light on the &quot;bubble, bubble, toil and trouble&quot; of the Salem Witch Trials."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"This book would be a good basis for a TV movie on the Lifetime channel. It may be based on solid primary sources, but it is written like a non-fiction novel full of conjecture and theory using the basic facts as a foundation. In other words, it is not good reference material; a good book to give an overall story line, but that would be it, hence the three star rating.Starkey raised my eyebrow with his Preface comment, \\"Only twenty witches were excecuted,\\" as he compared what happened in Puritan New England to the rest of the world. When speaking of Dorcas Goode, the five year old sent to prison for eight months, he almost implies that she deserved her fate. While this may be his methodology for being frank and blunt about a serious subject, perhaps wanting to stir the emotions of the reader, I found it a bit callous, if not dismissive--which might have been his goal.From a scholar point of view, he provides no background, and simply starts at the beginning of the hysteria with the \\"illnesses\\" that afflicted Betty Parris and Abigail Williams. He ignored Ann Putnam, the older of the \\"original three afflicted\\" who kept the hysteria going, especially with her dramatics at each of the examinations.Again, I give it three stars just because it provides a shallow start for further investigation and relatively easy read. Sort of a \\"if you read one book on the Salem Witch Trials, you've read them all\\" category."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"Caveats out of the way first: yes, there are some factual inaccuracies in this riveting account of the Salem witchcraft hysteria. Fifty additional years of research will inevitably alter the record. And yes, by virtue of the same fifty years of additional work, certain of Marion Starkey's interpretations (by no means all) are now generally considered to be superseded.All that admitted, what a gem this book is! I read it as a teenager and it demonstrated the possibilities of historical narrative for me as no other book had. The facts of the story are gripping in themselves, of course, and when presented with Starkey's novelistic and dramatic flair, the result is informative, thought-provoking, and exceptionally moving. Starkey wrote this book in the shadow of McCarthyism, the \\"witch hunt\\" of the 1950s, and that lends especial power to her majestic conclusion.Starkey was a most considerable writer (so reading some of the criticisms of her prose here at Amazon is confounding -- we must not be teaching our young people to read complex sentences very well!). Any budding historian or novelist would do well to study her work here most carefully -- for example, the sheer brilliancy of her chapter endings. The Devil in Massachusetts achieves literary status and should be part of any American reader's basic education."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"If I remember correctly, Starkey's book started off as a doctoral thesis. It reads like one, despite her attempt to inject drama into a period of history that needs no such injection. Her modern enquiry is rather dated now, as she used the technique of Freudian analysis to explain away the hysteria surrounding the trials and to explain how something like this could have happened. The psychoanalysis may hit on a grain of truth, but a lot of what she stated was merely conjecture. I would have been more interested to know about the link between the real dangers the Puritans faced (dangers over which they had very little control in their new, hostile, strange environment) and their belief system, which left them ripe to believe in imagined ones."},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"It's a clich&eacute;, but I literally could not put this book down once I started it. It's beautifully written, the bare-bones facts fleshed out with details of the appearance and atmosphere of 17th-century Salem. The inexorable and horrifying progress of the witch hunt, which, once begun, became an unstoppable machine, fed by gossip, self-interest, and religious repression, is recounted in day-by-day detail, focusing on the characters of those involved on all sides. It sometimes shows its age--it was originally published in 1950--but very few books today show such mastery of style in historical writing. It was an influential book in its time, serving as source material for Arthur Miller in his play \\"The Crucible,\\" which he wrote as a cautionary parable about the figurative witchhunting of the McCarthy era. It's a tale of a time and place when persons could be imprisoned without benefit of counsel for indefinite periods, when a word of protest could bring accusations of treason, when powerful, well-connected people could influence the course of justice, when the forces of religious and political intolerance walked abroad in the land. Does this sound familiar?"},{"Title":"The Devil in Massachusetts: A modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials (Dolphin books)","review":"This book takes the Witchcraft in Salem through the entire process from the beginning to end. It takes each of the people involved and brings the reader into their lives to see what happened. The analysis is at a minimum and the content is there to draw one's own conclusions. This is what I like."},{"Title":"Heretic's Heart: A Journey through Spirit and Revolution","review":"I loved this book. I am a few years younger than Margo Adler--and I was always about four years years too young to experience the high points of the Sixties directly. Too young to hitch to Woodstock or go to San Francisco for the Beatles last performance, let alone the Summer of Love! Yet, reading Adler's book, I felt I was there. She is articulate and well-spoken, and can breathe life into those years for those of us who were a little too young to participate, and were always left out. Her correspondence with Mark Anderson made my hair stand up on end, not only because of its evocation of the era (and its &quot;The Way We Were&quot; pairing of two very different people), but because it played out like a precursor of a modern Internet romance. Despite the distance between Margot and Mark, despite the fact that they could not meet in person for years, they &quot;connected,&quot; and formed formed a strong, passionate bond that enriched both their lives. I highly recommend this book for more reasons that I have space to describe here. Older boomers, read it to recall a time you lived through; younger boomers, read it to experience a time you may have missed; the rest of you guys, just read it! It's not &quot;just&quot; about the Sixties, it's about love and friendship having the power to transcend even a war that was tearing the country apart."},{"Title":"Heretic's Heart: A Journey through Spirit and Revolution","review":"Ms. Adler's book gave me an insight into a time that (I am embarrased to say) I never cared about before.

The Newberry is an attempt (a very good one) to allow you to observe the true literal retranslations of the actual texts based on translations from a concordance. They are embedded within the writing of the Newberry right where the word would be found. It makes no attempt to try to persuade you to any type of belief system. Rather it displays the actual re-translation of text right on the page. Beware however...if you are looking to prove false doctrine you may find yourselves at odds with this book. It may even change the way you perceive your faith. You will find that it is a wonderful study tool as well as an indespensible tool for putting your teachings together. If you strive to find the real truth you will need this book."},{"Title":"Newberry Reference Bible: Single Column Edition","review":"I recommend the single column edition bec. it has more english notes.

This peaceful item intrigued me and I wanted to learn more about this modern master. Just in time to quench my curiosity, Nature, Form, and Spirit: Abrams published The Legacy of George Nakashima. Lavishly illustrated with archival photos of the family home, vintage catalogs, working drawings, plus new photos of classic pieces this oversized hardcover is a great addition to your library.Written by his daughter Mira, Nature, Form, and Spirit showcases Nakashima's sparse strong furniture as well as his architecture. Vital, collectable, and contemporary Nakashima's furniture is memorable for its simple designs hewn from monumental pieces of wood. Represented in museum collections around the world Nakashima was declared a national treasure by the Japanese Emperor in 1983.Although he is deceased, the Nakashima legacy continues as Mira Nakashima continues to produce her father's bold and original designs.

He was the first to embrace the whole tree, which I try to remember whenever I work with wood.As I have mentioned in other reviews I appreciate the skill but also the philosophy and spirit.We also learn that Mira is now in her own element, and the experiences of growing up with Mr. Nakashima that educated her by experience."},{"Title":"Nature Form & Spirit: The Life and Legacy of George Nakashima","review":"This was a gift to our son.

I did a library request for it (I do that with all books first so I can see if I want to buy it or not.. I loved it so, I waited until it got to a lower price. Never went below $50 so I sprang on it ( it does go up and down) with Xmas $'s I got..OK, enough about the book..Now the packaging.. This was a $50 book that came in an oversized box (yes I get it you can't carry a size for every different item you carry) with 8\\" open on one side, 4\\" on the other and 4 inches on height. This is all over and beyond the book size. Oh, they did pack one each 3 block inflatable ...what do you call it..? packing 'thing'. Oh and the middle one was flat.. nothing else in the box for cushioning. So when you pick up the box, you can feel the book inside sliding to and from..Great, did I say this was a $50 book? So I find the dust cover ripped a little at the lower binding area and a little dinged on the upper borders. We all remember the old Samsonite luggage commercial with the Gorilla tossing the suitcase all around his/her cage to show how indestructible their product is..well think that when you think of postal shipping and travel. I don't blame them at all..well maybe if it arrived as a sponge or briquet or whatever but to not be packaged properly to begin with..Some serious consideration needs to be given to the lowest paid worker in the shipping department and their chain of command re: the product preparation..Yes I know, I'm only a customer and its not like there are a billon more like me but its my hard earned money thats paying big bucks for a book ( or whatever) like this so get your s#^& together..This has happened several times before so I'm not going to be polite here..

(Novelisations did not recommence until 1973 under the Target banner.)The Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki arrive in twelfth century Palestine, and are soon split up: Barbara is captured by the Saracens, while the rest fall in with King Richard the Lionhearted. While Ian is knighted and dispatched with a message to Saladin and to rescue Barbara, the Doctor and Vicki are caught up in court intrigue. Given the way things go, one could argue which of them is in the most danger.Strong characterisation by David Whitaker (author of both the original script and this book) makes this book a very good read (sadly, we only have half of the story still existing on video), and yet again demonstrates that the historical stories were often very good, exceeding the science fiction stories in some cases.This book is illustrated by line drawings.

It draws on the work of Wilfrid Sellars and Robert Brandom, and articulates claims of meaning as normative rather than descriptive. Along the way, and perhaps most important, there is a discussion of the nature of normativity. Although this book requires a background in philosophy in order to understand, it has enormous implications for recent philosophical debate. Taking the Wittgensteinian idea that normativity arises within our practices, the authors develop a perspective that is not merely suggestive (as Wittgenstein often was) but thoroughly discussed and defended. By rights, this book, alongside Brandom's Making it Explicit, should set the parameters for philosophical discussion of language and normativity for years to come."},{"Title":"Lost City of the Incas: The Story of Machu Picchu and Its Builders","review":"I recently came back from Machu Picchu and had an interest in learning about its discovery directly from Hiram Bingham. I thought it was overall an interesting read. A majority of the book gives you a history of the Incas and how they fell from power. Hiram also speaks about his desire to locate what he knew to be Vilcabamba, the last Inca holdout before the Spanish Conquistadors ended the Inca rule for good. It's important to note that although it's mentioned in Hiram's book, some of his theories about the purpose of Machu Picchu were later disputed. The most important one was the fact that Machu Picchu was NOT the last stronghold of Tupac Amaru.I know some people disagree over whether it's better to read the book before or after visiting Machu Picchu, but I'm honestly glad I read it after my trip. It was interesting to go through the last chapter on his excavations and think to yourself: &#34;I know EXACTLY where he's talking about!&#34; I can picture his route there because the trip was still fresh in my mind and I had a great understanding of the altitude and appreciation for climbing through the jungle for more than an hour to get to the top of Machu Picchu. The most interesting read to me was about his companion who attempted to climb Huayna Picchu. I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to climb it during my trip and that was honestly the most challenging thing I've ever done. Huayna Picchu is a vertical hike and it took tremendous effort to climb all the way to the top. That makes me appreciate the time it took Bingham's companion, Mr. Heald, to get there even more. Apparently Mr. Heald had to cut his way through lots of jungle and fell at one point, badly hurting his arm. When I got to the top of Huayna Picchu I saw lots of home structures built into the side of the mountain. What I find most fascinating is the fact that Hiram Bingham mentions that when he and his men first explored Huayna Picchu in 1912 there were NO structures on Huayna Picchu, simply several stairs, a few terraces and three caves. That means all of the home structures on Huayna Picchu were built later by the modern Peruvian government.The best part of the book, however, were copies of original photos taken by Hiram Bingham in 1912. You get to see what Machu Picchu looked like when he discovered the ruins and began his excavations. It's amazing to compare his photos side-by-side with what the Peruvian government has done today. Several of the structures were literally rebuilt but there are still a few that haven't been touched and are in their original form from 600+ years ago. At least one of the structures is an altar that the Inca used for animal sacrifices. The right portion of the structure has crumbled, and I easily spotted it in Bingham's original photo. I'm pleased to say that as of 2012 there were no changes and it looked exactly as it did when Hiram saw it in 1911.For any history buff, this is certainly a good read. It's perfect for the Machu Picchu visitor."},{"Title":"Lost City of the Incas: The Story of Machu Picchu and Its Builders","review":"A good, although rather in depth, book for visitors to Inca sites in Peru.

Some of it was tedious georgraphical details that made very slow reading.

He was actually a professor (and political representative) that went to Peru to increase his knowledge about South American history for teaching purposes. He decided to go back with a team of experts to try and find the lost city of the incas. And he did find it! It is great \\"adventure\\" reading...hiking through jungles, steep and dangerous terrain, exploring a long forgotten (and uncharted) area of Peru.He also shares a lot of history about the incas in the book. We \\"owe\\" a lot to them. For instance, they domesticated/cultivated some of the common agriculural foods we still eat today. And they domesticated the guinea pig. Your kids can thank the incas for their furry little pet!If you are considering visiting Peru and Machu Pichu, I'd highly recommend this book. It is a great starting point to learning more about this country and culture."},{"Title":"Lost City of the Incas: The Story of Machu Picchu and Its Builders","review":"This book is valuable for many reasons. First and foremost, it presents us with the views and attitudes of one of the world's foremost anthropologist-explorers from the beginning of the 20th century. This means lots and lots of passion and enthusiasm, a willingness to risk one's life in pursuit of an elusive goal and an ability to follow one's gut instincts. All traits which, sadly, have practically dissapeared from modern anthropology. In addition, of course, the book is permeated with the spirit of the times (1910-40ies) - which means patronizing attitudes toward the natives (the \\"savages\\", who for the most part clearly resented the tasks of having to clear the jungle, build bridges across impassable rapids and climb hills infested with snakes) and an eurocentric view of the world which now seems a bit naive.All this being said, I must emphasize that this book is a treasure and a must read for anyone about to visit Macchu Picchu - if only to contrast the conditions encountered by Bingham and his Indians to those that exist today, when busloads of clueless tourists are delivered straight to the Temple of the Sun. The first third of the book consists of a superb Introduction including a recapitulation of the16th century records of the Incas and their empire (including the awesome Pachakuti Inca), very competent review of Inca technology (many of their and an excellent recapitulation of the life stories of the last 4 Incas. The last part describes the actual \\"discovery\\" of Macchu Picchu which occured by procuring, for a silver coin, the services of Anacleto Alvarez, a local Qechua who had been living among the ruins all along. Macchu Pichu therefore had never been truly \\"lost\\" and \\"discovery\\" has in this context many interesting connotations.For my part, I have a respect for Bingham and for his guts that served him so well. In time, for example, they led him to the US Senate (from Connecticut). I suspect it will take many a pachakuti (turning of the Wheel of Time) till another anthropologist gets an opportunity to represent Democracy and the People."},{"Title":"Lost City of the Incas: The Story of Machu Picchu and Its Builders","review":"This book tells the gripping story of the discovery of Machu Piccu. Although Bingham is an academic archaeologist he appears to be belong to the Indiana Jones school. As a travel book it is a gem - Bingham travels through uncharted teritory in the outback of Peru at teh beginning of the century. He risks his life climbing the steep hillsides to Machu Piccu after getting a tip from a local farmer. But the book is also full of detail on the finds he made at the site. It is an insight into the ways of the Inca, and the archaeologist. Although it can be a bit dry in places - the lists of finds at Machu Piccu - Bingham makes up for this with his absorbing adventure story in the earlier chapters. END"},{"Title":"Lost City of the Incas: The Story of Machu Picchu and Its Builders","review":"Bingham's book was written back in the 1940s. This details his adventures in finding the city of Machi Picchu. The city was never really lost, the Indians knew about it all along. Bingham just brought it to the world's attention. Some of Bingham's theories about the Incas have later been proven false. So if you want the definitive explanation of why Machu Picchu exists, this is not the book. Generally this is a good adventure book and details the last years of the Inca Empire before Francisco Pizarro destroyed it. This is located in the first part of the book, which is interesting. The second half of the book details his theories, some of which have been proven false.

His readings of the original Spanish conquistadores and explorers suggested there were more never found by the Europeans and he returned with an adventurous expedition. In 1911, on his own with a couple of local Indian farmers who were quietly using the land, he found the ruins of Machu Picchu high in the Andes under jungle overgrowth. Thus he ushered in the new era in Incan scholarship, 20th century adventurous exploration, archeology and, what he did not imagine at the time, tourism.Bingham wrote THE LOST CITY OF THE INCAS with verve nearly 30 years after his achievement. To its credit, it is not riddled with hindsight but offers an immediacy of perspective. He begins with a very lucid, unbiased reading of the end of the Incan empire by the Europeans who leveled it. Bingham then recounts his own adventures in the discovery and subsequent archeological efforts, after which he provides a gloss on Incan culture as understood in those first digs. Bingham's narrative never bogs, even among the dryer material. The book stirs with wonder. Bingham may have been an ambitious man but his ambitions in this context are all about furthering knowledge for all.The only reason to nick a star in the rating: datedness. Thanks to Bingham's inspiration, Incan studies perpetuate and some of his conclusions are no longer current. Though in one section he refers to native Indians as \\"savages,\\" the book is largely and refreshingly free of elitism. He struck a deal with Peru to remove artifacts for study at Yale, with the stipulation that Peru could have them back when it wanted them.

(yawn!) Not this book. Once opened, it is difficult to close! Deductive, descriptive, and imaginatively proscriptive, it spans both verticality and horizontality; depth and bredth, not only citing but insighting. True, he does define &quot;invisible&quot; as &quot;not visible&quot;, but how less reasonable is this than defining &quot;connected&quot; as &quot;not disconnected&quot; as is done in topology? Please note that in both cases the words have techical meanings whose understanding is quite independent of a sense of humor. That is the beauty of Dr Raskins work. Please read and take note of his ZIP world, an important idea whose execution is hopefully as immanent as the object of his 67' thesis on the usable, object-oriented, platform-independent graphical interface? Read this book. This man has vision. He describes the way HCI ought to be and would a' been in a &quot;revisionists&quot; history ( i.e. &quot;second vision&quot; (see 67' thesis)and also if Apple had ruled w/Raskin as it's HCI guy))."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"The author of this book was my prof at UCSD. I was looking forward to reviewing his book. I was satisfied"},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"The book is reasonably well written and has some interesting ideas.Unfortunately the whole concept behind the book is flawed.I've been using computers for 40 very productive years and havehad numerous attempts at \\"interfaces\\" inflicted on me. I have tosay that the ideas of Don Norman and Jef Raskin are probably thereason why I cannot use an Apple computer. I felt that the Appleinterface is too \\"user-affectionate\\" but Jef has shown me thereal root of the problem.Jef argues that the user interface should be \\"noun-verb\\", that is,you identify the thing and then do something to it. However, ifyou use any tool you'll find that you \\"cut the board\\", not\\"the board, cut\\". You naturally do \\"verb-noun\\"; at least I do.And as I think about it, all USEFUL tools I use on a daily basisare verb-noun based.And there is the \\"quantifiable\\" nonsense about putting menus atthe top of the screen (Apple style) because it maximizes the Fittmeasure. Besides the notion that only one menu is of interest(nonsense), there is also the notion that menus are useful at all.I work for weeks without using any menu-based tools.Then there is the idea that the available commands should be visible,another point of nonsense. I have a command prompt which gives meimmediate access to 7,314 commands (per my search) at the moment.Every command is immediately and always available. By GOMS measureI am nearly at the optimal user interface. Anything else, e.g. mice,menus, drag/drop, cut/paste, or any GUI-based interfaces aremeasurably suboptimal. I should point out that I'm a linux command-lineuser. I just type \\"print filename\\" and it prints. How hard is that?Why does that need a menu, an icon, a print-preview, a file-chooser,a printer-chooser, a command-bar, a keyboard shortcut, a help file,a printer configuration wizard, a devices menu, ...Please don't follow Jef's advice. You're only making computers hard to use."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"There are so many books like this one that have been written over the last three decades. And yet hard-to-use computer systems are still produced. I read this book. A few months later someone else told me that I should hand out a chapter to my students at MIT. I made a note to myself to check out this book, having completely forgotten that I'd read it. In fact, it was sitting on a shelf right behind my desk chair!One reason that this book won't have much impact is that it is not available on the Web. Thus university students worldwide will be unlikely to encounter it (professors only assign hardcopy books that can function as a textbook for an entire semester of a standard subject). So the next generation of engineers will be unaware of Raskin's restatement of user interface principles.A deeper reason why this book won't have much impact is that it usually requires a working system to get an idea across. For example, a lot of people learned about good UI by using the Apple Macintosh, not by reading the Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines (though that book was/is extremely lucid).Bottom line: a book on usability that, because it isn't on the Web and isn't organized as a full-term text, isn't usable by 99% of the people who'd be best able to use it."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"This isn't the best book it could have been, but it's well worth reading nonetheless. It would have been better had Raskin taken the time to present an in-depth explanation of the Canon Cat interface, rather than taking it for granted that everyone would know all about it. Those who have seen it know that the Cat interface verges on genius, but the rest will find themselves lost very quickly. Raskin talks about LEAPing (a Cat method of moving the cursor around and selecting text) a lot without ever explaining the concept in sufficient detail to get a sense of how it would feel to use it. Others have criticized the book for its scattershot approach in its second half, where each chapter is basically a separate idea Raskin has without much to tie them together. It's a fair criticism, but I enjoyed this part of the book anyway. A third issue is that Raskin focuses almost entirely on manipulating and organizing text. Some of his ideas (having e-mail automatically stream into your workspace in the middle of what you're working on) are just plain goofy and most of the rest simply aren't applicable to anything much more complicated than basic word processing, spreadsheet, and database tasks. Raskin never even hints at how a single interface might be designed that would allow text to be processed, numbers to be crunched, illustrations to be designed, and movies to be edited seamlessly and without modes, as was the Cat's goal. It's as if the desktop publishing and multimedia revolutions never happened in Raskin's world. The truth is that different tasks demand different ways of working. Raskin no doubt knows this but chose to basically ignore it in this book, perhaps because he's not sure what to do about it. Still a good read, though."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"The positive reviews cover the positive side of this book.The negatives:1) The distinction of noun-verb vs. verb-noun behavior is strange since all his examples of good design are really verb-noun-verb (navigate-select object-perform action on object).2) His section on user customization reveals the sort of 'the designer knows best' arrogance that has traditional brought us such design failures as soviet era archetecture, not to mention untold millions of dollars of unsellable products.3) The worst part of his writing style is that he NEVER (ok make that seldom) describes the trade-offs that real design usually involves. He slams the beginner-expert design efforts without dealing at all with the real tradeoffs necessary. Similarly, icons are dismissed without dealing with the tradeoffs that icon use involves.4) His approach is that of the industrial engineer who measures efficiencies with time and motion studies; after reading this book I have the dstinct impression that using software he designs would be similar to standing in an assembly line all day.5) Very limited discussion of aethetics as they apply to ergonomics. For instance, no (well, very little) discussion of color and how it relates to the human interace; no discussion on fonts and how they relate to eye strain.In general, the book has some good technical information, but writing style and lack of essential coverage of design issues make for pervasive flaws."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"This is a valuable book for two reasons. First, it explains how human cognitive abilities and limitations determine which UI designs will be easy vs. difficult for people to learn and use. It can therefore help to educate those software designers who lack training in cognitive psychology. Second, it challenges longstanding GUI design assumptions, pointing out many ways in which conventional GUIs are actually bad for users. It can therefore point the way for evolution of current-day GUIs into something better.What this book is NOT is a design-guide for creating GUIs that are Windows (or Mac, Motif, or Web) compliant. If that's what you want, you should look elsewhere.My one criticism is that, in my opinion, the book loses steam in its later chapters, becoming a collection (the author calls it a &quot;potpourri&quot;) of Raskin's pet peeves about computers, along with his remedies. For the second edition, these chapters could be tightened up or cut. Nonetheless, the Human Interface should be required reading for every software designer and UI researcher."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"Many of the conclusions presented in this book will seem radical to almost anyone that has used a computer before.Because of his abandonment of convention the resistance to Jefs ideas are profound (even evident in some of the other reviews here on Amazon). He mentions in his book that many times he would create an user interface for a client that was much more efficient than any competitors but the design would be rejected because it was too different from the competition. I felt Jefs core message was not to trust the mistakes of history, think for yourself and define the world you want to live in. If you are scared of been different this book is not for you. If you are willing to hear something new and want an edge in interface design, this is it.While Jef builds his arguments clearly and cleverly some readers may find the discussion a bit deep and I could not recommend this book as a relaxing night time page turner. The mix of physiology and computer science creates some thought provoking ideas and will require the reader to devote a fair amount of thinking time between chapters to fully appreciate. Not for the closed minded, you will need to suspend your initial doubts until you have had time to digest the evidence presented. In most cases, most of his points bear the weight of close scrutiny very well. Many of the negative reviews here clearly show a misunderstanding of Jefs ideas not just disagreement with them.A large portion of the book focuses on the science of user interface. If you are involved in any project that requires user testing, which should be every project, this book provides a core set of useful techniques that are present discreetly from Jefs ideas. Jef uses all of these techniques to provide evidence for his ideas else where in the book. Providing an easy to follow yet incredibly powerful set of tools, this book is a must have for these sections alone.At the end of his life Jef devoted his time to making his dream a reality. The Raskin Center (RCHI) was formed and started development on the Archy Project. After his death the project carries on; using the book as a starting block this, now community driven, project is on the steady march forward. If you want to see some of Jefs ideas in real life or wish to discuss the ideas in the book then check out the website ( &lt;A href=\\"http://rchi.raskincenter.org/\\">http://rchi.raskincenter.org/&lt;/a> ). I have found the forums to be very useful in deepening my understanding of the points raised in the book.While most people will revert to designing computer interfaces in the standard \\"industry\\" fashion because it's easier to think inside the box, I truly hope that this book inspires at least a few to bring us a new world of computers that actually respect the user. Or in other words, computers that use a Humane Interface."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"+ I read this book cover to cover, which is seldom, since I usually have 3 to 8 other books lurking around to make up a certain boredom factor.+ His ideas are radical.+ This books made me aware about the real ugliness of modes (my personal daily mode error counter got installed).+ It made me wish for the global incremental search facility.- His ideas are radical (get the hint?): I doubt that without investment from a major global player in the computing industry, his ideas will just not catch on with the broader public audience, and hackers will dismiss his ideas as being too, well, non-hacker-wise. (Which is of course not a problem with the book, but with our industry in general.)+/- Sometimes the computing world he describes is too text-centered. I will always end up in discussions with my friend on how he wants to get a CAD package working with his ideas.- Sometimes there is this &quot;I'm the guru, you know nothing about computers at all.&quot; attitude.Anyway, you should read it, just to know that there is something else than the button-menu world in GUI design."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I have been interested in interface design since I started programming. I always complained about bad interfaces and praised good and simple interfaces. Very strange among all the techies! I had read a lot of articles and all the GUI guides of MS and Apple. I had a lot of ideas about good design. But I never had the courage to read a full cientific book on the subject. THis was the book that explained everything to me. From the hows and whys of human interaction with machines, to metrics and all the way to crazy ideas. I think it is a fantastic book for beginners or experts. And, if you are a beginner, it will give enough background for you to start serious investigation on your own. It comes with a lot of Bibliographic references that will enable you to continue to study such a passionate subject."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"Jef Raskin presents a good overview of human machine interaction issues in the first few chapters. His superb coverage of interface modes, habit-formation, locus of attention and various worked quantitative analysis methods to measure interaction makes this book well worth its while alone... These are topics which are rarely covered this well.I feel that the author loses focus slightly when he starts to talk about how he would implement a new computer interface. Without good examples, screenshots or user-reports from an implementation of these ideas we are largely left with the author's lengthy textual explananations which are sometimes hard to follow. It seems like the author is trying to make up for having the Macintosh project taken away from him. Constantly referring back to the dated &quot;Canon Cat&quot; which was a project he worked on, gets a bit tiresome; it would have been nice to see more modern applications of the authors ideas, many of which are extremely interesting (the ideas presented explain why nearly everyone finds Windows 2000's &quot;adaptive&quot; menus annoying). Despite this, the book is essential reading for anyone with an interest in human machine / human computer interfaces."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I scoured numerous texts to support a college seminar course in human/computer interaction design. My hunches led me to select this book from among many other excellent books. In retrospect it is one of the best textbook selections I have ever made. The book covers fundamentals of simple human psychology that are both key to good design and that will stay with students for life. It provides practical techniques, design approaches, and measures that students can immediately apply in real life. And it provokes the student (and the professor) to think about programming--not just interface design--in refreshingly radical new ways. In short, this book does everything a great textbook should do, and more. I've been a programmer for 20 years, and it changed *my* view of programming."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I do not know who edits books on interface design but all too often the books are more about &quot;look at how great I am&quot; than thoughtful insights. The beginning of the book offers some good interface guidelines and metrics but around chapter 5 it becomes more about Raskin's ideas than interface design itself. The most laughable is chapter 6-4-3 where he advocates the removal of usernames from login systems to rely simply on passwords. He obviously doesn't understand security and never talked to someone who did before publishing it. He contradicts himself in later chapters with points he makes in the beginning, but if you can look past his constant references to how great his systems are, there is good content in there."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"This book has proved to be a practical and useful one for our business. We develop interactive Web sites.The book discussses easy-to-understand and implement principles that improve usability. For instance, the principle of &quot;monotony.&quot; This does not mean what we generally take it to mean, but it is the idea that people can focus on one thing at time. We broke the tasks of determining a shipping address and billing address into two separate pages and people were much happier.The book also gives many metrics that can be used to quantatize the effort in using an interfaces. We have found these valuable in creating proposals."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"When I told a friend I had bought this book, he said he liked it through chapter four--but that it went rapidly downhill from there.He was right.In those first four chapters, Raskin--the &quot;inventor&quot; of the Macintosh--offers what I think is a terrific introduction to the basics of interface design, cognetics and the quantification of interfaces. I lapped it up, despite Raskin's occasionally convoluted writing style. In fact, it gave me some ideas for a project I had worked on last year.I suspect I'll turn to the first four chapters for reference in the future.But Raskin goes afield, I think, in the latter half of the book. He proposes an entirely new interface for PCs--one that dispenses with file names, directory structures and applications.I'm sure we all agree that the current Windows interface is far from ideal or humane, confusing untold millions and making work more difficult than necessary. But while Raskin's heart and intellect are in the right places, I think his proposed cure is nearly as bad as the disease. I am intrigued, however, by his ZIP or &quot;zooming&quot; navigation approach.So--is this book worth your time (and money)? You'll have to make your own call. If you already have a background in interface design theory, The Humane Interface offers you a view of Raskin's dream for a new interface. On the other hand, if you know little about interface design, you might really enjoy the introduction Raskin offers and appreciate the stimulus his dream interface provides."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"This book provides some simple rules to apply to almost any situation in interaction design. Like Design Patterns, it's very text-editor-centric. Also like Design Patterns, though, that's incidental to the fact that it has a ton of wonderful information to provide within that example that apply much more broadly! It should be required reading for anybody whose code interacts with the user.Unfortunately, it can be a little tough to get a good idea of the tradeoff between habits that the user has already gotten and habits that would be better for the user. It's clear there's a tradeoff there, and while the book acknowledges it, it fails to provide much guidance on making designs choices about when you can actually try to 'teach the user something new'."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"In a nutshell, this book should be on your shelf if you are an electronic media designer - whether you're designing Web sites or other types of interactive media. The book is well-written, and covers many critical topics in usable design.One thing to note: there isn't a whole lot of content in this book that is specifically geared towards applying principles of Usability to Web design; you'd need to use your imagination to apply some of the principles to this area.Nonetheless, I think that the book is well worth the price. It does a fine job of tying together a lot of otherwise abstract concepts from human factors psychology and human-computer interface study."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I can recommend this book wholeheartedly to anyone involved with information technology. Raskin offers a considered and analytical approach to what really makes a good interface. In doing so he exposes many of the inadequacies of current systems like Windows and Macintosh.He shows how it is possible to measure the efficiency of interfaces, often with surprising results. This is particularly refreshing at a time when we are often told that interface design is something creative\\" or intuitive\\".Another strength is his determination to get back to basics. As he points out there are only a limited number of elementary actions that we perform when interacting with a computer. To make the system easy to use it is therefore important to make the performance of these elementary actions completely consistent across the user\`s whole interaction with the system.His method leads to some revolutionary conclusions. I find the argument for a content orientated approach to interface design highly persuasive. When writing this review, for example, I want to be able to concentrate as entirely as possible on what I am writing and not on the often baffling myriad of features that my word processor offers me.Raskin makes it clear that user interface problems have not been solved by the GUI. As a long term iconoclast (or should that be iconophobe?) I find his critique of icons very welcome. I have always found icons difficult to understand and in business applications where you have to represent abstract concepts the task becomes impossible; what would be a suitable icon for Create Accrual\\"? Almost always a word is easier to understand than an icon.I am trying to apply Raskin\`s ideas to the programs I write (though Windows tries hard to stop me) and I sincerely hope that the designers at Microsoft, Oracle and in the Open Source Foundation are paying very close attention to Raskin\`s ideas. Then we can look forward to information systems that are really a pleasure to use."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I read this book at the beginning of my career as an interaction designer. At that time I found this book very inspiring. It was an easy and very enjoyable read. I am not giving 5 stars, just because of his section about icons, which I thought was subjective, incomplete and actually deceiving. What I really loved, and still carry with me, was his argument against modes and his suggestions on how to avoid them. I have used his quotes many times in design discussions. I am still amazed how people don't understand the danger of modes, until I remind them of the many occasions they made mistakes because of them ... over and over.I do have to thank Mr. Raskin for his brilliant and insightful arguments. They help me win many battles and create more usable designs."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I learned a lot from this book. Not just how to design efficient interfaces for software, but also how to design efficient interfaces for HUMANS. Some earlier reviewers, \\"A Customer\\" in particular, seem to have misunderstood the concepts that Jef so finely explained. Yes, he suggests making content the interface itself because that's what computers are for--creating, editing, and navigating your content. One of Jef's Asimov-esque principles is \\"Under no circumstance should your computer harm your content or let it come to harm through inaction.\\" Indeed. Hence we should eliminate the Save \\"feature\\" and instead the computer should save EVERY action you do AUTOMATICALLY. This way, no matter what happens, your content will be safe--even if there's a power outage.Jef's key concept was giving the user the complete power of the computer at any time. This means displaying the user's content in a Zoomable User Interface (ZUI; what he termed \\"ZoomWorld\\") and allowing the user to access every command of the computer at the press of a button. This button is the Command Key and it interprets our natural language into tasks to perform (an omnipresent, humane command line, if you will). For example, if I found something cool on the web and want to email it to a friend, I would simply type the email address I want it sent to, select it, then make a new selection of the content (ZoomWorld remembers what you selected and in what order!), press and hold the Command Key and type SEND. When you let go of the Command Key, the command is executed. The system will know that you previously selected an email address and that you are currently selecting something to send to that email address--it does the thinking for you.But reading this book is one thing. Creating what Jef describes is another, but thankfully his son, Aza Raskin, is carrying on his legacy and has created this omnipresent, ubiquitous command line in the form of Enso, which can be downloaded for free at humanized.com. There are actually a number of developments underway that incorporate many of the ideas Jef explains in the book. Things like Microsoft's Surface (utilizes a ZUI), Google's Android (utilizes the software architecture Jef envisioned which eliminates redundant functionality) and a number of free and open source projects that aim to experiment with his ideas (google \\"raskin, archy\\" without quotes).We're at a turning point in software design. Jef Raskin was way ahead of his time but we're finally seeing the fruits of his research, so if you want to find out where software is heading, give this book a read. Also check out what the crew at Humanized are doing to get a hands-on glimpse at what's possible."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"Consistent emphasis on some important central concepts: locus of attention (what the user is looking at at any given moment); Fitt's law (smaller targets take longer to hit with the mouse); rate of information transfer in interface design. Positives: concentrates on enduring principles, not as picayune as the &quot;Miss Manners&quot; books on interface design. Greater intellectual scope and synthesis. Negatives: somewhat pedantic and idiosyncratic. A few pet concepts, such as LEAP, are overbearingly ubiquitous. Worst example: &quot;If a feature is not visible, we say that it is INVISIBLE.&quot; (Page 63)."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"Jef Raskin's book, The Humane Interface, is the single best human interface design book that I have read. While I am a healthcare preofessional and not a computer geek, the principles of design that Raskin discusses could well be applied to the design of the systems that I use to document patient care and to manage clinical data. I recommend this book to all people who design systems that real people must deal with and use. Part of the frustration of caring for people in healthcare should not be the poor data management systems that require users to learn a multitue of systems and specialized commands; the systems should support the user doing their job. I wish that all designers would read this book and take its message to heart."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I read this book hoping for some insight into good design. I expected a pragmatic, psychology based perspective on users and technical design. Instead, I found the equivalent of a time- motion study on user interaction with technology. That's not a bad thing. Raskin sites some interesting studies on how people are able to work with various input devices. However, I found his negative tone put me off. Everytime he sited a study, he also complained about what was wrong with it. He thinks his designs ideas are superior to many of these, but he sited few scientific studies that backed up his claims.Raskin constantly praises one of his earlier projects, the Canon Cat. If it was so wonderful, why weren't more of those ideas emulated in future designs? I'm sure there are some valid reasons, but I think his designs are not quite as wonderful as he seems to think they are.On a different note, I think some of the writing must have been done a while back. Many of the problems considered date much farther back than the year 2000 publication date. Where some of those problems still exist today, many have been solved or inproved by current software.If you're looking for a good book on the psychology of good design, I'd recommend Norman's, &quot;The Design of Everyday Things.&quot; If you would like more practical software design tips, &quot;Designing From Both Sides of the Screen&quot; is pretty good...especially the first half, which has lots of fun examples."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"Jef Raskin is high on my list of People Worth Listening To. When they speak at conferences, I do not miss their talks. When they write books, I buy them immediately without waiting to read the reviews.Jef's new book certainly justifies his ranking. He tackles, head-on, the question of why computers are such a hassle to use then plots a course for change. He starts with a review of the human psycology relevant to human-computer interaction, and shows how the basic facts about how humans work are routinely ignored (if they are known at all) by the people who write software for us. He then moves on to give the reader a taste for how interfaces can be quantitativly judged (an idea that is mostly foreign to the world of software development).Finally, The Humane Interface points the way to a new generation of computers and electronic devices that serve the user; quite the opposite of today's computers and devices that quickly come to dominate the user. This book provides quite a bit of food for thought. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"If you have ever been annoyed or perplexed by your computer, you will love &quot;The Humane Interface,&quot; by Jef Raskin, the Silicon-Valley iconoclast who created the Macintosh project at Apple.My first experience with computers came at a party in the mid-'70s when I was dragged into a four-way discussion over the question of how to get past an ogre who was guarding a cave entrance. I had no idea what my three nerdy companions were talking about with such amusement and I felt that they were secretly savoring my confusion. It turned out that they had a computer terminal in the bedroom that was hooked up to M.I.T. through something called the &quot;Internet&quot; and they were playing a game called &quot;Zork.&quot; A few years later, these same guys and their nerdy brethren were designing the interfaces that you and I rely upon today and, I felt, they were still secretly savoring our confusion.As luck would have it, I was drawn into computers by way of the electronic games industry in the '80s. Whenever I complained about the way computers worked, I was driven back and put in my place by technical arguments that made me feel like a Neanderthal. Now I imagine that many of YOU have either been in the same place, or have just accepted -- as you might a bitter medicine --the aggravating complexity of computers as a &quot;given.&quot; Well, with the publication of &quot;The Humane Interface,&quot; our time has come. It is an easy and amusing read, but it is also a radical critique that just might shake up the computer industry. The attack on the sacred cows of GUI interface design is humorous but devastating, with plenty of supporting scientific data. Once he's definitively proven that the emperor has no clothes, Raskin offers commonsensical, and oftimes ingeniously simple solutions.I recommend &quot;The Humane Interface&quot; to casual computer users as well as professionals, since it will equip both with the right spells to overcome the ogre of GUI."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"The level of detail in this book was appropriate and helpful for the field, while not overly boring and technical.

His incites are well documented and clearly explained. Unlike some authors, he goes into great technical detail which I applaud. He may have certain leanings to exclusive input types such as a keyboard, but this does not detract from his message. I enjoyed the text thoroughly and found the concepts challenge the roots of all design. Raskin should follow up on his challenge and give us more to consider in relationship to what the newest round of efforts has produced in the field of User Interaction."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"Finally a book by an author who has sat down and worked out his ideas by mathmatics and lab testing!

There is very little practical information, however, if you plan to design an interface that would be built on any modern operating system.While there is some interesting theory presented in this book, it is quite academic, and unfortunately not applicable for most \\"interactive systems\\" being created today.If you are looking for information that would help you design a good interface, I recommend reading Alan Cooper's books, The Inmates Are Running The Asylum and About Face 2.0. The Inmates Are Running The Asylum introduces Cooper's methods for designing a good interaction with the user and presents a strong business case for doing so ( have senior management read those chapters ). About Face 2.0 is a detailed guide to using Cooper's methods.Also, I strongly recommend Donald Norman's The Design of Everyday Things to anyone thinking about designing an interface or design in general. It is an entertaining book that helps to orient the reader to an interesting point of view which challenges the needless complexity and confusion inherent in the many devices we encounter every day."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"The chapter on GOMS and metrics is worth the price of admission. This distillation is very valuable. It's a simple fact that to measure and observe something is to improve it.

While I am somewhat embarrassed to not have heard of these techniques before, I can tell from most user interfaces on the market that I am in good company."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"This book offer you the intellectual framwork to think outside the box. It really challenges you to think about interface from a cognitive point of view."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"If you have ever been annoyed or perplexed by your computer, you will love &quot;The Humane Interface,&quot; by Jef Raskin, the Silicon-Valley iconoclast who created the Macintosh project at Apple.My first experience with computers came at a party in the mid-'70s when I was dragged into a four-way discussion over the question of how to get past an ogre who was guarding a cave entrance. I had no idea what my three nerdy companions were talking about with such amusement and I felt that they were secretly savoring my confusion. It turned out that they had a computer terminal in the bedroom that was hooked up to M.I.T. through something called the &quot;Internet&quot; and they were playing a game called &quot;Zork.&quot; A few years later, these same guys and their nerdy brethren were designing the interfaces that you and I rely upon today and, I felt, they were still secretly savoring our confusion.As luck would have it, I was drawn into computers by way of the electronic games industry in the '80s. Whenever I complained about the way computers worked, I was driven back and put in my place by technical arguments that made me feel like a Neanderthal. Now I imagine that many of YOU have either been in the same place, or have just accepted -- as you might a bitter medicine --the aggravating complexity of computers as a &quot;given.&quot; Well, with the publication of &quot;The Humane Interface,&quot; our time has come. It is an easy and amusing read, but it is also a radical critique that just might shake up the computer industry. The attack on the sacred cows of GUI interface design is humorous but devastating, with plenty of supporting scientific data. Once he's definitively proven that the emperor has no clothes, Raskin offers commonsensical, and oftimes ingeniously simple solutions.I recommend &quot;The Humane Interface&quot; to casual computer users as well as professionals, since it will equip both with the right spells to overcome the ogre of GUI."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"There are many good insights in the book, but plan on heavy slugging through psychology and philosophy. You'd think a book on UI design would include better techniques for knowledge transfer than page after page of complex prose. If you're looking to expand your mind, buy this. If you're seeking a good UI design tutorial or reference, skip it."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I recommend this book wholeheartedly and not only for the marketplace that includes application designers and web page developers, but also for the many who may be curious about the fundamentals of human-computer interaction. The book succeeds in providing a basic education in interface design principles. For me, an editorial director in magazine publishing working with a growing web department, the book was fascinating and stimulating. I now recognize interface elements that work well, or that do not, much more ably.The book describes a set of elements that coalesce into a next-generation interface that could revolutionize the way people use computers. Jef does a brilliant job reducing quantification of interface activity to readily understandable terms. And for those who want a deeper, philosophic, scientific look, Jef very briefly delves into information theory to show how to evaluate the ultimate efficiency of drop down menus, error messages, and the like.Jef has done an enormous amount of research and credits countless pioneers and researchers. His colorful and interesting sidebars and eclectic appendices are interesting side trips. Jef's work is an eloquent, humble, and inspirational salute to current knowledge that awaits implementation. But it is also a primer for every web page developer, every editor working with web page developers, and every application or operating system designer out there. Offering many practical insights, this book lucidly pursues the humane where computers and human lives are becoming ever more entwined."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"This book doesn't really contain &quot;New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems&quot; like it says on the cover. In fact, Jef's directions for designing interactive systems mostly revolve around his designs for the Canon Cat, which date from 1984-1987. Different, and a departure from what's become the norm (the WIMP, or Windows Icons Menus Pointers graphical user interface), but not new.Readers may be annoyed by Jef's continued insistence throughout the book that the Cat contained such wonderfully efficient interface ideas, but there are some solid ideas presented. Highlights of this book include Raskin's introduction and description of Locus of Attention (approximately: involuntary focus), which may be as important for designers to consider as users' conscious focus. The concept of 'monotony' in interfaces is also interesting to consider as Raskin describes it, because he asserts this is a path that allows users to form efficient automaticity and focus on tasks rather than the interface. Also, chapter 4 includes an overview of GOMS analysis that does a good job of bringing it out of the academic esoteric realm into a place where more interaction designers will consider using it for commercial projects. Raskin's heuristics for good interaction design are spread throughout the book (would have been nicer if they were all corralled into one place for reference), but Appendix B comes close to summarizing them -- it is a document from Alzofon and Raskin's 1985 SwyftCard design.Low points of the book include Raskin's annoying, overly specific notation for keystrokes that he uses throughout, the lecturing tone, the tedium of chapter five, and the goofy quantitative modality measure he proposes in chapter three."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I found a lot to disagree with in this book. Mr. Raskin recommends that we dispense with GUI fluff that obscures more than it illuminates (not necessarily a bad idea) and replace it with a system in which your content IS the interface. While typing this review, for instance, I could type the word SAVE, select the word SAVE, and invoke a command to interpret the selected word as a command, thus saving the text to disk. Or type EMAIL (right here in the middle of this sentence!), select the command (and somehow also select the sentence), and tap a key to send the sentence off as an email. Or I can type an arithmetic expression into my text and evaluate it on the fly (which as we all know, most users need to do urgently and often). Truly out-there stuff, and I think that's admirable, but I also think it's wrong. Many of the book's proposed computing paradigms are based on the notion that most files are text files, when in reality, at least in today's systems, only a tiny percentage of files contain human-readable text. We've got applications, MP3s, video, pointers to content, content we've made ourselves, content from other sources. These data are different, and cannot all be tossed into a homogeneous soup and treated as text.Moreover, the book has some &quot;bugs&quot; which limit its own useability. Mr. Raskin makes dozens of references to a product he designed and extols, the Canon Cat, but never actually explains what it is. I know that it lets users manage files without having to name them (interesting) but I don't know what kind of files they're making, so I can't decide whether this is a good idea. The book does not offer even a single screentshot of this device. Same goes for Swyftware, another oft-cited product with which the author assumes we are familiar, when we are not (Google reports only 7 references on the Web). Instead of showing us pictures these paragons of design in action, the book devotes precious glossy color plates to a gallery of black &amp; white icons, a Windows menu bar, a photo of a grey radio and other illustrations in which color is meaningless.In this book Mr. Raskin is really thinking, and he does back up his ideas with (talk of) empirical data. And as someone who has developed both hardware and software, he is not afraid to propose alternative input devices and new keys added to the keyboard. That's interesting stuff. But so many ideas just seem wrong. I don't think people want their computer to process keypresses while it is asleep. I don't think people are suffering for lack of a quicker way to enter a Carriage Return character into a search &amp; replace dialog. And I don't think people want to have to learn a command-line interface and then type up their own menus (suffering through syntax errors in the process) to attain the convenience of a GUI. It's a novel book, but I won't recomment it on that basis alone."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"Raskins' \\"The Humane Interface\\" is cut from the same cloth as Alan Cooper's \\"About Face\\", Jeff Johnson's \\"GUI Bloopers\\", and Bruce Tognazzini's \\"Tog on Interface\\". I prefer Johnson's books to the others due to its thoroughness, even-handedness and case-study orientation. As in Cooper's and Tognazzini's books, many of Raskin's recommendations are tried and true, whereas others are much more speculative.Raskin thoroughly grounds his book in cognitive theory, which for a cognitive scientist like me, is highly refreshing. Others might not appreciate the theory as much, but this is clearly the meat of the science of UI design. But this is not a book on cognitive psychology, so it quickly moves on to discuss \\"cognetics\\", which he describes as the ergonomics of the mind. Like most UI designers, Raskin has semantic qualms with the term \\"intuitive\\", but introduces \\"affordances\\" as a stand-in. An affordance is simply something that's familiar from your earlier experiences. Combined with \\"visibility\\", they form the backbone of easy-to-use-out-of-the-box UI design. Raskin quite rightly denies the zero-sum nature of design for novice versus design for experts, claiming you can build well for both by following the domain. There's an excellent discussion of Fitt's Law, which predicts how long it will take to land a mouse on a screen object based on size and distance. I also appreciated the clear explanation of the GOMS keystroke model and his subsequent application of information theory to the design of a farenheit-celsius converter.Getting more concrete, Raskin delivers the obligatory rant against modes. In a novel twist, he then introduces a nifty notation of the elementary actions of today's GUI's (mouse down, key clicks, selection, mouse movement, etc.), which brings him much closer to the engineering side of interface design than any of the competing books. There is an excellent description of in-text search, using emacs (the text editor of choice for the world's programmers) as an example. The section on commands and transformers, the basis of the Unix operating system and software design within it, indicate that emacs wasn't the only thing Raskin picked up before he designed the Mac UI.I was completely unconvinced by Raskin's radical suggestions for redesigning (really discarding) the notion of file. I can't imagine making his concept of LEAP work in practice. I'm not even sure I understood the description. I was equally unimpressed by his \\"Zoomworld\\" suggestions for navigation.\\"The Humane Interface\\" doesn't break much new ground, but its solid foundations and smattering of sharp insights make it a worthwhile edition to any UI designer's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I can not over-emphasize how absolutely important it is for everyone involved in the design or programming of computer software--no matter how big or how small--to read this book. Even designers of non-computer interfaces, like for steroes or vcrs, would benefit from reading it.The book doesn't just explain the dos and don'ts of interface design--it also clearly explains the WHYS, by going into the psychology of the human mind and explaining interface design from that standpoint.It is true that the book goes outside the realm of currently-used computer systems, and introduces ideas that can't immediately be put to good use. But that is necessary to get a complete picture of the concepts. (Not to mention the help that it might give to someone who decides to go about designing an all-new computer or operating system of his or her own. This is a hint for all you inventors out there.)And it isn't just the individual ideas themselves. After finishing the book, I began to have an all-new way of thinking about programming; a whole new attitude which is helping me with some of the projects I'm currently working on. A creative mind can think of many new ideas based on the general concepts presented here, other than the specific things that Raskin mentions.The book is, for the most part, very pleasant to read (a page-turner!) and focused on the concepts. Very professionally done."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"At first, I was really disappointed with this book. The &quot;thick&quot; writing style hides the presentation of straightforward concepts in long paragraphs and dense text. Be prepared to mull through the page looking for italics.Additionally, the &quot;God complex&quot; attitude conveyed by Jef really should have been caught by an editor. The didactic tone is a real turn-off. And, as other reviewers have pointed out, there is little practical advice, beyond Jef's &quot;this is what I did&quot; anecdotes.After saying this, there are many valuable concepts presented in the book (for a list, see the table of contents). If the book goes to a second edition, an editor and a technical writer should be part of the writing team. This would make it more readable and referenceable; making it easier to recommend."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"The book opens with a brief look at cognetics. Studying how the mind works, such as matters of attention and habituation, clarifies why many popular designs are often so COUNTERintuitive. Once you have that background, Raskin starts defining terms. Then, he provides formulas for analyzing interface efficiency. As valuable as usability testing can be, it's nice to add some objective measurements to the toolbox.The last half of the book looks at some popular current practices in software, and points out ways they violate the principles expressed in the first half. Some of his ideas are quite radical, but definitely thought-provoking. I wonder if anyone in the Open Source community would be interested in taking a crack at developing a new system based on these proposals.Raskin designed the Apple Macintosh and CanonCat systems, both of which are used as frequent examples. An appendix on why the Mac chose the one-button mouse is a must read for any Mac partisan (pro or con). Because the CanonCat is so obscure, I do wish he provided more information (especially pictures) on how it actually looked and worked. But that's a minor quibble.As someone new to the profession of UI Design, this book has proven invaluable. I'm already using his terminology to explain issues to developers. And I'm still ruminating over some of the other proposals in the last half of the book.If you've read last year's popular book &quot;The Inmates Are Running The Asylum&quot; by Cooper, you understand the problem exists. This is a good follow-up to start you on the road to fixing it."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"This is a great book! It goes into considerable depth about how people think and how the way we process information should affect computer interface design. The two key concepts are the singular nature of the human locus of attention, and the human ability (and compulsion) to habituate behavior. The author then details how he would design a whole new way of interacting with computers to take advantage of these two key concepts. I found the author's ideas intriguing and his point of view a direct, if somewhat idealistic, challenge to the current human/computer interface paradigm.What this book isn't, however, is a practical guide for how to improve your own design. This is a very theoretical text (although extremely easy to read), not a reference or a checklist. Be sure you are aware that the book is trying to give you a foundation and a point of view, not a tutorial. Once you recognize that, it is a tremendous read!"},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"There are two categories of people who should read this book:1) those who write programs and design user interfaces (which today includes everyone who builds a Web page, and2) those who don't.For the first category of folks, the point is clear -- there are some well-researched principles to designing user interfaces, and you should know about them before you write code for human consumption. As a matter of fact, the references and bibliography alone are probably worth it for serious programmers.For those of us in the second category, the book is a glimpse into a world where computers serve useful functions in a simple way. Rather than the complicated, feature-bloated and overly cryptic machines we use today, computers are presented as being capable of adapting themselves to our work, fading into the subconscious, and allowing us to focus on the work itself.Everyone should come away with an almost obvious thought or two they've never realized, but upon reflection will say, &quot;you know, that's right!&quot; Nothing is taken for granted, and you will never view such standard user interface components as logins and passwords, file systems or text searches the same way.I'm afraid it will be years before hardware, software, operating systems and development tools catch up to some of these concepts, but there is nothing in it that couldn't technically be implemented today.Get this book, and pay attention to the footnotes!| OK |"},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"This is a book on user interface design by the father of the Macintosh and the information appliance.Like most people I find computers frustrating to use. Raskin explains some of the reasons why this is, and also points to better ways of designing software for real people. But some of his ideas seem hard to apply to modern networked computers.One of the most important ideas is that \\"An interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties\\". Humans cannot remember what state or mode the software is in, interfaces should minimize distractions so we can focus on the task at hand.Many of his ideas can be applied today, others require a redesign of human-computer interaction. His proposal to replace applications with commands is intriguing. The book doesn't quite show how that would workMany of the ideas based on the Canon Cat and original Macintosh that Raskin implemented years ago. This seems to prove their feasibility, but it's hard to see how \\"leaping\\" would apply to modern networks and file systems.I was saddened to learn that Jef Raskin passed away this week. It's exciting to learn though that his Raskin Center for Humane Interface has been funded to carry on his work.The book has inspired me to explore the topic of humane design in more depth, and to try to apply these principles in my job as a software designer, and in my own projects."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I am currently writing my thesis in interaction design and the man who wrote this book, Jef Raskin is in my mind the father of usability and a strong opinion on how to do things right.

It is my opinion to any designer to look at the ideas of this book to understand why a company like apple has been able to reach its current position and the know that it is more than just creative branding and a pop-cult logo.I found the message here to be a call to designing for the human processor, since the race for hardware speed has already surpassed our bodily capabilities.regards,"},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I first read this book years ago but March 27, 2009 the Business-Week article describing \\"Tesla's Electric Car for the (Well-Off) Masses\\" quotes designer von Holzhausen on replacing most interior controls with a flat-panel: \\"I don't understand how I can pay $299 for iPhone and then get in my car and still have to turn knobs.\\" von Holzhausen shoulda read Raskin - hint - you can turn a knob without LOOKING at it....

Most of the examples of bad user interfaces come from either Microsoft Windows, or a very old version of Microsoft Word running on a Mac.

This portion of the text is sure to remain valid throughout the years.Although not exactly a page turner, I would recommend this book for anybody who designs user interfaces on a regular basis - even if you don't use the laws described, at least knowing about them is likely to make you design better interfaces unconsciously."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"This is possibly the most rewarding UI book I have read. I say that because it takes a constructive approach - actually suggesting novel solutions to problems rather than just stating that &quot;the mouse is dead&quot;, &quot;menus are passe&quot; etc. The latter style frustrates, as its obvious the author doesnt have any better ideas (or if they do, they're not willing to share them!).The other good thing about Raskin's book is that it encourages the reader to think about their own solutions to common UI problems.This second point is where my caveat comes in. Raskin's suggestions prompted my own creativity because his are so extreme! Resist the temptation to take Raskin's suggestions as gospel. I think they intended more to stimulate debate over UI elements we take for granted.Those of us who have used computers since the early 80s (or earlier) might be tempted by Raskin's rather zealous &quot;back-to-the-good-ole-days&quot; ideas, such as dedicated function keys on the keyboard (he's very big on these) - but I don't see the 21st century PC novice warming to such ideas.Of course, if you disagree with Raskin's ideas, it means you're thinking about UI design, so you're getting your money's worth!"},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"'The Humane Interface' was a very good book.

Important stuff.That portion of the book should be required reading for anyone designing an interface."},{"Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems","review":"I think most people approach this book with the attitude of a technical manual of design, which is not what this book was intended for. If you're looking for &quot;how to design a great webpage&quot; or the aesthetics of computing, this isn't the right book. This book should be considered by engineers and programmers who want focal points that will make their hardware or software more acceptable and effective to end-users.This is an extremely important book because, at this time in the computer industry, we use a lot of crufty, over-extended applications with poor interface and design. Even the once-rudimentary OS has become overly complex and burdened. The individual, confused and distracted at the interface is clearly not in control.Raskin wants to place the user firmly back in control by introducing a variety of different considerations most engineers do not research thoroughly enough when calculating usage needs. He approaches the issue of interface design from a philosophical, psychological, and technological perspective. The theoretical concepts of chunking, gesture, and habituation are mixed in with the pragmatic ability to Universally Undo actions.Simple things ruin an interface's ability to care for and serve a user, from not understanding the process of how humans switch contexts to incorrectly estimating how humans use their unconscious and conscious minds. How is quality assurance testing possible, he asks, when you have so many unnecessary &quot;Preferences&quot; and customizations able to be set in ways that are unique to the individual users? The answer, of course, is that it is foolish to attempt testing what doesn't exist yet.The resulting product is fascinating, even if you don't agree entirely with some of Raskin's conclusions.

In attempting to provide a comprehensive history, the book's strength sometimes becomes its weakness--on many topics, Cook offers sketchy coverage, occasionally reduced to simple lists of films and filmmakers. A natural hazard, perhaps, of such an undertaking. Despite that, there are many excellent sections, including those on the early development of the film industry and some of the discussions of particular films, directors, and genres, such as Potememkin, Orson Welles, and film noir. Ultimately, it's a worthwhile volume for the reference shelf of anyone interested in film."},{"Title":"A History of Narrative Film","review":"Imagine having the gall to write a history of &quot;Narrative Film&quot; -- not just Hollywood production, but ALL film, from ALL OVER...Well Cook does, and does it better than anyone else.The most amazing thing about this book is that is reads so well: you can literally open it up anywhere, start reading, and start learning -- and be entertained at the same time. I just love reading this book.The second amazing thing is that Cook seems to have seen a lot of movies and taken the time to think carefully about them. As a result his comments, his sense of historical perspective, and his assertions are usually accurate, frequently insightful, and always enlightenling.If you're studying film in ANY context, this is the book to buy. If you prefer a video store with a foreign language section instead of your local Blockbuster, this is the catalog for you. Within days of reading this book I was making lists of films that I had to see (The Red And The White, and the Wadja trilogy among them), and running out to find them.For those in need of a text-book, this is the best value-for-money you can get. For thos FEARING a text-book, relax: it's actually a real page turner.Any short-commings? There are some minor factual errors (the photographs demonstrating zoom, telephoto and wide lenses use inaccurate frames from Barry Lyndon, for example), but nothing to worry about -- there so much about this book that's good it really doesn't make a difference.

The book is well organized in terms of chronology and geography, tracing artistic movements and schools of thought from the prehistory through 1895 and beyond. The only thing that kept it from 5 stars would be its sometimes overwhelming amount of information (particularly lists of foreign film titles, not all of which are translated) - as a student, I would prefer that the text focused on the films that had a discerable impact on the development of the genre rather than just being listed for their own sake.

I bought this older edition on the cheap and am quite pleased with my purchase.Cook covers many important aspects of the film industry, from the beginnings up through the modern era (different editions naturally leave off at different points - I think mine is from the 90's). He discusses the technical, business and artistic aspects of the film industry and their interactions in some depth. For example, the discussion of competing sound technologies, the business decisions involved in the transition to sound and how those factors influenced what sorts of pictures got made was quite fascinating to me.As someone with a fairly wide, but scattershot experience of films I found this book to be just about perfect in terms of the level of detail it goes into. It allowed me to place many of my favorite films into a broader, more structured context and to see their relation to film history much more clearly.I would actually have appreciated it if the book were not limited to narrative film, since many of the earliest films were not narratives and the interplay between avant-garde and mainstream film would be covered in much more detail if non-narrative films were included."},{"Title":"A History of Narrative Film","review":"This is a thorough, informative, and interesting history of world cinema, from the invention of the medium in the 1870s to about 1994.

Griffith, the first great narrative filmmaker, gets a whole chapter to himself, and so does Orson Welles. But usually particular filmmakers are included under larger headings: the French New Wave (Truffaut, Godard), Western European Renaissance (Fellini, Bunuel, Bergman), the American studio system (Ford, Hawkes, Hitchcock), Hollywood in the twenties (Chaplin, Keaton, DeMille).Because the book covers so much ground, only the major highlights of each subject can be explored, but Cook is still able to give a good survey of important considerations for each topic or artist. Emphasis also is on the word \\"world\\" and Hollywood does not dominate, which for a book like this is good.

I was very wrong and very pleased at what it was instead.This book explores a story line that seems to be so obvious you would think that more than a few authors would have already written something along this line, and that's what makes it so unique. The book is a fast paced, action ride for anyone who has ever watched a cartoon or read a Superman comic. It brings a million &quot;what if&quot;s to mind as you read it. The main character is one you hate to love, but can't help it. You continue to read hoping for redemption.

Long chapters of synopsis are combined with sentence fragments to create something that reads like a quickly dashed-off screenplay treatment. I'm sure the destruction of San Francisco and the various metahuman/cop battles will look great on screen, but as a book, this makes comic books look deep."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"I haven't seen this much pent up anger in a book since Order of the Pheonix. Soledad is an angry, two demensional, bigot who's a Mary Sue to top off the nastiness that exudes from her. Her coworkers are angry. The boyfriend is a nonentity. The Mutants (whom we get so little background about) seem to be the only faction in this story that have a right to be angry since they're being hunted down regardless of their personal histories.Anger about Los Angeles. It's so plainly obvious that the author hates LA with a passion that makes his blood boil. Why, oh why, did he set it there? He even hates the nice days in town. I went to college in LA and know first hand that it's not like what appears on tv, but holy cats, this guy really doesn't like it. The pure venom in the narration makes it that much more difficult to put up with such borederline protagonists.Also, is this a book or a script? The use of colons instead of verbs was simply poor form. I understand that Mr. Ridley is a tv writer, which is great, but he needs to understand that prose and scripts are different beasts, or his editor should be fired.I picked up this book because it had a great title, which is the only thing that was any good about it."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Soledad O'Roarke is a BAMF LA cop who specializes in killing supernaturals. When the supernaturals first came, they were heroes. An unfortunate accident changed that and now it seems they're rogues.This is a dark and disturbing book.

It's worth a read, but the hate for a whole class of people is just too darn close to Nazi Germany to make this more than a one-book affair for me."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"What began as an interesting novel and journeyed into an interesting form of describing humanity and some of our worst shortcomings, ended without any of the characters transforming into something new and preferably better. I felt cheated by how this story ended and refuse to believe that all of humanity is as hopeless, narrow-minded and self destructive as what was represented by the main character, Soledad."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"It is rare for me to put a book down and simply stop reading it. I did with SM Stirling's \\"Draka\\" books ... there's something seriously wrong with a book that leaves you wanting to root for the *Nazis*, for example ... and this book leaves the same sort of bad taste in my mouth. The main character is, frankly, sick - and the society she is \\"protecting\\" is not much better the way the book is written.She has no redeeming features at all. She is a bigoted fanatic of the worst sort ... and she wallows in it ... and so does the author. Well, to be fair, Stirling claims not to love his fascist Draka (I've never been sure I believe that claim), so its possible that Ridley is trying to make a point about bigoted fanatics ... but it doesn't come across that way.Then there's the believability factor of the background. I can't quite come to grips with this ... its supposed to be a gritty realistic police thriller. But with superheroes who wear their underpants on the ouitside. There's something that just doesn't gel ... it just seems inherently ... silly? unbelievable? strange? It just doesn't work for me, anyway.Apart from the above, the book is reasonably well written. Won't win the Nobel Prize for Literature, or the Hugos or the Nebulas. But it isn't awful and amateurish. Its just there are other problems. As noted."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Boy, was this book a serious letdown. I rushed out to get it based on my love for comics and fictional futures. The premise is excellent, and Ridley's dialogue is like nothing I've ever read. It's true to life and unique. The only thing that let me down was the main character that we're (I think) supposed to be rooting for (or maybe not...maybe this is Ridley's intention). Soledad comes off as a hateful, bigoted, murderous, merciless human being. And it's not even for an understandable reason. Sure, the disaster visited upon San Francisco is horrific...but Soledad's family never made it to the city. They were all spared. This is the one thing that kept me from thoroughly enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"I bought this book with anticipation, because the book blurb intrigued me. Boy, was I disappointed!As others have stated, the background of the story is that there is an emerging presence of \\"mutant\\" humans, ones who seem to have superhuman powers. As in all comic book stories, the \\"good\\" mutants fight the \\"bad\\" mutants and try to protect human society. All that comes crashing to an end in the USA when one of the baddies manages to wipe out most of San Francisco. Immediately, it seems, the normal humans turn against all the mutated humans, an Executive Order is issued by the President abolishing their civil rights and giving them 30 days to leave the country or else be subject to \\"termination\\" without due cause. Special MTAC squads are set up in all major cities to handle the extermination of the mutantsIs there any real exploration into whether or not the mutants are just the further evolution of humanity?No.Is there any real explanation as to why the entire population of the USA seemingly allows civil rights to be trampled without demur?No.Is it ever even explained why the mutated humans who acted as superheroes and supervillians adopted corny names and wore costumes?No.Instead we get the character of Soledad O'Roark, a bigoted and essentially nasty female cop. One who apparently was so traumatized by what happened in San Francisco (she and her family were supposed to take a trip there that day but didn't because she was ill) that she has dedicated her entire life to becoming the scourge of the mutants. Never mind that they were obviously childhood heroes to her, never mind that outside of her police duties she never comes into contact with them, never mind that the majority of the mutated humans follow a \\"harm none\\" policy, never mind that no one she knew was killed in San Francisco. She is a WOMAN WITH A MISSION. She has no close friends, she keeps her family at arm's distance, she has no social life - her life is her job and her goal is to become the baddest bad-ass in the special MTAC squad and kill the mutants. She is single-minded in her hatred. She doesn't seem to care if the people she kills help humanity or hurts them; she resents that they have god-like abilities and that's enough for her.There is a rather lame romantic tangent in the story - frankly I could not see why on earth the character of Ian would have been attracted to her in the first place, much less put up with all of her bigotry when he didn't seem to share her POV.THE FOLLOWING IS A SPOILER: When they are involved in a traffic accident on their way to taking a vacation after having finally admitting that they love each other, Soledad begs Ian to help her save a woman trapped in a burning car, Ian does so but has to reveal that he too is a mutated human. The woman's life is saved solely due to his intervention, but does that even penetrate Soledad's mind and cause her to rethink her bigotry? No, she takes out her gun then and there at the accident site and empties it into him - the man she professes to love.Soledad is a one-note cartoon character who exhibits no true emotional or intellectual growth throughout the book. And as a black woman, she shows a complete lack of understanding of the historical incongruity of her mindset and bigotry.Since this is the first book in the series, I suppose there is always the chance that Soledad will evolve into a more, not compassionate - that would be stretching things too far, but perhaps a more thoughtful person, but frankly I'm not going to devote the time or money to try to find that out."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Think X-Men, only without the interesting characters or any of the humanity of the story. Also, the \\"hero\\" of the book wants to exterminate all mutants. Others have explained the plot, so I'll just get to what I think works and mostly doesn't work about this book.For a book about super-humans, there sure aren't a lot of them in this thing. The glimpses we do get to see of \\"metahumans\\" usually end with them getting shot by the main \\"protagonist\\" Soledad O'Roark, who is perhaps the most unlikable character ever put to paper. She embodies the underlying theme in the story, which is that everybody on the planet is bigoted and racist, even minorities, and sometimes human rights have to be stripped away in order for \\"normal\\" people to feel safe.I found it odd that the author would write a book with superheroes in it, then chalk the main character so full of hatred and racism it's impossible to like her. Presumably most of the people who would read a book with super-humans in it like superheroes, and the story here is pretty alienating in that respect.We never really get to know any of the characters, much less care about them, save the fact that I found myself getting progressively angrier and angrier at Soledad's \\"only good mutie is a dead mutie\\" attitude. Even at the end of the book she has no redeeming characteristics, and the later chapters actually make her more vicious and nasty, if that's possible.At one point Soledad says, \\"I don't have friends.\\" Well no kidding; she's wholly unlikable and has no redeeming characteristics. I found it impossible to understand why on earth the love interest in the story would be able to put up with her nastiness for more than three minutes without setting her on fire.I suppose I just don't understand why one would write a book from exclusively this point of view, especially being an African American. The moral of the story seems to be \\"oppress whoever makes you feel safer.\\" The hope of someone's redemption and the \\"what's going to happen next\\" kept me reading this book, but when it was all said and done I was definitely sorry I had. I like stories with characters who have both good and evil in their character, and moral gray areas of plot, but this one is all evil and grim and none of the positive of humanity. Whenever you make Phillip K. Dick look cheery by comparison, something has gone bad wrong.Ridley must really, really hate comic books."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"I read this book in one sitting, but I didn't really like it. I could have liked it a lot more, even without a word being changed, if there was a message that this was just the first part of a trilogy. Sadly, I saw no such note.The world setting is much like DC's apocalyptic Kingdom Come. Humans have given birth to metahumans. The reasons for this are never explored. At first some of the mutants live out their superhero fantasies, dress up in garish costumes and - like Peter Pan - think good thoughts and do good works. Butsuperpowers don't equate with the Freudian \\"superego\\"... in other words, metahumans do not have any greater sense of social responsibility than do normal people. Some are \\"good\\" and law-abiding, and others get their thrills any way they can.Public perception changes and hardens when San Francisco is destroyed in a firestorm by a pyromaniac metahuman. As in the novel Watchmen, all \\"mask\\"s are outlawed, all metahumans ordered to leave the United States within 30 days or face extermination. No exceptions made.... Not even for an angel...The main character in this story is a young woman with a genius for weapon making and a homicidal urge to kill metahumans. Unfortunately she's a cop in an elite unit so her kills are sanctioned at the highest levels. She is the weakest plot point in the entire book. We never learn her \\"backstory\\", we don't understand her total black and white view of metahumans.I found it almost incomprehensible that a young black female cop should not see that she is dehumanizing those who have special attributes and abilities in just the same manner that earlier oppressors had treated women, Jews, and Blacks. She is blind to herself... and it makes it hard to care for her in any way, because she is barely human herself.If the author writes another book about the cop and develops her character and history a bit, I'll gladly read it, but as a stand alone novel THOSE WHO WALK IN DARKNESS\\" left me in the dark in too many important areas!Paul Memoli"},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"John Ridley's Those Who Walk In Darkness is a futuristic, sci-fi thriller filled with superheroes and super cops in a battle between good and evil. Soledad O'Roark is a tough, no-nonsense rookie on an elite team of police officers whose sole mission is to capture and deport metanormals. Metanormals are humans who have altered genetic traits which enable them to perform extraordinary feats, like fly, manipulate elements (metal, fire, water), become intangible (move through solid objects), etc. However, the most feared and deadly of the metanormals is the telepath who can enter the mind and take total control of one's actions, emotions, and thoughts with little to no warning. If you are picking up a strong \\"X-Men\\" vibe, then you are right on point.In this novel, San Francisco and its half million \\"normal\\" humans were obliterated from the face of the earth when the good superheroes failed to stop an evil superhero's doomsday device. Thus in a knee-jerk decision, the President issues an Executive Order to deport the metanormals. Europe openly accepts those who are deported, while others hide their capabilities and try to live peacefully incognito in the U.S. However, the \\"normal\\" humans (especially the cops) spew so much malice toward any metanormal whether good/helpful or destructive/evil that there is usually conflict in every meeting that ends in a lot of cops dead when trying to capture one metanormal.Most of the story centers on the heroine Soledad; her life and motivation. We learn that she is the typical hard-nosed, loner, idealist cop who believes in \\"the system\\" until a series of events leads her to love, threatens her career, and changes her life. The plot's formula is familiar and so are the supporting characters - there is a \\"lover boy,\\" a dedicated family man, and a \\"Rambo\\" type to round out Soledad's four-person crew. At times, I felt like I was reading a screenplay for a new cop show - there were plenty of \\"shoot \`em up\\" action passages, characters with misguided anger, and the resonating \\"woe is me\\" lament of misunderstood policemen. The story works reasonably well because I kept reading to find out what was going to happen next.True to Ridley fashion, this novel has plenty of comedic scenes and a darker side. It raises issues of human rights and challenges the reader to examine social injustices of the past and potentially the future. I enjoyed all aspects of the book and I am looking forward to his next release.Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClubJuly 9, 2003"},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Ridley gives you the unexpected. Not a bad thing in today's cookie-cutter world. Not always satisfying, but you have to read. He's on the edge of a big one, I want to see it when it comes."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"There is nothing more thrilling for an avid reader than finding a new author to stoke the fires, and keep me up all night. John Ridley's writing is sparse, clean and vivid. Though I avoid most sci fi, this novel blends both mystery, thriller, police procedural and sci fi in the noir tradition. I see the influence of Raymond Chandler and the inagination of Philip Dick with the contempoary flair of Pelecanos.This is a great concept deftly written and imaginative, dark and moody, but immensely satisfying. I highly recommend \\"Those Who Walk the Darkness\\" for anyone loves a good story and great writing. Now, let me know what you think."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"I've had a lot of arguments about this book. For those who just think it's an action story, everywhere in the book insert the words &quot;New York&quot; for San Francisco and &quot;September 11tth&quot; for May Day. This book is about politics, rights, freedoms and what happens when we either take them for granted or abuse them. Not to malign comic book fans, but I think those who are just expecting a simple &quot;chick action&quot; book have missed something very bold, made more so by the fact the &quot;hero&quot; of the book is about the most complicated hero in a story since, maybe, Dekker in Blade Runner. Somebody said to me: &quot;but I don't like Soledad.&quot; Uh, you're not supposed to LIKE her. You're supposed to find her FASCINATING. And the woman is fascinating as hell.

Just for people who like being challanged."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Well folks, I grew up on comics and still love them, although I am not a frequent reader any more. I was excited to hear about this book and eagerly read it, but ....ugh. If you want some quick reading trashy sci-fi type junk, then go ahead and read it. If you are looking for an intelligent treatment of some comic-like themes, then you'd better keep waiting. This is the first novel I have read that has inspired me to pan it here, that's how bad it was."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"In a fantasyland USA of tomorrow, mutant human beings stalk the land. Some are heroes who save \\"normal\\" human beings from disasters such as bank robberies or giant sinkholes that open in busy streets. However, others are bad, just like some regular human beings, and cause distress and pain. John Ridley's heroine, Soledad \\"Bullet\\" O'Roark, doesn't care to make a distinction between the good freaks and the bad freaks; she wants them all dead.Keeping her emotional distance from everyone, she becomes involved in a car accident, and subsequently with the driver of the other vehicle, Ian, who is very similar to Soledad in temperament. They never discuss their past lives, they almost never discuss even the present. They seem, as a couple, to be perfectly happy sharing living space, having sex and not doing much else. Questions cause them to clam up, especially with each other. For a long time, Ian doesn't even know that Soledad is on the M-Tac squad, which was formed specifically to hunt down mutant human beings. When he does learn, he is uneasy, but accepts his new love's job as part of the package. It could be his undoing.Soledad, while on duty, kills a \\"good\\" super human - one who can prevent disasters or reverse the damages from calamities that should have killed people. While Soledad O'Roark feels justified in the killing, the husband of the super freak is angry beyond reason. His specialty is mind control and he can make a regular human being kill him/herself by entering that person's thoughts and controlling his/her actions. He begins stalking the M-Tac squad. He wants Soledad dead. In turn, Soledad wants him badly enough to endanger herself and the entire squad. The battle is on.THOSE WHO WALK IN DARKNESS is a quick read and an interesting one. I do tend to like heroines that have some redeeming values and I found Soledad a little hard to take, yet I couldn't stop reading the book. I knew, at some point, that this woman would have to have some small spark of decency in her. John Ridley has come up with a surprise ending that makes an already fantastic book even more so.Reviewed by alice Holmanof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book is a thrill ride.

Can't wait for the follow up."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Deep and thoughtful. This book is very tough. Tough in language, and tough in ideas. In my opinion, this is actually the most interesting modern perspective I've read on all the \\"isms\\" of our world. I would say those who are used to the soft heroism of the DC universe, don't bother. It's like comparing the grit of Saving Private Ryan to the gloss of an old John Wayne war film.

Apparently, there is some universal need to balance the scale so soon after other superheroes and just as potent supervillains surface. Normal humans watched the fights from the sidelines hoping not to be caught in the crossfire of a car being tossed like a baseball. Everything abruptly changes when the supers fight and Bludlust destroys San Francisco. The outraged human populace passes laws outlawing superdom and special police units form to hunt down these powerful beings regardless of whether they are heroes or villains.Soledad O'Roark joins LAPD's Metanormal Tactical Unit to stop superhumans in spite of the extraordinary high death rate amongst her peers. She scientifically attacks each super by studying their weakness and modifying her weaponry to defeat them. She earns a reputation as a super hunter. However, when she kills a super healer that many claim was an angel, all hell breaks loose, but her biggest nemesis is that her lover is the greatest telepathic villain of them all.Readers will marvel at the delightfully cunning images of a world where superheroes and supervillains battle against one another and against humans for supremacy. The exciting story line is comic book in nature (X-Men like), but purposely done so that the audience ends up with a superb fantasy tale with the acceptable excesses (except perhaps for Manga, but then again there is Nubian Princess) that make for a fun time. Fans who want a superb escape will appreciate John Ridley's valiant enjoyable homage to a truly art form with this powerful opening flight of fancy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"This story and its United States made me sad and angry. It tells a tale of the USA outlawing an entire culture of people. The fact that the hero is female and black (which excited me to start with makes me wonder if the writer was trying to make a point.

Yeah it's negative and yeah there's no happily ever after ending, but that's the nature of the beast. There is also humor, romance, mystery and a very realistic you-are-there sorta feel-- which I liked alot. I have looked for the hardcover of the next one in this series, \\"What Fire Cannot Burn\\" but it's not to be found. I will await the paperback in October, cause I loved this book, it is pure escapist entertainment. Made me want to be a BAMF too."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"The premise of blending the world of superheroes into a novel for adults is what drew me to this book (similar to what drew me to the Watchmen graphic novel back in the '80s). However, the author's main character, Soledad is so full of hatred and bitterness, it's really very hard to root for her. In fact, I found myself rooting against her (as futile as I know this was, given the fact that she is supposedly the \\"heroine\\" of the story). Even more troubling than that is the fact that she was not even personally affected by the events leading up to the U.S. turning against its supers, other than the fact that she \\"almost\\" went to S.F. before it was destroyed. Seriously? That's her motivation? C'mon, man! Here is a protagonist who, based on the actions of a few evil individuals, now hates the entire race of that people, regardless of their character. That's like making a movie about a cop who hunts down anyone of Middle Eastern origin because of the events of 9/11...and expecting us to root for this character. Very disappointing. And even other people pointing out the irony of her bigotry given that fact that she's a black woman was totally lost on her. I understand that every novelized hero is supposed to have his/her imperfections, but this was a little too overboard."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"A lot of people here are writing some pretty harsh reviews because of the 'hate' contained inside of these pages. The main character here, Soledad is unique in fiction. She is probably the most alienating protagonist I have ever come across. She is full of self pity, disgust of her fellow humans, hate towards mutants, 100% negative. Every single sentence in this book drips with disgust. I felt like I was not reading but watching someone flick scum off their hands over and over again.I think that the idea here is great. I myself loath the entire idea of superheros. So its fun to contemplate a story where they are persona non grata and cops like Soledad are around to clean things up, not other superheros. I also like the fact that this book is so negative and dark. I don't mind that Soledad hates so readily. What I do mind is that it felt like to me that the author has such a contempt for his audience.If you want to read a really great dark author with a twisted protagonist, I would highly recommend Zeltserman's work, 'small crimes' is a beauty."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"I was reminded of Halle Berry's claims of not appearing in X-MEN 3 due to mistreatment at the hands of the first two films' writers when reading this blending of S.W.A.T. and SPECIAL UNIT 2, especially since the term \\"BAMF\\" (originally Nightcrawler's teleportation effect) takes on a brand new meaning in it. Comic-book superheroes and supervillains are real, and once one of their battles resulted in the complete eradication of San Francisco, they're all declared persona non grata in the US and told to leave lest they be shot on sight by the assorted Metanormal Tactical Units (\\"MTacs\\") of every major police department in the country. The principal character, Officer Soledad O'Roark, is a bit of a renegade and a hothead, but is also an engineering genius by designing a variety of highly unauthorized ordnance delivered by an equally unauthorized O'Dwyer Variable Lethality Law Enforcement gun (a real device from Australia with a theoretical fire rate of 1 million rounds a minute) to take out the \\"freaks\\" as they're now called: white phosphorous rounds for the Human Torch types, contact poison rounds for the Thing types, composite rounds for the Magneto types, and \\"barrel-launched adaptive munition\\" guided smart rounds for the Flash types. The only thing she doesn't have is a real defense against the Shadowcat-esque intangibles and the Professor X-like telepaths, the latter being the most dangerous because they've often had cops shoot themselves with their own guns, along with the politicians of the LAPD. From time to time it gets a little overly political, but it does provide you with what Senator Kelly and General Stryker were thinking."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"I usually don't buy books in hardcover and I definitely don't buy books in hardcover that I don't have a really clear idea of what I'm getting in advance, via reviews or word of mouth. So it was really unusual that I bought this book on a whim last week, after just reading the cover flap and never having heard of the book or the author.It was a worthwhile purchase, though, even though I DID read it in a two-sitting binge. I liked the alternate reality world where superheroes and villains exist, and the way bureaucracies and mere humans cope with the day to day of trying to enforce the laws against them. The story itself was suspenseful and hard to put down, and the writing was terse and really added to the story. So many suspense/action novels seem like a waste of trees--why not just go straight to the screenplay sale that this is obviously angling for? Not in this case--while the story WOULD make a great movie, the writing itself adds a dimension to the story that a mere screenplay would not have.But what I most liked was the way I was placed in the position of being sympathetic toward someone whose political views I despised (and like most fans of the x-men, I read anti-mutant as racism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc.) and wanting the best for her even while I root against her side succeeding.The main problem I had with the book was that it wasn't long enough. It obviously is the first of several or a series, or at least I hope it is because much was left unfinished at the end of this book. I'm looking forward to more!"},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Though the writing is technically sound, and Ridley knows his pacing and is able to punch up the action sequences with real drama, he makes some questionable decisions regarding the development (or lack of it) of his main character. He also leaves several huge holes dangling in the plot that leave the reader wondering about those and why he didn't address them rather than concentrating on the tale he is telling. **Possible Spoilers rest of way** Examples of these are when the gun manufacturers don't want the main characters gun developed because it would be in competition with theirs, when in actuality they would just gobble up the rights, which she had indicated she'd sign away, and sell those to police departments also. Or why don't the police and the government employ meta-normals in an official capacity. Failing to address these simple issues is puzzling. But the main problem with book is that the main character is a bigot. And there are many chances for reasonable people in the book to try to explain to her the idea that some good can come out of meta-normals actions, but surprisingly, this almost never happens or is not followed up on. If this book were about a white cop and the meta-normals were replaced by blacks, or the main character hated Jews, or gays, and hated them with such 100% conviction, this book would not be so warmly praised as many are doing. But there are many cutting it slack because they, like me, are comic collectors, who like to see our hobby given serious treatment in outside mediums. But that doesn't excuse the fact that I spent 300 pages becoming emotionally invested in a bigot, who turns down redemption at every turn. I'm not sure if the author is trying to make a statement here that racism is here to stay. If so, then it's too heavy handed and obvious, so that can't be it. If he's trying to say institutional racism is ingrained in our society than he missess the mark because his character acts outside the bounds of the institution she represents laws. Maybe he's trying to say he has no faith in people. If that's the message of the book, then it could have been said in a short story. He came close to creating a great heroine for modern times. Instead he created a bitter woman who echoes the worst of our past. Is what she tries to do on the side of the road any different than a lynching? I've disliked books in the past. But I have a hard time remembering the last time one made me feel this sad, for the opportunity missed."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"A very frustrating read, a literal wall-banger that got deservedly hurled with great force.

However the central premise of this alt-reality, a world where a brief age of superheroic derring-do was ended when a villain succeeded in destroying a city and all metanormals are now outlawed and executed on sight, doesn't stand up well to even cursory consideration. Outlawing superheros because they missed a villain once is something like villifying fireman because an arsonist once got away with the crime. The fanatically genocidal way the ban is enforced is morally repugnant, akin to fighting extremist terrorism by slaughtering all Muslims. The most hateful aspect is the Protagonist, an emotionally barren person who lives only to hate \\"freaks\\" and to kill them in any way possible, and for a rather petty reason (she felt bad when the city blew up; that's pretty much it). The author only highlights the lead's unpleasantness by repeatedly having her confronted by metanormals suffering very human misery due to the persecution, only to snap out how much worse the \\"freaks\\" deserve to suffer. She's a genocidal murderous slime that deserves biblical retribution, yet we're supposed to sympathize with her. I hated spending time with this character, and very much never want to do so again."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"This book has no redeeming features. The main character is unimpressive, being as she is a moronic, tempremental, mal-adjusted, anti-social, racist, whose entire character revolves around her being moronic, tempremental, mal-adjusted, anti-social & racist.The syntax, the pacing, the sentence structure, the dialogue, the imagery are all terribly trite, with no positive side whatsoever. Whats more the entire plot of this novel could be sumed up as \\"Hi, i'm an angry, moronic, tempremental, mal-adjusted, anti-social, racist cop... Ask me how.\\"I actually spent most of this book wondering why the cops didn't just invest in sharpy shooters with sniper rifles.-M"},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"I can really understand why this book can inspire either love or hate. If you've read the Wild Card series edited by George R. R. Martin or the X-men comic books you'll find this book the flip side of what those stories express. I found this book a page-turner in that I couldn't put it down. But I also found the book disturbing in that it seemed to justify a form of racial hatred, a hatred for superheroes. As an African American reader, I kind of wonder what Ridley as an African American writer is trying to say. I do recommend it but I recommend reading it with your eyes wide open. The book does have it's flaws. I found the climax a little hard to believe and the dialogue is clunky. For that I gave it only three stars."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"From the writer of the acclaimed movie Three Kings, what would you expect to follow the release of a pulse-charging, plot-twisting sci-fi cop thriller but a June 3, 2003 DVD/VHS release of an urban anime sci-fi movie starring the voice of hip-hop superstar Li'l Kim as the heroine of Those Who Walk in Darkness, Soledad \\"Bullet\\" O'Roark?Ridley's plot revolves around a group of superheroes with \\"metanormal\\" abilities who encounter the prejudice and hatred of ordinary people, personified by Soledad.This well-thought-out science fiction thriller is Training Day meets NYPD Blue meets X-Men, with a little Blade Runner thrown in, plus \\"Law & Order\\" when a metanormal-championing defense attorney uses Soledad to further her own ambitions. There's even a love story. Ian seems to be Soledad's salvation from a life of hatred, but pulls the rug out from under her in a twist well-foreshadowed in the plot, but as stunning as the final wrinkle in The Ring.Soledad's prejudice, coming from a black heroine, is an intriguing social commentary. The ending, while true to Soledad's character, will provoke commentary and debate, as any work of speculative fiction should."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"They were welcomed at first. The Freaks, muties, metanormals, they were looked upon with awe, as superheros. They had special powers, superstrength, superspeed, telepathy, shapechanging, etc. Some of them even started wearing costumes and went by flamboyant names like Nightshiftand Nubian Princess, breaking up crimes and saving citizens from natural disasters. But just like there are good and bad people, there were good and bad Freaks and when a Freak is bad, they are very very bad. Things changed when one of the bad ones, a supervillan destroyed San Francisco, killing hundreds of thousands of people. The Freaks were ordered to leave the country. Those that stayed, went into hiding and were hunted by trained squads of Freak hunters called M-Tacs.An M-Tac has the most dangerous job in the world - hunting Freaks. It is so dangerous that squads of M-Tacs are limited to only four members, so more than four officers cannot be killed at once. Rookie Soledad O'Roark is initiated in grand style, when her squad is sent to confront a Pyrokinetic and almost wiped out, except for O'Roark's heroics. O'Roark had developed a new weapon with personalized ammunition for each known type of Freak and she killed the Pyrokinetic just in time. As it was, one of her squad, Reese the only other woman, had been killed, another hospitalized, and O'Roark was reassigned to patrol duty until an investigation was completed about her use of an unauthorized weapon.In the meantime, O'Roark manages to kill another Freak. An Angel, a female Freak with wings, who unbeknownst to O'Roark had just saved scores of citizens. This enraged her husband, a Telepath - the most deadly of the Freaks - who plotted retribution and provoked a confrontation with the newly reinstated but still on probation, O'Roark and her squad.CONCLUSIONThe Author, John Ridley certainly has a vivid imagination. This is the first book I have read by him and I have mixed feelings about his writing. He is obviously a talented writer but I found his unorthodox style a little disconcerting. Perhaps this is the new wave, the avant-guard in writing. In any event, I found his style readable but a little jarring. Nothing glaring that I can put my finger on but there. For instance, in a running dialogue, Ridley doesn't bother with the traditional Bo said, .... O'Roark asked, ....? Yarborough replied.... format. Ridley uses colons, i.e. Bo: ..... O'Roark: .....? Yarborough: ..... Nothing wrong here, simply different and that's the way the writing is, nothing wrong just different.Ridley's character development was a tad weak. I never really acquired a grasp on the characters, even the main character, O'Roark. I knew she had a king size chip on her shoulder and felt guilty about not being killed in San Francisco, where her family had been planning to go, but I never really got to know her. The others either. I suppose in an action thriller, one does not need to know the characters as well as, say, a drama. Another thing I thought was a little off was Ridley's handling of O'Roark's squad-mate Reese. Ridley built her up alluding to her being O'Roark's role model and so forth and I thought she was going to be a major player and yet Ridley killed her off a few pages later, the only fatality at the hands of the Pyrokinetic, killed in the first chapter.Ignoring the writers little idiosyncrasies, the overall tone of the book is good. It flows well and at three hundred ten pages is concise not being particularly wordy or rambling.John Ridley had written four other books at the publication date of this book, including Stray Dogs, which was made into an Oliver Stone movie. The movie U-Turn starred Jennifer Lopez and Sean Penn and was filmed in either Globe or Superior, right here in Arizona. I wonder if Ridley has written screen plays as well since his style of writing seems to be conducive to screen writing.Although I enjoyed Those Who Walk in Darkness, I didn't necessarily like it. It wasn't my style and I felt that the premise of the book was a form of genocide. Yes the bad Freaks could be dangerous but most Freaks were good and tried to handle the bad Freaks themselves, yet in the eyes of humans (only in America, many Freaks emigrated to Europe) all Freaks were equal - targets for execution."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Those Who Walk in Darkness was a decent book. To me it was a book about race relations told through the eyes of a racist. While you don't always agree with Soledad, you can understand where she is coming from.The action scenes were quick and at times brutal; definately not the spectacular kind of action found in comic books like the Justice Leage or Avengers. I guess what I'm saying is that it was as realistic as you can get in this kind of fiction.The prose was James Ellroy like. Terse and quick. Don't use 7 words when 4 will do. It seemed to me like the prose was ment to reflect Soledad. She is not the type to be flowery and neither is the writing.Give this book a shot (pun definately intended)."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"I've read most of the reviews for this novel and it seems like the most bitter reviewers are the ones that wanted Soledad to be redeemed some how at the end. Sorry folks. Ridley didn't write a fairy tale or a comedy. This is a bleak bleak tragedy of suprising depth and raw reality.Splattered against a backdrop of post-catastrophic California the tale of Soledad O'Rourke, a very angry black woman indeed, is spun out to the sound of gun fire and explosions. Soledad has issues, lots of them. Yeah she's a bigot and would probably come out worse in comparison with any flesh and blood racist cop. Just because she's black doesn't mean she has to be particularly reasonable or sensative to differences. Ridley puts it in your face from page one. She's a bigot in a society that has accepted this particular brand of racism. How ever it doesn't keep the reader from routing for her and even actively liking her. At the end Soledad loses quite a lot because of her bigoted nature and her unwillingness to change. She pays for her flaws with several very precious things, including hefty chunks of her soul and humanity.Ridley's writing is urban and very now. An incomplete sentence or two is easily overlooked. The atmosphere is very Gothamesque with Soledad drawing parallels to the Caped Crusader himself.If you're looking for a tale with clearly drawn morals and uncomplicated, one dimensional characters look elsewhere. &quot;Those who walk in Darkness&quot; will keep you thinking long after the last page is turned. I await the next installement with baited breath."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Reading some of the other reviews of this book, I see that I'm not alone in thinking this while it makes for great sci fi/action movie material, it's not a particularly enjoyable read. I've read most of Ridley's work and as far as the character Soledad goes, she's a typical Ridley protagonist.When describing his books to someone who hadn't read him, I foudn myself saying \\"you don't read him expecting everything to be all good in the end.\\" His lead characters are almost never worthwhile as human beings, but the difference in this book is that it's actually easier to identify and sypathize with the primary antagonist, Vaughn. There's more logic behind his murderous actions than there is behind Soledad's.Like some other's have already said: it could be that Ridley is making a statement about bigotry and how it can infect anyone's mind. I just don't feel that Soledad is a character worthy of more than one book."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"This is a world where superheroes exist. Like in the Comic Kingdom Come, the metanormals are not popular due to a reckless accident that cost a lot of lives. An Executive Order was issued giving the metanormals a chance to leave the county (with an extra $50,000) and then forbid them to stay under penalty of death. To handle these cases, police departments have special officers called MTacs. This is the story of one of these officers.Soledad O'Roark is new to the squad and soon finds herself confronted with a human fire menace. The only thing that saves her and other members of the squad is a gun she designed and has been trying to get approved. Suddenly everything hits the fan and she is being investigated for using the non-standard gun. As Soledad's goals seem to be going down the drain, she also manages to start the glimmering of a relationship, an unusual occurrence for an MTACS.By the end of the book we have learned the histories and motive of many characters. Learned the alternate history of the world. Learned of human/metanormal relations. It was a very interesting read with plenty of action and plenty of though provocation. A very intelligent novel and an interesting main character. I can't wait to read the next Soledad book."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"I admit I haven't read comics in a long time, but I loved \\"3 Kings\\" so I figured I'd give this a try. Whoa. What this book has that's unique is an absolute lack of moral guidance. The sheer genius of this book is it's absolute lack of moral guidance. Everything I've ever read, no matter how \\"complicated\\" it's ethical web might be, there is always the subtle voice of the author saying \\"here's how you should feel, here's right and wrong\\". That's what makes most books comforting and that's why I enjoy them. But this? Who is right, who is wrong? There's no hidden road map to let me know how I should feel about this war against super heroes. It reminds a lot of Blade Runner, the director's cut, without that stupid narration. I mean, there was our hero, obviously, the person we're supposed to identify with, and his job is to kill life forms who's only real goals are freedom and life. That's Soledad. I don't know how I feel about her. She's the hero, right? She's the person I'm supposed to identify with, right? But what's her job, to kill people who want to protect us and only because one of them screwed up? Because they made her lose faith in her heroes? Jeez. At least in Blade Runner, he got to do the \\"right\\" thing at the end, the thing I would want to do. But at the end of this book? Bottom line, if you want a fun, possibly dark, \\"easy\\" sci-fi book that's going to play nice with your moral compass, don't read this. But if you want to be challenged, this book is awesome!"},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Ridley has done a nice job of setting up a world of mutants, familiar to many comic book readers, and includes allusions to 9/11 as well. Although another reviewer was upset that the main character is a racist throughout the story, the use of mutants to comment on racism is not a new concept for those of us who have any knowledge of The X-Men. I will agree that I was a little disappointed that there was not more of a change in her viewpoint in this regard, but that flaw is not fatal. If anything, I was a little surprised that for a good portion of the book, mutants are not even at the forefront of the story. There is a long portion in which the main character is under investigation by Internal Affairs and is developing a relationship. This is all well done, however, and only deepens our investment in the story. I would guess that the previous reviewer was so upset by the main characters lack of redemption only because the author had done such a good job creating a character we care about. This looks like a series, so perhaps we'll see that in another story. I hope so."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Superbeings exist, but after a cataclysmic incident between two powerful foes, a hero and a villain, takes out a city, they are banned from the United States.Cities have elite police units trained to deal with outbreaks of superbeing activity. Those who serve on these units, taken from the best of the best of SWAT teams have short life expectancies.Super strong, fire blasters, telepathic mind controllers and more are what they must face.Soledad O'Rourke is working on a special type of gun to deal with said bad guys, but is taking a lot of heat from her department and its ties to the usual weapons supplies, and people that don't trust new technology.When she survives a trip or two, she earns the name 'Bullet', and dedicates herself to her job.Everything, of course, is not as black and white as it seems, of course."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"The only reason I kept reading this book was the vain hope that this character would develop some kind of redeeming trait. It never happens, she's treats almost everyone, human or mutant, like crap. She'll watch a mutant save someones life then without hesitation pull out her gun and shoot them. She's filled with blatant, uncompromising hatred and not the least bit of reason or conscience about the people she's murdered. One of the mutants in the book puts it most accurately when he compares her to nazis and klan members.Other than her the book was okay. The action sequences were intense and the other characters were well written."},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"This book has a main character who is a bigot plain and simple, while some have found this an offensive choice for the story's POV, I believe it was a great decision. It leads the audience to constantly question the ethical dilemas society would face if confronted with superhumans. The violent reaction of the government when a superhuman disaster occurs seems incredibly plausible, along with the survivor's guilt that drives the main character's fanatical hatred. Fans of the TV shows Heroes or True Blood, and comics like the X-Men will find themselves right at home with this book. It's odd to recommend a book with a main character whose actions and beliefs disgust me, but is a great read"},{"Title":"Those Who Walk in Darkness Signed 1ST Edition","review":"In the new normal, post 9/11 and the Patriot Act and Abu Ghraib right and wrong go from black and white to a horrid gray. Life is no fantasy. For a fantasy book, Those who Walk in Darkness is harshly real. In the story there are people with amazing abilities, but there are also everyday cops with little more than ordinary sidearms trying to enforce the law. Mind you, the law and what's &quot;right&quot; are two totally different things. I don't mean this in a dismissive sense, but I think some people seem to have come to this book expecting a comic without pictures. This book is more like hard boiled fantasy. It deals more with laws and concepts than empty fluff and is fronted by an anti-hero who is more anti than hero. Definitely not for everyone. Mature readers. Not for the strong language, but for the complexity of thought.

The course was life-changing: not only is Bauer one of the world's leading specialists in Matthew, but his communication, teaching and writing skills are so personal and passionate that even technical material is understandable. His heart for God, Scripture and practical application are all commendable.I owe my passion for Matthew's gospel all these decades later to Dr. Bauer. I now teach Matthew on the college level, and I draw from his well in probably every class session. No one has brought to life the beautiful and intentional literary design, and its resultant theological/practical implications to life like Dr. Bauer.As it is academic, the book would probably be s stretch for college students, but a worthy one to stretch towards.Anyone seeking to capture the flow, narrative and message of Matthew will find a wealth of resources.Whether structural analysis of biblical text is new or not to you, as it is wrestled with, you will be amazed at the life lessons that will result. If you have never considered the crucial place of chiasm, inclusio, and other literary devices/forms in Scripture (or other ancient texts), buy this book yesterday.

This book is still worth reading for those engaged in comparative and structural linguistics studies of extant or vanishing languages, providing a thorough grounding in methods of structural analysis and description that are still valid in terms of the treatment of the surface structure of a language's grammar.One only needs to read these pages and then a modern study in analytical and computational grammar, however, to see how far things have come even since Chomsky's book. Now linguists talk about harmonic context-free grammars, generalized and head-driven phrase-structure-grammars, formal recursive parsing algorithms, and other concepts that sound like they're from the field of computer science or engineering rather than linguistics--and in fact, these ideas are often used to analyze computer languages as well. Hence, you'll see articles in the literature with titles like, \\"Posterior Decoding for Generative Constituent-Context Grammar, or \\"Multi-Modal Combinatory Categorial Grammar,\\" and \\"A Parser for Harmonic Context-Free Grammars.\\"But getting back to Harris's book, this is still an excellent presentation of the subject at a time just prior to Chomsky's revolution, and remains one of the best books on the subject ever written."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"Victoria Price has written a book that i feel is a double edged sword toward her father. i've read it many times and prior to buying the Lucy Chase Williams book on Vincent, i'd pull out Victoria's book as a reference for something obscure or whatever. well, those times are over. it is no secret that Vincent was a liberal politically. his interest in art, conservation, and theatre among other things are stereotypically liberal that we didn't need his daughter to hammer the point home because there's some fans out there, like me, who could care less about their favorite actor or singer's political views and i get offended when it comes across that Republicans like myself shouldn't be a fan of Vincent's because \\"we're bad and want to destroy public TV and arts programs\\", which is how i took it from reading this book. politics you might ask? it's true! Victoria at times brings up the liberalism that she and her parents lived and practiced but she intentionally or accidentally makes people who don't live that way or think as her friends do as being strange or abnormal...in addition, Victoria goes into detail about his successful career on the stage in playhouses all over the United States and abroad and to me this was informative because most people focus on his horror career only. but, here comes another problem, the lack of information on his horror career and his movies in general. what we're treated to are her accounts of what critics or her father had to say about the movies...she offers no first-hand knowledge and SHE IS HIS DAUGHTER so she should know things we don't already...and by the time this book arrived she had PLENTY of time to watch his horror films and get an opinion of them. but, Vincent's dramatic films are also given very little discussion. if we're to believe her, none of her father's films are worth watching unless they recieved high praise from a nationally known critic or were box office successes. she paints a picture that her father's films can't be open to anyone's viewpoint once a critic has stamped it a bomb or whatever. i've seen quite a few of his so-called flops and they were GREAT! near the end of the book we're told about his career on TV and in commercials. his 1981-1989 run as the host of the PBS classic show \\"Mystery!\\" is also touched upon but once again, Victoria showers the chapters with second and third-hand information that family should already know first-hand. the pictures in the book are great!! i love the one where he's with his peers: Karloff, Lorre, and Rathbone during a photo shoot in the early '60s. there is a segment in the book that details Vincent's artistic flamboyance, and she brings up the silly rumors that Vincent was bi-sexual. first off, Vincent's sexual behavior isn't interesting to me! when i'm watching him stare at someone with that menacing look or if he's laughing at some devious scheme he's cooked up, i'm certainly not thinking about who he's sleeping with or who he finds attractive off-screen and so i find this section of the book silly and uncalled for and a MAJOR distraction to what the book was suppose to be, a biography of her father through HER eyes and NOT through the eyes and opinions of critics and industry insiders, which is basically what it turns out to be as a whole!! the only time i see that she gets personal and really says how she feels is when she talks about Vincent and his life with Coral Browne {near the end of the book since the marriage came in 1974}. now, i don't expect Victoria to drop to her knees and kiss the ground her step-mother walked on because after all Coral wasn't Victoria's mother, but at the same time, Corale couldn't have been that awful or else Victoria would've said something DECADES ago to a tabloid paper!! i give this book 3 stars because Victoria doesn't seem to realize that her father's fans aren't interested in rumor, gossip, and alleged communist involvement that were never proven because the accusations were flimsy and had no weight, so it's baffling as to why she'd plant those kind of thoughts about her father to potential new fans who ONLY know of Vincent through Batman re-runs {Vincent played \\"Egghead\\" on a few episodes}."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"There are several other excellent biographies on Price, but this masterful book will be THE definative biography that current and future fans will go back to to understand and appreciate the man.

Bringing up idle rumors that are doubtlessly groundless in a book like this isn't the way I would memorialize my parents.

Vincent Price may have been a unique, instantly recognizable cinematic icon, but Victoria Price focuses on him as a human being, and that makes this book universal.Ms. Price is an excellent prose stylist.

I hardly expected an unbiased opinion from the child of a broken home, but some of the none-too-subtle suggestions that Vincent was 'bi' and so on - without any factual evidence, only gossip - not to mention WHO CARES - is just too much.

I don't like it when people air dirty laundry in public, especially on family matters. There is no chance for VP or Coral Browne to respond. Innuendo shouldn't be brought up - everyone, especially in Hollywood of all places, has enemies or jealous persons ready to use rumors to hurt the other persons reputations. Even bringing such issues up is not worthy. I've got many bio's on Vincent and on his films, and this just isn't going to be on the same bookshelf. I think that maybe some of the high praise on this is based on people's love for the wonderful Mr. Price and not based on their knowledge of the many other wonderful books by him and about him? To me, this is just another &quot;Mommy Dearest&quot; surrounded by seemingly sweet sentiment."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"This book is a very candid, affectionate and revealing look at Vincent Price, not only as a ledgend in the Horror Film genre, but as a very cultivated and educated indavidual, always willing to give more then he can, to the arts media. The book was very interesting to read because the author explains why and how Vincent Price was successful in Hollywood films while he managed to sustain his other iterests and his domestic life. The reader will learn many fascinating things about the famous actor in a way that if one were to look at any of his films afterword, they would view him in a totally different yet still mysterious manner. As a horror fanatic, I'm partial to anything related to the subject matter. This book, however, was full of fun facts and referencaes about certain horror films I've never known. The authors account was very warm, at times humorous and quite amazing. I definately enjoyed the book, and reccomend it to anyone interested in film and media, horror film ledgends or even those who just want to read something different. A must read !"},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"A very readable book, with great insight into Price, the man behind the monsters. Nice details about his family (would you believe his grandfather invented baking powder? Get away!). The book pulls no punches, showing Price at his best (doing charity work, promoting art) and his worse (his comments to Robert Quarry on the set of Madhouse took me by surprise, I didn't think he knew words like that). If you're a Vincent Price fan, don't hesitate. Buy and read the book, now! Nice pictures as well."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"Fun book! Turns out Vincent Price wasn't the sinister guy he played in movies, but a really nice guy."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"This is an excellent, engrossing book about one of my favorite actors, Vincent Price. I found the story of his last years terribly, terribly sad - and it's a lesson to everyone - don't lose sight of your family when you're on the way up, because you'll regret it when its too late to do anything about it. Mr.Price had a great life, and his legacy will live on with his fans, family and friends. My only complaints are two: As an old-time radio fan I wanted much more on Price's radio work, and when are we going to get the Art Book that was the genesis for this biograpahy? Thank you Victoria, and thank you, Vincent Price."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"Vincent Price was one of my favorite horror actors, ranking with with Karloff, Chaney, Cushing and Lee. This book provides somewhat of an in-depth look at the man, not the actor. I was unaware that Mr. Price had a daughter until reading this book. I must say, she is indeed a very prolific writer and knew how to stir emotions in the reader. As I was winding down the last few pages that described his final days, I cried as I read each page. It felt as if I had known him after having read all there was to know of him. He struck me as being a gentle man, unlike the sinister characters that he was known for on screen; it surprised me to know how that conniving witch of a wife, Coral Brown, made a pansy out of him during their marriage, keeping him from the loving arms of his children and his grandchildren with her raging jealousy and insecurity. It just proved how devoted Mr. Price was to her, in spite of her selfishness.The book also mentions much about his talent when it came to cooking and art, two of the many things that meant much to him when he wasn't scaring the pants off his loyal fans in his work. Having remembered Mr. Price from his horror films of the 50s and 60s, I was very moved when I watched his final performance as the creator of \\"Edward Scissorhands.\\" In the film he displayed a soft father-like character instead of the mad scientist/murderer characters that he was most known for. While I was reading his book, I researched smany of the pieces that he most relished which proved that he did have quite the eye for classic art. I understand that several cookbooks have been published of his most relished cuisine which I plan to attempt myself, although I don't consider myself to be a gourmet.I highly recommend this book to anyone, fan or not, whom I am sure will be as moved as I was. His daughter is to be praised and congratulated for such a very entertaining work. Thank you, Victoria.Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography"},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"This is not so much a biography of Vincent Price as it is a book length therapy session for Miss Price. We can tell more about her thoughts than her fathers. Her own biases are clearly defined in this treatment. It's entertaining but not a must have."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"This is a fine, detailed portrait of Vincent Price that will be hard for fans to put down (double meaning intended). Biography, especially by a person who knows the subject intimately, always has individual perspective, yet Ms. Price has written an excellent, professional account that also includes, of course, special insights. (Unlike a previous reviewer, incidentally, I don't recall Ms. Price clearly inferring that her father was bi-sexual, only that some people wondered about it, and I saw nothing wrong in addressing this.) This book is not intended to be an analytical examination of Price's movies, but a way of getting to know the person, his background, interests, accomplishments, and what sort of life he led---let alone the familiar and unfamiliar anecdotes that are so entertaining.I once attended a lecture by Vincent Price in Seattle and was captivated by his knowledge and humor. He told entertaining stories about his experiences in Hollywood (one I recall was him getting a little tap on the shoulder in a grocery store, and when he turned around it was Ava Gardner, who said, \\"Hi, Vinnie!\\") Toward the end of his lecture, he told the audience he was going to recite some lines from Shakespeare in a part he knew he would never have been asked to play. He did Romeo's famous soliloquy to Juliet. And amazingly enough, it was superb!Because I grew up watching Vincent Price (mainly after he became the horror actor most of us know and love), and because of the fascinating man himself, I found this one of the most enjoyable biographies I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"This book has hundreds of details that I have never known before. It gives a deep detailed look into Price's life and career.If you are doing a research paper on Price, you should have this book as one of your sources. It gives an over-abundance of information."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"Having read this book, I now have even greater love and respect for the man. Victoria wrote a thorough biography, flavored with love and loss. Having once met Vincent Price when he made an appearance in Milwaukee in the early '80's, I feel especially privileged to have talked with my idol of many years. He is everything gentle, courtly, kind and gracious. This book filled in so much of his life that was unknown to me. Upon the announcement of his passing, I nearly crashed my car on the freeway, the sense of loss was so great. Thank you, Victoria for taking the risk, and for giving back to me someone I have admired for years."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"I just finished a book called VINCENT PRICE: A DAUGHTER'S BIOGRAPHY. As you may have guessed it was written by Vincent price's daughter, Victoria, and it's about Vincent Price. It's pretty interesting too.Victoria draws upon her own experiences with her father as well as files pulled from Vincent's personal papers after he died. So you get two books for the price of one. You get a father/daughter Lifetime type story about how they were close, then drifted apart, then became close again later in life, all against the backdrop of Hollywood from the 50's to the present. And you get plenty of cool and interesting stories about Vincent Price the Actor and all those nutty films of his.Price was quite a Renaissance Man and an especially devoted art collector. One of his lifelong goals was to make L.A. the artistic center of America. So you also get some inside info on the L.A. art scene of the 50's thru the 90's. SOme of that's as crazy as his movies.I don't want to list every last interesting fact or story that appears in this book, so I instead,as this book is written by Vincent's daughter from her daughterly perspective, I cobbled together a list of the TOP 10 INTERESTING ASPECTS OF HAVING VINCENT PRICE AS YOUR FATHER:10. Sweet 16 party decorated by Roger Corman.9. Peter Lorre always coming over to borrow sugar in his bath robe.8. As a young child on Christmas Eve you impatiently ask your father, Vincent Price,\\" Daddy, when is Santa coming?\\"...His response... Sinister bone-chilling laughter.7. \\"Uncle\\" Boris Karloff asking you to pull his finger every Thanksgiving.6. Jokingly blames personal flatulence on \\"The Tingler\\".5. If you think it was tough on Ben Stiller finding out his girlfriend's father was Robert DeNiro, imagine your boyfriend meeting your father, the Abomidable Dr. Phibes!4. Sarcastically referred to his frosty, hen-pecking 3rd wife's woo-hoo as \\"The Tomb of Ligea\\".3. You don't get the lead in the school play. Next week you drama teacher is murdered by over consumption of toy-poodle soup.(That's a toughie)2. Drunken friends accidentily mistaking acid bath in the basement for a jacuzzi.1. Constantly finding Bela Lugosi passed out in the laundry basket.It's a good book, give it a read."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"How presumptuous of Brian Hathaway to assume that anyone else could have such an absurd take on such a wonderful, entertaining, educational and very loving biography. I don't know what streets he's walking down but I don't think that they exist in Raleigh, NC or anywhere other than, perhaps, his own mind. The style and eloquence of this book made it a joy along with so many fascinating (1st hand)stories as well as historical accounting of a time gone by. As for the &quot;bi&quot; part...with so many other wonderfully informant and enjoyable excerpts why does HE want to focus on this? But, yes, I agree with the daughter, better to address it and put it to bed (no punn intended) than ignore what has been a Hollywood whisper. Good job, Victoria. Always a fan of your father, and, now, thankfully you! I found it extremely fascinating, entertaining and educational and bought 6 copies for Christmas presents.Looking forward to your next book... Go lick your own wounds, Brian."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"What a refreshing way to read about a favorite celebrity. No Mommy Dearest here. This book by Mr. Price's daughter gives an honest and loving portrait of a great star from a daughters perspective. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"While other books have concentrated more on the extraordinary career of Vincent Price, never before has the man behind the personna been so fully revealed. &quot;Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography&quot; is a must for anyone interested one of the century's most unique actors and one of the true Renaissance men of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"Victoria Price lovingly recounts the life of her father, actor Vincent Price, in a carefully researched book. Drawing from Price's own letters and diaries, as well as her childhood memories, the author gives incite to a man who was much more than just a horror film villain or one of the old Hollywood Squares. In writing this book, a daughter reaches an understanding of her father, both as a man and actor."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"The price one must pay for being famous -- and a father -- is that one of your kids will write a book about you. There will be the good. And the bad. Victoria Price doesn't do a \\"Daddy Dearest,\\" nor does she dish too much in this bio of her father, he who continues to scare the bejesus out of filmgoers in such classics as \\"The Fly,\\" \\"House on Haunted Hill\\" and \\"House of Wax.\\" She does reveal some shockers: As a student, Price was anti-Semitic, writing letters praising Hitler; during the McCarthy witchhunt of the '50s, he condemned his peers who took the Fifth when asked if they were members of the Communist Party. Price's effete quality is also discussed, and though Victoria claims she could not find any evidence Dad was gay or bisexual, he did acknowledge that he once had a relationship with a man that he described as \\"a love affair without the sex.\\" A small price to pay, indeed."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"Victoria Price's book was a big disappointment. Price's own autobiography covers his early years, and the films are throroughly and more acurately covered by Lucy Chase Williams' book. Victoria's book is long, but the only &quot;new&quot; information would have been better left unsaid. Much of it is republican bashing from both father and daughter, at times it's hard to tell which is actually speaking. To them, it's heroic to oppose fascism, but those who opposed communism as well are &quot;villains&quot;. The conservative bashing extended to trying to prevent the John Wayne Cancer Center from getting money Coral Browne willed them!"},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"Such a charming, elegant, and intelligent man deserved much better. Victoria's liberal bias taints an otherwise sentimental recollection of life with one of the most gracious men that ever lived. Instead read Vincent Price's own writings, which are much more revealing and still widely available."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"I considered myself a fan of Vincent Price since I was a small child. His voice, his height, his choices of roles, I was hooked. However, after having read Victoria's account of his life, I no longer consider myself a fan. Her views on his politics were not necessary. In my opinion, the comments bordered on hate. I wish I had selected a biography written by someone other than Victoria, then I would not have been so disappointed."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"Many people know Vincent Price simply as &quot;that horror film actor&quot;. He was, however, a man of many varied interests and talents, far beyond those even most fans might be aware of. The life of Vincent Price could be summed up in one word: full. Price did so much with his life that the author's job of bringing it to one book must have been daunting. But Victoria accomplishes this task quite well. From traveling to and receiving his education in Europe, to his first major stage role (and huge hit) in Victoria Regina, his stage, television and film work, marriages, children, interests in travel, public-speaking, cooking, writing and well-known and life-long love of art are all here. For those who must have something a little more lurid, heretofore-unknown facts about his involvement with the Fifties McCarthy witch-hunts and the rather shocking deal he made, and his sexuality are touched on. The greatest achievement of this book, however, owes as much to Vincent Price himself as it does to the author. Throughout his life Vincent wrote (and kept) an enormous amount of correspondence. With this wealth of personal documents at her disposal, Victoria sprinkles quotes from Vincent throughout the book. Thus, we are fortunate to have Vincent's life unfold before us as if Vincent himself were relating his own story. His triumphs, failures, joys, fears, pain. Vincent talks to us about each. Never before has a person's life, documented by another, been brought so close to the reader, or made so personal. Many thanks are due, both to Victoria and Vincent for this wonderful accomplishment. There are a few downsides to the book, however. The book is lacking when the author discusses her father's films. She has over the years admitted that she never really watched her father's horror pictures. As such, we regretfully do not gain many insights into the making of those films that we didn't already know from other books. This is a huge opportunity lost. And sadly, the slant that comes across when the author discusses her (deceased) stepmother, actress Coral Browne, is decidedly negative. While entitled to include or discard facts as one wishes (for this book is as much a memoir of Victoria's life as it is a bio of Vincent's), one wishes the author hadn't been quite so needful (and used a bio of her father as the vehicle) to paint Browne in such a bad light. The uplifting, joyful and celebratory narrative of Vincent's life comes to an abrupt halt when the author turns her attention to detailing her stepmother's perceived faults."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"This is probably the most rounded, most intimate portrait we will ever get of a horror film star. Due to her unparallelled access to her father, his unpublished memoirs, and his letters, Victoria Price gives us a remarkably intimate and detailed view of her father's public and private life. The strongest parts of the book are her portraits of her father's theatrical career (covered in great detail), and his rich private and social life. His marriages to Mary Grant Price and Coral Browne are portrayed in all their complexity,and Price's final years are revealed with both love and sadness. The book has literally dozens of fresh details about Price's private life which were unknown to even this veteran fan. The book has its weaknesses, though: Victoria Price has no great interest or love for horror movies, and her usually rigorous command of detail breaks down when she covers these topics. And her coverage of Price's film career is heavily dependent on an earlier book by Lucy Chase Williams, THE COMPLETE FILMS OF VINCENT PRICE--to the point where I thought she had Williams book in one hand while typing in the other. Additionally, Ms. Price's book lacks footnotes, a somewhat maddening omission, as the many anecdotes from her father are all unsourced. But all in all, this is a must-buy and must-read for any Vincent Price fan."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"This was a wonderful book, from beginning to end. I've been a Vincent Price fan since I was a little kid, but I never had a clue that he did anything other than horror movies until I became an adult. While reading this book I became fascinated with him all over again, watching old movies that were new to me, like Oscar-winning LAURA, where he played a young playboy from Kentucky. Not only do you learn about him personally, but about the extreme era in which he grew up. He witnessed the Nazi regime first-hand while living overseas, and even attended one of Adolph Hitler's many rallies. This book really gets to the heart of his true loves in life; Art, Europe, Family, Music, and the stage. Read it and dicover what a wonderful, multi-faceted person he was all over again."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"This biography is surprisingly good, considering the subject's own daughter wrote it. Victoria Price manages to remain objective in discussing her father's life, though - as is only to be expected - she accentuates the positive and quickly glances by the negative. Not that this is a bad thing (I wouldn't expect, or necessarily be attracted to, some kind of expose on the man), but it does leave unanswered questions.Victoria brings up Vincent's \\"grey listing\\" during the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings, and his getting around it by making some general pro-American/anti-Communist statements to the FBI denoting basic agreement with them (citing organizations and non-named individuals as being un-American) for instance, and even that his affirmations to the contrary were later discovered (by her) to be false, but this is quickly glossed over - as is her father's \\"occasional drinking problem,\\" which she tantalizingly hints was an ongoing familial difficulty but refuses to detail. Vincent was involved in the 1959 rigged quiz-show hearings for his part in The $64,000 Question, about which Victoria hastens to inform us he was found innocent, or at least ignorant, of - though oddly she virtually proves the actor's at least semi-knowing involvement in his behind-the-scenes pre-briefings before airtime.Victoria is best at presenting the human side of the man, which is after all what a good biography does. Her greatest strength is in detailing his psychological development and early career, pre-horror star status. She falters considerably from Vincent's American International Pictures years on, admitting herself that she still hasn't seen his many famous horror films. Anyone looking for information on those projects and those years would do best to look elsewhere.Still, that this is a less thorough biography than it could be is a matter of little import. It does genuinely paint a warm portrait of what Vincent Price was, by one of the people who would know best: an accomplished art critic and collector, a gourmand, a generous benefactor to those in need, a concerned and active political man, a devoted father, and (of course) a celebrated actor. Victoria does at least mention her father's flaws, in such fashion as one can only sympathize with them, and does a wonderful job of presenting the famous actor as the remarkably vigorous and witty Renaissance man he was."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"Well, I'm almost afraid to make mention of any thing to criticize in the book after the past few reviews here, but there really isn't that much to complain about anyway (nor is this the forum for people to be objecting to other reviewers that merely stated their views of the book -- and not on other reviewers). Excellent book about Vincent and certainly filled in some holes about his career that I was never quite sure about (especially as I had nowhere to go to research his career properly until this book). I do feel that too much time was spent on Coral, but given that this was a women who represented so much in the writer's relationship with her father, it is forgivable. The only major complaint (and it's not much of one) is the use of fractured timelines in the text that leaves a reader bouncing back and forth through time a bit too much. As to the &quot;bi&quot; thing (since it has been brought up), I do also feel that the author never bothered resolving the issue in any form, thus it seemed a bit silly to even bring it up in the text of the book. Still, I doubt it would keep anyone from the book itself in discussing such matters."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"First I have to wonder whether I read the same book as the reviewer on January 17. I found it to be well written, well researched, and terrific reading. This intimate look at Vincent Price was much more than I expected since Victoria had the kind of access to her subject that a lot of biographers do not: she was his child, lived with him for some years, and she also had the good fortune to have scores of family members, wives, close friends, co-workers, etc. to glean information from. And she painted a balanced portrait of the man complete with his flaws.I also disagree that the book's focus is on Victoria. She is in it no more and no less than any child of a biographical subject would be. The reviewer seems to be implying that Victoria is whining and complaining about her life and the times her father was away from home working, etc. etc. She does mention that at times the relationship suffered because of his absences, but she also makes clear a number of times just how much she loved and admired her father and vice versa and how she treasured their relationship and the times they shared together. My impression is that they had a pretty good overall relationship and it does not seem to me that Victoria is &quot;licking her emotional wounds in public.&quot;She is upfront about the tense and awkward relationship she had with Coral Browne, Vincent's last wife, but she also takes great care to understand how much of an imposing presence Coral was in her father's life (apparently in anyone's life!) and also recounts the great times she had with Coral once Coral began to let her guard down. Victoria understands that Coral was threatened by the undying love and devotion Vincent had for his daughter and Coral hated the fact that she was not the only person in Vincent's life. Most of Coral's friends and acquaintances that were interviewed admit that Coral was unable to accept that Vincent refused to completely shut his kids out of his life because that was what Coral wanted and this was what led to some tensions in the relationships.However, as I said, Victoria states that she came to like and admire Coral and recounts a number of times that they shared good times together. As for the hints of bisexuality, Victoria points out clearly that for years there were rumors of both Vincent and Coral being bisexual and that they were well aware of the rumors and laughed about it all. The focus on Vincent's career is pretty interesting and while there are many anecdotes about his films, plays, costars and the like, the book is hardly gossipy. I do agree that she seemed to gloss over his work in horror films which kind of disappointed me since, as a kid, that was how I first became aware of Vincent Price, but she admits herself that she has no great love for horror films, but she doesn't ignore them altogether; she understands how important they were in her father's career and how they opened Vincent to a wider audience than ever. She just doesn't cover them in great detail as I would have liked. Then there are the other sides of Vincent: the art lover and supporter, the gourmet, the loyal and devoted friend and father which help with the balanced portrait. Does Victoria cover every single facet of her father's life. No, probably not, but what biography is 100% complete? Some things are bound to get short shrift in the grand scheme of things. (She does acknowledge her debt to Lucy Chase Williams and her book on Vincent's films) All in all, I'm thankful to Victoria for this well balanced, fascinating and entertaining look at one of the best there was. She should be as proud of her book as she was of her father and this terrific book will be part of Vincent's legacy. I say read it for yourself and judge. My guess is that if you're a fan of Vincent's you won't be disappointed. Thanks again Victoria!"},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"The one thing you could always count on from Vincent Price was a good performance. Price always gave his all to whatever character he played, be it Brigham Young or Dr. Phibes, Mr. Manningham of Angel Street or Egghead of Batman. He was a professional, through and through.This biography of Price by his lovely daughter Victoria would certainly have made Vincent proud, for it is also thoroughly professional. The author's prose is about as polished as it gets, which makes reading the book a joy. And the editing is nothing if not top notch.The book starts with interesting information on Vincent Price's early life in St. Louis, then moves on to his college years (Price graduated from Yale), to his overseas travels, his work in London theatre, his eventual return to the United States and work on Broadway, his marriages to actress Edith Barrett (who bore him a son, Vincent Barrett Price), to designer Mary Grant (who bore him Victoria), to Vincent's work in Hollywood, to his eventual final marriage to actress Coral Browne, and much more.We learn much about Price's great love for art and of his desire to make art affordable for everyone (which led to Price's work for Sears); of his contributions to various art galleries and his efforts to have a permanent gallery of his own (he had one, for a time, but had to close it); of his travels to exotic places around the world; of his gourmet cooking; of his love for animals; of his extensive work in film (Price made a number of horror films, but most of his work in film was not horror related), of his extensive television and stage work; of his incredible solo show as Oscar Wilde and of his many speeches; and of his relationships with many of the biggest stars of his day, many of whom became his close personal friends.Some of the most interesting parts of the book were those in which the author wrote of Vincent's relationships with people in general. Although Price was a big star, he apparently treated everyone with the same genial kindness, be they celebrities like himself or mere street sweepers.So as not to make him into too much of an angel, Victoria also tells of her father's occasional angry outbursts, of his affairs, and of his two divorces. She tells of his insecurities, and of his all-consuming desire to be liked.Vincent Price has been gone for a few years now - gone but not forgotten. His work remains, as does his spirit in the hearts of his family, friends and fans."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"As a long time admirer of Vincent Price I found this book quite interesting and entertaining. On the plus side ,it provides a comprehensive overview of the subject's movie career with enough \\"Behind the Scenes\\" trivia to satisfy the fans. It certainly opens the door on the various Price households (plural !) and there are a few revelations. The author has a smooth writing style and the book is easy to read.However,far too much space was devoted to \\"Vinnie's\\" involvement in the world of art . I found myself skipping over ALOT of pages . Worth buying at a budget \\"Price\\" if you're a fan of this uniquely talented actor."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"This biography is no &quot;Mommy, Dearest&quot;-posthumous attack. It is, instead, a balanced look at a multi-faceted man, and the biographer has been, overall, quite responsible. There are very few negative &quot;revelations,&quot; and even those are correctly placed in context of stressful times or unfounded innuendo. Victoria Price did NOT savage her father, but as a responsible biographer she had an obligation to address some aspects that may not be regarded as flattering. Vincent Price was a human being of enormous talent, perspicacity, and personal charisma -- this book reinforces that, although admitting that he was, after all, a human being and subject to human failings. My understanding for the man was increased, not diminished, by this book. My only complaint about the book is that it is &quot;light&quot; on info about VP's film career. Ms Price's acknowledged disinterest in his &quot;horror&quot; movies is evident -- and I was saddened by her lack of appreciation. This book must be viewed as an adjunct to Lucy Chase Williams' magnificent &quot;Complete Films of VP,&quot; not a replacement for."},{"Title":"Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography","review":"What a life! There is one word I can think of to describe Vincent Price--Integrity. This book was a disappointment, however. The author's (Price's daughter) constant rant about evil conservatives detracted from the reason I bought the book in the first place--love of the films. Although I enjoyed reading of his personal political thoughts, I couldn't be sure where his' thoughts left off and her's began."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],L={key:0},B={key:1};function q(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",B,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",L,"See more"))],8,W)):p("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-b3bc89dc"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/58.md","filePath":"library/58.md"}'),R={name:"library/58.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(H)]))}});export{D as __pageData,E as default};
