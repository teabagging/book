Would Juliette play?A large number of intellectuals from the German expulsion of Jewish mentalities came to America as an ideal society for people freely contriving thermonuclear weapons. There is no index for this book. Many of the notes gives variations in the text from the first publication in 1944 when a second version of 1947 reveals a change in terminology describing some concepts in political economy. The approach to politics as a form of activity making the feckless powerlessness of political jellyfish caught in a monetary net pulled by a flash bang gravy train diving as deep as German philosophy realizing that its control of events is even less universal than an ideal in Kant, who still gets remembered as if:In confirming the scientific systemas the embodiment of truth -the result arrived at by Kant -thought sets the seal on itsown insignificance, becausescience is a technical operation,as far removed from reflectionon its own objectives as anyother form of labor underthe pressure of the system. (p. 66).I originally looked for an index to identify the personification Juliette for a section of the book called:Excursus II: Juliette or Enlightenment and Morality.The material identified as edited in 1987 by Gunzelin Schmid Noerr translated from Volume 5 of the German works of Max Horkheimer provides an Afterword (pp. 217-247) quotes key ideas from something Horkheimer wrote in 1943:the permanence of oppression,its parasitic nature, becomesmanifest. . . . The structurecorresponded to that of competingrackets. . . . The racket pattern,which used to be typical ofthe behavior of the rulerstoward the ruled, is nowrepresentative of all humanrelationships, even thosewithin the working class. (p. 236).The laboring masses arethe object of both forms;they merely have to payfor the whole system. (p. 236).Previous racket theory has assumed that social systems were the primary mechanism for extracting whatever flow could be diverted from the crazy system that produced a chapter in this book called:The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception.Modern society considered as a host of baby Babylons producing lots of higher swindle fanatics can skip from mythologizing pleasure to victimizing human behavior without regard to rank or class.

The book also takes a look at some of the programs which were initiated by various nations in the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan and Thailand at different points of time, what the expectations were when the programs were initiated and how they have eventually stood up on those expectations. A common failure of all the temporary worker programs is best summed up in a line from the book \\"There is nothing more permanent than temporary workers.\\" Quite true. While governments and bureaucrats who frame the provisions of guest worker programs might expect that employers will register all their immigrant workers even when it takes them several months of wages to go through the whole registration process and immigrants themselves will return to their home nations after staying in the host nations for a few months, the realities are far more complex. With time, employers get used to having a virtually inexhaustible source of cheap and docile labor while the immigrants themselves get used to the higher wages and higher living standards of the host nations. As a remark on the very last page of the book makes clear: \\"What is worse than being exploited abroad? Not being exploited abroad.\\"The book overall is a serious read for someone who is interested in the topic of migration and the demand and supply conditions leading up to it. Not only does it offer different perspectives that are drawn from a wide range of nations over several decades, it also provides some interesting factoids that would be interesting to some. To mention just two: The total number of immigrant workers at about 90 million constitutes 3% of the global labor force. Yet another- While 60% of the migration is in the developed nations (about half of that in the US), the rest 40% of the immigration is in the developing nations such as Thailand which in the short span of a few decades turned from a net exporter of immigrants to a net exporter of immigrants.Recommended for the serious reader and someone who is interested in how complex the realities of migration are."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I think I preferred her last two books even though they were a mediocre rating. I think she's getting way too much publicity because she got published as a teen. I think she should put for characterization and description into her book, it's not very accurate to visualize. It only took me a little over an hour to read.Looking over the other reviews, they are right, she needs something new. The witches and vampires just is plain and boring out there. I admire her for being published at a young age, but her writing really needs an improvement."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"The book by Amelia Atwater contains a story line that you can relate to real life issues and she captures the reader throughout the whole story. Shattered mirror is about a girl named Sarah Vida. She's a teenager in high school but she has a secret. She goes to school during the day and hunts vampires at night. She is a witch and she is stronger than the average human.At night she hunts a vampire named Nikolas because he killed one of her ancestors, Elizabeth Vida. At school she makes friends with two vampires but there's only one problem. Nissa is Nikolas's sister and Christopher is his twin brother. Sarah gets in a fight with Nikolas and hesitates because he looks so much like Christopher. She tries to put space between herself and Christopher but it doesn't work and she gets caught disobeying the Vida rules by her mom. She has a choice of running for the rest of her life or trying to kill Nikolas before he kills her.Shattered mirror was an excellent book and it brought up some good points. Like don't judge people by their appearance and get to know people because they might just surprise you. Amelia Atwater writes in an intriguing manner and she keeps you wondering what's going to happen next."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I've only read a couple of Atwater-Rhodes books recently and am shocked at how talented such a young author is. The thought of having a best-seller at the tender age of 13 is mind-bongling. Her books only take me a few hours to read, which means they are fairly short, yet with so few words she can bring the reader to smoothly and easily into the life of this fictional character. I can understand how the main character feels, why she is thinking the way she thinks. Even the bad guys are made crystal clear. I'm definitely planning to work my way through all her writing.In shattered mirror, Sarah is a witch, and a trained vampire hunter at seventeen. As a matter fact, her mother is the most famous, and feared, hunter of her time, and she comes from a famous line of vampire hunters. She was trained mercilessly since an extremely young age on how to kill these \\"leeches\\" with as little emotion as possible. After all, they are all just creatures preying on the human race. Sarah has to attend a new school after being kicked out of the last one for fighting. On her first day she meets and befriends a sister and brother, both vampires. She can tell they are weak and not prone to feeding on the human race, but that doesn't change the fact that they are leeches, none the less. She tries to break off the friendship, but they are just so nice, so good, it makes it hard to turn away. Besides Christopher is so sweet. He leaves her the most beautiful sketches of herself and poetry in her locker and books and, well, how could she kill someone she likes?If your not sure wheather or not you should give this one a try, trust me, you won't regret it.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Sarah Vida is the new girl in town.

It shows not only the love and loyalty that can exist between siblings no matter what they do, but it shows what lengths a person might go to survive.

Her sucess and multitudes of positve reviews is baffling."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"While some confusingly bitter reviewers angrily state that the story is \\"stolen\\" from that horrid show Buffy, I'm afraid the story is Amelia's.

Honestly, if you want to read more by this author, skip this book and continue on to her fourth one."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book was an all right book. It confused me greatly. I liked Sarah, who was an excellent page-stealer, and Christopher's sister, Nissa, who seemed expertly created. However, Christopher and Nikolas both annoyed me. Christopher was too cocky, to I-Know-You'll-Love-Me. And Nikolas was an excellent villian for a while...until the author completely changed directions in making him a caring, loving Vampire. It drove me crazy, espeacially as Atwater-Rhodes made the witches more and more \\"bad\\". They seemed to become gradually worse than the vampires, while I had wanted it for once to be the other way around.Although I reccomend READING this book,I wouldn't BUY this book. It's a great addition to Atwater-Rhodes' collections..."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book is another excellent book from Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. This one is different from the others as it stars a witch instead of the usual vampire. This book was a twisting book with surprises. Example: Their is a twist about the main character's enemy. It was also romantic. I enjoyed this book. I give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"It was a good book. It is by far better than the other two. I was pretty surprised at how much she grew. And I do have a message for Amelia, should she come across this - Don't listen to other people who try to set limits for you. Break past their boundaries and do what makes you happy. Whenever someone tries to set a limit for you, it should only inspire you even more. And when someone either passionately loves or passionately hates your books, it means that you have a very controversial, but very good book! And you have &quot;it&quot;, the charisma that people like Stephen King, Justin Timberlake, and The Rock have. Don't ever listen to people who tell you that &quot;you can't.&quot; They just aren't worth it.I also wonder about the people who put bad reviews on this book. Could it just be envy?"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"The book is bad from begining to end. We all know Miss Amelia is a young writer, but has she ever heard of a thing called pronouns? Her writing frustrated me and got on my nerves. She keeps on writing \\"Sarah...Nikolas..\\" in every single sentence. Then, she combines to many things into a sentence in a really bad way. The story did not seem interesting to me at all. If you're an ignorant gothic kid you'll enjoy this book, but other than that you will hate it! It's an annoying book and she needs to add more detail to her writing. I never want to open this book ever again in my life!=_='"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I have no problem with this being about a vampire hunter. Believe it or not people, Buffy wasn't the first thing to use them.The story started off good, but the ending good really stupid, for the lack of a better word. Nike is a killer who tortues his victims and makes them his followers, but is good and moral because he doesn't kill them? Uh, no, that didn't go down my thoat no matter how hard the author tried to shove it. The idea of vampires, after living a hundred years, decide to go to high school is hard to believe. The ending is the same as Demon in my View and it's hard to buy this time around. The vampires (who kill people) are made to be the good guys while the witchs (who risk their lives to save us meer mortals) are the bad guys. The idea that a person, who's father was killed by vampire, would sit well with the idea that they are vampires is outrageous.The author needs to wait a couple of years before she writes another book. In that time span, she should watch people and see how they act. Because the Chacters she creates are not even remotely close to the people on plant earth."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"To me thins book is one of me favorites. Vampires, fighting, and romance.To exciting for words.Sarah, a high school teenager by day, and a vampire hunter by night also a witch. I recommend this book to people that love vampires as much as me and are a teenager looking to find a fast action book about love and hatred.Sarah a vampire hunter, with a mother in charge of all the witches, goes to another school to get a way from the vampires at her old school, but finds more then enough vampires at her new school.In my opinion that when Sarah gets turned into a vampire, yes she does, but only after her vampire boyfriend messed up and tried to make her one of them but in turning one she almost dies because her witch powers ciliated with her new vampire genes."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This one was better than the other one I read from her (Demon...)... better, but not great. I picked up this one because a friend was completly crazy about her. The plot twist was great and seemed so original... and then i read the other one and my illusions were shattered. Just finding out that Demon came first is a dissapointment. I feel sorry for this poor author because all her life from now on she'll be reminded of these terrible works of fluff. Make way, much better writers are on their way."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"ok a vampire slayer falls in love with a young vampire, hmmmmmm? where have we heard this before? anybody heard of buffy the vampire slayer, yeah thats where i heard about this , you see buffy was a vampire slayer and she fell in love with the young vampire, Angle but angle doesnt drink the blood of humans, but animals but then he turned evil and she sent him to hell, well this wasnt exactly like that but the buffy angel thing is right on, this author has a grudge against buffy, she should get her own material"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I was sadly disappointed and probably the last time I will ever think of buying her book. Next time I will just save the money and borrow it from the library. there's just no improvement in her writing. This is even more unoriginal then her last two books. It reminds me of a rip off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I expected more from her. This is garbage, hopefully her next book will be well over the vampire hunter a la witch by then. It be nice to read something not about witches in every book."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book was really good and I would suggest it to anyone who likes vampire books, romance novels, and/or action books. It's very interesting what Amelia portrays vampires as."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I forgot how much I loved this book. How I don't know. I love Christopher or Kristopher, either way you want to spell it, though Kristopher is from his people killing days. Sarah Vida, youngest daughter of Dominique Vida the head of the witchy vampire hunters, is awesome. Her Mother moves her and her sister out of the city to a quiet town to keep them out of trouble, but of course Sarah finds trouble because that's just who she is.I love her character. Amelia Atwater Rhodes, author of Shattered Mirror, does an amazing job of making Sarah both a strong, prideful, determined, and brave, but at the same time she has this underlining vulnerability that I love. She isn't perfect and that's one of the reason's she's so relatable. Her Mother is constantly pushing her and in Sarah's eyes her sister is practically perfect. There is so much to live up to in her family, so she is constantly trying to prove she's just as good as everyone else.We can all relate to that. Pride is so a human folly. Toss aside the family issues and throw her into school cue meeting Christopher, god I adore him. He draws her pictures and writes her poetry. I was let him bite me just for that, even though technically he doesn't feed from people anymore. He's like a vampire vegetarian. It's sweet.I never really like to give too much away with reviews on Rhodes's books because they are always so good and I feel like you need to read them to get the full effect. It's incredibly sad how the second I start her book despite the time of day it sucks me in so much so that I get through it in one sitting without any breaks.It's like I literally can't get the pages to turn fast enough. She captures me and I find I'm powerless to resist the enticing world she's created.I urge you to get this book and read it; you'll love it I know you will. Christopher, Nikolas, Sarah they are all spellbinding and the way Rhodes's novels all sort of tie into each other because they're all part of the same world is awesome. Sometimes it even gives you insights into characters from other stories. But seriously, check it out you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I don't remember how I found this book, but I really enjoy the story. Its short which is good and bad. Its an easy read but leaves the reader wanting more in the end-and there isn't a sequel to the book. I love the characters as well as the references made to another book-demon in my view by atwater-rhodes. If you enjoy vampire romance (although it wasn't focused so much on romance like in twilight) Id check it out. Its not like twilight, nor are the characters, but its short and doesn't feel like its been concluded and there's no sequel to it unfortunately. For the story though I give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"The first two books In the Forests of the Night, and Demon in My View in my opionion were much better than this one. I was just about to put this book down when something happened to keep me reading. Didn't hold my attention because I can't remember what it was now :( I will go ahead and read the next one since i've come this far, but if you want a really good series on Vamps/Witches...don't read this one."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I thought this book was okay, but there was nothing very special about it. The story line was ok, but Sarah, the main character, was kind of annoying. All she kept saying through the whole book was \\"I'm a Vida\\" and \\"I'm a vampire hunter\\", \\"Every hunter knows...\\", blah, blah, blah. Ok, I get it. You're a hunter. I got it the first ten times you said it. This book was okay, but I wouldn't buy it (Wish I had read the reviews before I did). I'd say check it out from the library."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This was the first Amelia Atwater Rhodes book I read, and it made me go out and buy all her books. She is one of my favorite author. I cant wait to read the sequel All Just Glass."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Shattered Mirror would have been exactly like the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer if Buffy has been less perky and faked a more \\"tough-girl\\" act. Sarah is a vampire hunting witch. She kills vampires because they are bad by definition. That is until she meets Christopher. He's a good vampire. When he was eating humans, he went by a slightly different name - Kristopher. Even though she fights it, she falls for him. Sound familiar?The story isn't bad, the writing is simple and there isn't much graphic violence. Overall, the book wouldn't be a bad fit for the youngest of teen fiction readers. Nothing new is covered and older readers will have seen it all before."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I don't normally read young adult books but I was desperate and this had good reviews. I was only flipping throough it, not really going to read it but after reading the first chapter I read it through in one sitting.Vida, the vampire slayer, befriends two weak vampires and discovers the world is not black in white. (Its actually amusing that the vampires have similar qualities to Twilights' vampires although this one was written 7 yrs earlier.)Overall, an enjoyable book for all ages."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Shattered Mirror is the third book by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and it doesn't disappoint me. I first started reading this author's books in middle school, and I'm now an adult. I decided to reread this book because of my fond memories of it and to see if I still like it or if nostalgia has clouded my memory. Well...I still liked it! Not to say that this book doesn't have its share of flaws, but it also has many positive points (at least in my opinion).The story this time follows Sarah Vida, a witch and vampire hunter. She tries to please her sister and over-strict mother, but never seems to measure up to their standards. When she moves to a new school, she is befriended by two weak vampires. Obviously, her family disapproves and the whole situation escalates out of control... Clearly there's much more to the story than that, but I don't want to spoil it.Amelia's first book was written about a vampire, and her second book followed the exploits of a human protagonist. This book is about a witch, and I really enjoy the variety that the author is giving us. As with \\"Demon in my View\\", familiar characters appear, whom you would recognize if you have read the previous two books. It's a nice little easter egg for those who've been following the author's work. However, the stories are not direct sequels of each other and can be enjoyed without having read the other books. The only downside is that you might be a little confused about exactly what powers the vampires of her universe have, what the witches powers are, what \\"blood-bonded\\" means, etc. Although these things are explained briefly within this book, they are explained in better detail in some of her other books. Ultimately you can still read this book without having read any of the others and still enjoy it though.Now, while I really enjoyed this book, it has some aspects about it that some would consider flaws. In other words, this book is not for everyone. Firstly, it's short. This book is exactly 227 pages long, so those that want a long, 500-page novel will be disappointed. I really like this aspect of her books though, because I enjoy the fact that I can finish a book quickly and move on to other things. For the young adult genre though, shortness isn't unusual. Another flaw that people might pick up on is that Amelia is not exactly a writer of fine literature. Yes, people, the writing is simple, and yes, she likes to use the word \\"sapphire\\" a lot (some have likened it to bad fan-fiction), and yes, the writing isn't going to win any awards. Personally, I don't care. It's still entertaining and I'm more than happy with it. I've also found that her novels are the kind you can read again after some time has passed--which is great since I can't normally stand to re-read books.Overall, I recommend this book if you happen to fall into the age range of teens or young adults. At that age, the \\"simple\\" writing shouldn't offend. However, if you're an adult that likes vampires, isn't too picky, likes their novels on the short side, and is a bit open-minded, then I would also recommend this for you, too. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I would if I could give it two and a half, but the book as I have noticed from other reviews, yes there are a lot of storylines taken from Buffy and other horror writers, which is what upsets me. I'm kind of offended that she hasn't yet written something, well original, I am hoping she makes an improvement sometimes in the future. Her writing is stronger, it's her creativity is what needs work. The whole Buffy thing just annoys me. It's too unoriginal for my say."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I was expecting a good book from some of the reviews critics were giving her, but critics normally can't review a book if their life counted on it.I found the critics worshipping her age more then her actual writing ability. I read the book for myself and I am ashamed to even think she has influence upon young writers. Her writing quality is around below average to average. Around a C-.Starting with the synopsis... Sarah Vida is on a journey to slay Nicolas, a \\"deadly\\" vampire who marks his victims.Sarah: annoying with her tough girl and \\"independent\\" attitude when in actuality she can't take care of herself. Some here have quoted: \\"Buffy look alike.\\" I agree, she looks very similar to the TV star who portrays the character. Only this one is very weak and stupid when it comes to making decisions.Chris: mainly a poetic wimp that isn't that strong. He is practically a geek boy worshipping over the \\"hot\\" girl and it is pathetic. The poems are stupid and Nissa, his sister describes him like an obsessive maniac.Kris: the more vile side of Chris was a killer, not very original, sounds like someone that Buffy was linked to. There is nothing that interesting about him and nothing catches my attention in this one.Nicolas: another \\"very tough\\" vampire, are there any vampires in her books that actually have brains? He doesn't even die, it's just like Demon in My View, Aubrey is suppose to kill Jessica and he doesn't. Here, too, she doesn't kill the main objective.Nissa: a wimping a good two shoe vampire.The characters--you don't know much about them. Amelia never explains the reasons behind their actions. WHy are her vampires in high school, I was in high school and it was the last place I wanted to be!!! But of course I graduated... but why high school? Are these vampires that behind in knowledge?Amelia has improved in her writing but lacks many qualities. The book isn't as superficial, but the romance reminds me of Demon... it shows how much Amelia does her research... she doesn't do any. If I were her I would ask others who have been in relationships.She also doesn't get too involved with the Witches. I don't know much about them, and the fighting is poorly done. These vampires don't seem strong when she fights them.Overall I only can give her 2 stars."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I thought that Shattered Mirror was just as good as Demon in My View, which seems to be more of the favorite out of the first two. I DON'T regret buying this book. The content of these books are all interesting love stories, and yes, this one was about a vampire and a vampire hunter. So, what? Okay, there was some similarities to Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but there was some differences too. The ending was great, and the twist was much different from Buffy. Anyone saying that she should stop writing about vampires, is just stupid to buy this book. I don't know about the rest of you, but it was pretty clear to me that this little series was ABOUT vamps. I hope that people learn to read the description of the book before buying and I also hope that there are more books by this author. The subject matter is great, why not keep writing about vamps? If you don't like that subject....DON'T READ BOOKS ABOUT IT! And don't critisize them either."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I loved the story line and the characters but the book was pretty superficial, barely skimming over what could've been a richly detailed start to a series.Quite frankly, I am very disappointed that there was no sequel, let alone a series to follow. Hopefully, Ms. Atwater-Rhodes will pick up where she left off and tell us more about Sara, Christopher, Nicholas and Nissa. I am also curious about Adianna and the Vidas, along with Single Earth."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Stories of vampires have always fascinated me. Stories of twins have also always fascinated me. Therefore the story Shattered Mirror was a tale I could sink my teeth into (please pardon the pun). This book follows the quest of witch/vampire hunter, Sarah Vida, for the reviled vampire, Nikolas. What Sarah finds are two \\"weak\\" vampires, a brother and sister, at the high school she has newly started attending. Despite her own reservations, and the constant warnings of her family, Sarah befriends the vampires.Although Shattered Mirror takes place in the same setting as Amelia's other vampire stories, it is a wonderful, stand alone read. It was the first of her vampire stories that I read and my personal favorite. Amelia truly shows that characters are rarely as good, or as evil, as they may appear on the surface. There are many shades of gray in between and they are explored in depth during this story.I would highly recommend Shattered Mirror to anyone interested in the vampire genre or anyone who is simply looking for an enticing distraction from reality."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It really draws you in to the history of the people in the book. The way it vividly shows the emotions, and thoughts of each character really made me want to read more. Sarah is very troubled in her life. She must follow the footsteps of her mother and sister, though she is quite rebellious. It is not so much a story of teen angst as it would seem, but is a story of a girl striving to find her own place in the world, as is most people's goal in life. Her sister, though she has her Sarah's best interest in mind, is constantly pushing her to be a carbon copy of the rest of their family. The book also stresses the need of self-control. Sarah loses control as a young child when she stumbles upon her father's dead body. She is then punished by having her abilities bound, and being put through rigorous training. Kristopher, the vampire that Sarah befriended, loses control and bonds her to himself. He did not examine the reprucussions of his action, in turn almost killing Sarah. He then must save her by transforming her into the very creature that defines her reason in life. She embraces the freedom of being a vampire easily, but does not wish to stay with Kristopher and his siblings. She leaves them, and goes on to find her self, knowing that she can always come back to the comfort of a family. Another focal point in the book was the contrast of color. The sharp contrast of black and white, which have borders that are quite clear. It gives an insight to the mind of Nikolas, Kristopher's brother. How he sees the world with a simple line between what is bad and good. Sarah thinks, because he surrounds himself with these colors he has no emotions. This turns out to be incorrect when Nikolas shows his overwhelming love for his brother. The tone of the words implies that Nikolas is almost dependent on his brother. That his brother was what made him whole, his foundation. When he is without Kristopher he could be described as a lost soul. Just drifting in the sea of carelessness, and indulgence. Which is not unfamiliar to his kind, but certainly is to his twin, Kristopher. This again gives a yin and yang concept. The kind brother cannot function without the cruel, and vice versa."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"One of the reasons I really like A-Rhodes is that her writing is gripping. Yes, most of her characters are the same (dark and mysterous) but she manages to make things diffrent for each story, I mean, you have to give her credit, she's not age 50 like most other writers. If you like vamp. stories, you'll love this."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"In this book \\"Shattered Mirror\\" the story is in great detail, but at the same time it was easy to follow and understand. In every twist, your adrenaline is rushing with such intensity that you never want to put the book down. I was so into this book that i read it in one night. It was so extreme that i had shivers up my spine as i read it. i give this book a 4-star rating for the great details and the interesting plot."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Shattered Mirror was an awesome book!! It really keeps you interested in it and it lets you use your own creativity. I thought the storyline of this book was interesting!! I really liked learning about the different veiws peopel have on things. Forexample when the vampires thought different from the witches and then the humans were kind of clueless as to what is going on. It was also interesting when in one part of the book there was a group that had all humans, vampires, and withces united together as one! The book really makes you think and it tought me that not all people have the same veiws on life and how it should work! It is a great drama also... I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to Meilinda when she was out hunting for vampires and then I also was paying attention to the thing going on between her and Christopher!! Overall I would give this book 4 stars and would reccomend it to anyone interested in vampires and fantasy!! It's a great book to read and get into!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I have to admit, I blew through this book in about an hour. It was not that it was insubstantial (the book is 225 pages long), it was because it was a generally good read. I couldn't put it down.The book is about Sarah Vida, a member of the Vida line of witches. The Vidas are elite vampire killers and devote their entire lives to that goal. Sarah was raised with the rules of the Vidas and was taught to see the world in black and white. That is until she meets Christopher...Christopher is a vampire, but he is weak and does not feed on human blood. Although she has been trained to hate vampires, Sarah soon finds herself charmed by the artistic and polite Christopher. Through her relationship with Christopher, Sarah begins to see that having vampire blood does not make a person evil. She learns that the world is not black and white and that there are shades of gray.While the book is not incredibly profound, it is still very entertaining. That in itself is a good thing."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This was the very first book i read from Ameila and let me say it had my attention from the start...when i was a teenager at least! First off if anyone wants a good read for adults..look in the adult section for that! But for teenagers this is a good book! I loved all the characters in the book and i couldnt put it down but once again it was a short read but a good read!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"As a witch, Sarah Vida has been brought up to abhor vampires and hunt them down. She's the daughter of the most famous (or infamous, depending on the company you keep) vampire hunter of the times. So when she starts tentatively making friends with two weak sibling vampires at her new school, her sister is horrified. She tries to impress upon Sarah that such friendship will only lead to death, or worse. Yet Sarah can't seem to tear herself away from the only ones who have ever perceived her as anything other than a killer, when in fact they are the ones that should fear her.Shattered Mirror is the opposite of so many vampire themed books that are being released in the past years in the sense that it initially shows vampires in a less favorable light. This factor, coupled with the fantasy-like intrigue of the laws and customs of the Vida witch clan is the only interesting and innovative element of the whole novel. The protagonist, Sarah, appears to be a flat character without much profundity. Any of the author's attempts at depth, like working in the Vidas' reactions to their father's death, fall flat, and the reader experiences no real connection with any of the characters. Shattered Mirror is chocked full of drama, but very much lacking substance."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Sarah is the daughter of a powerful vampire hunter. And that is why she is upset to find there are two vampires in her new school. Things only get worse when she begins to care for them.When she finds them at a bash and they admit what they are...even though she knew all along, she knows she is going to have to make them leave her alone.When Sarah picks the wrong fight and loses she is intent on killing Nickols. But that is easier said then done. And if Sarah makes another mistake it could change things forever...Personally i thought this was the best vampire/vampire hunter book ever! It had lots of action and the characters I really loved. Even the \\"bad\\" one. There was even some romance and mystery.Great!!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Shattered Mirror is written simply, but well. The plot is fairly shallow; I could have used more detailed explanations of certain points. The witches also lack a certain emotional depth. However, the book is an easy, interesting read, and Atwater-Rhodes is a talented young author."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I read this book again late last year, and this book always satifies my hunger for vampire novels! The story of a witch hunter that becomes entangled with two vampire brothers. All the characters, especially Dominique, are sharp and fresh in every way. I think she should write a seque, from the ending, or write stories of people like Caryn, both vampire brothers, or Dominique. With as much detail as she gives us, it leaves us wanting more about every character. This book has everything a vampire novel could have, my absolute favorite or her novels!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Sarah Vida kills vampires. Her family has done it for centuries. For as long as Sarah can remember vampires were nefarious and evil and needed to be exterminated. Sarah never encountered a problem with her lifestyle until she met Christopher and his sister. They may seem nice enough, and Christopher may be cute, but the fact remains that they are both vampires. Sarah is not permitted to be friends with them. That is not the way of her family. Sarah has a goal throughout the novel. She must kill the vampire Nikolas. Nikolas is considered one of the worst vampires, and has done much damage and has created chaos. But, Sarah is not prepared for what she finds out about her vampire friends and Nikolas. This novel presents many issues that are fundamental to the plot. The greatest is the inner turmoil that Sarah faces. Sarah must figure out for herself whether or not all vampires deserve to die. Sarah is constantly struggling to come up with an answer throughout the novel. Sarah not only fights vampires in this novel, but she fights herself as well. Her inner turmoil adds to the the human side of the novel. One can identify with her struggle to find common ground. This novel is great because it is set at a fast pace, just like her previous novel In the Forests of the Night. The pace of the novel also creates a sense of frenzy. Sarah is running out of time, things are occuring fast, and the reader is being constantly bombarded with new and exciting plot twists. The novel is set up so that the reader experiences the rush of excitement, the feeling of defeat, and above all the thrill of a good book. This novel is set up in such a way that it blurs the line between black and white, good and evil, and leaves the reader with an indiscernible shade of grey."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Love, love, love this book.

This story line is so different that it keeps you locked in. It's different to read a story abiut vampires from a hunter's view."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Shattered Mirror by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a compelling story about typical teenage life mixed in with life-altering changes. The main character Sara Vida, a typical run of the mill teenager, is actually a vampire hunter from the long Vida line. She has accepted this fact and understands the Vida laws, number one being to never be friends with the enemy. Not even ten minutes into her new school and she has been introduced to two vampires; and she actually tolerates them. Things speed up and she is soon friends with Christopher and his sister. Sara listens to their life stories and soon finds out they have a link to Nikolas.Shattered Mirror picks up near this point and Sara is forced to pick between her lives, either to a hunter or run with the vampires. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves some mystery mixed with horror and some romance. I found that once I got started reading I could not put the book down, so it really drew me in as a reader. What I liked most about the book was the constant issues going on-its what kept me interested. There was romance between Sara and Christopher, knowing they would be together because it was meant to happen. There was also the adventure in trying to find Nikolas and whether or not Sara would die trying. There was also the tension between Sara and the weird boy at school, the constant angry looks she got from him. Trying to predict all the outcomes of these issues kept me drawn into this book. This is why I would recommend reading any of the books that Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has wrote because they all are just as intriguing and great."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Along with every other novel written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, I never could put this one down. I have read Shattered Mirror twice and will probably read it again. The book is about a young female vampire hunter, named Sarah. Sarah doesn't have any friends . . . she leads a dark and lonely life. She meets an interesting boy at her school in which she automatically realizes as a vampire. Not only is he a vampire, he is the brother of one of the most notorious vampires alive or should i say . . . . dead. His brother is her target. Will it be so easy for her to execute the brother of her new found friend?I want to thank you for reading my review because, this book was truly an amazing one, and I am sure you will feel the same way once you read Shattered Mirror.

First off, you can read short descriptions of the book above to find out that the main character is a vampire hunter and such.I can think of many ways to explain myself, but the best would probably be to say that while reading this book, particularly scenes that occur at bashes (this book's equivalent to a party with drugs and sex), the reader can have a parallel scene playing out in his/her mind of a REAL party in reality. What I am saying is that everything that happens at these bashes relates perfectly to what happens at certain parties in real life.A second thing is this. As I began chapter 23, I felt like I was reading \\"Speak\\" all over again. For those of you who don't know, the main character in Speak is a girl who got raped at a party between 8th grade and the start of her freshman year at high-school and kept it a secret from everyone. That is EXACTLY what happens to Christine/Kristin (they're the same person - read it to find out why the \\"c\\"'s turn to \\"k\\"'s).Now, if you're a parent of a teenager, I'd run to a bookstore right away. Still don't get why? Your kid loves to keep secrets from you. (I'm a 17 year old boy myself.) Your kid most likely says all books are stupid for some reason or another, ESPECIALLY ones like Speak (see last paragraph). In other words, the exact kind of books s/he SHOULD be reading are the ones s/he rejects THE MOST. However, Shattered Mirror gives off just as many if not more positive messages for teenagers than books like Speak, Second Helpings, Big Mouth & Ugly Girl - the list goes on. The first 2 or so chapters of Shattered Mirror are nearly pure-horror. They occur at a bash with action right away, similar to the Goosebump books of old. Then, the main character starts school - totally turning the mood of the story into something much more pleasant... for a while.By now I think you're starting to get the point. BUT, you might be asking \\"If this book is so good, why doesn't it have a bazillion awards all over the cover and such?\\" Note that this book is 4 years old and new \\"classics\\" don't get written every day. Violence is in this book constantly. The main character purposely wears as many knives as she safely can. But on the other hand, Speak is a great book for teen girls to read... but what if you're about to enter high-school? You'll be scared out of your mind! A 13 year old girl who reads Speak will get so scared of getting raped that she never gets to have any fun in her teenage years. So the 2 pretty much cancel out. And we're back at thinking that Shattered Mirror is an excellent book. Just don't let anyone TOO young read this book, cause all they'll see is the violent part of it and turn into a madman.Other good messages include \\"love always triumphs\\" and \\"not everything's black and white; many are grey.\\" Any reader who enjoys thinking as s/he's reading will put this book in his/her top 10 by page 80 or so. Speaking of which... a few quick facts about the book: 31 chapters, very large text size, 227 pages (in my version). I flew through it in just over a day, but give most of the credit to the amazing suspense Amelia Atwater-Rhodes gives us.Highly recommended.Normally at the end of my reviews, I always say \\"go check out my other reviews and please say if they were helpful to you or not!\\" But, this is the only book I've reviewed (so far). Everything else has been music. This is the 41st book I've read since June of 2004 and its the first one I've felt such a need to come here and praise it on amazon. Think about that. (Other books I've read include Fade by Robert Cormier, Second Helpings by Megan McCafferty, and Into Thin Air by Jon Krafauer - didn't review any of them.)"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Okay let's get the facts out of the way first. Amelia Atwater-Rhodes wrote her first novel, IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT, when she was 13. DEMON IN MY VIEW was written two years later. SHATTERED MIRROR is the latest novel from the teen Anne Rice. Note: I will not let the fact that she is a highly successful novelist and I am just a shlumpy old loser affect my review in the least.In SHATTERED MIRROR, Atwater-Rhodes does Buffy one better. The protagonist of the story is Sarah Tigress Vida, is a vampire hunter AND a witch. Double occult whammy! Her whole family are vampire hunters --- have been forever. Sarah is a totally hard-core, tough girl. A loner, she prefers the company of the night stars to actual humans. Sarah is proud to be a Vida witch and loves all the honor that name conveys. She would never consort with the enemy...or would she?Trouble starts brewing when Sarah meets two charming vampires posing as high school students. Christopher is a &quot;harmless&quot; vampire, living off animal blood or willing human donors. He is artistic, kind and, of course, really cute and Sarah reluctantly begins to find herself crushing on him bad. Christopher returns the feelings by writing her love poetry and giving her sketches he has made.As we all know, love can be quite confusing. Sarah is thrown completely off, not just by her raging hormones, but also by the fact that the boy she cares for should, technically, be on her &quot;Dead&quot; list. Sarah finds herself questioning her entire life and all the traditions of her family. She can't get her mind around hunting vampires anymore, as her family has sworn to do. Can a vampire hunter and her undead prey learn to love each other?SHATTERED MIRROR takes a crazy twist just as readers will be hoping for Sarah and Christopher to get together. Turns out Christopher is actually Kristopher, twin brother of one of the most hated and hunted vampires of history, Nikolas. The fiend Nikolas is famous for carving his name into his victims and Sarah wants to be the Vida to take Nikolas down. Will her new feelings for Christopher cause her to change her mind? And will they lead her to a dangerous decision, a decision that would tarnish her family's reputation --- and cost Sarah her mortal soul?All these questions and more will be answered, promise. Fans of Atwater Rhodes will be pleased to see the return of characters like Caryn Smoke. Fans and non-fans alike will be totally engrossed in this story about the battle between love, evil and tradition.

Now 17, Amelia has shown a steadygrowth in her skills, her characterizations, and the believablemixture of horror and teen angst that makes BUFFY such asuccess.

The only problem with her novels isthey END! This one is longer than IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT and DEMON IN MY VIEW, and hopefully next year's outing (MIDNIGHTPREDATOR) will be even longer!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Let's start on a positive note. This is the best of Atwater-Rhodes's first four books. Unfortunately, that really isn't saying too much.Sarah Tigress Vida (TIGRESS?!) is a vampire hunter and the youngest in a long line of powerful witches. A constant disappointment to her mother and older sister, Sarah wants desperately to please them. However, that would involve having to lock away any and all emotion she possesses, something Sarah can't seem to do. Actually, the only emotion Sarah displays for nearly the entire book is a kind of pouty-punk 'look at how much of a brave and misunderstood tough girl I am' attitude. Oy. Then she meets the new vampires at school. Despite her initial feelings of 'get away from me', Sarah grows to like them. These vampires are gentle, peaceful, so weak most witches wouldn't identify them as vampires. They don't kill to feed. The boy Christopher soon starts sending her roses and poetry.Note: I still don't buy the whole vampires going to high school thing. Yeah, they say they have to remember humanity, but there are other ways. Trust me, it just takes a calculus class at eight in the morning to reveal the darker side of human nature.Then Sarah's sister finds out about the vamps, it's suddenly revealed that Christopher's twin brother is Nikolas, the most feared vampire in history (I have no idea how he got that title, since he only shows kindness to his followers), and there's a ridiculous and useless subplot about a kid whose sister is under Nikolas's spell, except she was really hypnotized by another vamp.The book ends in typical Atwater-Rhodes fashion. I can't tell you exactly what happens, but it seems vampires are the favorite creatures in Atwater- Rhodes's world, and that's what makes this so ludicrous. The author provides us with heavy- handed metaphors about the lack of black or white, good or evil in the world, but from what I've seen she loves her vampires and apparently dislikes her witches. Dominique, Sarah's mother, is a one-note, robot like character who comes in a couple of times to basically tell Sarah she hates her, and all the vampires, except for the 'real' villain (a cackling stereotype) are really sweet. If nothing is black or white, that 'profound' idea should apply to every character in a book, as opposed to a handful of main characters.My other gripes: all vampires are teenagers. Why? The dialogue ranges from wooden to puzzling to being outright absurd. (I remember some bit when Nikolas offers Christopher blood; he criticizes Christopher's desire for blood and his refusal thus: ' Would a starving man refuse a chicken dinner, simply because he was vegetarian?' We know when dialogue sounds right. This bombs.) The story is neither forward nor enthralling. And everyone looks like a freaking supermodel.This IS Atwater-Rhodes's best of the first four books, since she creates a fairly credible love story built upon something more than looks and hormones. However, that doesn't keep it from being a ridiculous and tedious book."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"For seventeen-year-old Sarah, the world has always been a black and white place, where a distinct line exists between good and evil. The humans are good. The vampires are evil. And in between exists the witches, who use their powers to protect humanity by killing vampires. As the youngest daughter of the Vida line, Sarah has been trained nearly all her life as a vampire hunter. On her first day at a new school, Sarah recognizes a brother and sister, Christopher and Nissa, as vampires, but the pair, who no longer kill to feed, are too weak to sense who she is. At first, she views the pair as dangerous, but she comes to realize that they have managed to keep some part of their humanity. But in the process of hunting down Nikolas, an evil vampire the Vidas have sworn to destroy since the day he killed one of their own over a hundred years ago, she discovers just how dark Christopher's past is. Fans of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes previous two books are sure to enjoy this one as well."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I have recently reread all of the Amelia Atwater-Rhodes books in preparation for the third installment in the Keisha'ra series (beginning with Hawksong, then Snakecharm, and then the not-yet-released Falcondance). I was really dreading, to tell you the truth, reading Shattered Mirror all over again, and thought it to be the young authors worst offering yet. I remember being disgusted since it basically had the exact same ending as Demon in My View. But now I understand that their are really only two kinds of endings for the novellas Miss Rhodes writes.1) Our protagonist-always a mysterious beauty- ends up giving into her feelings for the vampiric love interest, or has to because of impending death, and, so, becomes one of the undead. Or2) Doesn't become a vamp. Simple as that.The writting in 'Mirror' is the best out of the authors previous two, although not perfect by far. She writes unrealistic fight-scene dialoge and that can really gets on my nerves. We know she has an advanced vocabulary, so it really makes me wonder why she has to use prose-worthy speeches and dry wit within such chapters that deal with fights. It's so annoying!Okay, only one more. AAR never fails to get under my skin, when describing her characters. They're always mysterious, dark, and beautiful in a goth, black-out sort of way. Aren't there any fat and ugly or just plain average-looking vampires? Or even humans for that matter?But all in all, the book was good. The characters were intersting, especially the Ravaena siblings, and I hope AAR writes more about them in the future.R, your friendly neighborhood reviewer."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Shattered Mirror is the sequel to two other books by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, In the Forests of the Night and Demon In My View, her first and second published books respectively. This surpases both in length and plot, in my opinion.While I found Demon in My View more satisfying at the end, Shattered Mirror had many layers that made it superior. For one thing, technique. The story is much more straightforward and in some places more easily understood. This is not to say there were not a few flaws, but every good book must have flaws to make it endearing.Interesting to note: The first segment of Shattered Mirror brought back feelings of many Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes and fanfiction pieces. It was not a plaguirism, but a borrowing of atmosphere. And the fact that the main character was kicked out of school for damaging school property while slaying, I mean HUNTING, vampires doesn't hurt, either.One problem with the writing of Amelia is shared with many, including her influence, Anne Rice. The weakness of the third act. Now, while Anne Rice's sometimes can seem lengthy and dysfunctional at moments, Amelia's have each been extremely brief, and leaving questions to be answered. Even through the two sequels, none so far, except in this book the witch Caryn plays a part explaining her circumstances, have answered any. I still wonder for Risika(from ITFotN) what exactly went on with her brother. You would think they would explain in the most closely related book, Demon in My View, what went on. Nothing offered, nothing received. And Jessica and Aubrey? Not even a mention this outing.Now, none of these are specific critisisms of Shattered Mirror as much as the series as a whole. Only one critisism really holds true to this book, though it is not a fatal flaw. The ending does not satisfy. The \\"surprise,\\" while it caught me off guard, it probably will not startle many. And I don't find myself any happier for the character. Her views may have changed, but she become no more or less likable. Unfortunate, really, for such a promising outing, to have to mention that. But again, definitely not a horrible problem. This book is definitely worth taking a look at, maybe several, even if you're buying it just for the fact that Amelia is a teen author.A final note: I'm glad not to have to say negative anything about length. While maybe a page or two could have been added near the ending, this book was a fine length, fully exploring the main points of the story, and not leaving you feeling cheated for length as the previous two may have. I hope with each book the pages become more plentiful, but only if the story calls for it. That will, of course, be for Amelia to decide."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book is the best Amelia Atwater-Rhodes book ever! And maybe even on the top 5 list of my all time favorite books!Sarah Vida is a young witch of the Vida line, the strongest and cruelest of all daughters of Macht. All of the Vida line are sworn never to befriend vampires, and to track down vampires to kill them. But however she tries to be like her self-controled mother, or her sister, she never can be a true cold blooded killer.When she moves into a new neighborhood, she meets two vmapires and her school- Christopher and Nissa Ravena. They are highly artistic, kind, and weak; the kind that would never be a danger to her. When her sister, Adianna, finds out, her problems get worse. And to all that, she must tell Christopher that he must desert her, even though they love each other.But the worst is yet to come. Hunting Nikolas, a infamous vampire, murderer of Elisabeth Vida, and totally deadly; she finds out the terrible secret. Nikolas is Christopher's brother. Happenings with a tormented teenage girl, a Halloween dance, and a couple of bashes in between, leads to a choice that might change the course of the Vida line forever.I loved this book so much because mainly two characters: Nikolas and Christopher. Nikolas is sort of like Jaguar, deadly and icy-cold, yet loyal and caring. I was also fasinated by his apperence-black and white. His tenderness to his brother and Christine, and his deadly coolness towards Sarah and witches.Christopher is a totally different person altogether. People at first sight think he's weaker than Nikolas, but his iron self-control and devotion towards Sarah make him a great character."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"That is what I am doing- mourning for all the trees cut down to create the paper to hold this piece of tripe work. This plot went no where. The characters are weak yet they are played up, or told to others, that they are some of the strongest in their lines. Once more, like Forests and Demon, Amelia gives us cahracters for one paragraph (or sentence!) names them, and then never speaks of them again. Great if she's going to talk about them in later books, but by then I think I might have gone and destroyed her computer so that she doesn't send any more manuscripts to her editors at Random House and cut down another rainforest!Sarah Vida is annoying- she has a cool car, an evil mother, and she hates vampires. Oh but wait... nope, she loves Christopher, the vampire. The artiste.Gag me.This is just awful. Spare yourself the time and wasted money and energy and just put the book down! The ending is precisely the same as the predecessor, Demon in My View. I'm completely tired of seeing &quot;perfect&quot; people turned into vampires by vamps who were once their enemy.I wish that more talented young authors would get the recognition they deserve. I have read two great works by two young authors (one another vampire writer hopeful) who are struggling to make it when Amelia is sitting here writing stuff that makes me feel less intelligent for having read it in the first place.I fear Midnight Predator, Amelia's fourth outing due in May. I hear it has something to do with the Bruja Guild of vampire hunters going into a place called Midnight to kill a woman vampire named Jeshickah and her right-hand vamp, Jaguar (too close to Jager if you ask me. Get some more original names, please!). But the main characters, one Turquoise Draka and Ravyn Aniketos, are enemies working together, selling themselves in as human slaves, which these vampires seem to use. My question- where are the police with all of this stuff? Are we even on earth anymore? She should just make her own planet or make it more believable. That's what most people want out of a vampire story- the horrorific fear that it COULD be true.Though, the way most of her characters whine and throw tantrums, hers being real might be far more frightening."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book unfolds around Sarah, youngest daughter of the Vida Line. In this story, vampires are bad, humans are good..and witches are in between. The witches job is to slay vampires to protect the human race. Sarah, has been trained nearly all her life to slay vampires.Tthe first day of school she senses two people as vampires. Nissa and Christopher, who are too weak to sense Sarah's powers. She first takes the impression that they are dangerous but soon she realizes then are not. As this book continues you'll realize many things. Although this book seems confusing from time to time, the plot is awesome and will have you guessing. I think if you enjoyed other books by this author, like I did...you'll find Shattered Mirror just as great!I highly recomend this for the Atwater fans, and I know there are plenty. Other books that are awesome, written by Amelia Atwater Rhodes are : In the Forests of the Night, Night Predator, and Demon in my View. I can't wait for this author to write and publish more!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I like the fact that she admires Anne Rice but the thing is her books are too much like Anne Rice's material and other auhors work. She needs more depth in her work and originality. Too much originality can be bad but her ideas have already been used and all she does is put it in different words. You can't relate to any of her characters.There are penty of horror writers with the talent who should be published rather then Amelia. have read unpublished work by many and yet they are very talented but haven't had any luck with publishing. She's just a weapon for Random Houe of &quot;good publicity&quot; and they buy her work because o her age. Just because she is a teen that doesn't make her a good writer.A good writer speaks fom their soul not from other writers point of views. She may be big right now, but wht happens when someone her age gets published? She will be yesterdays news and no longer prased for her &quot;age&quot; when she should be praised for talent. Talent matters and she just doesn't have it, or I haven't seen it yet from her. The only talent she shows is that she can rewrite something by another author making it sound worse.As far as the length of her book I would expect her to write atleast two o three novels a &quot;year&quot; anyone could write that much within one or two months and maybe less. No if she was like anne rice writing a six or seven hundred page with 90,000-130,000 words then I could see why she wries on book a year.I'll just be satisfied the day a writer like Ameia comes out only with more talent and show what it mean to really get in touch with their readers. Amelia needs a lot more voice. Writing isn't something you can just pass on, writing a novel is a challenge for everyone including novelist.I read in one interview of Amelia that she doesn't structure or outline her story, well, it would help a lot Amelia. You could do better if you actually thought the plotline out. Plotting outa story on a piece of paper helps a LOT.I pity you if you are praising her for her age rather then talent. I envy her for the fact there are more writers who deserve her spot with more talent then she carries. I will pray her next book has more taste and voice or I think I may just kill myself."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Despite the fact that I was dissatisfied by \\"Forests of the Night,\\" and heartily disliked \\"Demon in my View,\\" I picked up \\"Shattered Mirror\\" and braced myself. I must have a streak of masochism -- or I just have an optimistic hope that Atwater-Rhodes improve. She definitely can, but her books have been getting worse as they've increased in size.Sarah Tigress Vida (\\"Tigress\\"?) is a vampire slay... I mean, a vampire HUNTER, who generally stalks around vampire lairs with silver knives (I thought silver was supposed to affect werewolves, not vampires?) and kills vampires when she can. Her mother is Dominique Vida, a character mentioned in \\"Demon\\"; her father was killed when she was seven, an event that traumatized her, and her sister Adrianna thinks she's treading into dangerous turf. Sarah has every intention of capturing a particularly vicious vampire named Nikolas, who gets his kicks (and his followers) by carving his name into their arms.Sarah befriends Christopher and Nissa, a pair of young vampires who apparently don't attack humans. Christopher is sweet, writes poetry, and is completely smitten with Sarah (whoa, what a surprise. Anyone else see this coming? Why is it that people of the opposite sexes in this imaginary world either despise each other or fall in love?)Unfortunately, her fellow witches (Adrianna in particular) have a problem with this -- their law forbids it, and Dominique is an ice-cold walking punishment. But as Sarah hunts down Nikolas, she treads a dangerous line between the vampire world, where her love interest still is bound, and the world of the witches where she may become an outcast as she tries to hunt down a ruthless vampire killer.Mary-Sueism strikes again; after dealing with the amoral and unsympathetic Jessica in \\"Demon,\\" we must deal with gorgeous blond toughie Sarah, who is slightly more sympathetic than Jessica and who thankfully is not a teen vampire author. But the only vulnerability we see in her is never exploited, and we see few insecurities, leaving her a Buffy-clone with little personality. Christopher could have been the most intriguing character of all, but Atwater-Rhodes spends so little time on him that it's hard to see what motivates him except guilt. Oh, and his poetry isn't so good. (He rhymes \\"light\\" with \\"night.\\" I rhyme it with \\"trite\\") Nissa is slightly more explanatory, given her anecdotes to Sarah, but sadly we don't see much after that meeting. Adrianna is a typical tattler, and Dominique is a two-dimensional ... well, amazon won't let me use the word. It rhymes with \\"itch,\\" though.The only truly three-dimensional character is Nikolas, oddly enough. Though initially portrayed as a psychopath, he is a killer but not a monster. These moral question marks are just screaming to be explored in more depth, but she leaves them dangling. The last quarter of the book happens too fast, as does the so-so relationship between Sarah and Christopher (whom she distrusted and then beat up during the course of the book).And one of the twists leaves the reader unsatisfied--didn't we see this event in \\"Demon\\"? Has she taken to ripping herself off?Perhaps Atwater-Rhodes' biggest problem is pandering to the basic teen market. Her first book was somewhat unique in that it featured a lead character who stays in the shadows, and no romance. After that, however, she has lapsed into tepid teen romances and lead characters in high-school. (Why the heck would vampires attend a high school?)Another note: All of her lead human/witch characters are teens, the vampires were all changed as teenagers. All of them are gorgeous, or at least charismatic (this charisma often didn't reach the reader) and most of them do act like spoiled teens. And how many 17-year-olds have sapphire Jaguars? Other problems include the fact that Miss Atwater-Rhodes is starting to inject her religion into this: Wicca. This detracts from the mystery of the non-human witches, by grounding them in a very human religion.Miss Atwater-Rhodes has talent, and she has imagination. Her first book displays this.I'll keep hoping that Atwater-Rhodes improves her stories, and creates a lead character like Risika who is not a pale copy of her or Buffy, and a universe populated by intriguing and original species who are carefully shown in the detail they deserve."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book was sort of different than Atwater-Rhodes first two books, but equally as satisying. Sarah Vida, daughter of the leader of one of the most dangerous witch families, is an avid vampire hunter. She is currently following a vampire party circuit, and she gets launched into it in a way that violate all of the witch laws and the twists and turns of this novel surprised me thoroughly. In this book Atwater-Rhodes veers off her course of describing the lives of the more powerful of the vampires, instead describing the lives of the more viscious vampires, but less powerful. the ending was mildly disappointing, but the rest of the book more than made up for it. I was sort of hoping that Ms. Atwater-Rhodes would write about one of the older vampires, such as Fala, Jager, Ather, or even Silver himself. But if you want an action-packed novel with suspense and excitement, then this should be your pick!!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"A girl named Jessica starts to write books about vampires. Jessica does not know the books are true. She had just come up with these ideas. A vampire goes after Jessica to kill her so she will not write any more books. The vampire Aubrey falls in love with Jessica and cannot bear to kill her. Therefore, the other vampire goes after her but, not because of the books but because of hatred. Jessica does not know that there is a vampire after her. You will have to read the book to find out what else happens and what happens to Jessica, and whether or not she gets killed.What I disliked about the book was that it had stopped in the middle of the book and then did not have a sequel to it.What I liked about this book was that it had details in it about all the characters.I recommend this book to people that like to read books about vampires and people that like to read a book that has romance in it."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"this book was pretty good. it was a typical written in first person, romantic, lesson in the back book. the plot was interesting, though. it starts off with the vampire hunter Sarah Vida her family has been hunting vamps ever since the infamous nikolas killed elisabeth vida about 100 years ago. sarah has been transfered to a new school since she had been kicked out of her old one for fighting (does any of this sound kinda familiar?) well she meets the weak vampire christofer ravena who, unbeknownst to her is the brother of the infamous nikolaus well as in most vampire novels and movies sarah falls in love with christofer and vice versa. This book is a big fat buffy spin off but still an enjoyable read. i reccomend this to teens who like romantic vampire novels that don't get very graphic or gritty."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is the best of her novels by far. In my time reading her books I have noticed a great deal more maturity of writing style in this novel. She has upped the anty on the language and the plot. My only problem is now sharply the book comes to a sudden halt. In all three of her novels I have found it hard to cope with the endings..they're so abrupt. But, over all...this is her best work and seeing the progression that she is making she has the potential to be around for a long time. I highly recommend her books..."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"But I think that's only because I wrote a fanfic about it. So I guess I'm liking the book just because what I wrote tied the story up nicely for myself to tolerate.A lot of the elements in this book were taken from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, one of my favourite shows, so that's probably another reason why I liked it. Regardless of that, however, I can say this was probably one of her best unintentional works. Why unintentional? Because I can't conceive of Amelia actually working up a sweat on making a story believable and likable to anyone but herself.Sarah Tigress Vida, a vampire hunter witch raised in the black and white society of her people, finds her world beginning to blur over when she finds herself the centre of a vampire's (Christopher) affections. And for whatever reason she meets this vampire at school. Because all 1000+ year old vampires are just dying to see what modern day educational facilities are like, lemme tell you. That part alone is cringe-worthy, but it can be overlooked if you want it to be. So throughout the majority of the book not only is Sarah burdened with not living up the standards of her older sister and mother but she has that nagging vampire Christopher to deal with, who is just too darn sweet despite what she was told about vampires and who she can't seem to get rid of.I just hate what she does with names in this book. The switch from Christopher and Nicholas to Kristopher and Nikolas is so friggin' ridiculous I almost vomitted. Is the K supposed to symbolise something evil or creepy, Amelia? Because I think it's just lame. Another thing is that she needs to learn that not everyone is beautiful, eyes don't come in the colours she makes them out to be, and every story must have an ending. Even a crappy story. But she doesn't like endings, she just gives up wherever she wants and that's what happens to this story. But even in the linear conclusion one goes away with a feeling of relief. I have no idea how the ending was suitable, maybe she managed to get a stroke of luck when making this book.I don't know how she managed to pull it off, but by George, Amelia did it. So that's the only reason I'm giving her credit for this book. Two stars for stumbling over something that was worth my ten bucks plus one star for the fanfic I wrote about it. Seriously, other people should consider doing the same thing with her stories if they don't like them so much. It's surprising how satisified you'll feel afterwards."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"this book and all of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' books are extremly compelling and and filled with poetry that makes you think.

The strongest line of witches. Daughter to the strongest most ruthless witch Domanique Vida. Sister to the witch who never loses Adianna Vida. Trained by the best. Taught to never feel pain, fear or love. To except death. And above all to hate and kill vampires. Black and White good and Evil. For 17 years she's been able to live by these rules losing control only once... when she was 7 when she found her father dead. Sarah's goal in live is to kill vampires but one vampire especially. His name is Nikolas. Known for carving his name in his prey. But when Sarah meets the 2 new vampires at school the trouble starts. The vampires are both very weak. Too weak to sense thats she's more than a human. But when the boy, Christopher falls in love with her. The side of herself thats she buried, the lonely in need of love side bursts out. But she knows she can't fall in love with him her mother would kill him if she found out. So on the night of the halloween dance she tells him that she is a witch. A Vida. A vampire hunter.

Sadly, one's a vampire the other a witch killing vampire.(I guess you can see where the problem starts)Plus the vampire hunter would like nothing better to do that kill her lover's brother.Here's the catch: You might look at this book and say...\\"dammmit! Love story...between vampires?? Sounds rather....well different.\\" That's exactly what Atwater-Rhodes is all about. Being different. Her sense of style, her writng, her appeal to teenagers weighed by a darkness that will draw adults. Her style may be juvenile for the adult reader, but not her writing. She's got pure talent that will mature with the writer herself. she can spin you and open a window to your mind. You will be thrown back and forth. Plus you need to get a sense of literature. Atwater-Rhodes has a begining page with a poem by the famous W. B. Yeats called \\"The Two Trees\\". Great poem that ties with a great novel. The novelist has something that not every author can grasp...and that is having depth. To actually bring the writer's mind into a place that fastpaced, phenomonally unatural, and have earthly morals and feelings as normal human beings have in her own fictious characters is overwhelming. Thought there is a love conflict it's not sappy but stimulating. And no.... nothing about sex....Thank God."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Yes, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a talented writer, but somehow I think her writing lacks personality. Also, as another reviewer said, she lacks originality. I'd recommend this to younger readers looking for a taste of the occult. If you're looking for romance, you're not going to find it here. Although SHATTERED MIRROR *does* have more romance than Atwater-Rhodes's two previous novels, it's nothing spectacular. For example, she needs more description in kissing and falling in love and such. But then again she's just a kid, so she hasn't learned everything there is to know about writing yet. It's worth the read at any rate, even if you only read it once."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"The book &quot;Shattered Mirror&quot; is really great. If you're interested in vampires, witches, demons, ect., you should defiantly read this book."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Sarah Vida may look normal but she's not. Though she plays the part of a normal 17-year-old by day at night she's a witch, and not just any witch, a Vida witch, a powerful vampire hunter. When she enters a new school she immeaditally catches the attention of two vampires, both who are far too weak to realize who she even is. But as she grows to know them better (especially the good looking Christopher) she realizes that everything in the world is not as black and white as she once saw it. She realizes that some vampires can be possibly... good? But her opnions all change when she learns that Christopher's twin brother is Nickolas, a fabled vampire that the Vida line has been hunting for ages, and who Sarah has been dying to get her hands on. But where do her loyalties lie, with Christopher or with the rules and regulations that the Vida line has bestowed on her?I found this book to be very entertaining. Sarah is a great charecter and so are all the other new charecters in the book. It's nice to see some returning charecters (especially Caryn Smoke) too. Though the ending is weak, it's worth buying it for the first 2/3rds of the book. I reccomend it to any Atwater-Rhodes fans. Oh and while reading this book I found myself certain that Amelia was once a Night World fan. I found yet again another compairison. The SingleEarth group sounds so much like Circle Daybreak. But other than that the book is great. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book was I think, a little bit of a let down. I wanted to see some of the old charactors we all cared about. (Risika, Aubrey, Jessica, Fala, Ather, Jagar) The only familiar charactors were Dominique and Caryn. You heard about Nikolas being so strong and everything, but if he was, why didn't we hear about him in previous books??? I didn't like the newer charactors as much as the old ones. One good thing about the book was its length. It was longer then the previous ones. It was also written better too. Overall this book is a good one, except I prefered Demon in My View and In the forests of the night."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"That is how the end of this book left me. All of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's books affect you in different ways. The stories are the same, but different. I have enjoyed them all, and my respect and admiration for this girl grows with each of her books. I like each one better than the one before it."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a fairly good author, but she just couldn't pull this book off. Why? I'll explain:Sarah Tigress Vida is the youngest Daughter of Vida. Unfortunately, she can't be a vampire killing machine like her older sister and her mother--who just happens to be the famous (or, in the vampire world, imfamous) Domonique Vida. The problem with Sarah is that she thinks too much, and with the thinking comes doubts and hesitation: two things a vampire hunter just can't afford.Her hesitation is tripled when she meets two benign vampires at her new school, Christopher and Nissa. She's always thought of vampires as blood-sucking leeches, but both of them soon become her friends, and Christopher becomes something more.Trouble soon ensues, though, as she discovers that Christopher is not what he appears to be. Events test Sarah's loyalty and devotion--and force her to see that in life there are indeed shades of grey.Sounds fine, right? Well, it would be, except that the plot is poorly handled. The three stars are for Atwater-Rhodes' good story telling, not her plot handling. She just isn't ready for the moral issues she poses in the novel (I am using the term novel loosely--although this book is longer than her two previous ones, it still isn't much). Often the plot seems to be barely holding together, and there are several inconsistancies and things that are hinted at and then forgotten. Sarah is a poorly drawn character, little better than Christopher. Nikolas was the worst: she made a mess of portraying Christopher and Nikolas' relationship. Atwater-Rhodes may understand what she'd trying to get out, but she can't quite say it yet in a book.I also found the plot pretty far-fetched. Sarah's middle name was ridiculous--Atwater-Rhodes should have spent more time thinking up names. Christopher's alter ego seemed fake, and I have my suspicions about where she got that little plot twist. I don't watch much of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but even I know about Angel and Buffy. The end was ill-drawn and bordering on absurd. The only thing I thought was really good in this book was the poem the title came from.All in all it was a good attempt; Atwater-Rhodes just wasn't ready. Perhaps another ten years down the road she'll come up with a book that gracefully states the moral in this book; until then, borrow this from the library and read it on a rainy day in the car."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"So far this is the novel i can tell she had taken some time to write. It was great until the conclusion where she used the same ending as Demon only in different words.Her writing had progressed extremely well in this novel and I praise her for it. She took her time until the ending where she rushed.Though I found Sarah to be annoying with her overly confident persona. And it resembles Buffy the Vampire Slayer too much.Those looking for an average written book, this is a recommended pick."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"The main thing that annoyed me about Atwater-Rhodes' latest book is that she resolved it, once again, with the main character's transformation into a vampire. She could have perhaps come up with a better solution, although maybe her whole point is to show that vampirism is inevitable. I think that with a little pre-plotting (not too much, as she of course doesn't want to know what happens before her book is finished) she could stop writing herself into these little messes where the only solution is transformation. I mean, it's getting a little old. Also, her characters were a bit too one-dimensional, and I didn't feel sympathetic towards any one of them, except perhaps Nissa, who seemed to be a little helpless for a vampire.However, I did like the book in other respects, excepting that she seemed to use none of the beautiful language that she did in her first book. Other than that, it was a decent story, with characters you don't like but are interesting anyway, and a somewhat predictable plot that nevertheless held my attention for most of the book. The beginning was a bit slow, however."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I've kept up with Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' releases, and honestly I didn't expect this one to be much better. But I found Shattered Mirror a bit of a surprise in which I cringed through the beginning, then hung on to the rest of the way. This book is enthralling with its delecately interwoven plot and a few new and rather intriguing characters. In truth, the romance is sparse throughout the story and pops up inconsistently. The quick action and unravelling storyline keep you tied until the end.Unfortunately, the writing itself reads like a pair of fish-net stockings. I hate to sound like a middle school reading teacher when I say this but Miss Atwater-Rhodes does a little too much &quot;telling&quot; and not enough &quot;showing.&quot; She seems to take her readers' level of understanding for granted and is a bit too in love with her characters. The introductions and descriptions are quick and unimpressive, inhibiting the reader from really getting attached. And as she attempts to reveal sensitive sides of her villainous characters, such as Nikolas, she only ends butchering any depth the character had at all.But there's definitely enough improvement to praise."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"ok a vampire slayer falls in love with a young vampire, hmmmmmm? where have we heard this before? anybody heard of buffy the vampire slayer, yeah thats where i heard about this , you see buffy was a vampire slayer and she fell in love with the young vampire, Anegl but then he turned evil and she sent him to hell, well this wasnt exactly like that but the buffy angel thing is right on, this author has a grudge against buffy, she should get her own material"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Shattered Mirror was the first book I read of the Atwater Collection... I was kind of confused at the begining, but the book turned out really good! I found this book at the closest library, I was bored, so I got it... I am glad that I did... The book was kind of creepy at some points, but that is what made it good... I finished the book in 2 to 3 days and can't wait to read another! The thrills and chills of this book was part of what made it great... I never thought the ending would end that way... I thought something really different would happen at the end... I recomend this book to everyone who loves adventure, reading about the mystical creatures in the world!

This book is the best one that I've read so far.It's about a vampire-hunting witch named Sarah who's clan is after the vampire who killed a relative named Nikolas. Sarah seems to be a Vida who is all about stretching the laws as far as they can be stretched. She has a tendency to do dangerous hunts alone. She meets Nissa and Christopher at school and instantly senses that they are vampires, though they're not strong enough to sense who she really is. There are a lot of plot twists in the book and it ends really well, leaving you guessing on a few key points. (Maybe a sequel coming up?) I definitely recommend this book as well as the others by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"shattered mirror is the 3rd in a semi-series of books by Amelia Atwater that are all slightly intertwined with each other.

If you are into romance and breaking the rules"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is my second review- my first was the one by \\"Jade\\".SHATTERED MIRROR is a book by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes: a richly-written, atasfying novel. The plot is complex and has twists and suprises, but is simple enough to understand thourghly. Sarah Vida is from the line of the most powerful of all daughters of Macht, the mother of all Witchs. Every Vida's goal is the kill Nikolas, who killed one of Sarah's ancestors. When she goes to a new school, she meets Christopher and Nissa Ravena- vampires both, but weak and no threat to her. But against her will, she breaks one of the most sacred laws of the Vida- she befriends vampires, who are Christopher and Nissa She's also in love with Christopher- who she finds out to be Nikolas's twin brother. She knows she can keep her secret for only a matter of time. Sarah Vida used to live in a world where the line between good and evil was clear. Now that world has disappered.SHATTERED MIRROR is Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's third book. The ones which were puublished before are IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT and DEMON IN MY VIEW. The one that was published after is MIDNIGHT PREDATOR. Of all these books, I'll have to say that SHATTERED MIRROR is the best. IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT and DEMON IN MY VIEW are almost Prequel/Sequel. SHATTERED MIRROR is totally different, except for two already-known characters- Dominique Vida and Caryn Smoke.What I liked best about this book were the characters. Three that I liked the best were Nikolas, Christopher, and Dominique Vida. Nikolas is somewhat like Jaguar from MIDNIGHT PREDATOR. He's known to be deadly and evil, but he has another side he doesn't show except towards Christopher and Christine. But I liked him because of his looks and his demenor- which, like me, will find interesting in the book. Dominique is a cold, steel tempered person. Infamous to all vampires, she's an expert at her trade. She's killed a lot of strong vampires and insists it's not murder- \\"It's isn't murder to kill something that died thousands of years ago.\\" Christopher is almost an exact opposite of Nikolas- no threat, weak, and has an iron will and an ability to resist some of the most tempting things. I think that these three characters made the book extra interesting.This book is wonderful as it is- the story can't be any better. But the only flaw that I can find is the cover art. The cover is very discouraging- I didn't want to read it at first. In fact, it reminded me of a car accident. But don't be influenced by the cover- remember, don't judge a book by it's cover. It's certanly true in this case.If you liked the other Amelia Atwater-Rhodes books, then you'll love this one to. I would recommend this to all teen readers and lovers of fantasy and maybe horror. The fantasy part in the book is quite modern, though. There are a few books I haven't read, but have heard are good and related to this book's genre: BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE, THE SILVER KISS, and DEAD UNTIL DARK. IN other words, all people who like reading about vampires and witchs."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is my second review- my first was the one by \\"Jade\\".SHATTERED MIRROR is a book by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes: a richly-written, atasfying novel.

Continuously placing herself in danger Sarah continues to hunt for Nikolas and soon learns of his past and his lost companion and brother. After discovering who they are and leaning the truth of the past can she bring herself to kill the man sworn as her enemy?Grow with Sarah as she learns to overcome some of life's little battles and some of life's huge ones.

Join Sarah as she grows from a nave close-minded girl into an understanding wide-eyed woman taking in the aspects of all the creatures of day, night, life and death.Amelia Atwater-Rhodes write enthusiastically chilling novels and proves it in this blood boiling story. For only being 19 years old the author writes exquisitely."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This was my second experience from Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. It was an improvement from the poorly written Demon in My View. She improved somewhat in character development and description, but it was still a tragedy awaiting.The main character sounded like a clone of Jessica from her second novel: callous, insincere and she thinks the world evolves around her. She has this talent for causing the reader to hate Dominique. In actuality, the mother is just concerned and Sarah is nothing more than a spoiled brat.She has a stalker by the name of Chris, who praises his love for her like a delusional mental case. He's too nice and wimpy in my opinion. Nissa, his sister doesn't have any purpose. Nick, is probably the only character I liked, but still annoyed with the fact he was all talk and no action.There was no storyline at all, just a saffy love story gone wrong. The ending was just like Demon in My View. Amelia makes the villain sound like the strongest beast in the world, though with sequences of Sarah and Nick together, he seems weak and unnoticed.I gave it three stars for improvement, except I was kind of bored with the story."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book of vampires and witches created a fantastic plot that kept me hooked. This is one of the few books that I managed to finish in one day. Although it is not a difficult read, I was very impressed with the authors abilities for such a young age. I would highly suggest that young aspiring writers read this book. I believe that it shows how even teens can write enjoyable books."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"What really stuck with me as a message in the book is that it's hard not to judge people and that there are two sides to most people. Sometimes it's easier to think in terms of black and white with the evil villian and the hero. Here the villian turns out to have a sensitive side?It's a really interesting plot, the way you can't tell who's evil or not. It's a good idea but the ending stumped and kind of upset me.It's an interesting book but the ending largely upset and creeped me out so I only gave it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I thought this book, Shattered Mirror, was a good book with a unpredictable ending. The witch in the book, Sarah Vida, is a vampire hunter. She is trying to find the vampire Nickolas. Everything is fine until she goes to school and ends up befriending two vampires. When her sister finds out about their relationship, Sarah runs into a problem, ruin the relationship with her friends or family.I liked the book. It kept me guessing and it was never boring. The ending is unexpected and unpredictable. The perfect book!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I liked this book, but didn't love it. The plot was decent, not up to her usual standards, and the characters were a little monotone. I liked, however, how she incorperated the characters so that they all linked together in the end. This is a good book, but I liked the others better."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Sarah Vida is a part of the strongest witch line and vampire hunters in the world. When she goes to her new school she finds herself breaking a hunting law...do not make friends with a vampire. Which is exactly what she does to Christopher and Nissa, two wonderfully sweet vampires. Sarah comes to care for these two and by doing this she not only endangers herself and her friends. So she explains to them she is a vampire hunter and she does not want to endanger them and this convinces them to leave her alone.But Sarah soon finds out that Chris and Nissa are related to one of the most infamous vampires in the world and this has Sarah breaking many rules to get to him. With a wonderful plot and many twists this book is sure to have you enchanted throughout the whole book."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Of the three Atwater-Rhodes novels I've read, this is my favorite. I think it has the most real feeling characters, although the heroine is a bit soft hearted.In past books, Atwater-Rhodes tells the story from a vampire perspective, or a vampire sympathizer. In this novel the tables are turned, and it's told from the point of view of a vampire hunter, a member of the Vida line for hunters. Sarah isn't as good a hunter as her mom or sister, but she's determined to find her place in the Vida line by killing Nikolas, a vampire that killed one of her line centuries ago, and still causes, carving his name into his victims and making them fiercly loyal to him.Sarah is attending school like any normal kid, and she meets a brother and sister pair, Nissa and Christopher. They're both vampires, and as it turns out, hundreds of years old. Christopher is taken with her, and leaves her poems and drawing, and in a relatively short period of time Sarah falls for him.Later she finds out that Christopher's twin brother is Nikolas, the vampire she wants to destroy so badly. While hunting him down she risks her friendship with Nissa and Christopher, as well as her standing in her line. Her mother is furious she'd make friendships with the \`leeches.'The novel continues in the same vein, introducing another brother and sister pair, this time normal, which gives Sarah a chance to strengthen her resolve that Nikolas is a monster. Later she finds out things about Christopher that she wishes she hadn't, which puts her in a more precarious position.I admit I didn't quite expect the ending, and I'm disappointed by it. Not only does Sarah meet the same fate as Jessica from Demon in my View, but Nikolas' vow to take care of a problematic vampire doesn't seem to happen. You're left wondering where everyone's going to go from the ending.The blurb about the story is a little misleading. Christopher isn't a benign vampire, and nowhere does he boast about only living off the blood of animals and willing victims. Sarah notices from the start that he doesn't seem to feed of humans, but the issue of who or what he feeds off of doesn't come up until much later in the book. When it does come up, it's a big deal too, so I think that part of the blurb is misleading."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This was such a great book. I loved the characters, even the antagonist Nikolas. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves supernatural novels. Again, it was awesome!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I thought this book was excellent. Geared toward teens, it expresses some of the emotions they feel many days. Sara, the main character, mirrors how some of us feel, confused. I liked the vampires, especially Christoper. The book flows smoothly, and is easy to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read 'The Last Vampire' series by Christopher Pike or just likes vampires."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"The minute that I read this book, I fell in love with it. I checked it out at my school's library along w/her other books, In the forests of the night, and demon in my view. The first 2 were pretty good, but this one was AWESOME! The plot is really good, and unexpected things happen during the book you wouldn't expect from certain characters. I give it 5 stars, and this author has a gift no one can take away!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is a great story of forbidden love, a vampire huntress falls in love with a vampire now if that isn't breaking the vida law then I don't know what is. She also puts her life on the line a number of times to avenge her ancestors on a horrid yet intoxicating vampire named nicholas. This is a story of action and love hate relationships a great novel the best winter read on a dark night it will let you escape into the dark gothic mists of rhodes latest most intriguing novel."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes continues to write about vampires in this book which is one of my personal favorites.Its about a vampire hunter who moves into a town where good vampires goto school with her and she ends up associating with them much to the displeassure of her family.So what happens when a forbidden bond is created between the vampire hunter and the vampires?If you really want to know then read this book,once you start you may not be able to put it down though."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I first stumbled upon Amelia Atwater-Rhodes while I was at my local library. I love the way she writes and makes you feel connected to the characters, and how you can't help but root for the good guy. I liked Shattered Mirror because,number one, I love any vampire, witch, shapeshifter fantasy. Number two, It's believable, it almost seems real. It takes place in Massachusetts. I also could relate to Sarah Tigeress Vida. She acts tough, but deep down she had fears and a little insecurity. I kind of fell for Christopher too. (I guess I'm a little bit of a romantic.) The only thing I didn't like about this story was that there were a few loose ends. I hope there will be a sequel. I want to know what happens between Sarah and her family, how she handles going from a vampire hunter/witch, to her relationship with Christopher, and how they handle Kaleo. I do highly recommend this book and any other titles by Atwater-Rhodes. She has an incredible talent."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"After hearing so much of Miss Atwater-Rhodes, I decided to pick up one of her books. The library had \\"Shattered Mirror\\" and no others. I checked it out and was immediately drawn into the book.\\"Shattered Mirror\\" is about Sarah Vida, a vampire hunter. Sarah Vida comes from a long line of witches whose soul purpose is to hunt and kill all vampires. When Sarah starts at a new school, two vampire's Nissa and Christopher befriend her. She knows how dangerous this is, to her and the Vida line. She also knows that she can have her powers removed because she is going against the Vida law, because of this she try's to get Christopher and Nissa to stay away from her. She fails. All this time Sarah is hunting the vampire Nikolas. She finally finds him, and he looks just like Christopher. Nikolas is his twin. Nikolas plays mind games with Sarah and even invite's her to his vampire bashes. Sarah learns that Nikolas and Christopher (Kristopher at this point) were two very powerful vampires. They would carve their names into there victims. She knows she has to kill Nikolas but she can't seem to bring herself around to do so. Which is her downfall.Three stars are given to \\"Shattered Mirror\\". I liked the main ideas and the plot but it got a little confusing. You didn't find out everything about the characters until you were half way done in the book, (which made you say, \\"Huh?\\" at some parts) also, the vampire's could go out into the day. That's a bit off. Although to book has its flaws I really liked it. The poetry was amazing! Miss Atwater-Rhodes did a good job. It's a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"I don't want to give away to much of this book because I feel all of it needs to be left unknown until read. But I do want to say a few things.Sarah Vida is a vampire hunter and Christopher Ravena is a vampire. The two become friends against everything their famly's knowledge, belifes, and wishes(kinda Romeo and Juliet). Not only is a fiendship forming but so is a romance.Well that's all Im gonna give away about the story. But I will say that when I read this I felt as if I had some connection to the characters. They are very real."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This is the story of a witch named Sarah Vida. In this world witches are vampire hunters. Sarah starts a new school and on her first day she meets two weak vampires. She can sense their aura but they can't sense hers. The two vampires names are Christopher and Nissa. They are brother and sister. Christopher falls in love with Sarah and she doesn't know how to tell him who she is. Sarah's sister Adianna finds out that Sarah is friends with two vampires and threatens to tell their mother. If Sarah's mother finds out she will disown her. That means that Sarah will lose all her powers as a witch.This is one of my favorite books. I don't read very often but I've read this one four times. I've also read every other book by this author. I strongly encourage everyone to read this book and every other book by this author."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"Shattered Mirror is a great book. If you want a book that has adventure then this book is the book to read. Shattered mirror takes place in a small town and a small neighborhood. In the beginning Sara had to go to a new school and meet all new people. At first everything was fine, but then she met this boy. His name was Nicholas. Nicholas was a vampire, and since Sara was a vampire hunter she smelled his aura right away. When she realized what he was, she tried to ignore him, but he insisted on being friends with her. She did research on Nicholas and she found out that he hadn't harmed anyone in over 200 years. Because he hadn't hurt anyone in so long, Sara decided that there was no harm in being his friend. But when her mom found out she was mad because she had forbidden her daughter to ever befriend a vampire. What Sara's mom doesn't know is that Sara and Nicholas are not only friends, but they have fallen love. If you want to find out what happens to Sara and Nicholas, and the journey they face then, you should really read this book.\\" Sara wasn't sure what she wanted to do now that she was a vampire but as Nicholas had said, she had forever.\\" This is my favorite quote in the book because it is so mysterious, and it really brings everything in the book together. I also like this quote because it really makes you want to read the next 2 books.I think that the book shattered mirror is a great book, because Sara, one of the main characters, really fights for what she believes in. What I mean by that is that even though none of her family members agree with her and Nicholas being together she stays with him any ways. I think that if you like fantasy/super natural kinds of books then this is the book for you. Also if you like vampires and creatures like that, then you would really like this book. I would recommend this book to kids about 12 and 13 years old because there are some confusing or hard parts to understand. Also I would recommend it to adults who want a shorter book, that is also a good book. I think this book is important to read because it teaches you to believe in and do what you want, no matter what anyone thinks."},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book was unbelieveable when you consider how young she is compared to other great successful authors in her genre.

Sarah Vida is an excellent heroine. This is an amazing story that alot of young readers will enjoy basically becuase it reaches them on certain levels where authors like Anne Rice can't reach because of the age diffrence that Atwater-Rhodes covers.

At night she goes to vampire parties, looking for Nikolas, armed with various knives ready to kill Nikolas at any cost.This book was awesome! There was such inner turmoil, so much tension and many life-or-death situations. Sarah was such a strong person, but still vulnerable.

These are not your typical vampires. Some of them go to school with Sarah. Not all Vampires are bad. Some of them feel that killing is wrong and some feel that drinking human blood is wrong.It is a rich and interesting world that reminds me very much of the Night World books by L. J. Smith. If you are familiar with them and like them, then I am sure you will enjoy this book as well.Sarah has just started a new school. Sarah ir rather head-strong and does not always follow her mother's orders (her mother is chief witch, head of the line and very powerful). This really comes out regarding two of Sarah's classmates.

You never really seemed to connect with either of them on a personal level and it got so annoing how much she freaked out when she was around him. \\"this is so wrong\\" \\"im breaking all the rules\\" blah blah...The action was decent but it was just boring.

I could not stop reading. I just kept reading and reading. Even when I was supposed to go to bed I still read it because you wanted to know what happened next. The only part about the book that I did not like was the ending. It shocked me what happened. Shattered Mirror is about a girl name Sarah whose family are witches including her that hunt vampires. She was sent to a new school and meets two brothers and sisters, Christopher and Nissa. They are vampires but they don't feed on humans. Later on Sarah finds out that Christopher and Nissa are related to Nikolas. Sarah's family has been trying to hunt him down and kill him for centuries. But Nikolas always escapes from the witches traps. One night Sarah got invited to a party, but she didn't know that it was a trap. Only does she know that there were going to be vampires there but also Nikolas too. So now she can try to finish him but her family doesn't know that she is going to the party. Sarah's life is in danger now with all those vampires there and nobody backing her up. Will one of her sister's or her mom come and save her or will Christopher or Nissa? What will happen to Sarah?I rate this book 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows)","review":"she comes up with such creative story lines and creative unique titles that make you want to pick it up and give it more thought, since this book i have read all of her other books! and i love them all!!!"},{"Title":"Arthur C.Clarke's Chronicles of the Strange and Mysterious","review":"I am totally confused by this book's title. Ordinarily, one might expect a book called \\"Arthur C. Clarke's Chronicles of the Strange and Mysterious\\" to have been written by Arthur C. Clarke!, but not so. It transpires, some years ago, Clarke hosted two hugely successful British television series' entitled Mysterious World and World of Strange Powers - the accompanying books for which went on to become best-sellers. Now, seemingly in an attempt to jump onto the bandwagon, these two authors have produced a book containing fresh mysteries and have invited Clarke to analyse them. Confusing or what?And there hangs the problem as far as the subject matter is concerned. Clarke is a most distinguished scientist and engineer. For him, therefore, all paranormal events have a perfectly rational explanation - even if he does not actually have that explanation to hand.We live in a world beset with mysteries and we like reading about them. As and when conclusive proof comes along to prove, discount or explain away this mystery or that, I personally do not want my reading of such matters spoilt by one who know best and by one who knows all the answers simply because he is a scientist.Some interesting mysteries - but there are better books available.NM"},{"Title":"Snapshots in Black and White","review":"I laughed, I cried, I was intrigued, I was puzzled.The author opens the door to our own mind as well as hers.For every experience she had, you may have had also."},{"Title":"Snapshots in Black and White","review":"\\"Snapshots in Black and White\\" had me glued to the page from cover to cover...candid and passionate...she writes with a depth of insight that had me smiling and crying...her journey, what a wonderful read!!!"},{"Title":"Car Crime (Crime and Society Series)","review":"Considering not big choice that we have today in books about car crimes, I purchased this book and I'm very glad.

If you have a little experiance in the API, (for example, i had used the API for a few BitBlt functions), then this is a good 'next level' book. If you have no idea what i mean when i say 'BitBlt Functions' then this book probably isn't for you. This book is a good reference and fairly useful when troubleshooting API problems, and it also goes a bit beyond the Win32 API which can be informitive.

Often he writes, that something will be explained in another chapter. This is a bad design of a tutorial. He has some good tips and tricks in that book, but if one is a beginner with Win32-API he must read too many things a few times until he understands them. Dan Appleman's book seems to be a little better for beginners."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 6 Win32 API Tutorial","review":"I can honestly say after doing about 80% of the examples in this book, that I found only about 20% of the stuff useful.

And it is hard cause unlike picking some new control and just figuring out what it does by its properties and methods, API's aren't something you can quickly grasp (IMHO) by playing with them.I didn't like the 'I will explain what all this does later', concept either as one reviewer mentioned. If your going to write out tonnes of code explain it all before you move on. This book doesn't do that. ALSO DON'T throw pages of code and more pages and then explain what it all does.DO IT IN SMALL CHUNKS!! Any developer who writes tonnes and tonnes of code and then tests his/her program is nuts. Take it in small steps. The book doesn't do this and I feel that was its greatest fault.I'd write this huge routine and sure it would work, but I'd be saying to myself &quot;what do these 2 lines here at the beggining with the API call do exactly&quot;.. Then I am coding more and then the concept is atempted to be explained to me in its entirity.. And I am sitting there &quot;What the hell did I just do?&quot;Well that's my 2 cents. The good thing is source code is available from the publishers web site, and what errors there are in the book are easy to see.. nothing huge (that is unless you are really new to VB then u shouldn't be using this book first). However, the mutex example was VERY helpful and I have it in one application already. I know what it does but I don't really understand its mechanics...

It is inescabable that this book is compared to Appleman's book which is the definitive work on API's but while I have the Appleman book I find that it is better for people who are already somewhat experinced and want to learn more. This book by Jason Bock is THE book to buy if you are starting out. Not to say it is a 'API for Dummies' type of book -API usage is a non-trivial subject- but this will give you the foundation you need in a much more digestible fashion.

I read a little, then started to skim, then skip sections, then put it aside completely where it collected dust while I found my answers elsewhere. I eventually picked it up again after I had become casually familiar with the Win32 API and realized that my remorse over the purchase wasn't the book's fault - rather it was my expectations of what the book was going to deliver.The Win32 API is vast and complicated. A casual glance at Win32 API books that go over just the Functions and Types (in only 4000 pages) will prove it. Any programmer looking at this book to solve a specific problem for them should keep looking. The book does not cover that many specific API situations, but rather explains syntax and structure, how's and when's, etc (metaphorically explaining what the abbreviations for a cup or tablespoon is and how to read a recipe card rather than how to cook any particular dish itself). I recommend the book as either your first introduction to the Win32 API after you have got VB6 down but before you actually need the Win32 API, or as a refresher for those who know the general gist of how to use the Win32 API, but want to fill in the gaps of what some things are, why they are used, and when to use them."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 6 Win32 API Tutorial","review":"Im a 17yr. old VB programmer, when I purchased the book I knew some API, FindWindow, FindWindowEx, a few others, and how to declare them, but I didnt know what all the stuff meant(Declare Function blah blah), this book taught me what it all means, where to find more Calls, and ALL of other useful information, If I knew nothing about API, and read this book I would definatly know how to use is by the end of the book!

I decided to add it to my &quot;stack&quot; of read-and-rates.There is nothing new, novel, or remotely remarkable about this book. But less than average writing, poor illustrations, and out-of-date techniques are among some of its numerous flaws. I approached this book initially because it was listed under &quot;Dogs -- Behavior&quot; AND &quot;Dogs -- Training.&quot; But really if anything, it falls under choosing and caring for a new puppy!There are 10 chapters in this book. The first is more of an &quot;extended intro,&quot; second is Dibra's 8 Fundamental Pack Behaviors (nothing any reading/thinking person wouldn't know *yawn*), and chapters 3-6 are all about choosing and caring for a new puppy! WHOA! Wasn't this listed under &quot;Dogs -- Behavior&quot;? Just wait, it gets better!Chapter 7 finally gets to the &quot;behavior&quot; portion I crave. But I was severly dissappointed. The illustrations are terrible, if not incomplete, and the description of basic doggy body language is less-than-adequate. He doesn't even BEGIN to go into the complexities of certain types of dogs, or &quot;dialects&quot; as we like to call them! But all in all, if you have never read any texts on behavior, it may possibly be a wee bit helpful to you.Unforgivable Sins in this book:Dibra's puppy-buying guide relies HEAVILY on AKC as a &quot;starting point,&quot; saying you can use them for breed research, breeder referral, and a reference point. Not so. AKC offers generalities like breed standards (useless when matching a dog to your lifestyle!) and a list of breeders who may or may not produce quality dogs. This generally wouldn't bother me so much, but he KEEPS referring to it!Dibra recommends that at 6 months a dog be fitted with a &quot;control collar&quot;... which is a lame way of saying &quot;choke chain.&quot; He says in chapter 8 (pg 143) &quot;It goes without saying that training can't begin without the proper equipment: training control collar and leash ... Otherwise you have no control of your dog.&quot; Oh really? hmmm... I've never used a correction collar and I compete in agility, which takes a high degree of focus and control.I was disgusted by his use of the choke collar in general, such as when teaching heal, continually pop the collar at intervals to remind your dog to stay with you. What, is it a reward now? He also mentions that it is not punishment, it is correction, and that punishment makes a dog &quot;shut down.&quot; I'm here to tell you, I have a dog that &quot;shuts down&quot; when you tug on his nylon martingale accidentally! I know several others who shut down when you correct them verbally! How do you deal with that?He is against any other training device and doesn't even cover them except to say they &quot;backfire.&quot; Please be open minded! Even I teach methods for equipment I don't agree with!A minor fault: he refers to the veterinarian as the ultimate reference for doggy health. I'm here to tell ya (as a vet tech student and natural raiser) vets don't know everything! And above all else, who knows your animal better than YOU!I was severely disappointed with this book to the point that I wrote down the things as I found them (hence the quote). There are way more &quot;red flag&quot; quotes in the book. I can't believe this man teaches celebrities how to handle their dogs for $300 an hour.

The first part of DogSpeak was a reasonable introduction to recognising dog behaviours that may be useful to people coming to grips with their first dog, and who don't have other sources such as more experienced owners or a local obedience club to turn to. For people looking for more advanced dog-person communication, there was very little that was new or particularly insightful. The second section of the book on training was more disappointing. The training methods were basic, old-fashioned, and importantly were short on detail on what to do when the method does not work (and no method works all the time!) It is simply not good enough to reassure readers that 'your dog will understand this', as the author regularly did. Also the use of the corrective methods shown in the book could be dangerous and counterproductive in the hands of inexperienced trainers. Unlike the blurb, DogSpeak is definintely NOT revolutionary. It makes very little connection between the communication and the training sections, the former being basic and the latter being a method that has been around for many years before this book was published.

Dibra is truly the authority on how to understand animals. He is, without a doubt, the best in the world.I have always been impressed by Dibra. All of his books show a sincere love and devotion to animals. It is clear from his writing that Dibra is a gentle and caring individual who truly loves and respects the dogs he trains. Because of his connection with the animals, he is able to understand their communication. It's almost as though he can read their minds. No kidding. He knows exactly what they are thinking. I trust him and his techniques implicitly.Not only is the book written in clear and interesting language, but the advice Dibra gives is absolutely golden! The training works beautifully and it fosters a loving, trusting, and respectful relationship between dog and owner. I know first hand -- I have used Dibra's techniques and my dog is an absolute doll. She has earned the reputation of being the neighborhood sweetheart. I firmly believe this is a result of using Dibra's book and communicating well with my dog. After all, I can finally understand her language!This book is a MUST for any dog owner.

I really hope there's a GREAT book of Anne and Mary out there, cause this ain't it!"},{"Title":"The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read","review":"There seem to be a lot of stories about Anne Bonny and Mary Read, and much of it is not certain, not proved or just pure romantic fantasy. The book of Eastman and Bond tries to filter out all fantasy and leave only the facts. I think they have done this in a very professional and honest way. Included is a 2 page list of used sources.The booklet starts with a short but good introduction to piracy in the first years of the 18th century. This is good background information to better understand the story of Anne and Mary. The second part describes the lives and background of the two 'hellcats'. The last part is a transcript of the trial. A well done 3 page index closes the book.The booklet contains several black and white reproductions of woodcuts depicting Anne and Mary, and several illustrations of stamps and coins. (Have a look at the decolletes of the girls on the stamps and coins and compare them with some engravings!)I cannot compare this book with other books, because this is the first I have read about the subject.Sticking to the facts probably means that the quantity of the information can only be limited. I did read the book from cover to cover in less than 2 hours. It contains 66 pages, title pages and index included. For the $ 9.95 I paid for it, it is good quality for the money. I have seen more expensive offers, and in those cases I wonder if you get good quantity for the money.Jos Erdkamp, Netherlands"},{"Title":"The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read","review":"I bought *THE PIRATE TRIAL OF ANNE BONNY &amp; MARY READ* in order to write a paper about these women for my Western Civ class. Out of the four books I read about pirates, *THIS* book provided me much more information on these women, by far. It's not large, so it's very easy to read - and provides straightforward, well researched facts in a no nonsense writing style. I found information in this book that I'd never read anywhere else, and the complete transcript of their trial was extremely helpful to me, because it saved me the time and trouble of ordering a copy. Ms. Tamara Eastman states at the end of this book that she is coming out with another book on Anne Bonny and Mary Read very soon. I am anxiously awaiting the next book, because I really enjoyed *THIS* one.Stephanie C. Cambridge, Massachusetts"},{"Title":"The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read","review":"I ordered this book and read it with great enthusiasm. I've searched for so long for really good information on these women pirates, yet to date have only managed to find vague, overly embellished material on websites, that seemed to have been written by romance novelists with vivid imaginations. I can't tell you what a great relief it is to find a new book on Anne Bonny and Mary Read that is as close to being scholarly accurate as they come! I would like to thank the authors for their time and effort. I was initially taken aback by the minute size of the book, however I was pleasantly surprised to find it is packed with a great deal of very good information, not to mention some interesting and entertaining illustrations I'd never seen in any other books on pirates. Tamara Eastman promises to delve even deeper in an upcoming biography on Anne Bonny, and I am looking forward to seeing the next book. ~ Barbara"},{"Title":"The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read","review":"I've held a deep interest in pirates since I was a young boy, and only over the past few years discovered that women stepped into this world. I attended a pirate convention in the Florida Keys a couple of weeks ago to learn more about pirates, in general, and treat my wife and daughters to a few days in the beautiful Keys.While there I attended a lecture by two authors, Sandra Riley and Tamara Eastman. What a fabulous lecture it was! I learned so much more about the most infamous pirates through listening to these women discuss their research and the work they've done to help dispell various myths and lay these women's true stories open for the world to enjoy. Tamara Eastman autographed a copy of &quot;The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read&quot; for me, and I began to read it on my drive back home. This is one of the VERY BEST books I've ever read about these particular women pirates. It's apparent that Ms. Eastman has spent a great deal of time and effort on her research, as it shows in this book. I must warn potential readers NOT to judge a book by its cover, however. This is a small paperback, with a rather plain cover. In fact, I must say I am not impressed with the cover - and I feel the publisher could have invested a lot more in it. It's a shame to have someone spend as much time as Ms. Eastman obviously has in her painstaking research, only to turn to a publisher that gives such a half assed attempt at putting a decent cover on the book. I'm here to say NOT to judge this book by its size or its outer cover. Because once you start reading it, you cannot put it down until you have finished it. This is an easy task, as Ms. Eastman is a remarkable and gifted writer, and tells these women's stories in such a manner that you easily understand where she's coming from. The forward introduction of the book was written by Ms. Constance Bond, and Ms. Eastman gave me some info about Ms. Bond, including the fact that she's written for Smithsonian. I'm impressed with how the introduction sets the stage for Ms. Eastman's book. Overall, this is a truly remarkable book and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the women pirates, Anne Bonny and Mary Read. In talking with Ms. Eastman after the lecture, she informed me that she's beginning a book project with the author, Sandra Riley. Having listened to these two women lecture together, I can only imagine what a great book they'll turn out. I eagerly await this forthcoming masterpiece. I'd also like to thank Ms. Eastman for autographing and giving me the last copy she had with her in Key West. She's not only a terrific writer, but a very kind and generous person, as well. My whole family enjoyed meeting these authors. Incidentally, Ms. Eastman does a terrific job of portraying Anne Bonny, as well. Very convincing. My daughters were thrilled with the show! Mr. Edward Malloy, Miami."},{"Title":"The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read","review":"I obtained an autographed copy of this book a couple of weeks ago when the author, Tamara Eastman, came here to Orlando and conducted a book signing. She delivered a lecture beforehand, and I found Mrs. Eastman to be one of the most informative and entertaining speakers I've listened to in a great while. I have read THE PIRATE TRIAL OF ANNE BONNY &amp; MARY READ and found it to be the most straightforward and historically accurate book about these particular pirate women that I've ever read. Mrs. Constance Bond wrote a great introduction to the book, giving us some important historical facts about the Caribbean in the 17th and 18th centuries, and some general background information on Anne Bonny &amp; Mary Read. Then Mrs. Eastman discusses the events that lead up to the pirates being tried in Jamaica, and some of the research she's conducted over the past couple of years. I particularly liked seeing the trial transcript in its entirety, as I had never read the full transcript until now. The authors don't waste a lot of time recanting the numerous unfounded stories that have been circulated throughout the world, but instead present their indepth research in a fresh, matter of fact manner that finally brings the whole story into perspective. For anyone wanting some concrete information about these women pirates, without a lot of time to waste, I would suggest reading THE PIRATE TRIAL OF ANNE BONNY &amp; MARY READ.Mrs. Denise Lobeck Orlando, Florida"},{"Title":"The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read","review":"I find it peculiar that this book is listed as &quot;not published,&quot; as I just received my copy last week. Having read many books and articles on these women pirates, I've found there has been a serious lack of information on them, and much speculation. This book begins with an introduction by Constance Bond, who orientates the reader with the very world these women entered. Tamara Eastman has presented the story of Anne Bonny and Mary Read as I've never seen it before. She appears to have gone to great lengths to avoid the speculation from the past, and has presented new evidence on each of these women. The book is not large, but it is powerfully packed with documented information, some that I'd never seen or heard before. Anyone seeking to uncover the story of the actual events surrounding the piracy career of these women, or who are searching for the truth of what actually befell Anne Bonny, then they may find this book to be a tremendous help to them. The mystery of Anne Bonny is just waiting to be found, and I truly believe this author is very close to discovering it. I rarely ever present a score of five stars, but having read several books on these women pirates, I feel this one is the best, by far."},{"Title":"The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read","review":"I must agree with all the on-line comments so far. That Ms. Eastman has wrote a WONDERFUL book. I know that the cover isn't much to look at, but when I had the opportunity to read the book I was a Historical Interpreter and it was perfect in simplicity to hide from visitors going through my tours. I read it every chance I got, and as a pirate storyteller I KNOW for a fact that it added to my ability to portray a more appropriate female pirate. After having met and spent time with Ms. Eastman not only is her book wonderful, but so is she! Being able to talk with her one on one was a real treasure! Just as this book! Thank you for doing so much work and research! I can tell you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read","review":"I've purchased this book used, and have to say I agree with the man from Miami (December 2001) who stated he was not impressed with the cover of the book. If I were to see this book in a store, it very likely would not pique my interest enough to bother giving it a second glance. However, this is a good case example of \\"never judge a book by its cover.\\" Tamara Eastman has obviously gone to great lengths to bring the story of these women pirates into a more realistic light. Instead of repeating the countless myths that perpetuate these women, Ms. Eastman has dug below the surface, helping to lay many of these myths to rest. I've read a good number of expensive, elegantly bound books on pirates - and yet none of them impressed me quite as much as this paperback book that the publisher apparently didn't go to much length to dress up. For only a couple of bucks, I was able to purchase this book (used) and learn far more about the pirates, Bonny and Read, than I have anywhere else, prior.I'd be very interested in reading more of Tamara Eastman's work, as I'd never heard of her, prior to reading this book, and am quite impressed with her writing.Ashley DavisBurrowsville, Virginia"},{"Title":"The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read","review":"I've seen a lot of trashy myths when reading about these girl pirates but I really liked -The pirate trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read- The whole book is presented in an easy to read style and the authors have done a great job of telling these two ladies story in such a way that it is very well understood by the reader. Another thing I like about this book is that I didn't have to wade through a bunch of -B.S.- stories like you do in a lot of other books about lady pirates. Instead of telling the same stories over again these authors have provided very good facts about them that they've found in their research.

It read a lot like an uninformed high school paper, with a catchy opening paragraph, but nothing exceptional after that - short, choppy sections, several pictures - that didn't even concrete what these female pirates looked like, more filler on all the other characters in the book, than actual facts on the pamphlet's topics, and some unanswered facts (a few that left me wondering why they were added).If you are curious about this \\"book\\" - check it out! But don't waste your time OR money buying it, if you are already familiar with these two pirates."},{"Title":"The Endless Sky","review":"In a tone as bleak, and yet majestically beautiful as the Badlands themselves, author Kathryn Lynn Davis presents a tale of madness, jealousy, passion and murder when the past meets the present. Betrayal and treachery haunts the grossly lands and towering cliffs, burning like the purposefully set fire set to destroy the Vallombrosa cattle range. As this timeless epic saga culminates in the changing century, the whisper of secrets becomes a raging inferno that threatens to destroy them all.Phillip de Vallombrosa follows his father's dream to succeed over the forces of the untamed land. Following his father's death in the deserts of Africa, Phillip and his family, including his stepmother Medora, leave Paris behind to return to the enterprise his father abandoned fourteen years ago. There the Vallombrosas resurrect a business venture intended to ship freshly butchered and packaged meat to the meatpacking plants of Chicago. Unfortunately, dangerous and ruthless enemies intend to see the Vallombrosa business fail again. A neighboring rancher and his family will stop at nothing to destroy the Vallombosa, blaming old wounds and desperate secrets for the pain of the present. Retribution becomes their motive for destruction, and they will stop at nothing to have their revenge.At twenty-six, Mianne fits in neither the Sioux world of her mother, nor the white world of her father. She and her father were left at the Chateau in the Badlands to care for the property until the Vallombrosas' return. Now Phillip finds not the elusive, ethereal girl he left behind, but the wildly passionate, and extremely private woman who refuses to allow anyone to touch her heart. Yet her love for Phillip leads to their marriage, even as she refuses to reveal the secrets of her heart. Indeed, her passion for Phillip proves to be as untamed and dangerous as the feelings still felt by her rival Katheryn, who vows to have Phillip for herself, or to destroy him so that no one might have him.Originally penned in 1984, THE ENDLESS SKY is certainly worthy of reprint, especially for those of us who haven't previously discovered this author's work. Kathryn Lynn Davis pens an extremely complex tale with many subplots that tie back into a dark tale of revenge and betrayal. Her characters are realistically multifaceted, with deep felt hatreds, joys, jealousies and dreams. With a master's precision, she weaves these multihued elements into an intricate whole that dazzles the reader. Further, the breath taking magnificence of the Badlands provides an evocative background rich with legend and meaning. Despite the complexity of characterizations, however, the narrative flows with a richness and simplicity that marks this novel as an outstanding read. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Weather in the Lab: Simulate Nature's Phenomena","review":"Mr. Baker was my 9th grade Algebra teacher.

Henry makes it into the novel but it felt perfunctory, along with Rosie and William etc. There were so many plot twists and long narratives describing every house or building that Kinsey encounters. This really could have been two separate books. It seemed like characters just kept falling in from everywhere, which made it was difficult to distinguish them, much less care about them.I still love Kinsey and will again be looking forward to Q in the series and this still had its' good moments but I hope Q will end with an ENDING!

Still, the book was enjoyable and worth the effort of reading."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I have read all the Kinsey Milhone books from Sue Grafton and have to say that this last installment left me unfulfilled. The story never seemed to take off, you didn't have the strong attachment to the character's eccentric personality as in previous installments and the ending left me looking for the rest of the chapter! Hopefully, O will be for on track again."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"&quot;P is for Peril&quot; was a nice addition to the beloved series...until the dissapointing ending. Who was the killer? (which of the 2 final characters?) Though we can assume, we don't truly know. What was the motive? Again - we can assume, but have no definitive answer. What was going on with Leila? (How is a 14 yr. old that smart? When I was 14, I was brainstorming my way out of Gym class, not pulling off major heists.) That storyline seemed merely thrown in to absolve one of the outstanding questions of the plot. Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I like my mysteries to be neatly tied up at the end, not leave you staring at the binding of the book, looking for evidence that some jerk ripped out the final chapter. Though it is always fun to spend some time with Kinsey, I'm hoping Q ends a little neater. Perhaps with a nice respectful submission?"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I am a devoted Sue Grafton fan - she is one of three authors that I will buy in hardback (Parker and Evanovich are the other two). I love her character Kinsey Millhone's situational surliness, plus I grew up in San Luis Obispo, setting of F is for Fugitive and not too far from Santa Barbara (the real name of the fictional Santa Teresa). She is also one author I have come to depend on for a cohesive, well-thought out plot.So I am doubly disappointed in this newest novel. Other reviewers have done a great job of describing the plot, so I won't repeat. The pacing of the story is just plain strange, though: hot and heavy with developments, then almost a whole chapter on the relationship between the the victim's second wife and her daughter. Also, Grafton relies very heavily on coincidence to produce plot developments, almost as though she had certain scenes and dialogue that she wanted to include even if they didn't really fit into the plot line.The ending of the book didn't bother me near as much as it seemed to bother other readers, although I did miss her &quot;final report&quot; that she usually submits. The whole tone of the book is off-kilter, as though two books were haphazardly merged into one. In fact, that's the first thought I had: Grafton had two books to write, and decided that neither one had enough oomph to make a novel, so she slapped them together."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"What is this? Is Mrs Grafton getting tried of writing books? I enjoyed her series until she wrote O. Then it started to get stupid. What happen to Kinsey? Grafton's got her being lazy and stupid now.

I found myself reading back over sections of the book, searching for clues since there are too many unanswered questions.

I'd love a chance to talk to Sue Grafton about this book."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This is the first time I can say I was disappointed in a Kinsey Millhone book. Sure they're all kinda light, but they're always fun and manage to hook you early on with enough suspense to keep you turning pages. Here I was just left bored. Her main case took a back seat to her secondary story line which I thought became trivial and left neatly tied up with Kinsey not even seeming to deal with what happens. Did I miss something here? And the resolution to the first case slips right on in at the end which offers a murderer, but just a hint at the reason. Believe me, I get it, but it just all seemed too pat. Additionally, there's no wrap up at the end which at least brings the case to a final resolution. I hope &quot;Q&quot; is for quality plot lines."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I've noticed alot of people talking about the ending of P Is For Peril. I, myself, just finished the book and was momentarily confused. Without giving anything away, I just want to say that this book was cleverly laid out, and the ending was haunting, and surprising. Sure, I wish, if not just for continuities sake, there was an epilogue, but I am more than satisfied with the overall product, and must admit that Grafton has caused me to think, more about this novel, than any of her 15 brilliant previous Millhone Mysteries. Go out and get it right now, before someone spoils the ending for you!!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Having waited quite a while for this book to be published, I sat down with much anticipation to read it. Unfortunately, like most things greatly anticipated, it didn't quite live up to expectations. While entertaining and somewhat familiar in tone, it was also not as well written as I have come to expect from Ms. Grafton. My biggest problem is with a ending that I saw coming a mile off. While not necessarily disturbing in and of itself, combined wtih the fact that the main characters seemed to be lacking depth and the secondary plot was MUCH more interestng than the primary, I finished the book without satisfaction and no hurry to get to the ending as is usual with Ms. Grafton's previous work. All in all, an uninspired outing for Kinsey Millhone."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"There is very little peril except for the reader who might fall asleep from sheer boredom. Instead, this slow, boring book should have been titled as \\"P is for Poor.\\"Dr Dowan Purcell has been missing for weeks when Kinsey receives a call from his ex-wife Fiona. Fiona, a potentially difficult client at best, is sure the good doctor ran away from his current wife Crystal. Fiona is convinced that she drove him away and that he eventually would have come back to her. Instead, to avoid the evil clutches of Crystal, the Doctor has skipped to Central America or maybe even Europe. Fiona is abusive and condescending and still Kinsey agrees to take the case.She then sets out on a tedious and detailed canvass of everyone and anyone that ever knew Dr. Purcell. She starts with his current wife Crystal who is convinced now that nine weeks have passed, that he is dead. She seems accepting of the possibility and has her hands full with her out of control daughter, Leila. Leila does not break new ground and like all the other characters in this novel, comes right out of character maker software. Leila is a classic out of control teenager. If you have ever seen any talk television or were unlucky to have a punk in your neighborhood, this is Leila. She hates her life and everything she has and spends the novel whining and rebelling. This allows the reader to meet the biological father as well as the other characters that populate Leila's world.Along the way, as she investigates the doctor and the nursing home where Dr. Purcell was a glorified administrator, Kinsey manages to get herself into a conflict between brothers. After renting out office space from them, she finds out that they probably killed their parents and fled from Texas with ill-gotten gains. Unlike the notorious Menendez brothers, these two seem to have gotten away with it until now.With stereotypical characters, plodding action, and a weak story that just does not move for much of this 352-page novel, this offering is a real disappointment."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"For those who love mysteries with lots of suspects, unexpected complications, red herrings, and sudden reversals, P Is for Peril will rank as one of the very best in this distinguished and popular series. For those who find it hard to be engaged by stories where they don't like the characters very much, P Is for Peril will be a bummer. Of the new characters you will meet in this book, only Jacob Trigg, Dow's best friend, and Anica Blackburn, a school counselor and family friend to Dow's second's wife's daughter, will probably be people you will want to read about again. If you are like me, you don't find books where the characters are all so unsympathetic to be worth five stars.P Is for Peril opens with Ms. Kinsey Millhone at age 36 in 1986, having survived two unsuccessful marriages, her love life at a low ebb, and needing to find a new office to house her one-woman detective agency in Santa Teresa, California. Retired geriatric specialist and now nursing home administrator, Dr. Dowan (Dow) Purcell, aged 69, is missing. He left work one night, and hasn't been seen for nine weeks. The police have looked, but have no leads. Kinsey is hired by his first wife, Fiona, to find him. There are alimony checks to be kept coming at stake! While Fiona, the ex-wife, is hiring Kinsey, Kinsey gets a bad feeling that Fiona may not be the ideal client. Fiona is one of those people who could find fault with a saint. Kinsey tells Fiona, &quot;I'll do what I can, but I make no promises.&quot; Suspicious, Kinsey asks about the bank balance on Fiona's account before depositing the retainer check. There's just enough to cover it. Whew!The current wife, Crystal, is a much younger woman, a former stripper from Las Vegas, whose appeal to Dow was her willingness to perform kinky bedroom games. She is expensive to maintain, and seems to be causing Dow some concern. Why was she disappearing into another man's home every morning? On the other hand, her prenuptial agreement means she gets nothing if Dow divorces her.At the nursing home, everyone loves Dow . . . except the former assistant administrator who disagreed with his firing of the bookkeeper. And soon there are rumors of investigations by the government for Medicare fraud. How does this connect to Dow?At the same time, Kinsey figures out that she had better find a new office. Lonnie's firm is growing and won't have room for her. She meets two nice young men who offer her a nearby steal, and she takes it. Then the story gets interesting!One of the best parts of the book is that the patented Grafton humor is very much in evidence. She gets help from a woman at the nursing home by bringing her junk food from McDonald's. In another key scene, Kinsey thinks she is about to be discovered as an intruder and instead is trapped under a desk by an illicit tryst. Several times, Kinsey makes major judgment errors and wishes she could kick herself. It's all good fun.Most series that have run as long as this one has tend to wind down long before they end. This book clearly shows the benefit of lots of thinking, planning, and good writing. I just wish that Ms. Grafton had remembered that people to read about people they like. These characters do not even have charm to redeem their glaring faults.After you read this story, think about the importance of developing and nurturing good character . . . in yourself, in your family, and in those you come into contact. How will you be remembered when you pass away? How would you like to be remembered? Consider Dow Purcell as a case example to stimulate your thinking.Reputation is a precious asset -- protect it from peril!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millone could only get better with age.

I willing followed her down the path of curosity only to be surprised at the outcome of &quot;who done it&quot;.

I've enjoyed Sue Grafton's A through O books over the past year, but this was sub-par. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. The book just (mercifully) . . . ended."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"The Kinsey Millhone series has gone up and down in quality during its life, but even in the weakest efforts Kinsey herself is always an entertaining tourguide to the past (1986, in this case). This story, though, isn't among the weak efforts. Despite the negative reviews submitted by several others, \\"P Is for Peril\\" is one of the strongest entries in the series (which is remarkable considering that just two volumes ago was one of the very weakest, \\"N Is for Noose\\"). Clearly, it's not time to write this series off.As to the reviewers who thought the ending wasn't clear, or that they didn't know who the murderer was or why the murder occurred: uh, the ending is very clear, as is the who and why. P>As it turns out, there are three intertwined plots here. Each of the plots is clever in its own right. One of the plots will teach you how certain forms of Medicare fraud work (apparently Sue Grafton was taking notes from the misadventures of HCA/Humana), which is where the nursing home comes in. The three plots work well together, giving Kinsey a number of red herrings (and some not-so-red herrings) to chase down that are worhty of her talents and her intellect. If many of the characters aren't young, vibrant and exciting -- that's a big part of what makes them seem like real people in a real time and place.Because of her relative poverty and casual ways, Kinsey is easy to identify with. I can appreciate her choices in a way that I was never able to appreciate Spade's or Marlowe's. Would you be willing to follow a hunch even if you might be humiliated if you were wrong? Would you keep following that hunch despite being so humiliated once? Most of us wouldn't. As a result, we wouldn't have solved this case. I LOVED this aspect of the ending.Perhaps that's why I rate this volume of the series so highly. Or perhaps it's just because I'm so relieved that Sue Grafton can still write both intelligently and entertainingly; I was starting to worry after \\"N Is for Noose.\\" It's nice to know that Kinsey is still in good hands."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"......but I'm happy, happy, happy.

Sue Grafton does not disappoint. Love the woman.Let's face it, sometimes your favorite writers have exhausted their themes, or grown tired, or whatever. Not our Lady Grafton. Hot as ever.Jeeze, you know how it is, you readers.

This is a jargon of characters, most of them highly unlikely at best, an even larger jargon of plots, and a convoluted mess of a story. I didn't like the style, the plot, the setting, or the story itself. In the beginning we are led to believe that finding a missing doctor is the plot here, and our heroine sleuth, Kinsey Milhone, is a private investigator hired by the doctor's long suffering ex-wife to do just that. Somehow there enters another story, of jewel thieves and murderers, that is not connected at all to the doctor's disappearance. I couldn't be sure at any one time which story I was reading. Our heroine comes across as a person with a screw or two loose, and she is just plain not real in any sense of the word. The ex-wife is underdeveloped as an eccentric older lady with a lot of bills, but that is all we ever really learn about this very vital character. The new wife, Crystal, is also vague, I never did get her place in the story correct until I was nearing the end, and when you add a totally unnecessary ex-husband to the new wife, a teenage daughter that isn't his natural daughter, yet he shares joint custody, the teenage daughter's friend who has absolutely no bearing at all, other than to validate the teenage daughter's character maybe..well, it just becomes a huge mess. Then the author throws in another story on top of that! It seemed as though Sue Grafton had some wonderful ideas for characters and plots and themes, would write them down, then forget about them and add new ones here and there. Definitely NOT an all-nighter on this one, folks, perhaps Sue Grafton should start again with the letter A and work her way forward."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Perhaps by Z, Ms. Grafton will give her readers a quality story. I'm forever hopeful (even after 15 mediocre attempts) because I think her heroine, Kinsey Milhone, deserves better. Certainly, we readers do. If you want a quick summer read while you're at the beach that won't take too much attention away from the &quot;sights,&quot; then this is perfect. If, on the other hand, you'd like to be challenged by a good plot or moved by deep thoughts and emotions, may I suggest another author.

If I have to think that hard to figure out the ending to a book, then I won't bother with reading it in the first place. I have always enjoyed Sue Grafton's Kinsey series, but I think this one was lacking in humor and a good ending. Also, what happened to her usual report at the end?For all those folks who actually like to think hard about an ending, this is for you. But for those of us who want it wrapped up neat and clear, don't waste your time. I'm sorry I wasted mine."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This is the best Grafton mystery in several years. It is a &quot;two-fer&quot; in which the doughty PI, Kelsey Millhone, gets involved with two cases simultaneously in monsoon-struck Santa Theresa/Santa Barbara. The first case is a search for Dr Purcell, the missing physcian/administrator of a nursing home. The second involves missing jewels from a murder/robbery in Texas. There are so many plot twists that this reader utterly failed to solve the &quot;whodunit&quot; aspect of the book.Kelsey is supported by her usual cast of friends: her 86 year-old landlord Henry, his older brother, William. who is married to the Hungarian tyrant of Rosie's Tavern, and lawyer Lonnie Kingman. One of Kelsey's former lovers, Jonah Robb, who is now head of Santa Theresa's homicide unit also plays a role in &quot;P is for Peril&quot;.It is the new characters -- mostly women -- that make this Grafton book special. Fiona Purcell, Art Deco decorator, hires Kelsey to find her vanished ex-husband, but seems equally interested in digging up dirt about his current wife, Crystal. Crystal is a former Las Vegas stripper with a troubled teen-age daughter, Leila, (born out of wedlock) and a baby son born to Dr. Purcell. Bright, tough Mariah Talbot arrives from Texas to enmesh Kelsey in the attempt to locate some missing jewelry. Anica Blackburn is the guidance counselor at the Malibu boarding school where Leila is incarcerated. The only person Leila seems to relate to is her Santa Theresa street pal, Pauline. All six women are strong personalities, vividly drawn, that engage the reader's emotions in one way or another. For contrast there is handsome Tommy Hevener, co-owner of the new office Kelsey has leased, who has designs to make their relationship more intimate.The only fault I have to find with this book -- and it is one shared by most contemporary mystery novels -- is that Grafton feels compelled to put Kelsey in mortal danger at the end of the story. The &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; ending has become a cliche in the mystery genre. &quot;If it's good enough for Dick Francis, it's good enough for me&quot;, seems to be the prevailing notion. Classic mystery writers, even the hard-boiled ones like Chandler and Ross MacDonald, devised climaxes to their stories that did not necessarily involve the imminent death and dismemberment of their investigators in the final chapter. At least Grafton has made risk-taking an integral part of Kelsey Millhone's character."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I BOUGHT THESE BOOKS FOR MY BROTHER IN LAW AND HE SAID H REALLY ENJOYED READING THEM"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone is hired by an ex-wife to investigate the disappearance of her former husband. The investigation into this disappearance pits past and current wives against one another, as well as the extended families involved. Dow Purcell, the missing man, has no known enemies and was generally well liked ,particularly by those at his office where he oversaw a very nice nursing care home. While this mystery begins the story, the most interesting part of the novel involves the two brothers Kinsey meets when she decides to rent office space from them in a nearby location. Who are these brothers? Where are they from? Who is investigating them? These questions form the fast paced second mystery in this Kinsey Millhone story. This is a great diversion novel, reads quickly and holds your attention easily. The ending is unexpected!!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I gave P is for Peril 3 stars because for most of the book, I found the story to be interesting. I do enjoy Kinsey. She herself is a unique character. The story, though slow in parts, was overall very readable. I would not call it spellbinding, but it could hold its own with other mysteries. There are two separate storylines and the one with the brothers is by far better. Nursing home fraud just doesn't have the pizzazz of a good old fashioned family murder.Unfortunately, there is the end of the book. I do realize that all stories must come to an end, but I really am tired of endings that are so out of sync with the rest of the story. In this book, we are taken through the plot lines rather carefully. Then at the end, the detailed plot stops, and the story is abruptly over. No real explanation, no post scripts, just &quot;the end&quot;. This is not the case of a story left hanging so that there can be a sequel, the narrrative just ends without a real tying up of the story threads.This slap-dash ending of stories has become way too common in recent books I have read. It really makes me wonder if these authors have commitments to write a book every X number of years and the time of publication gets near, so the ending of the book suffers. I just don't like to have invested my time in a novel and then feel like I have been short changed because of a unsatisfactory ending."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Sue Grafton is a good writer and Kinsey Milhone is still an interesting character, but the series seems to be losing its momentum. The title is somewhat misleading since there is very little peril or tension for the main characters. The insurance fraud subplot is a stretch: Kinsey is a PI, but she doesn't think to check the investigator's references or story? The ending seems rushed and doesn't really give a sense of why the killer acted as he/she did. It's a book that's a good summer diversion, but not fulfilling enough for Grafton/Kinsey fans."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I began following the adventures of Kinsey Millhone when _A Is for Alibi_ came out in 1982 and I've stuck with the series ever since. I'm not generally a fan of procedurals, but I make an exception for Grafton. By now, Kinsey is a fully realized personality -- as are her landlord, the octogenarian Henry, Rosie the Hungarian tavernkeeper, her acquaintances on the police force, and all the other repeating characters. This time, she has to unravel another missing persons case, the subject of the investigation being a prominent doctor (on his second wife, but she's been hired by the first wife) who seems to have been involved in a Medicare scam. And just to keep things interesting, there's a secondary plot involving two brothers from whom Kinsey is considering renting new office space -- which leads to a couple of fairly unnerving scenes. The plot develops logically and Grafton is adept at letting you (and Kinsey) stray off on dead-end paths. Nothing important was telegraphed -- not to me, anyway. My only real complaint is probably picky (except that I'm an editor, so it doesn't seem picky to me), and that's the poor job of editing from which the last few books in the series have suffered. For instance, though one of the supporting characters is named Harvey Broadus, when Kinsey finally meets him, he introduces himself as &quot;Harry&quot; Broadus. And the rear entrance to a building is consistently spelled as one word, &quot;backdoor.&quot; Very sloppy. But I'll forgive that for a really good story. Along about the middle of the alphabet, though, Grafton seemed to flag. &quot;L,&quot; &quot;M,&quot; and &quot;N,&quot; were pretty mediocre; in one of those, she used the verb &quot;to tuck&quot; about once every three pages, making me want to scream every time I read it. They also showed a lot of laziness in the research. (She obviously had never personally bothered to check out the area around Dallas!) So I was beginning to worry that the series might never be completed. But &quot;O&quot; was a great improvement, and I'm happy to say that &quot;P&quot; is the best one yet."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I was incredibly disappointed in this book. The writing style was not what I was used to in previous books. Gone was the light touch. Instead, the dialog seemed like something out of a grade B romance novel. The usually flowing and descriptive prose was flat and awkward. The humor that is so important to the character of Kinsey was nowhere to be felt. The only way I could finish the book was to pretend that I was reading a novel written by someone else with a character similar to Kinsey. Even then it was hard going. This book made me wonder if,in fact, Sue Grafton wasn't too busy to write it herself and just provided the outline of the plot and characters to someone much younger and less gifted to fill in the details. My advise to a new reader of Sue Grafton is to read all the other books of hers and forget this one exists. You'll love her that way."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Alright, I've seen commentaires posted on the Sue Grafton website, here on Amazon, and in other reviews about the ending, and I have to say that's it is quite interesting to see the reaction. I guess society has been dumbed down by having every single little detail tied up and explained with all but diagrams and pictures. The ending is not hard to figure out.And if you can't find the motive for the killer, well, that's maybe because you're overlooking the obvious one, and that no one really knows another's motives. That's what makes a mystery a mystery.I don't mean to sound obnoxious, and I'll try not to sound like an overbearing jerk with this review. But honestly, people, it's an ending that you have to infer for yourself. If you know that upfront, then you won't be surprised by the ending.This is one of the best books in the series, because it established mood perfectly, character development wonderfully, and balances an array of subplots to go with it. Only an experienced writer can do that.And for regulars of the series: this book is VERY DIFFERENT FROM PAST BOOKS! In fact, since &quot;N is for Noose,&quot; which also got undeserved criticism, Sue Grafton has turned out three books that are different, fantastic, and intriguing, showing signs that her series is just hitting its stridge, despite popular belief.Kinsey Millhone is the best written mystery protagonist of the late twentieth century (moving into the twenty-first) for the reason that with each book she grows and matures. Long-time fans refer to her as a real person. That takes talent.Kinsey is just as funny, insightful, and self-deprecating as usual in this book. I don't know why reviewers have missed the dry wit starting from page one. I won't give any plot pretexts away except to say that towards the end, there are (count 'em) four conclusions. That's right: four different plots and subplots conclude and end by the book's last page. There's a lot going on in this novel and it's easy to miss the high points and the clues.It's not a hard read compared to, oh let's say, &quot;Morality Play.&quot; But it's not Janet Evanovich or Robert B. Parker. These fine authors write mystery lite and are pretty good at it, although in recent books, they are recycling plot lines and twists with new book covers. But Sue Grafton has promised never to repeat a storyline and she hasn't. Kudos for her, because frankly, I won't pick up another Steven Wommack or Lawrence Block, because I know exactly what I'm going to get. With Grafton, I never know.This book is not for everyone. If you want a lazy summer read with no demands for thought, then don't read this book. If you want a spelled out conclusion right down to the very last word, then don't read this book. But if you want a mystery that's different, exciting, and utterly complicated, then &quot;P&quot; is just the story you're looking for.I am eagerly awaiting for &quot;Q&quot; and can't wait to see what Sue will surprise me with next."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This quite interesting book in Grafton's generally excellent series was fine until I got to the end of the kindle version.

Nevertheless, Kinsey accepts the job.It seems plausible that Dr. Purcell disappeared deliberately. Neither he nor his car have been found. His passport and $30,000 are missing. He has a history of previous unexplained disappearances. Pacific Meadows is in poor financial condition, and is being investigated for Medicare fraud. Moreover, his current wife--a beautiful former stripper named Crystal--may have been playing around on him.Yet, it is hard to believe that Purcell would run out on his infant son, of whom he is inordinately fond.The search for Purcell leads to Crystal, the current wife and former stripper, who is frantic with worry, yet convinced that Purcell is dead. It continues on to Leila, Crystal's rebellious daughter by a previous marriage, and Leila's kooky friends. It involves a mysterious and beautiful woman named Anica Blackburn, a hyper-fecund relative named Blanche, a nutty clairvoyant named Nancy, and a whole cast of southern California characters.Through it all, Kinsey is sustained by her friendship with her 86-year-old landlord, the good-hearted Henry Pitts. By dint of persistence and ingenuity, Kinsey solves the crime, and the accusatory finger points exactly where it should.This is Sue Grafton's best novel among those that I have read. The central crime is very logical and convincing.The best feature of this novel is the characterizations. Grafton has a keen eye for social scenes and human circumstances. She is a good observer of the southern California scene, from beautiful people--to office politics--to nursing homes--to upscale parties--to disaffected youth.P is for Peril is probably Grafton's closest approach to noir literature. In this novel, there is rot beneath nearly every beautiful surface, and under the ones that are not so beautiful. It is a study in the disharmony that afflicts marriages and families. And Kinsey Millhone's response to the murder, when she discovers its perpetrator, is payback in kind, unusually just and merciless.Another excellent feature is the protagonist Kinsey Millhone. Kinsey is interesting and attractive--and remarkably good at ferreting out the truth behind the explanations that people give for their behavior. Kinsey carefully examines stories that she is told, spots holes in them, and continues investigating until she learns the truth. This is brilliantly portrayed.If you have never read a Sue Grafton novel, start with this one!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This was the first Sue Grafton book read so I went in with an open mind. The writing is drawn out but the mystery is even worse, it seemed all over with nothing really tieing together. I kept waiting for some expose or conclusion. Then the 2 brothers seemed totally pointless. It seemed like they'd tie to the other crime.Maybe it's just because this was my first novel, I got annoyed when half through I realized it was set in 1986. Odd since it was written/published in 2001 and until then all references were as if the story was taking place today. That's her choice I just wish the time frame was specified at the beginning."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I always look forward to opening my new Grafton novel when thye appear in my local bookstore. Over the years, I feel as if I have come to know Kinsey as a friend, and can always expect a good yarn from her. P is for Peril seems to be two novels in one. The side story about the Hevener brothers and Kinsey's involvement in a real estate action, turns out to be far more entertaining than the main story itself. This being the case of Dowan Purcell, a local doctor missing from his community with a shady disappearance being likely. I found myself, wanting the information about the Purcell case to resolve itself, so icould get back to the real story, in my mind (the subplot). I think Grafton missed a golden opportunity to build a great tale around this instead of focusing on the dealings of a reputed shady medical facility. I work in the medical profession and was lucky enough to understand the terminology used throughout. I do think, however that someone new to this, will find themselves drowning in a sea of terms like HCFA or CPT coding respectively. The ending is also a big mistep in my opinion. Too cloudy for my taste and I suspect many other readers as well. All in all, a fun book, but not a caliber Millhone novel."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"My title makes as much sense as her ending! Although I have always enjoyed the Grafton ABC series, this was a huge disappointment! The ending is...........well, not there! And, although I do prefer to &quot;figure it out on my own&quot;, I seek that finality of conclusion that is lacking in this book. I truly believe that the publisher/printer has ommitted the final chapter!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This is a dark story. The characters are dark, the sky is dark, the plot is dark. The whole thing's dark and gray like the color of the cover. We know these people, or think we do. Thank you, Sue, for the wonderful character descriptions. I loved the book. It could have been one of the kooky lighter ones, like \\"G,\\" but Kinsey stepped out of the California sunshine for this one. It's harsh, sort of like \\"Fargo,\\" the movie, a combination of people and circumstances intertwining and playing off each other so there can be no good outcome. I understood the ending, but I won't spoil it for you. You could almost say, \\"The butler did it.\\""},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"P is for Peril is the another of Sue Grafton's quests to cover the entire alphabet with Kinsey Millhone mysteries. It's a very good mystery, but G is for Gumshoe still has to be my favorite!P is for Peril has Kinsey hired by a bitter ex-wife to try to find a missing doctor. Dr. Dowan Purcell disappeared leaving many unanswered questions and speculation of fraudulent Medicare claims at the nursing home he runs. There seem to be many questions and no answers, so it's Kinsey's job to try to find him and get those answers.Seems like a simple cookie-cutter type mystery plot, right? Not on your life! Throw in the current wife, a former stripper, with a teenage daughter whose sole purpose in life is to annoy adults and despise any and all authority. This current wife, Crystal, is rumored to be having an affair with her personal trainer. Then there's Crystal's ex-husband who still believes she's coming back to him.When Kinsey finds the good doctor's body, murder and not suicide is the outcome and these characters each have their own motives for wanting him dead. Even though she's off the case, Kinsey can't let it go and digs even deeper to find the identity of the killer. Seems like Kinsey Millhone has taken on some personality characteristics of Eve Dallas, of J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts) fame - one who \\"stands for the dead\\". Hmm, could Sue Grafton be a J.D. Robb fan?Where this novel falls short is the reader doesn't feel anything for these characters. Crystal fades in and out of witchiness (Epinions won't let me use the other word for this). Fiona (the ex-wife) is just a plain nut case and wants the status of being married to a doctor. Then there's stepdaughter who's spoiled rotten and needs military school instead of a fancy boarding school. And why is she like this? In my opinion it's because her mother can't be bothered, she even has a nanny for her toddler son, so she can sit on the deck and eat cheese and drink wine. Yep, life must be hard if you're an ex-stripper, married to a doctor and living the good life!A sub-plot has Kinsey looking for new office space and she meets a hunky landlord and his oddball brother. This could have been an entire book by itself if the story line was better developed. In fact, it might have been a very interesting tale with a bit more added. This entire sub-plot was rushed and the reader had to hurry to try to keep up. Then before you know it, it's over. Very anti-climatic to say the least!But the saddest part was when I read the last page and there wasn't the usual closure, \\"Respectfully submitted, Kinsey Millhone\\". Come on, Ms. Grafton, where's the ending we've all come to know and love? Instead we're given an Alfred Hitchcock type ending where the reader surmises what will happen. The ends aren't tied up in neat little bows that we expect when reading one of the Alphabet Mysteries. This change from tradition left me wanting the old style back. I want the \\"Respectfully submitted\\" back in the ending and not a guessing what happened type ending.Now don't get me wrong, P is for Peril is still a very good book and will have you guessing in several places. In my opinion, it's just not as wonderful as we've come to expect from Sue Grafton and her heroine, Kinsey Millhone. Leave the cutesy stuff for someone else!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Sue Grafton learned the alphabet well, and she also writes terrific mysteries. With P IS FOR PERIL, Ms. Grafton takes some chances. While the book seems on the surface to be a typical Kinsey Millhone story, Sue Grafton writes this book in peril. She tells a solid story about Kinsey being hired by a doctor's ex-wife, recommended to her by a long-ago client to find a missing person, the prominent doctor who has vanished without a trace. The story also involves a potentially dangerous near-romance for Kinsey, but Ms. Grafton's greatest risk of peril comes with her final plot twist. P IS FOR PERIL is an amazing mystery and that final twist is impressive."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Kinsey Milhone is hired to find missing doctor Dowan Purcell. In fact he's been missing for nine weeks but since there was no evidence of foul play the police have been treating it as a simple &quot;man who took off&quot; case. However Dr. Purcell's ex-wife isn't convinced and his current wife seems indifferent. But as Kinsey keeps digging she runs afoul of the brothers from hell.Unlike some other reviewers I didn't think this book differed too much from other Kinsey Milhone novels. They are always pretty light and breezy. They never tax you terribly. I persoanlly thought the sub-plot with the two brothers that Kinsey rents office space from might have been more interesting than the main plot, but that's just me. I have to admit that the book kind of ran out of steam the finish and the ending wasn't as satisfying as some. It was clever though. If you like Grafton you'll like this book."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I have always enjoyed Sue Graftons' Alphabet books, mysterious, intriguing, suspensful, and the endings left me satisfied. I felt there should of been more to the final chapter of this book. I was left sitting with questions, trying to figure out if my book had pages left out of it. Something was missing, the book ended, and I was still flipping pages for the neat little package, of loose ends and questions reeling in my mind. The book was fabulous, other than the drop off of the last chapter."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This is the first Sue Grafton novel that I have read. I was skeptical at first, but I grew to care not for Kinsey Millhone, but for many of the other characters in the book. Even the eventual murderer had some wonderful traits. The plot is well conceived, interesting and well-played out. It held my attention, but it did not make me want to run out and buy another Grafton novel. I read Koontz's &quot;From the Corner of His Eye&quot; previous to &quot;P&quot;, and the Koontz book is much more compelling. In conclusion, read this book, but borrow it from the library instead of buying it!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"P Is For Peril might as easily have been titled P Is For Perfect. Sue Grafton, ever dependable for grabbing readers with mysterious masterpieces that cannot be put down, has done it again with this fast paced romp. Kinsey Millhone more than has her hands full untying the knots of a well woven mystery envolving a wealthy doctor's disappearance, suspected fraud and embezzlement at the nursing home he managed, his financially strapped and high living ex-wife who hires Kinsey and the doctor's young wife, an ex-stripper with a history of unsavory romantic antics. The plot is well blended and spiced with just enough suspense to make your spine tingle and your palms sweat. Featuring a delicious subplot worthy of being more than just dessert, Kinsey uneasily enters into a romantic relationship with a mysterious, handsome younger man that puts her in genuine peril. Grafton serves up a buffet of well fleshed out characters and a well honed plot that keeps you guessing literally to the very last paragraph. I read this in one sitting, my hands glued to the cover. Sue Grafton gets better with every letter. The only downside to her exquisite mystery series is waiting for the next book."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I am surprised by some of the less than positive reviews of &quot;P is for Peril&quot;.

A surprise your &quot;stomach drops&quot; ending. Another winner in my book."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I love every other book about the alphabet series, but this book disappointed me. In fact, the last several books (say, from &quot;L&quot; on) have seemed too short and underdeveloped compared with earlier books. Like many other readers, I thought a lot had been left out. I figured out who did it and why as soon as she described these characters, and I think it would have been interesting if she had developed the lesbian relationship instead of alluding to it on the last page. A lot of other characters appeared and then disappeared, such as Dow's daughter Blanche. Why did Kinsey never consult the psychic? Why did she even interview Blanche? Why did Sue Grafton even write about it? Very weird, and I have to agree that this book seemed rushed and &quot;cranked out.&quot; Sue Grafton is very talented, and I hope she gets back on track, instead of simply describing peoples' appearance and home decor, as she seemed to do this time around."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Kinsey is still on target as the well woven individulist, who follows her own complex cloth. But, the story dropped a major stitch. - The peril was not due to Kinsey's mis-selection of a case for detecting, but the ordinary consequence of seeking a new office and the subsequent knowledge this action brings. After debating her options with Henry, her beloved landlord, Kinsey leaves her decision in doubt. So unknowningly, Henry puts himself into the &quot;peril&quot; and it is along this course that the chosing of peril SHOULD have been given more life and scare for both he and Kinsey. Additionally, a bit more NEW information of Kinsey's past/future is due all of her devoted fans. Grafton is too good to have pressed this jacket so shiney and thin. Maybe her stated decision to complete the alphabet in 18-month stints, rather than annually, is a decison well made.I await Q is for Quarry, because every at bat did not produce a home run, even for Sammy Sousa.

When I read books I have a movie of what I'm reading playing out in my head. When the climax came at the end I turned that page and the movie reel snagged. I re-read the last few pages and although I tried to guess at what the author was saying it would have been nicer if it was spelled out nice and neat for me. My brain works hard during the week and my book breaks are my vacation. No one likes to work during their vacation! I also didn't like having to guess at what the author was thinking.

You forgot to give the killer a motive.&quot; I will give Ms. Grafton credit on doing her homework about medical fraud and billing for Medicare.

The story of the missing physician Dow Purcell was fairly uninvolving. The people in his life were people you cared little about, and the solution, or lack of one, at the conclusion of the book is very puzzling. Although I think I understood what Kinsey &quot;was looking at all along&quot;, it surely could have had a much clearer ending. The secondary story line involving the Hevener brothers was far more interesting, and also left quite a few ends dangling. I expect Mariah Talbot to turn up in Q is for Quarry.

The main mystery revolves around Dr. Dowan Purcell, a doctor who has disappeared with suspicions of Medicare fraud hanging over his head. Suspects abound: Dowan's ex-wife, Dowan's current wife, the current wife's ex-husband, the daughters from the first marriage, the troubled stepdaughter, the delinquent friend of the stepdaughter, the second wife's trainer, the male nanny, the stepdaughter's guidance counselor, and all the folks who work or did work at the old folks home. Kinsey is being paid by the first wife, but as always, she works to solve the greater mystery. I enjoyed the book a lot, although it isn't as good as the best of this series. My biggest complaint revolves around the twist at the end of the story. Without giving away the ending, I need to say that the twist seems to play on a prejudice of a hopefully dwindling number of readers.

O is for Oh, my, goodness, please bring back Kinsey!P is for Presposterous!Sue evidently has followed the old Lawrence Sanders suit (he had some flunky named Vincent write drivel in Sanders' name) and left the writing to some underling whose voice in no way mirrors Grafton's witty, light and clever one.Goodbye, Sue. You lost a once-dedicated fan...."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I am surprised by some of the less than positive reviews of &quot;P is for Peril&quot;.

I liked the whole idea of Tommy Hevener (time for a new romance, younger guy, good chemistry) so the twist that Grafton adds to make him a bad guy was unexpected and added to the plot.I do agree with many of the other reviewers that the plotting of &quot;P&quot; is a little light and Kinsey isn't at her best when she's not really interested in what she is doing. I liked some of the new characters - particularly Anica &amp; Mariah Talbot (Sue G...perhaps a break to make one of them the heroine of a book not in the series?) I always appreciate more of Henry, but not enough of Sue's other usual regulars in the cast. Finally, I liked the guessing game you can play with the ending, although I'm a creature of habit &amp; missed the &quot;respectfully submitted...&quot; piece.Still looking forward to &quot;Q&quot; and glad that Grafton has kept Kinsey alive, well, and cynical as ever!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"If you told me this book was written by a Grafton wanna be, I'd believe it. I can't remember an alphabet book in which, when the murderer was revealed, I didn't say &quot;Oh, yes! NOW I remember that subtle clue.&quot; No clue here. I can't remember an alphabet book in which the ending didn't contain a muscle workout for Kinsey in a truly perilous situation. Not here. Further, part of the plot contains a very complex corporate structure involving fraud. The structure makes no sense whatsover to anyone who knows even the basics of business. This simply wasn't a good book. If it were &quot;A&quot;, there'd be no B."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Kinsey has an office she doesn't like anymore, she has a case she doesn't want, and her intuition is clearly on the fritz! She wanders around &amp; out-of-the-blue through-the-magic of an oh-so-convenient telescope sees what she really doesn't want to see. The body is found, her obnoxious client is clearly to blame. Another investigator tells her tale and she falls for it. She fights off the bad guys. She finds a bullethole with a name on it (only one person could have found &amp; fired that gun, she supposedly deduces?), she sees a hand placed on an arm, and VOILA she calls her ex-lover cop-buddy &amp; sits back for a glass of wine on a deck overlooking the surf with two of possibly five suspects (the others are all upstairs with the baby). She's so tired.Well, now I do believe that she's proved herself utterly stupid as well. Jacob probably arrives to find her out cold. That's where the end of this novel left me. But, then, I'm one of those unperceptive readers who can't see a subtle clue waved in my face, especially one with homophobic overtones. Grafton's off my hardcover list--her books can wait for the paperback. Better yet, just check it out from the local library."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Sue Grafton has been writing this alphabet series for a while now, and she's gotten good enough at it that when she's not in top form, she's still pretty good, and can get away with a bit. That's what happens here; the book's not that good, but Kinsey Millhone is fun anyway.In this installment, Kinsey's hired by a scorned ex-wife to look for her lost husband, who's not only abandoned her but disappeared some time later. The hubby has a new wife (a much younger ex-stripper), a nursing home he supervises that's in trouble, and various partners, co-workers, friends, and family. Kinsey must sort through all of this to figure out what happened to the good doctor, and once she figures that out, more questions abound.Meanwhile, Kinsey's also looking for new office space, and there's a handsome stranger offering to rent to her at a reasonable rate. This was the weakest part of the book to me. It seemed to read a bit like a Silhouette romance (not that I've ever read one, but this is how I imagine they would read) and be more than a bit predictable. The author did manage to pull off one surprise for you at the end of this. On the other hand, she left you wondering about something too.The whole book does that, a bit, and it's just a bit annoying. Grafton's gotten in the habit of doing this: not completely finishing her story, tying up all the loose ends. I'm sure she would tell us that life's like that, but this is fiction, not life. A good book, but a bit annoying."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This was a 5 star book, up until the last chapter. Oh how I was looking forward to the explanation behind all those sub-plots involving Dr Purcell's wives, family members and co-workers. Oh how dissappointed I was when Kinsey failed to find the bullet the first place she suspected. Oh how dissappointed I was when I was offered a weak explanation behind the killer's motive at the end. This book desparately needed an epilogue. The best part of the book was the second story line with Kinsey's new landlords, obviously patterned off the Menendez brothers. I knew everybody wasn't who they seemed to be, and I was pleased with the outcome of that part of the book. However, the main story left a huge hole in my imagination. Too many loose ends were hanging with not even an attempt of an explanation. For example, why all the hubbub from Fiona about Kinsey getting permission to talk to her daughter? Were all of Dow's business partners guilty of medicare fraud, or just one of them? How and why did Leila steal the money? These stories were building to what I thought was going to be a spectacular conclusion. I sense some frustration from Ms Grafton in the story, sense she didn't attempt the standard Millhone epilogue. I guess she cornered herself into such a tight box, there was no credible epilogue to attach the the mess."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Perhaps Grafton is tiring of the Alphabet series, Perhaps she has run out of ideas for Kinsey, Perhaps she forgot to finish this novel ( I, too, kept turning the page thinking there was more and wishing for a &quot;Respectfully Submitted&quot; ) Perhaps this is Grafton's new format of letting a confusing subplot overshadow the main plot. I don't know. It's not a horrible novel, it just isn't as grand as her others.And by the way, doesn't Kinsey have any damn friends that aren't over 80? I mean for God sakes, give this woman a friend already! Someone to have drinks with, someone to pal around with. Sheesh! Doesn't she get sick of hanging out with Henry, William and Rosie?Anyway, perhaps Grafton is throwing her readers for a loop and we are all missing a huge secretive thing that she has included without our knowledge. Perhaps we'll all grow to love this new style of writing. Perhaps not."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I just finished P is for Peril. It was entertaining (but I found myself skipping over unecessary details). I felt much more could have been made of the sub plot (the brothers). It really didn't add much to the story. My biggest complaint is the ending, if one can call it that. Yes, we know (spoiler) ....but are never told why. All the complicated goings on at the nursing home, characters that seemed guilty, just dissolved. I was left extremely dissappointed!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"As a loyal Grafton fan, I found her latest work somewhatvoid of the dry humor and difficult, at times, to followthe chararcters (which led to re-reading).

Considering she left everyone of her readers hanging on an abrupt assumption leaving us no choice to make up our own ending. This reader feels that makes all of us co-authors and entitles us to partial proceeds of the sale of this book. It's a good thing I am not Kinsey Millhone, because if I was, I would use my normally exceptional detective skills, hunt down Ms. Grafton and beat her with this book. Kinsey and the readers that love her deserved much better.

I eagerly started this novel, fully expecting to finish it in one day...it took me 3 weeks! As far as I could tell, Kinsey's &quot;breaks&quot; in the case came mostly from luck, the deductive reasoning of Sherlock was less apparent in this character than the bumbling of Watson. Too many story lines were introduced and none of them developed to their potential. Grafton has the beginnings of three great novels in this book, and an ending that says she had a deadline to meet. Because I'm an avid reader, I will give the &quot;A&quot; book a shot, but if you're a first time Grafton reader, DON'T START HERE!!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I think this is one of my least favorite Kinsey books.

Too many sub-plots that never really came together and the final chapter didn't even pull it together; left me with too many unanswered questions. In fact I wonder if possibly the publisher left out the final chapter. Grafton usually does a great job of tying up all the loose ends into a tidy conclusion. Not so this time!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"...Now on to the review:Kinsey Millhone is still stuck in the 1980s, living in Henry's garage and driving that beat-up Volkswagen POS, poisoning herself with Quarter Pounders with Cheese when she's not letting Rosie do it for her with her own unique brand of ethnic cuisine. The extended family Kinsey acquired a few letters ago isn't around this time to bother her (a good thing, since they got on my nerves), however in P is for Peril we're met via Kinsey with a new montage of characters guaranteed to grate one's nerves. A well-to-do doctor/administrator for a local nursing home goes missing, and Kinsey is hired by the man's first wife to determine whether or not his disappearance was of his own volition. Reluctuant to follow what she thinks is a cold trail (the guy's been gone for weeks, no witnesses), she grudgingly accepts anyway, knowing she'll hate herself later. Of course, we know if Kinsey says no there is no story, and it could be debated as to whether or not the reader hates Kinsey for saying yes.Peril offers little in the way of action as far as the mystery is concerned; the reader is treated instead to Kinsey describing in detail the backbiting animosity between the doctor's ex-wife and current wife, current wife's daughter from a previous relationship, doctor's harried employees and partners, etc. A subplot featuring Kinsey being stalked by a would-be landlord who may or may not have killed his parents is brought in obviously to pad the thin primary plot, which throbs like the headache we're sure Kinsey endured throughout this case.Peril is not badly written, nor is it a bad book. It is clearly not the best of the series; as a Grafton fan I had hoped to see Kinsey improve with age and tackle further cases with as much sardonic verve as she had in earlier outings. Recent titles like this (N is for Noose comes to mind) are disheartening to read, yet Kinsey is an endearing character, and hopefully when Q is for Quarry comes out she will be back to her old self."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I recently got interested in Sue Grafton a couple of weeks ago, I decided to read her book N Is For Noose and I was blown away by how good it was. Sue Grafton is a very descriptive writer and her story with Dr. Dowan Purcell is amazing, I recommend you listen to the Cassettes because Judy Kaye was an amazing choice to read this book she reads it so well you'll love it. I guarantee that you immediately run to your bookstore and pick it up either in the Hardcover or the Audio Cassette. I guarentee you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I have loved reading Sue Grafton and Patricia Cornwell. In Point of origin (Cornwell) she started to deviate from her normal m.o. Since then, it has been downhill with each novel.While I liked this novel, it also lacked in some common areas. Kinsey really didn't give a flip about her case. She didn't end with her usual report (but Fiona didn't really require one). So maybe we'll be okay. Pace is slow at times, some interesting things happen outside of her case. Overall, just a good book hoping the next one is better!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I like Kinsey. She's real and she's not afraid to say what she's thinking. I liked the double plots of the missing doctor and of the new office landlords. Kinsey is faced with figuring out whether the doctor is dead, missing by force, or has run away. I followed everything until the last page when we find out who did it, but not really why. The problem with the landlords happened and was resolved too quickly. The only real surprise was who the insurance investigator really was. I didn't feel that we got to know any of the characters as well as we have in past books. Yet, it's a good story and worth the read, it's just not quite up to her past few books."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Kinsey Millhone is hired to investigate the disappearance of nursing home executive Dr. Dowan Purcell by his ex-wife Fiona. He is married to a woman named Crystal at the time of his disappearance. Kinsey investigates several motives, including some shady financial dealings at his work and an unhappy marriage. A second plot revolves around Kinsey's plans to rent office space from two brothers, who are hiding a grisly secret. The search for Dr. Purcell occupies most of the book, and Kinsey finds a lot of dead ends as she investigates his family and business connections. The relationship with the two brothers is more suspenseful but that subplot ends in a rather [bad] and unsatisfying manner. The solution to the disappearance of Dr. Purcell moves very slowly until the end, when Kinsey has a sudden revelation, seemingly something she had not considered during her investigation. Though not the best book of the series, this one is still a good read."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I enjoyed the audio tape of the book and am a great fan of Kinsey Milhone! She's easy to understand and her adventures and activites are not too difficult to follow. Grafton is a wonderful author for readers beginning to explore the mystery genre. This was not the most interesting adventure for Kinsey, but it was worth listening to and it held my interest while I was driving on a long trip.Evelyn Horan - children's authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book OneJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book Two"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"What Grafton seems to have here is enough material for two Kinsey short stories, with some walk-ons from her supporting cast. Neither of the two cases is particularly engaging, and Kinsey herself doesn't seem to learn or grow this time out, and we don't really learn anything about her that we don't already know.Grafton can still outwrite most of the detective writers around with one hand behind her back, but this outing is definitely a bit shorter on spark than the usual."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This latest entry in the Kinsey Milhone series is a good mystery; while not compellingly great, it is definitely a pleasure for any fan of the series.In this case, the \\"Peril\\" that Kinsey faces has little to do with the murder mystery she is investigating. Instead, it deals with a major subplot involving two brothers who have killed their parents and now have become involved with her life. The fact that there are two separate storylines is a bit of a distraction, even if both stories are interesting.This series is reminiscent of earlier private eye novels such as Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer books in which the private eye/narrator is essentially a noncharacter who observes the soap opera-like lives of the other characters. Yes, Kinsey does have a life, but not much of one, and that's fine. It makes this series more like the classic hardboiled mysteries of yesteryear, and that's a good thing."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I have been reading sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone series since I was twelve (I'm 25) and have never been dissapointed in one of the books until now. Unlike other reviewers I don't want a refund. I found the story to be engaging (I couldn't put the book down) for the most part, until it started coming to the end. I couldn't figure out why Kinsey had ended up in places, or what the purpose of some visits were. There also seemed to be some detachment from the subject; as you know Kinsey often has a rapid internal monologue that ties things together by leaps and bounds. In this book Kinsey seemed bored herself with the investigation, it seemed she was frustrated and giving a half-hearted attempt at solving the crime. Although I am dissapointed with this book, I am giving it three stars because every author has an off year. I can only hope that the next in the series will be as good as the previous ones. So, I am going to read the book over again (it has been several months since I had first read it) and perhaps the second time around I will pick up clues that I missed."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This was a very disappointing novel from Sue Grafton. In addition to being very wordy (is she paid by the page?), Kinsey Milhone is quite dislikable.

I kept forgetting I was reading a Kinsey book. It was not like her others, which I have read, at all. In a way it was kind of boring. And the ending was weird. I have no idea who the killer was. She did not say. I will look forward &amp; buy her next book but this one just does not rank up there with the others. I totally agree with the first few reviews."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"A mystery hound, I go through two or three each week, buying most of them in paperback lest I blow the rent money on my book habit. I make an exception for a handful of favorite authors and series, including, until now, Sue Grafton's alphabet murder series. I should have waited for the paperback. P is for Peril drags, the plot limping along, bogged down amid lots of tedious health industry terminology. The wit that characterized earlier books in the series has gone flat as well. As others have noted, the book ends abruptly; it left me with the sense that perhaps the publisher was clamoring for a draft, with the whole project uninspired and behind schedule. Perhaps Ms. Grafton has hit a mid-alphabet slump. In any event, I am not going to be quick to throw the hardcover Q is for Quarry in my cart."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Perhaps Grafton is trying to make Kinsey Millhone seem more human by sharing the endless little details of her life with the reader. It isn't working for me. Do we really need to know Kinsey stops in the ladies room before keeping an appointment with an acquaintance of the missing man? Or the minute details of her exercise routine? There was, what seemed to be, a jarring inconsistency early on when Kinsey visits the home of Joel Glazer. \\"Shafts of sunlight formed geometric patterns on the smooth tile floor\\". The day had been described as dark and rainy before and after the visit. I realize the sun sometimes breaks through on a cloudy day, but that was not the impression that was given. Despite the tedious details and inconsistencies, I wanted to learn what had happened to Dr. Purcell and that kept me turning the pages. I was rewarded with more action and fewer details in the second half of the book. Unlike a few other reviewers here, I thought the ending was neat, tidy and satisfying. This wasn't one of Grafton's best efforts, but it was not her worst either."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Having read all the books in the series, I must say this is my least favorite. I read it on my iPad and when I got to the end of the story (or lack thereof) I thought it was a technical glitch. After a bit of googling, it turns out there is no conclusion, no final summary from Kinsey, etc. The reader was left to figure it out for themselves (which was not difficult).Interesting literary technique, but had no value add in this case."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I listened to this story on unabridged audio and the ending was so lacking, I honestly looked to see if there was a tape I had yet to listen to.The author goes into such extreme details as to tell the reader that the character used the restroom, (like I care, like it has any bearing at all on the story), but then ends the story abruptly, without details or any real explanation at all.Thank goodness, it was only $1 at the used book store (I can see why). Give me Nevada Barr or Elizabeth Peters any day over Grafton."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I have been reading all the alphabet mysteries and thoroughly enjoyed them. P is for Peril is no different. The ending has no epilogue as others have had and I enjoy figuring out for myself what Kinsey finally figured out. The flirtation with the landlord was fun to read about and the results very surprising. I love the way Sue Grafton writes, although sometimes at the end the descriptions get tiring when I want to know WHO DUN IT? I look forward to reading Q is for Quarry and then what's next?

But only untill I got to the very last sentence; is a chapter missing? Up to O, Sue Grafton has ended her Kinsey mysteries with an epilogue, concluding with the words: &quot;respectfully submitted, Kinsey Millhone&quot;. In the paperback edition, there is no such conclusion and I must admit I still don't know who the killer is. I figured maybe it was an author's trick, like a weird teaser. I hope it is and that she will give us some clue in Q."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"The plot of the story did not unfold basically until the end. I would have put the book down after the first couple of chapters but I wanted to complete it since I spent my money on it and now I want a refund. This was a terrible mystery!!!! actually it was not a mystery it was a very descriptive story big on detail and very wordy no action, drama, or suspense. It was a waste of my time. This was the first book I read by this author and I will not torture myself by reading another one."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Well, as far as books go this was not really that bad of a read. It just didn't grab me and not let go as most of Grafton's works have. As usual I very much enjoyed the Kinsey Millhone character. In fact I wish she were a real person so I might meet her some day. But the overall plot and especially the ending just didn't do it for me. The first few pages held some promise. Missing doctor; ex wife hires kinsey; young current wife seems indifferent; teenage daughter is out of control...so what else is new? You get the idea. Kind of intresting, but it just bogs down and just seems too contrived for a SG alphabet mystery tome. Again, I must remind you to keep this less than flattering review in perspective. Because Sue has done better, P is for poor."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This book was very disappointing. If you are considering purchasing it I would reccommend that you &quot;Pass&quot; on this one. Though I like Kinsey, this story feels old and tired. Not strong in the mystery department, and no interestering characters."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I borrowed the title of my review from the ending of the book because I found it so frustrating! I admit it, I'm not as smart as Kinsey. And her statement about looking at suspects and suddenly realizing what she'd been looking at all along was just too cryptic for me. Yes, I figured out who did it. But Kinsey seemed to have realized at that critical moment WHY the deed was done, and I wish she'd explained that insight.Still, I enjoyed this &quot;letter,&quot; as I've enjoyed every entry in the series. I didn't feel much sympathy for Fiona, but I liked that Kinsey was forced (by economic realities) to continue working for someone she didn't especially care for. It made her seem more an Everywoman. I didn't find the details about medical billing too hard to follow (and, as I established above, I'm not the brightest Kinsey fan), so don't let that scare you off. I was intrigued by the scare-your-socks-off subplot about her new office. And I thought her on-going relationship with Jonah Robb was realistically portrayed.But that ending! One of Kinsey's trademarked &quot;submitted by&quot; endings is definitely needed here!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"WARNING: The following post contains plot spoilers, so if you haven't read the book, you may not want to read any more of this post.I picked up the hard cover of P is Peril last week with great anticipation. I love Grafton's work and until this very moment have enjoyed reading every word she's ever penned.To be honest, I did enjoy her prose and Kinsey remains an interesting character. Also, the first three quarters of the book was excellent but the ending left me completely flat.This is true for both the plot and the sub plot. With the main plot, we're not even really sure it's a murder until the book is almost over, and the page chapter devoted to the time lag between the discovery of the car and the confirmation of the body was as much fun as dental surgery with no real pay-off. That it was the good doctor and that he was murdered was the least surprising of ALL the possibilities and therefore did not merit the page after page discussion of waiting. Waitining for the police, wiating in her car, waiting in her apartment, waiting for the coroner, etc....And then there's the who-done-it part. Even Kinsey gets it wrong until the last minute until she looks for and finds the key clue that settles the whole thing. The whole Medicare bit turns into one huge, boring, red herring.Okay, onto the Texas twins. I knew from the first page that the other PI was a phoney -- Kinsey is smart enough to check her out. And that too was resolved too quickly with no set-up. THe brother that was going to kill her in the first place commits murder in front of her and then just walks away? When did he take a stupid pill? Why doesn't he at least TRY to silence the only witness? He's already killed at least twice (and likely a thrid time), so I don't think he had an attack of conscious.Anyway, the set up was great, but I was completely unhappy with the pay-offs. I'm still a Grafton fan and am expecting better next time."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I am a dedicated Sue Grafton fan having read all of her alphabet mysteries. After what I thought was an excellent rebound back into gripping engaging murder stories starring Kinsey Millhone with &quot;N&quot; and &quot;O&quot;, I bought &quot;P&quot; thinking Grafton would continue her success. I was wrong.I think I started to read this book and then put it down from boredom about five times. The case and the characters simply were not interesting. Grafton does not seem to be fully invested or committed to the passions and motivations of the characters, the plot, or the story. There is no life in either of the two plots. Kinsey is searching for Dr. Purcell who has been missing for nine weeks. The police have already done some investigating, but the doctor's ex hires Kinsey. Kinsey seems to be following the same trail of the police, which is now cold, and not turning up anything new in the investigation to keep the reader engaged. It's only after page 200, and after numerous sighs of impatience, that something breaks in the case and the reader has something interesting to read.In the other plot, Kinsey finds a new office space and a new potential love interest, but those events seem half-heartedly written by Grafton. It's only around page 150 that the second plot becomes somewhat interesting, although right from the start it smells fishy (as other reviewers have pointed out) but not to Kinsey Millhone, P.I.The ending was a bit of a shock. You have 15 novels ending with &quot;Respectfully Submitted&quot;, and all the plot threads resolved and explained, you expect the 16th to end the same way. The final clue that led Kinsey to the murderer was grotesque. After Kinsey more or less stumbled on this clue, I immediately balked at the thought that the police were so incompetent that they had not found this clue in their investigation themselves. However, finally all the threads are more or less explained, although I didn't quite understand the final thread about why Dr. Purcell was murdered. I intended to read the final chapter again to work it out, but then I realized that I didn't care! I didn't care about Fiona and Crystal and their squabbles. I didn't care about Dr. Purcell's problems with his nursing home. I didn't care about Crystal's daughter Leila and her adolescent tantrums. I didn't really care about Kinsey or her romantic infatuations. And, to be honest, I don't think Grafton really cared too much about this book either. There doesn't seem to be the same gusto and love for the cases and the Millhone character that readers enjoyed early in the series. Perhaps Grafton's departure from her usual endings was an attempt to bring some life into the series. I think all it did was leave a lot of her readers alienated and confused. If you are going to try something different, at least do it well. Perhaps Grafton should try Kinsey investigating a crime outside of Santa Teresa, or try a new series altogether, perhaps starring Dietz. In any case, &quot;P is for Peril&quot;, the worst of the series so far, has provoked me to wait for the reviews and the paperback version of &quot;Q&quot; to decide whether I should continue reading the series."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Too many characters. Too many companies. Unrelated sub-story.A completely stupid ending. I am so glad I got this from the library instead of buying it. Grafton is cranking these out so fast now she doesn't realizing how bad this one is."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Ms. Grafton's use of epilogues to resolve issues is a trademark that is sorely missed in this book. When I finished the book, I was left unfulfilled. The two main plots never intersect (there are actually several other subplots regarding the relationship between Dow and his family members). I was left with numerous questions such as Dow's relationship with his employers and their relationship with crime, and Krystal's daughter and her relationship with Dow and his money. While I can guess at most of the main points, I would appreciate not having to guess. Please tell Ms. Grafton to go back to epilogues. In fact, I would love to have one posted to her website even now.I also found Kinsey's relationship with Dow's first wife totally unrealistic when Kinsey was hired by Dow's second wife.Like others, I enjoy Ms. Grafton's style and wit. But this is surely her worst of the alphabet series."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I loved P is for Peril, but then I love Grafton and apart from one or two of her books I rate them all at 5. I just love Kinsey as a detective, and I love the smallness of the world she inhabits. In Kinsey's latest mystery she has quite a complex crime to solve. Complex and seemingly impossible.She is asked by the ex-wife of a missing doctor (Dow Purcell) to track him down. He disappeared a couple of months beforehand and there has been no trace of him since. It seems the trail has run cold and even at the time there were very few clues to aid police. Kinsey isn't sure she wants to take it. The client is, quite frankly, a bitch and she doesn't think she can shed much more light on the case that has been picked over by the police.At the same time Kinsey is searching for new office space as she is starting to feel claustrophobic sharing quarters with Lonnie Kingman. Her search leads her to a small building almost right next door to her and the Hevener brothers from Texas. Unfortunately that leads her right into another case of murder which is something to close and personal for her to want to get involved in. She gets dragged in regardless.The main case of the Missing Doctor Purcell is really what this book is about. As usual there are plenty of suspects and plenty of confusion - why did Doctor Purcell's first wife bring in a detective, and not his second wife to whom he was currently married when he disappeared?, What possible financial shenanigans have been going on at Dr Purcell's business, Pacific Meadows, and was that why he disappeared? There are reasons to suspect just about everyone in the case and very good reasons too. In fact even up until the last couple of pages I was still suspecting the wrong people.Certainly there is some ambiguity in the final pages, it is not a straight forward Kinsey Millhone ending with 'respectfully yours' written at the end. I am not sure why this one is so different in its ending. But the criminals are clear and the intent is also if you read back through the pages - especially through the previous 10 or pages. I guess Grafton could have made that a little clearer but I loved the book anyway and am still very much looking forward to Q is for Quarry coming out."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I was recently in a Borders books when Ms. Grafton was speaking and picked up her book to commemorate the event. My mother read the book first and then forced me to read it (which is only fair since I forced her to read Janet Evanovich's series).Kinsey's capers in this newest Grafton are light and entertaining. It's not a novel that's going tax your brain or cause you to pull out the notecards to keep things straight but it will keep you guessing. Grafton is good reading for those lazy rainy days or for times when you want to unwind. Funny, humorous, and entertaining.Kinsey's hot on the trail of a missing doctor hired by his ex wife no less. The old harridan is making Kinsey regret her hasty acceptance of the hefty money but that's not the only complication Ms. Milhone is going to have to face before she can take this one off the books. Grafton will keep you guessing. Don't be surprised if you like the killer more than the client."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I enjoyed P is for Peril. It was a quick read (I went through it in about 2 sittings) and it kept me guessing. I definitely liked it better than O is for Outlaw, but I rank this installment somewhat below the others in the series because it didn't really tell me anything new about Kinsey or any of the other recurring characters in the series. I liked the subplot about the twin brother-murderers, but the way they were written out at the end was a bit far fetched. After O is for Outlaw, I wasn't sure I would continue with the series, but this one put me back on track to anxiously await Q is for Quarry (and hopefully more character development)."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I agree with most of the critisms others have posted about P is for Peril(the ending is vague, I'm not sure of the killer's motives,the book is padded with endless desciptions of rooms, and Kinsey seemed to discover clues as if she were pyshic) However, this book is not as bad as they would have you believe. The subplot with the Hevenger brothers is the more exiting and menacing part of the book. Fiona is a great character. (She should have been in it more) I laughed out loud when Kinsey was hiding under the desk in the nursing home. While I agree it is not the best in the series, I will still be buying Ms. Grafton's next novel in hardcover. Respectfully Submitted Don"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I think P is for Peril is a wonderful read, and it shows Grafton's resurgance continuing after the disappointment of L, M and N. The two stories in P are both wonderful though I sometimes found the Haveners to be a little more interesting than the Purcells, but all in all, P is for Peril is a great addition to the Alphabet series.Also, while it did end a little abruptly, I realized quickly that the ending is a beginning for Q. My clue? If you read the blurb on the jacket about Sue, you will notice that she has already picked a title, Q is for Quarry, and to my recollection she has never ever revealed the title to the next book this early. This leads me to believe that she found a good place to end P, and the lack of a total ending means that she is continuing on to Q."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"In the beginning, I thought this was the best novel that Sue Grafton had ever written. There was a great plot, numerous twist and turns and just enjoyable reading. Then the end of the book came and what a disappointment. It was confusing and left you feeling that you had just wasted your time reading the book."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Late in this book, Grafton's detective, Kinsey Millhone, describes herself as \\"Philip Marlowe in drag.\\" She could equally well have said Sam Spade.These books are not intended to set elegant puzzles. Their function is to walk us around Southern California while providing dry observations we readers wish we'd had the wit to articulate ourselves. It rings wonderfully true, for example, when Kinsey describes a neighborhood as looking as though it had been hit by an explosion at a Toys \`R Us store. The mystery is simply the vehicle by which Grafton maneuvers Kinsey into situations in which her comments lead us, however briefly, to look at our world and its inhabitants it in a slightly different light. Measured by that yardstick, this book is as successful as any in the series-at least as reliable as Kinsey's much-loved VW Beetle.Like the Beetle, these books are also period pieces. Grafton started writing them in the 1980s, but real-world time has progressed about five times faster than \\"Kinsey time.\\" This book is set in 1986, an era that an increasing number of people don't recall accurately. Kinsey can't call for help on a cell phone, for example, because cell phones didn't exist. For the same reason, she can't speed her detective work with web searches.Grafton has always downplayed the differences between Kinsey's era and the present, but the time may have come to reverse that approach. By 1986, Kinsey could be writing her reports on a computer. Fax machines are looming, and modems were moving from 300 baud to the incredibly fast speeds of 1200 or 2,400 baud. It might be interesting for future books to have Kinsey struggle with the degree to which to \\"modernize\\" with technology that today looks unbelievable clunky.Meanwhile, this is a good book. Sure, the ending is abrupt, but all of Grafton's endings are abrupt. The killer is clear, the motive is clear, and Grafton's quick endings leave room for wry imaginings of how Kinsey manages to clean up the messes in which she inevitably lands.Bottom line: this is a solid addition to the series-although I do wonder if 1980s California can provide enough cultural observations to support enough books to fill out the rest of the alphabet."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I am an avid Kinsey Millhone fan, and was anxious to get my hands on this lastest installment to the series. However, I found this one very disappointing. The plot was an overly used one with characters that weren't developed or explained thoroughly enough. Throughout the book, I kept waiting to find out why things that had been emphasized were key to the story, but it just never happened.I thought the subplot with the two brothers had much more potential. Developing that storyline would have been far more interesting.The old Kinsey just didn't quite come through here. She didn't have that edge that makes her so interesting. I've always enjoyed the way she thinks and operates. This seemed to be just a shadow of her former self.I was willing to forgive all of this just because I do adore the series, but I was left cold with the ending. Grafton has always been a master at pulling it together in a way that even if she hadn't thoroughly spelled out the way things were, there wasn't any confusion as to what happened. That was not the case here. I read the last 25 pages twice to see if I missed something, but I have more questions than is comfortable for a mystery novel. There was just too much left unsaid and unexplained which I found extremely frustrating.By far, my least favorite."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I've read every one of Sue Grafton's alphabet series. P is for Peril is up to her standards in every way but one - the ending. Each book in the series ends with an epilogue that wraps up the loose ends - each book but this one. When I finished, I looked for the epilogue to clarify the central question: Who did it and why? I then re-read parts of the story looking for additional clues. The problem is, I can come up with a number of different answers to the central question. Did Ms. Grafton want to keep us guessing? Am I missing something? What's up?"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"While Sue Grafton's writing style sparkles, as usual, with wit and vivid description, I couldn't help but think that the author should have kept on writing until she actually finished the book. The book contains a plot and a major subplot, and neither one is brought to a satisfactory resolution. Questions remain unanswered, loose ends are not entirely tied up. In fact it occured to me, some time after I read the final page, that heroine Kinsey Millhone had not actually told us the identity of the killer or the motive! Perhaps Grafton is being avant-garde; like many of her other fans, though, I would have appreciated a closing note &quot;Respectfully submitted.&quot;"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I have read all of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone books and, in spite of what I am about to say in this review, I will continue to read them through to 'Z' if they go that far (I just will not be buying hardbacks for the foreseeable future). Generally, I have enjoyed Grafton's writing style; her places, scenes and people are so alive, most especially Kinsey who is so well drawn that I find my self thinking of her as real.So it was with great anticipation that on June 4 of last year - on my way to the airport and vacation - I was at the bookstore when it opened for business. I was lucky enough to get a signed copy, my first Grafton hardback. The read I had so looked forward to while sitting on the beach was a huge disappointment.This book is a dud. It lacks memorable plot, interesting people, or character development; it is poorly written and boring. I barely got through it and kept putting it aside for other reading matter.Peril has two main stories, one with many branches, one more straightforward. The latter is more typical of Grafton/Milhone and is the more interesting but plays a much smaller part. The main plot is filled with serendipity, red herrings, and dead ends. Neither were as good as plots from past works such as Lawless and Killer.I do not actually read Grafton's books for the plots: I enjoy them as I go along, I expect them to be interesting enough to maintain my curiosity, and five minutes later I have forgotten them. I read mostly for character development, for snappy dialog, for Kinsey's observations on life and everything else. I re-read them periodically just for the enjoyment of experiencing Kinsey's wit and snappy comebacks. I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that Peril is two rewrites and an edit short of being ready for publication. Where was the editor on this book?The plots, such as they are, are worsened by the amount of filler in this book. It is just not like the Kinsey I know to spend so much time thinking about furnishings and what people are wearing. I lost count, too, of how many times Kinsey took off her slicker, hung her slicker on a peg, put her umbrella in a corner, put her slicker on, etc., etc. Trips in an out of Horton Ravine - countless numbers of them - are described over and over. All of the people in the book are outstandingly forgettable. Grafton's books always have filler - and it is usually some of the most interesting stuff. Not in Peril. Mostly I miss the humor.The filler was made even more annoying by the writing. A good deal of the sentence structure in Peril just does not seem like Grafton, being simplistic, rhythmic, and irritating, lacking her usual wit, sarcasm, and pithy views presented through Kinsey.There is a new Kinsey in Peril - whether purposefully or not only time will tell. The new Kinsey is wishy-washy and wimpy. The old Kinsey is adventurous, takes risks, and is generally unafraid. She often puts herself unnecessarily in danger, not calling for help, setting out in the middle of the night to track someone down, going alone when she could ask for help. She is a loner and, as Henry has noted, she usually \\"acts first, thinks later.\\"Kinsey takes the case in Peril against her own better judgement. She is manipulated into danger by others that she would normally be suspicious of on first meeting. She does ask for help but not in the way you might expect. For example, when Henry finds an ad for a new office and advises Kinsey to check it out, the dialog goes like this: Henry - \\"it won't hurt to call.\\" Kinsey - \\"you really think so?\\" Henry - \\"Of course.\\" Kinsey - What if it's rented?.\\" For crying out loud; the Kinsey I know would not say these things. She might pooh pooh the idea, or just go do it, but she wold not normally ask twice for reassurance; she never asks for reassurance, she rushes headlong into action.Kinsey is a character not yet fully explored, I feel, and Peril does not move the exploration forward one bit. Something needs to happen to snap her out of her comfort zone. As in real life, she sometimes surprises, sometimes disappoints. Outlaw seemed to open the door to some personal growth and Peril slammed it shut again, along with the other \\"doors\\" of Dietz and what is left of her family. After 19 years and 15 books, she is still telling the same old story. I still love her because she reminds me of me.Peril gives me the feeling that Grafton has run out of ideas for the series and that she is unwilling to introduce changes in Kinsey that might liven it. There have been signs of staleness in past books, notably Malice. I had high hopes after Outlaw, one of the best in the series. In that book, Kinsey was forced to confront some mistakes in her past and she makes reparations for them. It was a hopeful sign that has apparently been dropped.Change is needed, though, to keep this series interesting and fresh. It must be very difficult to write a continuing series, especially one in which the author has decided to keep the characters in an older time period. The author is trapped, Kinsey is trapped.The other day I heard a former Vietnam POW say \\"Few people are called on to use what they really have.\\" We do not know what Kinsey really has, nor Sue Grafton. Peril is a great disappointment and I have high hopes that 'Q' will shake things up. I have a secret hope that Grafton is up to something with Peril, leading us into to it, that Kinsey really is in peril and will work her way out of it."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I am embarrassed to say, \\" 'P' is for Peril\\" is the first of the alphabet series I have read by Ms. Grafton. I enjoyed it so much, the day after I finished reading it, I went right out and picked up a copy of \\"K\\" is for Killer; and I must say, I enjoyed it equally as well. I hope that by early spring, I know as much about the Kinsey Millhone investigations as Sue Grafton.Ms. Grafton has successfully blended all the ingredients together for a first rate novel. The story is fast paced and has a suspenseful plot. Ms. Grafton's character development is outstanding too. Kinsey Millhone does not do triple reverse sommersaults and karate six men twice her size to death. She does not work for free and she is not anal retentive about stretching the truth when it suits her purpose. She is a quick wit and a skilled investigator; an extremely believable character.I'm not an easy sell either. I'm a retired lieutenant with the Chicago Police Department. I spent ten of those years in homicide, ten more in narcotics. I know what rings true in police investigations and I know what Private Investigators can and cannot do. Consequently, I was unable to watch \\"Columbo\\" and a host of other like shows; nor can I read novels that stink to the high heavens. Ms. Grafton's books are a breath of fresh air and a great find for me."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"If P is for Peril, it is also for pair - a pair of wives (current and past), a brotherly duo, several pairs of friends, a pair of daughters, a pair of policemen, a pair of business partners, and a pair of plots (as well as a pair of Saucony trainers). The eternally 30ish Kinsey zips along in her VW in a rainy and cold California November, searching for a missing husband as well as a new office space. While attempting to untangle a myriad of complications, Kinsey finds herself personally indulging in peril. Grafton's writing had me smiling once again - I just ADORE Kinsey and her smart mouth and some of her more anti-social ways. And I covet that tidy apartment, her neighbor Henry and the black dress - but I might skip dinner at Rosie's. Grafton delivers a wonderful flash-back Kinsey tale, a convoluted crime, numerous surprisingly despicable characters, and a taste of California that isn't all sunshine and surf. Set in the 80s, this latest story also illustrates just how much computers and cell phones have changed our lives."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"** Contains spoilers **Like many other reviewers, I see a number of faults in the book. There are a number of unexplained actions and unresolved plot threads. The person who kills Purcell has probably the least reason of any character to do so. The motivations and actions of Paulie and Leila are unexplained. Did Leila take Purcell's money? If so, what happened to it? Why would Richard's killer throw down his gun, leaving witness Kinsey to report him?Why would the police not conduct the same easy-and-obvious search at Purcell's wife's home, as they did at his ex-wife's home? Is the reader expected to believe that a passing and casual lesbian relationship would provide motivation to kill your sugar daddy husband? Would Kinsey really take as indisputable truth the speculative newspaper innuendo about the brothers' past? (Surely she knows that what's reported in the papers and what really happened are often quite different.)Finally, why would Kinsey, having found proof of who committed the murder, walk up to the murderer's home and ask to use the phone to call the cops? There were no other phones in town?There are a few other bloopers too: an insurance company which lost a suit compelling it to pay a death policy could not file another suit to relitigate the same issues; nor would it be proper to ask the applicant's marital status on a commercial lease application in California.Further, of the five Spanish words Grafton uses in the book, she manages to get them ALL wrong. The road called \\"Via Bueno\\" would be \\"Via Buena\\" (no '&iacute;' on street signs), and would mean \\"Good Road\\" instead of \\"Road Good\\" as Grafton writes. Kinsey reports \\"I took Spanish in adult education, but I've forgotten everything except 'ola' [hola] and 'buenos dios.'\\" The phrase is \\"buenos d&iacute;as,\\" not \\"buenos dios.\\" Grafton's trying to write the common phrase meaning \\"good morning,\\" but the phrase she comes out with means something like \\"good god.\\" Sheesh.Grafton has not taken a plunge as deep as Tom Clancy has with his most recent book. However, sloppy proofreading and poor fact-checking, along with illogical plot development well below her usual standards, suggest that Grafton is intentionally producing a poor product. This is not \\"requiring readers to use their imaginations\\"; it is assuming that readers will accept any type of unfinished ramblings as a book worth reading."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I really usually enjoy Grafton's book. This one left me flummoxed! Grafton is definitely one of our better writers of the female detective genre in the U.S. I prefer her books to some others I could name, mainly because she is an intelligent writer. However, like many of these 'series' that get started with the best of intentions, this particular one is losing steam...I commisserate with Grafton's probable frustration at having cornered herself into writing a series of mysteries from A to Z. It must be difficult to come up with original ideas after a period of time.However, that really did not seem to be the problem here. The book was slow in starting, but then seemed to be chugging along just fine. I kept looking at the remaining pages left for me to read as they got smaller and smaller with no obvious 'end' in sight. So when Grafton literally ended with a phone call, and no real obvious conclusion (no one was arrested, no one confronted except the wrong person, etc.)...well, I went backwards through several pages and chapters to see if I had missed something. I know I read fast especially when it comes to books I pick up for pure enjoyment, but I didn't think I read it that fast! Not only was the main crime not solved to my satisfaction, but the side story dealing with Kinsey's involvement with a couple of sleazy brothers was never solved either.This is not to discourage anyone from reading Grafton's books...she is, as I have said, an intelligent author, and she doesn't dummy down her books for her audience (which makes me cringe). But this time, she lost me at the very end...I know it wasn't just me, because some of the other reviewers said the same thing.Karen Sadler"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Until i read the reviews on amazon.com, i thought i had purchased a defective book, i even went as far as returning to the book store that i purchased it from to look through all the other &quot;P&quot; is for Perils to see if pages were missing!!!!! i am a huge sue grafton and kinsey milhone fan, but i was major dissapointed in this book. i brought this book on vacation with me because i wanted a &quot;light&quot; and enjoyable read, and i got it until the ending.

They are quick reads, each giving me a better sense of who Kinsey is and I love the way all mysteries are solved by the end of the book. This one falls short of my expectation for wrapping up the mystery into a nice neat package at the end. I felt like I was missing a chapter...All in all, the book was good. The main plot is about Kinsey trying to determine what happened to a doctor who has been missing for nine weeks. She discovers the doctor has quite a few dilemmas in his life - one ex-wife who seems to have never gotten over him, new wife and child who require a lot of his time, a sticky situation at the hospital he manages and friends who make better enemies. In addition, Kinsey is loosing her office space and needs to find another office. She happens upon a great little office, perfect locations, completely remodeled, and reasonably priced - almost too good to be true. Well, it is! This scenario provides the back drop for another plot - two brothers from Texas who are accused of murdering their parents. Grafton does a good job of weaving the two plots effortlessly through the book. I felt like the second plot (with the two brothers) was presented and closed out better than the main plot.I always look forward to another Kinsey Millhone saga - this one was worth the wait and I highly recommend it to other fans. My only hope is that Sue Grafton goes back to neatly tying up her mysteries (with the trademark Kinsey 'final report')."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I am a devoted fan of the series but this one is either not completed (no &quot;respectfully submitted&quot; synopsis at the end) and for most of the book, it seem that Sue Grafton is still trying to figure out what the story will be about - much less how it will end. Very unsatisfying and NO character growth for Kinsey Millhone. No correlation between the title and the plot that I can see. Yeah she eats at Rosie's, skips the gym and eats junky sandwiches but almost as a gratuitous bone thrown to the reader. My advice is to borrow it, check it out of your library or wait until it's in paperback. It's not worth the hardback price.Sue Grafton should be allowed one dud and this one is definitely it!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"OK! I will admit that I am hooked on these Kinsey Millhone alphabetical series of novels dealing with the exploits of a female private detective! The books are set in the 1980s. The heroine is Kinsey Millhone a thirtyish, twice divorced, Big Mac fan with a old VW and a penchant for dinners at Rosie's diner. Kinsey's case in P for Peril is a good read but is far from the best book in the series.The Plot: Old Dr. Purcell has disappeared! He is a physician at a local Santa Teresa healthcare facility for geriatric patients. Fiona, his ex-wife, hires Kinsey to see if she can discover where the good physician is to be found. Purcell was married at the time of his diappearance to Crystal. Crystal is an ex-stripper. She and the doctor have a small son; she also has a daughter named Leila conceived in a previous relationship. The good doctor was facing a government probe on fraud. He was also quite wealthy!Kinsey finds medical skulduggery in the medical records at the nursing home where Purcell was employed. She also deals with crooked lawyers, cops and teenagers who have gone astray through drug use and theft. Kinsey also must deal with Richard and Tommy Hevener. These two dreadful creeps murdered their parents back home in Texas making off with mom's jewels. Kinsey's life is in peril during her investigation.The book is often slow paced but does have moments of suspense. The reader learns about life in a nursing home and how much medical fraud and elder abuse is being practiced in modern America. The book lacks the usual epilogue Grafton provides readers in the other books in the series. The Millhone books are quick reads and light entertainment. They are not great literature but Grafton is still an excellent author of Private Eye generic fiction."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I disagree with the person who says &quot;perhaps Grafton was hoping readers would take an interest in the aged&quot;. Why not? Is good reading only good if it's about the young? I, personally, cannot discriminate based on age and found that this latest Grafton mystery was very entertaining. In fact, her description of the residents of Pacific Meadows was both stirring and sweet - especially when I think of my own aging parents. On the reverse, she hit the nail on the head when she describes Blanche and her children. I felt as if I were there. This is a good book, with an insight that is great.

The set-up took a long time, with very little of interest going on. Then, once the book became a page turner with lots of suspects and action it feels like Ms. Grafton got bored with the book and decided to just end it. While Kinsey may work out a lot of the aftermath in her head, I hated how abrubtly the book ended. It had no closure for many of the smaller details. The sub-plot started out really well, and again ended too quickly. I loved reading about Kinsey again, as she's such a fabulous character and I would still recommend reading the book, but most of the earlier books are better. I hope Q is better. (Quarrel? Question? Quick? Quaker? Quartz? Quarantine?...)"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I was very unsatisfied the ending or should I say non-ending of this book. I even went to my local book store and scaned several copies to make sure my copy wasn't missing the last several pages. As avid Sue Grafton readers know, Kinsey always writes a summary of her report at the end of the book. This ties up all the loose ends. This book left us all hanging and my only hope is that Ms. Grafton's next book is titled Q is for Question no more the ending of P . . . I will clear it up for you in this book."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've read all of the alphabet series.

The novel is set in November 1986. The plot starts out a bit slow, but the pace picks up as the story develops. Kinsey is hired to investigate the disappearance of a prominent local doctor. The investigation opens many cans of worms. There is his ex-wife, broke and benefiting from a life insurance policy; his present wife and her personal trainer; an out-of-control stepdaughter and her friend; the ex-husband of the present wife; and some associates in a business which is under investigation for Medicare fraud.Things are compounded by a pair of brothers interested in renting Kinsey a new office, and an investigator looking for missing jewels (sub-plot number one). There is also the question of mysterious withdrawals from the doctor's bank account over a period of time (sub-plot number two). Many of the characters in the novel are over-extended financially (living on credit cards). Considering how often Kinsey lies to people in the course of an investigation (and how often she breaks the law), it is amazing how much she trusts other people.You can guess about guilty parties along the way, but the case has a few surprising twists. Even at the end, things are not certain. A suspect is implied, but the evidence is such that it would be hard to prove in court. Only one sub-plot has someone with a smoking gun. Some of the actions seem improbable, but criminals are not known for brillance. There are a few glitches, like the fact that rain would increase the reservoir water levels."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Oh, I am so disappointed!

Now it all seems pre-fabricated, and the worst part of all is the outdated nature of the story. It's almost as if Grafton wrote all the books in the series in the 1980's and sits back, releasing a formula-ridden sequel every year and counting the money.First of all, get Kinsey a cell phone! We are now in the 21st century, where is she finding all these phone booths? (first clue that this was written well before the release date). She's still driving a 1974 Beetle? Do those run anymore? The over-descriptive narrative gets very annoying after awhile as well. Too much thumbing through index cards, too much of Sue Grafton going through the motions in this feeble \\"effort\\". I rarely give one star in a review but this one is richly deserved. Time to find something else for light reading.Edit: Okay, my apologies, this series is frozen in the 1980's.

I buy all of her paperbacks as they come out. I finished \\"P is for Peril\\" this morning, hours after Letterman finished his show and went home. It IS light fiction, good for a rainy day. In fact, it WAS a rainy day. By and large, I did enjoyed it. It was good to check it on my old friend, Kinsey. But a few things bothered me. (Good fans are the harshest critics.)1. Kinsey needs to join the modern age. Everyone but me has a cell phone. She should have one. She can still \\"get out of range\\" or have \\"low batteries\\" if she needs to knock on a few doors, but women and detectives these days have cell phones.2. She should join the computer age. People use the Google search engine to find out about each other now. They \\"Google\\" each other before they go on dates. Kinsey would be nosy; she would Google everybody she meets, such as her clients, the insurance poser and the boys from Texas. Google me, for example. Does my bio come up?3. She should get credit reports on line too... Kinsey would \\"landlord\\" everybody, especially her clients and witnesses. She would know everybody's credit history, how much they spent, etc. This would change the plot drastically, for when Kinsey meets the Texas boys, she would be immediately suspicious of them: Their news-making Texas activities would show up on a \\"Google.\\"4. Detectives nowadays have all sorts if little and inexpensive cameras for surveillance work. Kinsey wouldn't joke about a tampon camera, she would have one.5. I did like the way the sub-plot with the Texas brothers did not take the easy route and somehow become enmeshed with the main plot. That was nice.6. In \\"P is for Peril,\\" the female insurance poser from Texas sets Kinsey up to smoke out the where abouts of the missing jewels. But how does she know when the Texas boys have them? They come and go from their house and the business offices regularly, so the lady would not know which trip they got the jewels. She would only know when they went to the fake jeweler. If she hits the boys the first time they visit the jeweler, they probably won't have the jewels with them; they are just checking him out. Of course, if no such jeweler exists, that is another problem.7. As much as I like Kinsey, I also like the taut, lean and mean storytelling of John (Camp) Sanford. Sometimes, I wish Kinsey would skip the long descriptions and would get on with it.Respectfully submitted,A.

For me the newness has worn off and that is only because no one single protagonist, i.e. Kinsey Millhone can hold my attention, therefore my interest, beyond four or five novels. Except Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series. I guess there are always exceptions. Anyway, there is nothing new to learn about Millhone and for me that is a big part of why I like to read-to learn about the characters.In \\"P is for Peril\\" there are sufficient surprises to hold your interest all the way through so don't allow what I said in the first paragraph to discourage you from checking it out from your local library.Marvin Wiebener, author of THE MARGIN and soon to be released THE MORIAH RUSE."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"The fact of the matter is that I pretty much love all of the Kinsey Milhone adventures. While some are better than others, I feel that Sue Grafton has a pretty good feel for popping out a more-than-decent mystery and this is one of them.

If it's any indication of the quality of her other books, this will be the last. Some of this book reads like a printout of driving directions from mapquest...\\"I took such-and-such road to another road and stopped. I looked left and then turned...\\" who cares??? She drones on and on with minutiae which drag out the story and bore the reader. The rest of the book is like reading the weather forecast, as the reader is subjected to minutiae regarding the clouds, the mist, the rain. Big deal. Who cares? Boring. Pedantic. Predictable."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"P is for Peril, a novel written by Sue Grafton, can be best described as unpredictable. This book if full of strange occurrences and suspense that will keep the reader captivated till the very end. The main plot of this story is that Dowan Purcell, a well-respected doctor, has disappeared. Dr. Purcell is a man in his sixties whom has gone missing. This is where the main character comes into play. Kinsey Millhone, a unique 36-year old detective, is hired by Dr. Purcell's ex-wife, Fiona Purcell to investigate his disappearance. His current wife Crystal, a former striper, seems to not care of his whereabouts. She calls the police department 48 hours after he does not come home. Dowan Purcell is an administrator of a nursing home, and both he and the office are under investigation for Medicare fraud. Dowan's passport is missing and his bank account has decreased by $30,000. What is really of interest is that Henry, Kinsey Millhone's landlord and confidant, had a relative who had been a patient in the nursing home, is being charged for services after her death. Kinsey Millhone's investigations lead to the finding of Dr. Purcell's body behind his ex-wife's house. At the end of the book, there are several suspects with motives into why they might have murdered Dr. Purcell; for example, both of his wives and some business partners, and Crystal's out of control teenage daughter. In the end, the author leaves the reader to interpret and analyze the evidence to determine who the culprit is. Grafton does not explicitly state who the murderer is. You will have to read the book and decide for yourself..."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"P is for Peril closely follows the pattern of Sue Grafton's other books. I enjoyed the multiple storylines in this one. I also enjoyed the main plotline but I don't believe that Sue Grafton brought the mystery to conclusion. She leaves us to surmise who did it but, in reality, the circumstantial evidence that she presents us could point to a few other suspects. So, overall it was a good read but a disappointment in the ending. Because of the way it ended, I actually thought that there would be a sequel in Q is for Quarry. If you hate ending a book without being sure of who did it, you may not like this one. If you like Sue Grafton's style, you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"***I commend Sue Grafton on being able to keep a mid-alphabet beginning reader informed with the entire Millhone story-line, I began reading Kinsey's adventures with P and experienced very few incidents of blank-stare faces. The descriptive techniques of Grafton are well crafted greatly appreciated, though the long list of characters had me in a whirlwind.Grafton provided an actual detective story, she held out the discovery of Dr. Dowan Purcell after an adequate period of time. The sub-plot of the story is an odd concoction that doesn't appear to fit-in with the actual plot of the story, more like some excuse for Kinsey to have guy problems. The outlandish scenario of the sub-plot came to an even more that unfeasible conclusion than the entire sub-plot itself.The final outcome was also somewhat disappointing. It appeared to be an unusual twist, that came from somewhere in thin air; a part of the joy in reading a mystery is having at least the slightest chance of discovering the conclusion before the final page is read. As a reader, if I have no chance of detecting the criminal, I have no sense of accomplishment and feel cheated somehow.Kinsey Millhone is a character that is impossible not to like, though. A female detective is an idea that still tickles the imagination, and gives a breath of fresh air to the female-public. Her straightforward, smart mouth, independent woman attitude is greatly superlative in comparison to any male detective.Perhaps beginning with P was not the best of ideas, and I'd appreciate her work more all the way back to A. Either way, Grafton is definitely not an author that I'd set aside frivolously."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I've read most of the books in the alphabeth series, and try to consider Sue Grafton as one of my favorite authors, at least I always keep in mind to read one of her books every year.I call P as Predictable for many reasons, and don't worry I won't ruin the book for you revealing the ending (not withstanding most of the readers seem to find its last plot turn a bit confusing). The thing is her books usually are better.Kinsey is there, the supporting characters we know and love are there, the city and locations are there, the humor is there (a bit muffled), and the talent and craft of the writer is there. Only the story is, well, dissapointing.All the subplot with the brothers, the office leasing and so on is frankly tedious and unbelievable. The moment she says &quot;its too good to be true&quot; we know it is, and nothing in it proves its worth to be, not say in the book, but in the series, it seems Grafton was lacking any &quot;peril&quot; in the P and added it in an effort to keep the reader in (there's an absolute lack of peril in the other plot lines).About the main case I don't have a problem in understanding who is the killer as most reviewers have, of course is an odd ending for series that uses to close things more neatly, but hell, I don't have a problem with it.The problem is in the pace. 200 pages to find a corpse and get things going, adds for a bit too much build-up. The book is full of too much description, and too much of the Kinsey routine we frequent readers love, but that is not enough to sustain a bleak plot. As a reviewer wrote previously, Kinsey keeps driving up and down, comenting about the rain, putting on and off her raincoat, looking for parking space or filling blank cards.Sorry Sue, lets hope Q is better so my favorite detective series doesn't plummet to the land of the forgettable pulp."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I'm a Kinsey Millhone fan, but this novel is warped. The subplot destroys what could have been a good one. So Kinsey's attracted to Tommy? I could not believe she would change that attraction to her dumb-dumb vigilante mode INSTANTLY--on the word of a total stranger! Why didn't she at least go to Texas and nose around? Then she wouldn't have been suckered by a femme fatale con artist, who herself was unreal. (The \\"insurance investigator\\" is so smart and sharp looking, but with a dumb low-life brother?? Come on.)I guess Grafton wants us to think Kinsey's infallible, but no one is, and that's why we have a Constitution and courts, folks. Where's Grafton been? Last I heard, juries were convicting the retarded, the insane, and the innocent, and these poor (people) were getting death sentences--ESPECIALLY in Texas. Come into the real world, Sue. Put Kinsey back in jail a while, and let her see what's really going on."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I love Kinsey Millhone and have read every book in this series. What I love most about them is that Kinsey doesn't take herself seriously and knows that we aren't taking her seriously either. It is fun light reading for those times when you don't really want to use your brain too much!This book, however left me feeling like I had missed something. I reread the last chapter three times and still felt like there was some connection I wasn't drawing.

I must have dozed off during her first introduction. To sum it up, Despite the fact I bought the hard copy edition, I have no desire to pass it on to anyone else. 1 star is too high of a rating. Shame on you Sue Grafton."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"All of the great elements of a promising mystery are found in this story but they fall flat on their face. The ex-wife of a prominent doctor hires Kinsey to find her missing ex-spouse. Oh, never mind the fact that the man has remarried and has an infant son. Throw in an investigation of fraud at the doctor's job and stir up some marital discord with the doctor's new wife. Don't forget Kinsey's problem with her new office landlord's brother. His hormones are at an all time high and Kinsey is his target. Forget about the fact that he and his brother are suspected of killing their parents.With all of those things going on what do you have? A mess of a story and plot. You see Kinsey being spun around in different directions to the point where you don't know where the story is going. Graton has given us three stories in one and neither one is complete. The incompleteness and motivations of Kinsey is what throws the reader off and renders the story unsatisfying.P is for Peril is not one of Grafton's best book in the series but it is not the worst. It starts out with a story full of potential but leaves you still guessing at the end of who did what and why. If you are a Grafton fan add this book to your collection. For anyone else be prepared for being short changed. P for Peril could be better."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"In keeping with most other reviewers I was deadly disappointed by this book.Sue grafton's style has become pedestrian and lacked any cutting edge to it.Kinsey's character has not developed in any way and the writing was old fashioned and mundane.Kinsey seems to have no friends apart from Henry and compared to other female PI's lacks humour.The plot was unexciting because Ms Grafton did not care about the characters.And if SHE didnt HER readers certainly couldn't.I much prefer Dana Stabenow's heroine Kate Shugak and Caroline Aguilera Garcia's sassy Cuban heroine.

I was very disappointed in this book and I'm hoping &quot;Q&quot; answers my questions."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I confess to having sneaked a peek at what some of the disgruntled readers had to say about this book. And it never fails to amaze me how angry people get when an author requires a reader to use his/her imagination (based on what's been presented) and work out the answers. Books are intended to challenge and pique the mind, not to act as soporifics--with everything presented neatly tied up and gift-wrapped. P is for Peril does precisely that: it offers all the evidence and then leaves the reader to arrive at the only possible conclusion.I've been a Kinsey fan since book A; some of the entries in this alphabet series have been weaker than others. But Grafton always writes well, with humor and superior plotting skills. This is a grown-up book from a grown-up author who has yet to rely on formulaic writing, but rather brings something fresh to each new &quot;letter.&quot; And P is just great; it's got wonderful characters, lots of humor, and enough red herrings to make a sizeable platter at a buffet.Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Sue Grafton provides her readers with no dearth of suspects in Kinsey Millhone's attempt to solve the disappearance of a doctor suspected of Medicare fraud: a wife and an ex-wife, several daughters and stepdaughters, nannies, teachers, nurses aides...lordy, the list goes on. Kinsey probably had to go out and buy a few more packs of file cards to rearrange on her bulletin board.Pretty good, but not Grafton's best in this generally terrific series."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This is another excellent entry in the Alphabet series. Sue Grafton's writing is taut and keeps the reader turning the pages really quickly. This book simply breezed by.Kinsey is a great character, and wonderful company for the4 hours or so spent reading this book. She is amusing, resourceful, morally upright, and very likeable!The plot here is great, allowing for an interesting investigation into the disappearance of the good Dcotor. His two wives are well drawn characters, and inflect the plot with many an interesting moment!It was also good to see one of the characters from &quot;J&quot; crop up again. I always get a little thrill when i meet a character who i can connect to another story.This book has several strands to it, the main inveatigation, the shady brothers selling Kinsey her apartment, and the &quot;misplaced&quot; money. The only problem i have with this book is that only one of these strands is actually explained to the reader fully. The explanations to the other two are not exaplained to the reader at all, and you really have to figure it out for yourself. All the info you need is there, but it takes another careful read of the book to actually be able to know how it was done. However, i suppose, if you read it carefully in the first place, that wouldn't be such a problem. So, this is definitely a book which rewards concentrated and careful reading.All in all, the final solution (one worked out) is a very good one, and this an extremely good addition to the series. It has humour, great characters, a great plot, and Kinsey. what more could you ask for?Oh yes, another little quibble. There is incredibly little &quot;Peril&quot; involved."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Medicare isn't exciting. Not even the word &quot;fraud&quot; can make it exciting. But this is Grafton, so you wade through all of that thinking it has something to do with the mystery. But it doesn't. Other characters come in and out in a revolving door that seems designed to keep the page number climbing. They end up as dead ends and red herrings. Pauline? Nurse Grey? Purcell's partners? Rand? Clint? How do they fit in? I read the book and I still don't know. The ending is a big &quot;Wha...?&quot; and not in thrilling sense. I thought I was missing some pages. Some reviewers here suggest that all will be answered in &quot;Q&quot; but, honestly, this story and these characters aren't compelling enough for one book, so why would any of us want to revisit them? There are other disappointments as well. I'm not opposed to Kinsey exposing weaknesses and vulnerability. I'd like to see a more personal side of her, but here she behaves stupidly not once, but several times -- taken in by losers and posers -- and that's simply not the character Grafton has set us up to accept."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"PLEASE...somebody who pretends to have understood the ending, explain it here.

If you're one of the reviewers (a minority to be sure) who thought the ending &quot;subtle and clever&quot; you should point out what clues the rest of us missed.Until I hear from you, I'll have to conclude that this book had no ending.

I was ticked off to see some had revealed plot twists in detailing their frustration.But now that I've read the book, I'm glad those people did spill the beans ... it gave me something to look for as I was reading. That knowledge spiced up this subpar Kinsey effort.But I gave this three stars because bad Grafton is still better than the wannabes who have crafted &quot;gutsy girl detectives&quot; in her wake. Check out pp. 88-93, when Kinsey's lack of maternal instincts are so beautifully described during the visit to Blanche's house. I loved how Grafton describes the house inhabited by four children: &quot;There was nothing on any surface below see-level, every breakable object removed to a high shelf as though in preparation for a coming flood.&quot; Anyone who has ever babyproofed smiled and nodded.We get to know Kinsey better each time out.

It didn't really have time to build the final climax. So it was disappointing to me.Dr. Dowan Purcell has been missing, and his ex-wife, Fiona is the one who hires Kinsey to find out what really happened to him, not Crystal his current wife. So Kinsey begins to search back into Dowan's background, and the longer she traces back to what may have happened to Dowan, the more it seems Fiona is the suspect. Or it may be Dowan's troubled teenage daughter Leila, who had everything against her dad. Kinsey doesn't know what to make of the whole thing, at least not for a long time.Then Kinsey puts herself into another type of danger as well that has nothing to do with the case. She answers an ad for apartment space that two gentleman are offering. She ends up with the apartment, only to find out that these two men who are brothers, are very dangerous. One of them, Tommy, makes the moves on Kinsey and starts to follow her around. Kinsey better watch her back when she decides to break the lease, and these guys come after her."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"There is much going on in P is for Peril.

The story works well, creating a good feeling for all the characters involved with the main storyline. Surprises are in store for them, though. You won't be sorry you missed this one. It was terrifc, but I'm removing one star simply because it wasn't in my top 5 favorites of this series."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I think P is for Peril is a very well-written book. It's a mystery and I haven't read that many mysteries lately, but I liked this one. The main plot is that Dr. Dowan Purcell has been missing after he left a nursing home. Instead of being hired by his current wife, Crystal, Kinsey Millhone is hired by Fiona, his ex, to find him. Then there is also the part about Tommy and his twin, and Kinsey finds out about their dark past.This is the first Kinsey Millhone mystery I have read, and I think she did a great job. Grafton gets you into a book and you just want to know what's going to happen next. Now that I have read this book, I think I will go and grab one of her earlier ones before reading Q."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Sue Grafton's Kinsey is the ultimate woman PI, and P is for Peril is equal to Grafton's usual standards. While there are some changes in form (the missing epilogue is most noteworthy), this novel has enough of the usual elements of the Alphabet Series to please any Grafton reader. Kinsey and her supporting cast continue all of their long-running subplots. Kinsey's A-story murder investigation involving a doctor's death as well as the B-story involving a pair of suspiciously dangerous twins are both entertaining. P is a fine mystery, and Kinsey continues to be the queen of today's literary PIs."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I really enjoyed this latest Kinsey Millhone book. I worked in a nursing home for several years and saw all sorts of strange things like she has described. She has written perfectly about the atmosphere in such a place and the people who work there. I wish we had learned if Leila actually stole the money out of the bank account and more about her, but she wasn't the main character. I didn't particularly like either of Dr. P's wives.Henry, her landlord, is one of my favorites. I wish I had a neighbor like him!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Grafton is the best mystery author now working. P is for Peril easily equals her high standards. I really like Kinsey, and I feel this book is among the finest recent Kinsey novels. I admire Grafton for risking reader hostility for the chances she takes with this story. Overall, P is a solid series entry, and I'm glad we still have a long way to go to Z."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Sara Paretsky, Janet Evanovich, Patricia Cornwell. Blech. Ptui. Sue Grafton, on the other hand, has got the writing cojones.Nobody out there has the imagistic flair that Grafton flaunts. Sure, sometimes she overdoes it. Early on in this one, she describes a new office she's renting. The paint, the molding, the carpeting, the lighting, the view, the dimensions. The story comes to a screeching halt, and I'm saying to myself, &quot;This damn well better be important!&quot; It was, kinda.The storyline of \`P' IS FOR PERIL deals with the disappearance of Dr. Dowan Purcell. Kinsey is hired by the doctor's ex-wife. She doesn't like her; she's not sure she wants to take the case, although she's hard up for cash. Kinsey takes the retainer, agrees to work on it for a few days. The doctor's disappeared before; he's had an alcohol problem. He could turn up. Kinsey discovers someone at the doctor's clinic was cooking the books, charging the government too much for medi-care. Purcell was only the manager; the owners of the clinic become suspects. So does Purcell's new young wife, Crystal.I wasn't too impressed with the scene where Kinsey discovers what happened to the doc. It involves a telescope. I've read a lot of mysteries and the telescope led me to believe that someone was watching the ex-wife's house. Nope, just a telescope. Must've been a star watcher.For me the book was salvaged by Kinsey's octogenarian landlord, Henry. I was worried she was going to kill him off. The sweet old guy unravels a co-worker's billing problem and in the process provides a clue implicating the person at the clinic responsible for the medi-care scam. I'd like to see Grafton do a book where Henry's the star.I thought I had this one figured out half way through the book; I wasn't far off. The motivation for the murder will really surprise you, though. Watch the foreshadowing. She does drop a few hints."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I've read/listened to every other Kinsey Milhone story and liked most of them, but this one really disappointed me. This is the only Sue Grafton book I would say was a stinker. It was rambling and crammed with dull details and I had to make a real effort to finish the book. I listened to the unabridged audio version and when I got the &quot;end&quot; I was afraid that perhaps I had listened to the tapes out of order and had missed something. The narration was also pretty flat.It was lacking in the usual wit and cleverness, with too many characters to keep straight, vanishing plots, a whole book of red herrings. Kinsey came off as pretty unlikeable. It was as though Sue Grafton got tired and decided to just stop where she was and say &quot;The End&quot;.I hold out hope for &quot;Q&quot; but will read the reviews before buying instead of after.

This book is a little longer than Grafton's norm, and it's really three mysteries rolled into one. The well-liked Dr. Dowan Purcell is missing, and we don't know whether he left town voluntarily, whether he committed suicide, or whether he was murdered. There is also an intriguing development with the two men who are leasing Kinsey her new office space. As always, Kinsey observes the world with her characteristic sense of humor. The characters are so well drawn, they leap off the pages. There is a surprise in almost every other chapter, the pace is breathtaking. Never before in a book has Kinsey been so wrong in her initial perceptions, but she perseveres and in the end, she figures it out--and the reader goes along for the ride. And I did love the subtle ending. Well, well, but of course, I said to myself...It is SWEET. Way to go, Sue. Can't wait for Q."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"A prominent member of the medical community, Dr. Dowan Purcell has been missing for nine weeks. At the time of his disappearance, Dowan was running a nursing care facility. Respected, and well-liked by all those he came into contact with, Dowan had no enemies to speak of, that's why it comes as a big surprise to Kinsey Milone when she is hired by Dowan's first wife to investigate foul play.As Kinsey questions Fiona (the good doctor's first wife), she hears a side of the doctor much darker than anyone expected. It seems Dowan threw over his first wife for a younger model (a stripper) to satisfy his perverted sexual appetite.Fiona believes Dowan is hiding from his new wife Crystal. Crystal fears he is dead. And one of his daughters has consulted a psychic who can see her father trapped in a dark place...Kinsey embarks on a long road with many dead-ends, but determination to find out exactly what happened to Dowan, will enter her into a dark underworld where the truth is hidden, and finding it could cost her her life.'P Is For Peril' is a mystery in the grand tradition; complex plot, top notch writing, and page-turning plot twists. With her sense of humor and endless determination, Kinsey Milone proves to be one of the most enjoyable characters in detective fiction.'P Is For Peril' shows that Sue Grafton has not tired of coming up with interesting plots, and with ten more letters left in the alphabet, she keeps readers anxiously awaiting each new book.Fans of the series will love this latest entry, and those who have not discovered the alphabet mysteries should do so now, because 'P Is For Peril' is about the best in the series.A MUST read!Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"You know I disagree with quite a few reviewers before me about this book.

So I went to The kindle store and bought the book only to find there is no end to the story. This was confirmed by a friend with a copy of the book. So now I'm frustrated that I read the whole bloody book and the author opted to not finish it. I feel ripped off after going and buying the book again for $7.99 and I still have no resolution. Grrr. Very disappointing. Especially after really enjoying the series up until now."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I like Grafton's books. They are not as heavyweight as Nevada Barr or Sara Paretsky, but I have read them all and am currently enjoying U is for Undertow.My advice is to skip P is for Peril. It seemed pointless and boring. Another reviewer wrote that she had just switched publishers. Maybe that explains it. Something in the process was definitely missing for this one. It gives the impression she shouldn't have bitten off the obligation to write 26 books in the series. Thankfully, the later books have improved."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I purchased the Kindle edition and feel I've been cheated. I like many of the other reviewers were left in a lurch on the last page of this book and looked for the non-existent \\"Epilogue\\". Every one of Ms. Grafton's novels through \\"O Is For Outlaw\\" included an epilogue so why was this novel the exception? While most \\"whodunits\\" were concluded by the end of the book, the \\"Epilogue\\" from Kinsey Millhone's character is always cleverly written to shed light on the \\"loose ends\\" that I'm certain the author purposefully leaves out to keep those of us readers engaged until the end.Although I read the \\"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\\" from 2001, which occupy two-thirds of the horizontal space on the bottom of Amazon's webpage, and the \\"Most Recent Customer Reviews\\", which occupy only 1/3 of that same horizontal space, there were only two vague reviews involving the \\"Kindle Edition\\". It is for this reason that I felt compelled to write this review to inform other avid fans of Kinsey Millhone that you might feel neglected, overlooked, abandoned or unfulfilled after reading Ms. Grafton's \\"P Is For Peril\\".I'm still astonished that in the decade since this book was first published that Ms. Grafton didn't provide an \\"updated version\\" that would INCLUDE the missing \\"Epilogue\\". Information is SO immediate these days; although I'm certain there are many \\"in-between corporate people\\" (formerly known as \\"middlemen\\") that will want to be paid if the author decides to make any changes. C'est la vie!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I enjoy the Alphabet novels, but this one struck me as a bit flabby, and I went back and checked. Sure enough, A Is For Alibi ran to 368 pages, which was about right, but this manages to stretch things out for 513, which is about a hundred too many. I noticed that every time Kinsey climbs into her car we're exposed to a detailed account of her journey, and every new house she visits receives a detailed description. This adds nothing to the plot, but slows down the action. I can only surmise that Sue Grafton's publishers have prevailed on her to increase the size of the book. But for whatever reason, she'd be well advised to cut out the padding, and revert to writing crisp plots, as she used to."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"A good read, but not quite 'up to' the quality of her earlier books in the series. It's difficult to 'get to 26' and keep them all up to her standards of excellence; however, without doubt, Sue Grafton is at the very top of my list of sleuths."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I have read all of this series so far (up through \\"T\\") and of all the books so far, I found this to be the weakest in storyline. There were too many sub-plots and characters that never got explained. All of the other \\"Alphabet Series\\" mysteries have been so engrossing that the books were hard to put down and I was eager to pick them up as soon as I could find a spare minute. But not this one. For some reason, this storyline did not grab me like all of her other stories have. It came across too much like she was trying to make some sort of \\"social statement\\" rather than writing a thriller. I won't give away the storyline or plot, but it did seem to me to be a little contrived, and too many coincidences occured for it so be \\"real-life\\". I love it when Grafton brings Kinsey's extended family (cousins, etc.) into play and wish she would do it more. If this book was being compared to most other fiction/mystery novels, I would have rated it a five, but I was comparing it to the other Grafton novels, and in my humble opinion, this one just doesn't measure up to the others she has written."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Obviously, the solution to this book is in the last few pages but what perplexes me is not who but why??? Maybe the ending is so ambivilant because Kinsey is initially unsure about her client and seems to remain unsettled about the case through the entire book. Maybe there is no 'submitted by' because Kinsey isn't through with the case and doesn't feel comfortable submitting a report on an open case. The constant financial reckoning (of Fiona's retainer) seems to indicate that possibly she is more concerned about how much refund is due Fiona than whether or not she finds Fiona's ex. No real explanation is given for the question of why Fiona is looking for him; the daughters of both wives remain unrealized characters; Henry just floats in and out of the story; and most unusual for a Grafton book, Kinsey herself doesn't seem able to commit herself to the problem(s) in any meaningful way. There are a million unanswered questions about this 16th alphabet book. Hopefully, Kinsey will show up in 17 and answer some of them!!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I read Q firt then read N, R, D and a few others.

What about the sister of the juvie friend? What happened to her? Maybe I missed it. I am pretty good about going back and finding details I may have missed. I did not like the character development in this one. I was surprised that a PI like Ms. Millhone would not do thorough background checks on people that come into her life, professionally or personally.I like to find an author and read a book.

I feel compelled, though, because this one is superior.I've read each of the Sue Grafton books, A through P, (actually I've read Q, too) and I think this is the best one yet. The plot is extremely complex but also extremely clearly laid out. PI Kinsey Millhone makes her investigation without seeming to do much--clever lady. And further, she gets involved in TWO mysteries, one completely unintentionally. It will come as no surprise to you that she manages to sort it all out. As a retired physician, I was pleased that she tackled, among other things, the currently hot subject of Medicare fraud.I do find myself wondering, though, what Kinsey Millhone will do when she has reached Z.

I enjoyed P is for Peril but was left disappointed. We never truly learn why the Doctor was killed. Kinsey seems to take almost being murdered by a man she had the hots for in stride. How did the insurance agent get the combination to the safe? Is what she did illegal? Wouldn't Kinsey, having worked for an insurance office, know the right avenues to pursue to follow up on this?

Kinsey Millhone had followed the disappearance in the newspapers and then his former wife sought her services. He was the director of a care facility. The client collects art deco.Sue Grafton's character is an effective protoganist. She represents good in the war waged in genre fiction of good against evil. She is refreshing, not rule bound, considerate of others, her elderly neighbors for example, and seeks to cut through the noisy insincerities of social intercourse to reach the truth. She is a sort of Western star, a loner, she explains, in female garb. Her roughness is meant to be endering and one has to admit that Grafton is successful.Kinsey Millhone is looking for a new office. Kinsey discovers the nursing home was under investigation when Dow Purcell disappeared. The investigation was being conducted by HCFA on medicare billing. An associate wondered if the missing man could handle the loss of face in the event of prosecution. Dow may have been a good practitioner and an incompetent adminstrator. A former employee certainly held such a view of the situation.In the midst of the investigation into his disappearance, which at least from a reader's perspective finally seems to be going somewhere, Kinsey learns of questionable conduct on the part of her prospective landlords. She does not know if she is inclined to use her investigative skills to discover their crimes to help an insurance company, but at a minimum decides to back out of the rental. She continues to have a contentious relationship with her client and feels that spending time on the case in order to justify the retainer accepted is a form of indentured servitude.Kinsey locates the dead man's car in water. The most interesting parts of the story are the medicare fraud strand. The villians portrayed are pretty convincing. Peril is a good word for the position of the characters in this yarn. Under the circumstances Kinsey Millhone would be a good person to know. The book is a nice job of writing."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I always enjoy Grafton's novels and appreciate the way her character develops from book to book. (I especially like the fact that the time frame stays accurate for Kinsey Milhone's age.) This story was just a little different--there was less romance, less action, but it seemed more realistic. The ending is not typical Grafton.

This strong female character with her pithy remarks would be ripe for discussion.Ms. Grafton, speaking as Kinsey, is a latter day physiognomist just as Charlotte Bronte and Anne Bronte. Grafton just takes herself a bit less seriously. Kinsey is someone who reads character and temperament from outside appearance and then she lets us, the reader, in on her apt observations. Your reading group might find it amusing to study the character development and description and see if it rings true with Kinsey's observations.Our favorite quote spoke of Kinsey's love of disappearing into a book, &quot;I settled on the sofa, where I covered myself in a big puffy comforter and started reading a book. Within minutes, I'd been sucked through a wormhole into a fictional world, traveling faster than the speed of words into a realm without sound and without gravity.&quot;Our interesting word selection is the simple word, &quot;smile.&quot; Your reading group might want to take a close look how people in this mystery smile - who does and who doesn't smile. Of course many authors use this term to tell us something about character and motivation and intent but few use it to help us solve a mystery. We learn that Fiona's smile was sour; Chrystal smiled faintly; Tommy flashed Kinsey a smile; Dana's smile was jaded; Tommy smiled at Kinsey fleetingly; Mariah's smile, when it appeared, scarely softened her face; Celine's smile, when it appeared was self-conscious- never reached her face; Anica mangaged a wide smile despite Crystal's distress; Anica Blackburn appeared and smiled at Kinsey briefly before she took her seat in the pew. . .Indeed Tommy's smiles were flashy and fleeting long before they faded completely and Anica smiled inappropriately more than once. What would truly be interesting to learn is whether or not Ms. Grafton used this device consciously. We are certain, however, that Ms. Grafton, as always, had the subtle intention of bringing a conscious smile of understanding to the reader's face.As always, in reading Sue Grafton, we settled in and within minutes we were sucked through a wormhole into a fictional world, traveling faster than the speed of words into a realm without sound and without gravity.

Kinsey's off and running, interviewing Dow's new and very young wife, his friends, business associates and employees and everyone of them is pointing fingers and has a theory as to what might have happened and why he's gone. But when by pure chance, Kinsey makes a shocking discovery, nothing's going to stop her until she gets to the truth.....

The writing is great, the dialogue, superb and the descriptions and detail, unrivaled. But the book has some problems. The main plot line is weak and complicated and at times hard to follow and Ms Grafton leaves a few too many plot lines hanging and questions, unanswered at the unsatisfying end of the story. The characters, though well drawn, are mostly a nasty lot and hard to empathize with or care about. You just don't want to spend time with these people. The real highlight of the book is the subplot involving a new office and mysterious twin landlords and I kept looking forward to getting off Dow's case and back to that part of the story. All in all, not one of the best in the series, but a good entertaining read that Grafton fans won't want to miss."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This is a departure for Kinsey Milhone. The mood is dark as the skies and as retro as an early Ross McDonald novel. The main plot is diffuse with unattractive, complex characters taking the center stage. A beloved elderly physician has disappeared. His eccentric but charmless ex-wife wants him found. His present wife, a former stripper, thinks he is dead. Nobody and nothing are quite as they seem. The missing doctor has a drinking problem and some quirky sexual needs. The ex-wife in her unfinished, stark and bare art deco home calls to mind Gloria Swanson in \\"Sunset Boulevard.\\" The trophy-wife, aptly named Crystal, seems fragile and dependent. She has a strange m&eacute;nage who consist of an utterly repellent 14-year old out-of-control daughter, her 18-month old son and his ghostly male nanny, and an ever-present friend who happens to be the daughter's school counselor.\\"Peril\\" is a decidedly ambitious book, and succeeds on many levels. The sometimes lyrical descriptions of weather, architecture and mood show growth and depth in Ms. Grafton's writing. However, she tries to do too much and the story sprawls. A secondary plot, though entertaining, is a diversion and fragments the reader's interest. She interjects a hilarious interlude with a hidden Kinsey trapped under a desk, a reluctant witness to a lovers' tryst. Again, funny and clever as this is, it does not forward the story. I had the feeling Ms. Grafton threw these in to placate her legion of Kinsey fans. Kinsey's regular pals, Henry and Rosie seem out of place in this setting. Think Ms. Grafton should bite the bullet and write a book without Kinsey, not in the alphabet series, and see how it goesThe ending is subtle but clear if you mentally review what you have read. The clues are all there. I had to smile at the cleverness."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I have read the earlier reviews posted here and wondered what book some of the reviewers read. Although the ending doesn't spell everything out for you, if you read it carefully, all the loose ends have been tied up by then. The final question about who killed Dow Purcell and why he was killed is answered in the last few pages with a discovery by Kinsey and a few subtle clues from the behavior of two of the characters.The subplots prove to be interesting, especially the one involving Kinsey's need for a new office. It is through another of the subplots (Henry working on Rosie's sister's medical bills)that Kinsey gets a better understanding of how the Medicare scam at the nursing home worked. But even that is another red herring as to the reason for Dr. Purcell's death. Was it murder, was it suicide? Did the money missing from his bank account have anything do do with his death? And if it was murder, who did it--his ex-wife, his business partners, his current wife's ex-husband, etc?Throughout the book, Kinsey takes some risks and find herself in potentially dangerous situations. The book ends while she waits for the police, and she has once again put herself in peril. The ending at this point keeps us wondering--knowing she is in danger and not knowing until the next installment if she escapes this situation unscathed.My perception of the book seems to be different from many of the early reviews especially in regard to the ending. I think it is a well written book with a neatly wrapped ending. If you are not perceptive and cannot read between the lines and see how Sue Grafton neatly wrapped up the story line about the Hevener brothers, or the murder of Dr. Purcell, then you might not appreciate the ending of the book. I think through the deft writing of Ms. Grafton, we are left with Kinsey in peril. You have to believe that the main character will not be killed off or what would be the point of her working on the next in the series? Too bad we have to wait a year for &quot;Q&quot;!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I had to read the reviews of this book to make sure I wasn't missing a chapter.

As I was recovering from the flu and the thick biography I had been reading was putting me to sleep, I felt entitled to indulge myself with the pleasure of Grafton's latest. I was not at all disappointed, and in fact thought it was one of her best. The tension of the story never got to be uncomfortable, as happens in a few of her books - yet it was, as usual, a page-turner. The only problem is that I finished it much too quickly!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"She has done it again! Like a magnet, my hand automatically reached for that large letter \\"P\\" on the library shelf. Weeks after Sue Grafton's latest book \\"P\\" is for Peril reached the local library it finally made it to the shelf without a hold placed on it. I am not even a reader of mystery genre. It wouldn't even matter to me if there was a mystery involved! I just like to read about Kinsey Malone, her neighbors, friends, enemies, divorces, affairs...well you get the picture. Sue Grafton can spin a story out of the most fragmented bits of information. I admire her ability to create real people for me as I read. And I envy her ability to blend it all together...she must use index cards like she requires Kinsey to do for her private detective work. I will be patiently waiting for \\"Q\\", while still telling others about \\"A\\" through \\"P.\\""},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Honestly, I've been unimpressed by the past four or five Kinsey Millhone books. Grafton has been slipping into lackluster formula, putting her heroine into less-than-gripping situations, the outcome of which I haven't given a hoot about. But with &quot;P is for Peril,&quot; she's back in top form, with not one, but two intriguing plotlines. Reading this book, you know why this series is consistantly on every best-seller list. By the denouement (on the last page, no less!), I had re-discovered why I became a Millhone fan in the first place. Brava!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said the series started to decline round about the letter L, but this book was back to Sue Grafton's high standards.

But on the whole this was one of the best books of the series in recent years."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I have read many of the previous reviews; however, I really did like this novel. I found it enjoyable, and totally engrossing. There were two threads to follow in this story. One was explained (although it was not spelled out ad nauseum, you could certainly figure it out!) and the story with the brothers was left kind of open, but I don't mind mulling that one over every once in a while when I think about it. I do agree that the one brother leaving the gun around would not be a typical action for a true sociopath who has covered up so cleverly up to now. Some things seemed like Kinsey should know better, but then again, all mysteries seem to suffer from the same thing.But basically, this was a well-written page-turner. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I enjoyed the basic story, but there were really two stories in the book, and I didn't think they had anything really to do with one another.I also didn't like the way she ended the book, I felt like I was left hanging with this one. She didn't end it completely like the rest of the books in the series.I am anxious to see what she does for Q."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"The alphebet series has provided many hours of enjoyment. This latest installment is entertaining with an interesting plot and amusing characters. However, the ending is abrupt and provides only a single obscure clue to the killer. In fact, the clue is more of a mystery than the book itself. Very unsatisfying!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This was a good book, but it lacked the crisp answers we are used to seeing in a Grafton book. It had a good basic plot line, but the obvious red herrings detracted from the story. The ending, while interesting, did not wrap, or tie in, all of the story lines and subplots. A good read, but not the emotionally taut novel O is for Outlaw was. Still, it held your interest even with the predictable ending. I'll buy Q when it comes out."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"An interesting plot but ms Grafton lost my interest quickly as she did not convey any depth to her characters. Usually she creates tension not only by the mystery and danger in her books but also holds your interest as you wonder about the characters thoughts and motivations. Sadly not this time. Still it remains a reasonable read if you're bored. But you might find yourself flicking forward as, I did, hoping to find a more gripping part of the story and sadly not finding any."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"This letter mystery goes no where.

While Kinsey is an enjoyable heroine and the 80s were the last heyday for traditional private eyes (before cell phones and the internet) the story here was lacking Grafton's great character development. Very few of the characters were appealing and nothing much happens of interest in Kinsey's personal life. The plot is pretty slow going until the end when everything gets solved in an unbelievable rush and in a very unsatifying way.I gave this book three stars since I am still Kinsey fan despite my disappointments in plot and character development.

This bugged me and left me frustrated.This is the first of the series that I read, and I am wondering do they all end this unfulfilling?If so, I think Q should be Quit, please."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"As a fan of Sue Grafton, I always wait with anticipation for the latest book in the &quot;Alphabet Murder&quot; series. From &quot;A&quot; to &quot;P&quot; Grafton never disappoints. In fact, I think her writing has gotten better with each book. Kinsey Milhone is a single, tough, intelligent private investigator in the town of Santa Teresa. Each book is a continuation of sorts of the last, but you don't need to start with A is for Alibi to appreciate the story. Unlike Lilian Jackson Braun, who spends three chapters explaining the background of her characters with each book, Grafton gives the reader credit for having some intelligence and offers up a rough explanation, and only when needed.Kinsey Milhone is the kind of woman I'd like to be; tough, intelligent, independent, and interesting. She doesn't bother with superficial people and with her, what you see is what you get. In &quot;P is for Peril,&quot; she is hired to find a man who has gone missing. The police have failed to turn up any leads, and his ex-wife wants to make sure that all the bases have been covered. After interviewing all the people in his life, Kinsey comes to the conclusion that he's probably dead and was involved in some shady dealings in his business practice. She accidentally discoveres the body, but proving he was murdered and who murdered him turns out to be a difficult task.Meanwhile, she has to move her office and in the process gets involved with some shady characters of another sort.Things are never dull in a Grafton book. I really like her stories. They are well-crafted and you are guessing right up to the end who the murderer is. All books have flaws, whether they be minor or major. Grafton's books have a lot of well-described characters, but my feeble mind has a hard time keeping track of who's who. I need to read it twice or take notes, but this is my problem, not a problem with the writing. This book was a slow starter, with Kinsey running around in circles not making much progress for the first half of the book, but the second half about makes up for it. Also, Kinsey's involvement with the characters from whom she rents a new office seems to have no relevance to the story. It seemed like an unnecessary, if somewhat riviting, diversion from the main plot.I give this book 4.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I'm in agreement with some of the others. This book just does not do it for me either. I'm a great Kinsey fan and usually Ms. Grafton's story are fast-paced and exciting. This one just isn't I figured out the stuff about one of Purcell's wives right from the beginning, so that probably didn't help. I found the stuff about double-dealing in the Health Care industry intersting, and that is why I gave this book a 3 instead of a 2. I also liked the chrasimatic landlords that Kinsey was involved with, but again, all that transpired there was pretty predictable as well.I will contine to read the series, but I hope Ms. Grafton gets her drive back again before &quot;Q&quot;. I'm finding the series is losing momentum."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I have enjoyed most of Sue Grafton's books, but this one totally disapointed me. Where was the epilogue? I know all books don't wrap up in a nice little package, but hers usually do. I felt I was missing an entire chapter. It was a nice rollercoaster ride that ended in poop."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Fiona Purcell hires Kinsey Millhone of Millhone Investigations to learn more about the disappearance of he highly respected former spouse Dr. Dow Purcell. Dow has been missing for more than two months and his ex-wife thinks he is doing the same trick he did to her when they were married. Reluctantly, Kinsey accepts the case, but wonders why the ex and not the current wife Crystal engages her services.One of Kelsey's first moves is to interview Crystal, who believes foul play occurred because Dow loves his two-year-old son and would never deliberately spend time away from him. As Kinsey delves deeper into the whereabouts of Dow, she finds out that Medicaid is investigating him for fraud. As she struggles with her missing person's case, Kinsey also has another case that simply threatens her life.Like the previous fifteen novels in this private detective series, P IS FOR PERIL is an exciting tale that shows the heroine can handle herself as well as her male counterparts. The multifaceted plot is fun to follow as the many interesting characters could easily be involved with Dow's disappearance. Sue Grafton has written another complex bestseller that will take the author to her usual spot at the top of the charts.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"One of my proudest days as a mystery writer came last summer when I participated on the same MWA/UCLA program as Sue Grafton. Several other writers were on that program, and P IS FOR PERIL perfectly demonstrates why we were all so thrilled to have Sue Grafton as our keynote speaker that day. In her latest Kinsey Millhone novel, Grafton has Kinsey hired by the ex-wife of an elderly doctor who has been missing for a number of weeks. The physician's current wife thinks he may be dead. While Kinsey is attempting to uncover the truth about that man's disappearance, peril cuts close to home. She becomes involved with a pair of twins who most likely murdered their parents. She discovers the truth about the twins, yet she also discovers she is more seriously entangled with them than she had first imagined. Grafton's P effort is one of her best. Her complex plot is swftly paced, and her characters continue ringing true. It is hard to imagine how Ms. Grafton will surpass this book's quality in her Q Kinsey Millhone mystery. P is perilously close to perfection."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"I am an avid fan of Grafton's A-O mysteries, and couldn't wait to dive into &quot;P is for Peril.&quot; I found the story satisfying enough, if you don't count Kinsey's sudden, albeit short-lived, transformation into an air-headed bimbo. (At times I didn't recognize her as the self-assured, no-nonsense character from the previous 15 books.) I was blind-sided, however, by the abrupt ending of the book. I read the last chapter twice trying to make sense of it. Then I returned to the beginning of the book and skimmed through each chapter trying to find what I must have missed in order to understand the ending.When a writer puts out a series of books like these, there should be a few constants the reader can hang his/her hat on. The wrap-up at the end, (&quot;respectfully submitted&quot;) is one of those constants, I think. I was SURE I got a defective copy that was missing the final chapter. I even took it back to the bookstore to exchange it for one that was complete......no such luck."},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"Readers of the Alphabet Sleuth series, regardless of how much they loved the previous books, might think that at some point Sue Grafton would eventually exhaust all ideas for the premise. Of course, having started reading the series just a year ago and devouring each installment, I didn't think Grafton would let that happen--she's too talented, right?Wrong.&quot;P is for Peril&quot; is, simply, a weak book. Even the anemic premise of Kinset Millhone looking for a man who's close to seventy years old is hard to swallow. Perhaps Grafton was hoping readers would take an interest in the aged, but the main plot of this story--an elderly man who's disappeared, leaving behinda young tart of a wife--is lame. There are characters who come into play, then inexplicably vanish, only to resurface with even less explanation. The secondary plot of Millhone's myserious love interest, Tommy, is just as boring, and grates the reader as Deitz is often mentioned, but never heard from. The resolution of both plot threads feels like a knot that was hastily tied, but won't hold together. In fact, even more questions are raised. For one, why did the killer (whose name I won't mention for those of you planning to read the book) kill Dr. Purcell in the first place? How did Purcell's stepdaughter get a hold of his ATM card, and what did she do with all the money? Who is this Paulie chick--who is quite interesting, by the way--and why didn't Grafton develop her more? In fact, almost all of the characters seem one-dimensional, which makes it very difficult for the writer to care much about them at all.I'm not writing nearly as much as I usually do when reviewing a book, because there simply isn't a whole lot that can be said about &quot;P is for Peril&quot;. The book is by far the weakest link in the alphabet series...and perhaps Grafton would be wise to make the next book a sequel to &quot;P&quot; in order to properly tie some loose ends: &quot;Q is for Questions Answered&quot;!"},{"Title":"P is for Peril (Abridged AudioBook)","review":"New readers might want to know that some of the characters and action (set in 1986) follow from J is for Judge, rather than from O is for Outlaw (the one about her ex-husband) and in fact she gives away the ending of J is for Judge.

Both the former authors are mystery writers, but only one is truly talented. This is my first experience with Sue Grafton and it will likely be my last.

It would have been easy to pull excerpts from sensationalized tell-alls on the True Crime shelf, but luckily that's NOT where Mr. Willis takes us. The writing of Peter Maas takes us into a money-making scheme gone bad, &quot;Joey&quot; explains how to set up a hit. For the story of Donnie Brasco, instead of going the easy route and plugging in an action chapter, the editor took an opening section from the book, on the mundane things that the FBI agent had to do to be accepted in his undercover role - fascinating. A mafia wife gives us a look from her perspective. The chapter from Casino avoids the casino itself and shows us instead how organized crime launders its money through semi-legitimate sources to get control of the casinos. One chapter discusses the tightrope relationship of a Don and his lawyer, another one shows the interplay between a mob informant and his FBI handler. It's all great stuff that you probably haven't seen before, and will likely motivate you to buy some of the source books.

There are selections by Peter Maas and William Kennedy. A section from Mario Puzo's \\"The Godfather,\\" accompanies a Fredrick Dannen report on \\"Defending the Mafia.\\"There are blood and gore sufficient to satisfy most appetites, as each selection entertains, informs, and above all, keeps the reader awake.We are told at the beginning that there is no such thing as an organization called \\"the Mafia.\\" Yet, some of the stories use the word as though there were. Maybe an unavoidable use when we recognize that Mafioso can be at war with each other so that, if the Mafia were an organization, some of its parts can become dysfunctional, threatening to tear the organization apart.Rather, being \\"Mafia,\\" the book's introductions tells us, represents an outlook, one in which personal honor and willingness to defend it, are far more important than civil law and peace, or of any personal code of virtue that doesn't place personal honor as paramount. Violation of a man's honor is to be redeemed by punishing the violator, perhaps by taking his life. In striking similarity with aspects we hear today of radical Islamism, a wife or sister violates the family honor by becoming pregnant out of wedlock, or consorting with the wrong types, often requiring that she be murdered to restore the family's (male) honor. It may be that this view of women in Islam and the Mafia code both arise from long-ago ideas about the sexes that prevailed in the eastern Mediterranean.Notwithstanding that sorry concepts like that about female \\"virtue\\" can motivate violent acts, this collection of vignettes makes for exciting reading that will satisfy just about anyone.Charles Tillinghast, author of \\"How Capitol Got the Beatles, and Then What Happened,\\" and \\"American Broadcast Regulation and the First Amendment.\\""},{"Title":"Mob: Stories of Death and Betrayal from Organized Crime (Unabridged Selections)","review":"This book is not unlike a buffet at a small office party. A few morsels here and there... most everything is pretty tasty, nothing's too filling, and there's one \\"mystery dish\\" that looks okay...... until you bite into it.Clint Willis has compiled a baker's dozen of mob-stories, from the infamous, to the you-never-heard-of-em. Some are great, some are good, and some might have been better to have been left on the table.On the infamous side is an excerpt from Mario Puzo's classic, THE GODFATHER. I've never read the book, but like any other self-respecting adult American male, I've seen the movie enough times to have lost count. After reading the excerpt in MOB, (regarding the memorable scene where Michael Corleone retrieves the gun from the restaurant bathroom and shoots the crooked cop in the head), I've discovered that I've GOT to read Puzo's book!Another interesting story comes from David Fisher. It comes from a book by \\"JOEY,\\" a long-time mob hit-man (though not a \\"made\\" man in the mob, because, as \\"Joey\\" tells it, as a member of the Jewish faith, he is ineligible to attain that level within the organization.) Still, he considers himself really good--and quite enjoys what he does for a living. And, it would appear that he's very much a psychopath. Whether one can believe everything that is written about JOEY is questionable, as there seemed to be a number of \\"facts\\" that contradicted other \\"facts,\\" but I guess that's for each reader to decide.I did actually SKIP one story: Bruce McCall's \\"GANGLAND STYLE: THE TRANSCRIPT.\\" Written in the format of a play, I became disinterested after about a page and a half of reading accented-goombah-speak spelled out phonetically.Jeffrey Goldberg's piece, THE DON IS DONE, is the final chapter in the book, and is the fascinating true story of the last days--along with some of the personal insights of mob boss, Paul Castellano... whacked, so the story goes, under the orders of the notorious John Gotti, Sr.All in all, MOB was a pretty enjoyable read. And because each of the stories stands completely by itself, you could theoretically finish a chapter, and pick the book up a year later without having to start over.- Jonathan Sabin"},{"Title":"Mob: Stories of Death and Betrayal from Organized Crime (Unabridged Selections)","review":"Only the most ardent organized crime reader probably won't find something new in this collection of short stories dealing with reader fascination with dangerous lifestyles. This sampler of mob-lore covers stories allegedly by the folks who lived and died it, and some history to add dessert to your meal.For those who like the relative safety of their reading chair, we get a step-by-step process of the so-called \\"hit men\\" of the mob. They are so-called because most members who have reached any decent level of leadership have all done at least one hit, so the true full-time professional is not that common. For this profession though, we do get an evolution of the man, and his general techniques.The stories here are excerpts from other works, so if your a mob junkie, you might have read a lot of it already. I previously had read the Sammy Gravano book that contributed this excerpt. You not only get a sample of the self-admitted bad man, but also a taste of what I didn't like in the full-length book, which was a constant jabbering of what a decent, honorable guy Sammy really is. This book, was, of course, before the guy got busted out West for running meth labs while in witness protection.My favorite of the \\"true life\\" stories was the one that inspired the movie \\"Donnie Brasco\\". Here we have the story of how a guy had to sacrifice a lot of family time over a period of years to do his undercover work, even once having to spend Christmas with mobsters when he promised his own family some quality Holiday time. The book I'm reviewing is good because now I want to read the whole \\"Brasco\\" saga.In the history part, we do get a brief glimpse of how this whole type of society came about. True, the people of Italy were extremely oppressed at the time of it's formation, but it also tells how the local culture first establishes male \\"honor\\", then expects him to prove it via competition, and if you won by using your own rules, that made you that much more of a worthy opponent. To his credit, the editor of this compilation does not glorify this behavior, and makes it clear to the audience that any honorable \\"codes\\" only last as long as is convenient for anyone involved."},{"Title":"Mob: Stories of Death and Betrayal from Organized Crime (Unabridged Selections)","review":"Fans of The Sopranos, the Godfather, and mob/crime fiction/nonfiction will find this Clint Willis-edited book a virtual Hometown Buffet of delicious crime treats. If you like mob fiction/nonfiction and don't read this you deserve to wake up with a horse's head in your bed.A sign of this book's huge success is that it truly leaves you wanting more. You'll be so fascinated that you'll DEFINITELY want to go to each of the primary sources and read them too. It's a fast, fascinating read: chapters comprised of well-edited excerpts from books, magazine articles and two works of fiction.I was especially fascinated (and motivated) by the excerpt from the fictional (I think) Godfather. I read the book when I came out, saw the flicks a zillion times but realized in reading this excerpt how great the original book was and how it differs from the movie (the Michael character actually seems stronger in the original story). I'll be re-reading that book soon.Every chapter is a gem and there are too many to go into here. My favorites included Peter Maas' excerpt from Underboss, the story of Sammy the Bull Gravano; an excerpt from mob hitman &quot;Joey's&quot; book Killer (the code of honor, precisely how he makes a hit with such efficiency and low risk); part of Nicholas Pileggi's Casino, describing how a horrified businessman one day found himself cemented to mob-connected business partners; Defending the Mafia, the eye-opening and ultimately sad story of mob lawyer Gerald Shargel's use of his considerable talent to keep mafiosos out of jail; part of Boss of Bosses, the bittersweet saga of aging Don Paul Castellano, eventually murdered by ambitious John Gotti's skilled associates; and the saddest and most poignent piece of all, Jeffrey Goldberg's The Don Is Done, about the lives of children of bigwig mafiosos.This book MOVES. And it'll send you scrambling to read more. A MUST to read or to gift."},{"Title":"Abomination","review":"Ambomination is an exellent book! It is hard for me to find books that I like and this book was great from the start! Ambomination is about a girl named Martha who is very different from the other children. Her mother makes her clothes and she can't invite anyone in the house because they might find out about Abomination. This book kept me reading because I wanted to know what Abomination was and what would happen to Martha. This book was the best book I ever read! Martha is beaten by her parents and starved so I would recomend this book to anyone who wouldn't mind reading about parents who beat and starve their children and I recomend this book to people that don't like reading. Trust me this book rocks!!!!"},{"Title":"Abomination","review":"Martha is bullied at school because of her clothes and introverted personality, but Scott is also new at this school, and feels sorry for Martha. Soon he, too, is being bullied by the other kids.In ABOMINATION, the bad guys are a religious extremist group that encourages child abuse, dictates what its parishioners wear, and regulates how they behave. It is a condemning look at a religious faction in which the families do not have television, computers, or cell phones.Twelve-year-old Martha is not allowed to have friends, and can never invite anyone to their house...they might learn of the actual Abomination that lives in the basement.Her older sister, Mary, was expelled from the family at age 16 for bad behavior, and now sends an occasional post card to Martha, which is promptly torn up by their father, and then retrieved and saved by Martha. Though Martha is required to feed and care for the Abomination, the identity of this creature is not revealed until near the end of the book.When Martha realizes what has actually happened with her sister, she and Scott decide to try to contact her, and the suspense kicks into high gear as the kids defy Martha's parents to right a terrible wrong.Swindells has crafted a compelling novel that will keep you reading to the very last page.Reviewed by: Grandma Bev"},{"Title":"Abomination","review":"Robert Swindells never fails to am axe. Cannot wait to teach this to my year 8 class in a couple of weeks. I will do my very best to do it justice!"},{"Title":"Abomination","review":"This is a total thriller and i loved it to bits.it's great how they keep you in suspense about what abomination is. I'm glad it was reccomended to me i would read it again1000000 times over!!"},{"Title":"Abomination","review":"What ticks me off about this book, is that it is so blatantly anti-religious, even more so than the amber spyglass. Amber spyglass was saying that god was evil, abomination is saying that christianity is destroying this kid's life. Which really isn't fair on normal christians, after all we aren't ALL extremists..."},{"Title":"The Knock-Knock Book: If I Hear God Knocking, Do You Think I Should Answer?","review":"This book is one that was meant to touch the hearts of the readers. The stories are as varied as the authors are different, so the reader has no time to get bored! I could read the book over and over again."},{"Title":"The Knock-Knock Book: If I Hear God Knocking, Do You Think I Should Answer?","review":"This book is a wonderful little haven of inspiration. These real stories of faith in everyday life will lift you up. Whether you give yourself the luxury of sitting and reading the entire work, or grab a few minutes to savor just one short story, you will go away feeling renewed in the spirit .... and listening for God's knock on your heart."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"This is the story of a husband and wife who adopted 12 children of mixed ancestry. Often just scraping by, they had a lot of love to share. Helen relates her experiences of dragging husband Carl along in the bumpy journey of building their family. Her tales of raising so many children, several of them the same age, through all the escapades that children can think up is funny and sweet at the same time, and often poignant. At the age of 10, I ordered this book through Scholastic book services. 27 years later, that tattered, dog eared, worn out book is lovingly stored in my keepsake box, though I take it out every year or so to re-read it. I still thrill to the opening words \\"I didn't yearn for a career, or maids and a fur coat, or a trip to Europe. All in the world I wanted was a happy, normal little family\\", as I settle in for the heartwarming read this book is. Because of reading this book, adoption was not such a daunting prospect; in fact, I hoped I would be able to adopt someday, a dream happily realized with my two beautiful children. The book is also a fascinating picture of the time period in American history, during the late 30's to the mid 50's, not to mention a glimpse at the life of a pastor's family. It provides insight into the prejudices of that time as well. My only regret is that I will never get to meet Mrs. Doss to tell her how much her book means to me. I think it should be required reading for all students, if only it would return to print!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"My Uncle Don was part of this family.....he is listed in this book that his mother Helen wrote. What a remarkable book.......what a remarkable family!!!! I am proud that this is part of my family heritage.

Then it somehow got misplaced, I actually cried the first time I tried to look for it and couldn't find it. This book has taught me so much about love and life. I always said that when I got older, even if I could have my own children, I would still adopt, and try to love as much as Helen and Carl did. I've tried to look for this book, but have been unable to find a copy. Besides the birth of my daughter, I think it would be the happiest day in my life if I could find a copy. If anyone out there has one, treasure it, because there are those of us out there who would be truly happy to have one."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was in 3rd grade and read it at least once every year after that through the 6th grade. I have not seen it for the past 30 years This book was the first book to really make an impression on me, and that impression has stayed with me to this day. After reading this book, I always thought I would adopt children when I &quot;grew up&quot;. I can't wait to introduce my 10- and 8-year-old daughters to my favorite book of all time. I just recently got a copy from my local library, although I thought I would never see it again. You cannot imagine how happy I was to find it on your website. THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"When I first saw this book, I thought it would be a book with big words that nobody understood. After the first few pages I couldn't wait to finish this book. The experiences that Helen had were unforgetable. I would recommend this book to parents who are going to adopt children. If you ever want to read a book about unconditonal love: read this book."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I hope some publishers sees all the reviews of this book and puts it back in print! I think I must have read this book about 100 times as a child. I haven't read it in years, as I no longer own it, but I still think of it often. I'm sure this book was an inspiration to many people to adopt children that &quot;nobody wanted&quot;, but in addition to being inspirational, it's great to read---full of details of life with a houseful of kids and not much money! So many details are still fresh in my mind---the Dosses eating that can of snake meat when they were ALL out of other food, the Christmas they were given all kinds of great toys for the kids, how the oldest son kept wanting a brother just his age...and many more! If you can get ahold of this book, you will like it!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"This book is wonderfull, full of love and triumph, through some very trying times, as well as alot of fun!

P.S. try a harvest book store, that is how I got my copy."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I always wondered how hard it would be for a man or woman, no matter how desperately s/he wanted children, to love a child with whom s/he did not have a physical bond. This book was the best story about adoption I've ever heard. Even though the family really couldn't afford so many children, the parents made their money stretch just a little further so that they could provide for another child in need of a family. I admire these parents and hope that when I have children, biological or otherwise, I hope that I can give them as good a home as these children obviously had."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"My mom read this to me when I was 5 and I can still remember some of the funny stories.

I reread it several times, and when I left home, I think Mom sold it in a garage sale. I've thought about it often over the years, and would love to have a copy again, so that I could reread it. I'm amazed that so many other people felt the same way about the book as I did. I can't believe that it's out of print!! What a wonderful story for all time!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I bought this book when I was in jr. high school (1975).

I loaned my copy to someone and it was never returned. A pity because, I would like to share it with my stepchildren. I also located the Life article about the family, when I was in high school (25 years ago) at a local university library and found it excellent. Check the periodicals index from the year (listed in the book) that the Doss's were named family of the year. The story has always been inspirational, not just because of the love shown by the family towards each other, but because of the faith they showed in the face of seemingly insurmountable problems. Their faith in the rest of the world, to both help them, and eventually, accept them as they are, is an example we can all use."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I read this book 35 years ago and still have my copy. I bought it through the Scolastic Book Service, when I was in 5th grade. I logged on to this web site hoping to locate a copy for a wonderful friend who just completed the adoption process for the latest of six children. He and his wife didn't need the book for inspiration, but it would be the perfect compliment to their own life story. I'll keep searching."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I read this book over 25 years ago as a young child and have read at least 10 or more times since then.

And if you get the chance to read it, do."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I am 17 and I have read and reread this book.

It is my favorite book and I have never felt such a wonderful love of reading then when I read this book."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

I also would like to find a copy of the Life magazine that featured the Doss family as &quot;Family of the Year&quot;."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I'm 15 and have been reading and rereading this book since at least grade school. I love it and wish my copy hadn't lost its cover!! I've read it at least five times, and it gets better every time!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"This is the most moving book I have ever read. It is also my wife's favorite book. She spent a significant amount of dollars buying a copy about ten years ago. The writing is good but it is the story that jumps off the page. The author and her family are incredible yet the story is told with extreme modesty. If more people read this book the world would be less egocentric."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"When I was in fifth grade, I remember I was sitting in music class when the librarian stopped by to ask me to return this book. One of the teachers wanted to use it in class, and I'd had it out so long, no one else could get a shot at it!I was an only child, very bookish and introverted. I read and reread this book. I married a guy who planned to become a Methodist minister (like Helen Doss) and we have four bio kids and two adopted from Haiti. I always wanted to adopt, which I'm sure came from this book. I was probably drawn to my husband at least partly because of the warm and fuzzy feeling about Methodist pastors that I had from this book.Reading things as a kid, you pick up on the stuff you like and ignore the stuff you don't. The Dosses adopted most of their kids as babies (with some exceptions). They did have some difficult issues one summer when they took a Native American boy in for a vacation in their family. I ignored this part of the book, focusing on the wonderful and easy other kids. We adopted an older boy from Haiti and it's been rough for him and for us. I should have paid more attention when I was reading, maybe . . . We also adopted a baby girl, and that's been great.One of my favorite books ever. I didn't know there was a new edition with updates on the family--I'll have to get it just for the updates, although I own an older copy. By the way, my parents never ever talked to me about racism. We had no friends of different races. I imagine I formed my beliefs that \\"we are all brothers\\" regardless of color, mostly from this book."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"Heartwarming! I absolutely love this book. Helen Doss and her family have touched so many lives over the years with their story of what love and family, commitment and priorities are all about. As a teenager I read a copy of my mother's that I still have. Over the years I have spoken with other people who had read the book and was looking for a copy of it. After combing garage sales and book sales without finding even one copy, I was so happy to see that this book is back in print!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I was an avid reader as a child, I still am. If I could point to one book in my lifetime that I have read that made an impact on the way I look at life it would be The Family Nobody Wanted by Helen Doss. I read it when I was around 10 or 11 years old. The story was about a girl and her brother and sister who were adopted after losing their parents. The adoptive parents were older, and had no children. Being a teenager myself, I could relate to all the emotions that the oldest girl was feeling. It gave me a new appreciation for my parents (my dad was adopted) and a new appreciation for my 2 brothers and one sister. I am not the oldest, but I feel like the oldest. Not only is their love in a family, but responsibility. This book taught me that it might not be easy going in a family, but life is easier when you have people to love. If there is no other book that I get for my two sons, it will be this one."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"Great book from my wife's childhood. Her original copy fell apart after many years of use. This replacement was just what she wanted."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"The Family Nobody Wanted is a most incredible book! This is a true story about a woman and her husband who adopt 12 children of various races in the 40's and 50's. I first read this book in junior high school, back in the 1970's. I thought \\"gosh, how wonderful it would be to adopt so many children, and such a rainbow of children!\\" Fast forward a couple of decades - my husband and I have adopted 4 children; one daughter from Guatemala, a son from South Korea, another daughter who is African-american, and a baby boy who is bircial. I have thought about this book thru the years, but could never find it. Luckily, one day I DID find it on amazon.com, and immediately purhcased it. I loved reading it again, and my husband read it too. I treasure this book, and won't let it out of my sight!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"The Family Nobody Wanted is about the family of Helen and Carl Doss and the twelve children they adopted. Two children were Caucasian, the rest different combinations of Mexican, Japanese, Filipino, Indian, Asian and other nationalities. I first read this book over twenty years ago, and I love it as much now as I did then. This is a great book to read for anyone considering adoption or becoming a foster parent. Helen and Carl Doss had so much wisdom and caring about raising a family of such assorted children. It puts you in a good mood reading this kind of book. You get the feeling that yes, people really can get along."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"Helen Doss tells it like it was in the early days of adopting children who were considered to be unadoptable. A beautiful story of love and faith going against all the odds in obtaining a wonderful family.

I loved all books,but this book was special. It was the first book that I ever read and reread. My Mother read it to see what I was raving about. She to thought this book was wonderful. During my childhood I reread this book more times then I can count,so did my Mom. The story is touching,moving and just plain-great. In my teens,my best friend read it and also fell in love with this book and this story. Thru many years both my mom and my friend would call me up and say\\"can I borrow The family nobody wanted book, I'n having a bad day, I need to be cheered up. So this book was passed back and forth over many many years.

Since my huband and I are in the process of adopting, I browsed Amazon on adoption and found the new edition of the book. I was thrilled to read the new copy would have an update on the family. I was disapointed when I received my copy to find just a few pages. So one of them became a computer programmer? I expected more. After all the time that has passed, the kids in the book are grandparents now.

The pile was going to be taken to the recycling factory, the next day. An avid reader, my interest was not only in the amount of books sitting there in boxes, but also in the many old and worn looking books. Being told I could look through and take any books I wanted, I quickly picked up one called &quot;The Family Nobody Wanted&quot; by Helen Doss, and continued looking. On the way home I started reading the book and haven't put it down. Since that cloudy day over five years ago, I continue to read and enjoy the story of Helen Doss and her wonderful family. I am inspired over and over as she displays constant joy and patience in her children. I've always wanted a large family, and with her as my hero, I hope to one day be a mother to twelve children also!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I started to read this book in 5th grade in school and never got to finish it.

My sister and I take turns keeping it. It is a shame it is not in print any longer. I had no idea that so many other people felt the same way I did. I thought no one knew about this book.

It is a wonderful book and very well written."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"Although not a great literary work, &quot;The Family Nobody Wanted&quot; compensates for lack of intellectually challenging subject matter by pathos alone, enriching the reader's empathy. Written in a sweeping, brusque, 1950's style of sentiment, its underlying backbone of sincerity connects with familial humor to produce a worthwhile novel. It successfully leaves the reader satisfied and even mildly inspired by the Doss Family's example of patient trust in Divine Providence."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I was VERY disappointed and, at first, pretty confused when I discovered the haphazard way this edition of the book is put together. Less than one quarter into the book, approximately 20 pages come up missing. Upon searching for them, I found other pages printed twice (some 20 pages), but the missing pages were NOT there. It was early into the story, and I was disappointed not to be able to get the whole story on such an admirable, loving, Christian family. The binding is new; pages were NOT torn out. It was actually bound this way!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"The quality of the product was said to be like new but the cover is torn around the edges, although all the pages are not bent and in good condition. Other than the conditon of the cover I am very satisfied with the purchase. The delivery was quick and I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I first read this book at the age of 10, after ordering it from Scholastic book services. I have since read it uncountable numbers of times, each re-reading bringing warm feelings at the familiar passages. This reprint has been highly anticipated, as I had wondered for years what had happened to the Doss family after the end of the book. It is the story of a man and a woman, and their desire for a family. But it is also much more. It is the tale of the strength found in a loving family, a family made by love and not biology. It is a reminder that we are all family, flesh and blood or not, skin color and ancestry aside. And it is filled with the humor that only small active children can provide! I highly recommend this book for readers of all ages, and would suggest it to families to read aloud together."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"In 1991 our local high school was selling off some old books from their library. I picked up a book with a rather sad looking cover. Upon opening it I saw that it was titled, \\"The Family Nobody Wanted\\" and it was covered in scribble. The scribble on this 1954 copyright says this, \\"Wonderful book to read! This well be one of the best books you have ever read! Oh Yea!; Good Book, Read it!; This book is real cool!; This book is great and great for a book report!; Kid! Read this book! It is stunning!; Notice everybody! This is the a real cool book, so people take head and read this book!; This is a great book and you will not regret reading it!\\" There are about 20 more reviews written throughout the book by high school students. With that in mind I figured I had better buy it for the 25 cents they were asking. I was so delighted to read it but had misplaced it just short of finishing during a move. My husband has read it and cried, laughed, giggled, all while learning what a struggle this family must have gone through to adopt and deal with prejudices. I have recently found it in our move to Germany and I am over joyed to have finished it finally. I hold this book as a treasure in my life representing the true nature of humanity. What a wonderful story! Thanks for trusting your instincts Helen Doss and sharing your personal life with us! What a blessing."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"Only my closest friends are given the privilege of borrowing this delightfully written true story; the long out-of-print and (before the days of the internet) irreplaceable book has been one of my most closely guarded treasures since childhood. Any family with several small children, of course, will have a store of hilarious anecdotes; children raised with love combine insouciant joy with freedom from adult assumptions and habits of thought, so that any house full of love and children is a house full of unpredictability and laughter. But Helen Doss, unlike most parents, can capture her children in her writing and pass the joy on to us. I don't know anyone who has managed to read the book through without at some point laughing to the point of tears.But the book is much more than a connection of Readers' Digest anecdotes strung together. Ms. Doss reveals, through deft and honest touches, her own weaknesses and struggles, her impetuosity and her grit. She communicates with power the pain that can come in so many different ways to a woman with a tremendous need to love, especially when obstacles - infertility, unreasonable adoption agencies, poverty - rise up to keep her from satisfying that need. And the portrait of her husband Carl, who changes as much as the children do, is vivid and telling. The Carl who says, \\"Let's take \`em all\\" at the end of the book is a very different Carl from the one who agrees to the first adoption largely to humor his wife and to keep her from moping weepily and endlessly about the house, and whose annual refrain for many years is, \\"This is the last one!\\" You expect him to come on board, of course; but his path is a bit surprising and most revealing of the essence of the man. In particular his ability to close ranks against outside inteference shows the degree to which his love for his family is as strong as his wife's, however differently it might be expressed.As a family memoir alone, it would be a classic. But because the children were of mixed racial ancestry - in the \`forties and \`fifties - the Doss family became an unwilling catalyst for the ignorance and prejudice of the time. It is part of the Doss magic that the love in the family was strong enough to triumph over the unpleasant incidents, so that those incidents enriched, rather than poisoned, the Doss childhoods. (Not that this made them less unpleasant, of course.)The book is never preachy. Nevertheless, it is a vivid documentary of how racism was built into the attitudes of even \\"nice\\" people of that time. It is a sermon of a kind, a sermon lived out in the lives of the Doss family. It is a primer on how to overcome evil with good, a standing lesson to a nation still struggling with racial resentment.But the genuinely remarkable thing is that, despite the frequent intrusions suffered by the family from racially prejudiced outsiders, the book is not about race. No doubt this is because the Doss family was never about race. When the book crosses your mind in the days after you've closed it - and it will, frequently - it will not be as a book about race. It will be as a book about a uniquely special family and about the triumph of love and joy and grace and laughter over whatever might vainly try to overcome them."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"When I recieved this book as a gift from my brother(see Ken Pierce's Review) I actually cried from happiness. I had no idea he was the one who had taken the battered copy from our family home, and have searched for the last fifteen years for another one. I had finally given up, and simply told my children, &quot;If you never get to read it, you will have missed one of the greatest books ever written.&quot; It's re-release is a blessing that I am glad to share with them.The new addition has a forword by Mary Battenfield which, unfortunately, makes this book sound like a social justice primer. Instead it is a book of love, joy, and laughter in situations that &quot;should&quot; have left the author and her family bitter instead of blessed.When I first read this book I was too young to truly understand racism, and was simply gripped by the way Mrs. Doss made her children come to life in my mind. I could relate to the children, as their personalities, not their race, gave each a unique voice.Now that I am an adult, I understand that the Dosses had a wisdom, love, and faith that transcended their culture. The family and the book prove that one doesn't have to preach to change the world. I can truly say that my life is better from having been introduced to both."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I'd recommend this book to just about anyone. It really gives a good overview of racial issues from that time period. It shows how the family struggles with financial, personal and especially racial issues. The best part about this autobiography is that it is 100% non-fiction! It's just wonderful! However, I wouldn't recommend this book to somebody who is looking for a challenge, because The Family Nobody Wanted, by Helen Doss, is written in an organized, simple manner. It's perfect for anyone of any age!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I read Helen Doss' heartwarming book in grade school and am thrilled to see it back in print. Carl and Helen Doss, a young couple struggling to get Carl through divinity school, adopt a baby boy. Without really planning it, they adopt eleven more children!Mrs. Doss' book is more than just a memoir of her precious children; it's also an indictment of a social service system that, through prejudice, denied who-knows-how-many mixed-race children loving homes. So many couples could have known the joy of children and given loving homes to them in return. Her book helped raise awareness and open doors (and hearts) to the needs of \\"unadoptables.\\" Thanks to families like hers, those policies are now dead.I've thought of the twelve adoptees over the years, and wondered how their lives turned out. Mrs. Doss gives an update of sorts in this new, revised addition, but left out more detail for privacy concerns. I hope one of them decides to expand on mom's work someday. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"This book is very heartwarming and can touch anyones heart. This book talks about a couple that can't have children so then they go to another option which is adoption. First of all they are a very poor couple and can barely afford food. They go apply for adoption and get declined they then fix the problems with their financial needs and then apply again getting approved. They get their first baby boy, Donny. They have trouble taking care of him since their very afraid of 'breaking one of his bones'. But they get through after that they apply for MORE AND MORE children and go through troubles along the way. At the end they adopt 12 CHILDREN and get in an article in a magazine. This book was really nice and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a comforting story..."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"This book was impossible to put down! It is such a treasure! The Doss family encountered persecution and misunderstanding on account of adopting their children. They were strong, though, and kept bringing more children (most of them of different nationalities and ethnicities) into their home. In all, they adopted twelve! The book tells of some of the adventures of the Doss family, and how they adopted each of the children. It was inspiring, and I even found it humorous in some parts! This book shows what a beautiful thing adoption is, both for parents and children. I strongly urge you to read this book!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I have read a number of books but none that has touched my heart as this. I bought the book at a garage sale when I was 10 years old, due to fire I lost the book a few years ago, and miss it terribly! If you have never read this book you must! Helen has done such a wonderful job at capturing the essence of her story on paper, few can match. Her story of hard times, love, and endurance is so powerful, I cried. I cry now at the thought of not being able to share such a wonderful story with my daughter. If you have a copy of this book, be sure to treasure it always."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I'd read this book back in 1976! 0ver time, I'd also given it away and decided that I wanted to have it back on my bookshelf! I love the story and it shows how a couple who were unable to have children of their own went out on a limb and adopted children whom nobody else wanted! It's such a down-to-earth story! This shows how one can learn acceptance of other people who are diverse in race & nationality! I would recommend this book for anyone! I'm really glad that I took the time to order this book again!

It's worth it!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I read this book several times when I was in high school many years ago. It was one of the factors that influenced my husband and me to adopt several Asian children, all of them now grown. I was surprised and saddened to read in the newspaper some years ago that Helen and Carl Doss had divorced. No mention was made of where their grown children were living at that time or what they were doing. I'd love to read a sequel to this book but I doubt that there will ever be one."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"What a wonderful book. I first read it in the 1960s.

It is a wonderfully told story that inspired and influenced me in many ways. I highly recommend this book for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"Like many other people here, I stumbled upon this book at my neighborhood library when I was probably about 12 or 13 and decided to check out what looked like an interesting story. It turned out to be about a minister and his wife who, unable to have children of their own, adopt a large family of children, mostly of mixed race and a few with physical or emotional disabilities, during the 1940s and 1950s. The book was written by Helen Doss, the wife and mother of the family, in a very entertaining storyteller's style that is a fast, funny and entertaining read. Despite the fact that daddy Carl is a minister, there's very little of a \\"preachy\\" nature in the book and instead there's many lessons in tolerance, both racial and otherwise, as well as funny stories about the joys and chaos of having a large family. Even though I had little interest in motherhood or raising a family when I read the book, I thought it was funny and heartwarming like a good Disney movie.As an adult, I still think this is a very good book but I can see that the author likely left out or glossed over some of the strains that came with this life, including lack of money. Once you understand economics you begin to realize that these people barely had enough money to support themselves and you wonder how they managed to keep everybody clothed and fed, despite them winning a major prize package from Life Magazine at one point. Also, as some reviewers have noted, mom Helen is constantly pushing to bring home \\"just one more\\" child over her husband's desire, very realistic in light of their meager income, to limit the size of their family. The fact that Helen always manages to bring home the new kid anyway and that Carl seems OK with that looks like a happy ending, but one has to wonder what dynamic was actually going on there, especially given that Carl sold a lucrative business to become a poor preacher when he and Helen were newlyweds. I later read online that the couple had gotten divorced in 1964 and while I didn't want to read too much into that, and it didn't seem acrimonious, it didn't surprise me that much either.Finally, readers (or parents giving the book to their kids to read) should be aware that you'll need some knowledge of the historical and cultural backdrop to understand some parts of the book dealing with prejudice against the Japanese just after WWII and with prejudice against African-Americans at several points in the book, notably where the family tries to adopt a half-African-American girl and has to give up the attempt in the face of red tape and criticism even from their close friends and relatives. The book doesn't spend a lot of time explaining these situations since it was written in an era when many people still had the biased attitudes portrayed in the book. Someone who doesn't know that might be a little baffled or hurt though. The book also doesn't get into the social dynamics of adoption very deeply (i.e. none of the kids go looking for their birth moms or anything) so it's a little simplistic in that regard."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I read this book many years ago as a child. The way Helen Doss describes how her family comes together, how the children of different ethnic backgrounds become brother and sister, and how all of them form the family the kids, Helen and her husband so craved, is just beautiful. I think it is in part due to this novel (which my sister and I wore out from reading it so many times) that I am inspired and determined to create a family through adoption. For anyone who is afraid of adopting children of different backgrounds, or afraid of adoption in general, you can see the beauty of it through Helen Doss' eyes."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I first read this book as a teenager and have always loved and been moved by the story of a young virtually broke couple who managed to change how adoptions are done in this country. Helen Doss' account of adopting twelve children, most of whom are of mixed race is both humorous and sweet. She is able to find humor in the most stressful of circumstances whether dealing with a flooded basement, nursing kids sick with chicken pox, or dealing with the trials and tribulations of toddlers. This edition is wonderful because it includes updates about the lives of her kids today. This is a wonderful read and a great book for those who have adopted."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"One of my all time favorites. I've read it many times over the last 25 years!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I would have to credit this family...this book....this story...for the creation of my own family. I first read this book as a nine year old with a Scholastic copy from my classroom library. That was 44 years ago. Because of the Doss Family, I was determined to make adoption a part of my own family. Today I have two internationally adopted children. I will never forget the dismay in the face of our first home study caseworker when she asked why we had turned to adoption. 'It was always in my family plan,' was my response. And I told her about this book and Marjorie Margulies' story of her Vietnamese/Cambodian adoptions, 'They Came to Stay'. Remarkable moms to emulate."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I read this book in my teens and LOVED it then. I thought of it often in the years that followed. This book can renew your love for the whole human race. It is heart-warming in the best sense of the word. The conversational tone makes it a quick read, but you will want to read it again and again.It tells the true story of a couple who are unable to conceive and set about to adopt children. The standard policy of the time (1940's - 1950's) was to place children in homes with parents of the same race. When the couple learns of this policy, they are surprised and vehemently object, promising the adoption agencies that the race of the child would make no difference to them. In time, they break down the objections of the agencies and nurture a growing family of children of many races and backgrounds - - providing a lesson in love and equality to the people around them."},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"My mom read this book when she was young, and it inspired her to later have 15 children (9 of them adopted, from different races/cultural backgrounds). This book is so warm, heartfelt and inspiring (especially when you consider the decade in which it was written). The author is a great story-teller, using her family's up's/down's, sad moments, comedic moments for the basis of her story. I only wish that the \\"preface\\"/family update (new to this edition) was longer and more specific.... However, after years of being out of print, I am so happy to see that it is being published again. A must read!!!"},{"Title":"The Family Nobody Wanted","review":"I read this book in junior high and fell in love with the idea of a family created from so many orphaned children. At the time I read it I decided that even if I did have biological children I'd try and convince my husband to adopt at least one child. As fate would have it, I haven't ever gotten married but three and a half years ago I adopted a beautiful baby girl from Russia. This book was the real beginning of that journey for me. What a blessing!"},{"Title":"Gordon Brown","review":"It is nothing unusual for a modern British prime minister to be surrounded by jealous and manipulative rivals who are after his (or in the most striking instance her) job. The post is not, strictly speaking, a directly elected one like president of the United States or president of France. Following a general election, or occasionally the departure of the incumbent from office, the monarch summons the leader of the party with a majority in the Commons, or failing that the leader of another party that looks possibly able to form a government, and asks him or her to do so. Established practice in the matter is clear and always adhered to, but in the last resort it is a matter of convention not of statute.So the trick is to become leader of the right party. Throughout the 20th century the dominant party was the Conservative party, which has a record of deposing its leaders worthy of imperial Rome. Since 1997 there now seems to be at least a serious possibility that it has lost its hegemony, and Labour has not had enough time in office through the mere 100 years of its existence for generalisations in this respect to be made with any confidence. The old Labour party was factious and fractious but never in the end did the deed. With Blair's electorally-dominant 'New' Labour I think we are waiting to see what happens this time. Blair effectively stole a march on Gordon Brown for the leadership, but there was apparently some sort of deal, or understanding at least, between them that he would, or might, or could possibly, hand over the premiership to Brown. What this deal amounted to depends on who you listen to. What is perfectly clear is that the current governance of Britain is characterised by intense partisan infighting between the two and their respective votaries. I'm quite sure it all loses nothing in the telling by the all-pervasive political commentators, but I'm just as sure that they are not inventing it. At a recent meeting of the parliamentary Labour party the mildest and most docile members lost patience and told the pair of them with scant respect or civility to stop the whole nonsense.For this the upstarts deserve our thanks in more ways than one. In particular even those who routinely follow politics with some interest are suffering a severe overload of obsessional garrulity from the pundits, and I would personally attribute declining popular interest in political issues not least to that. This particular book is still warm off the presses and you can obtain it at remaindered prices already. I gather there are others on the same topic, and some are allegedly 'better', but for anyone whose tolerance stretches to one only this one will do not badly at the right price. The book sketches in Brown's background and makes a half-hearted attempt at explaining some facets of his personality on this basis. I imagine any reader's guess in that respect is as good as the author's. Here is a man with a compulsion to dominate but severely lacking in self-confidence, a man who wants the most public office in the land but who is secretive in a most peculiar way - attempts at finding anything embarrassing in sexual respects have come up with nothing and I would guess that the secretiveness is more a matter of hiding possible failures than anything of that sort. Where the book reads convincingly is in presenting a coherent picture of its subject. Whether the coherency has been purchased at some cost in over-simplification I couldn't say, but I should think almost certainly. The style is literate and easy to read despite some signs of haste, and the writer is clearly well informed. I would not expect him to give clues as to his sources in many cases, but he could have raised this book to another level entirely if he had marshalled his arguments more systematically. The book is replete with accounts of meetings that Mr Bower was not present at, and it regularly attributes thoughts, reactions and motivations to Brown that even his inmost coterie would have had to conjecture. What I would have liked Mr Bower to do would have been to show the basis and development of his own reasoning, how he weighs up this or that statement or piece of behaviour, and what differing degrees of confidence he has in coming to various conclusions. Presenting it all as fact detracts from the interest of the book as an analysis. Also the general picture begins to seem odd after a while. Throughout the book Blair is depicted almost entirely as giving way to Brown, and I would need some convincing of that. Another aspect that is partly welcome and partly unsatisfactory is the detail given of Brown's economic management. If there were quite as many gross errors as there seem to have been then he has been extremely lucky - by comparative standards, which are all we've got, this government has contrived to seem more competent than most in that respect.The picture I ended with is of a man I wouldn't want as prime minister in his current frame of mind, seething with frustrations, harbouring obsessive grudges and full of unresolved contradictions. Whether achieving his final goal would exorcise some of these phantoms I can't tell. My guess before the recent general election would have been that Blair had decided to block him if he could, as 50 years ago Attlee made sure he blocked Morrison. My guess now is that Blair no longer can."},{"Title":"Becoming Me: A Story of Creation","review":"As the world increasingly breaks with the habitual patterns of its prescribed roles, there is a need to describe the process of casting off the shackles of compromising conformity, and this book does this both simply and elegantly.

We replace 'stupid' with 'silly'. It seems more appropriate that way."},{"Title":"The Stupids Step Out","review":"\\"The Stupids Step Out\\" is a story about Mr. and Mrs. Stupid, their two children and their dog named Kitty. One day, Mr. Stupid decides to take the family on a road trip. They get dressed up in outlandish clothes and then head for the car. The family rides on the outside of the car while the dog drives. They go to visit their grandparents but Grandpa Stupid does not recognize them. They do some window shopping and then stop at a cafe and all have a mashed potato sundae with butterscotch syrup. They walk home on their hands (I don't know what happened to the car) and then dress up like clowns before they go to bed. The final page of the book shows the entire Stupid family in one bed with their feet perched on pillows and their heads covered up with blankets.I don't think this book would qualify as excellent children's literature, but it is a wonderful treat and will certainly put a smile on your face. This book is just plain SILLY...not necessarily stupid.Parents must explain the difference between using the word \\"stupid\\" to imply that a person lacks intelligence as opposed to using the word to mean ridiculous, absurd and silly. It is never OK to call a person \\"stupid\\" in a way that will make him feel bad about himself.I like to see a child smiling and laughing as they are reading a book.

The word Stupid in itself is awful and shouldn't be used. My 5 year old who is in all day kindergarden had a project this week...to turn off the television and to read books. I took my daughter to the library today and we did a scavenger hunt of 8 authors....Harry Allard was one of those authors. Viola Swamp was easy to understand...but the Stupid Family isn't. How can people give praise to a story that makes fun of stupid people. Stupid is a very hateful word. Kids shoulnd'nt use the term STUPID at all."},{"Title":"The Stupids Step Out","review":"My 7 year old recently brought this book home from his school library. I found it very offensive, because I think it teaches children that it's funny to call others \\"stupid\\". I cannot think of a circumstance in which it is appropriate for a child or an adult to use this word towards another person. I was so upset that I wrote a note to the school librarian."},{"Title":"The Stupids Step Out","review":"I'm a teenager,(18) and my Mom read all the Stupids books to me when I was little. I loved them then, and I still do now. Mom thought they were as funny as I did! Now when I babysit I read them to the kids, who love them also! I think reading is very important to kids, and the Stupids can get them interested. Some people(adults) have a problem with the family being named the Stupids. I think it is a unjustified concern. Now a days there are many more insults kids could use that are a lot worse than just &quot;Stupid&quot;. I explain to the kids I babysit that the books are just for fun, and it is'nt nice to go around calling people stupid, and they understand. Just in case, I also check with their parents before I read them to the kids, and have had no objections. The Stupids will always be my favorite children's books, and I can't wait to read them to my own children."},{"Title":"The Stupids Step Out","review":"This is a GREAT book. Very funny and written to be so. And check out the publication date. I don't think that this book would probably get published in this age of political correctness (not to mention the fact that most school librarians came to their current positions after the book was bought), but there is a reason it is still in print -- kids love it. Now, obviously, there are other books for kids to read -- ones more educational or high toned or whatever. But we can't eat meat and vegetables all the time. Sometimes we want dessert and this book does just that with all its laughs."},{"Title":"The Stupids Step Out","review":"The stupid step, out Written by Harry Allad, was the funniest book I have ever read. Stanley Q Stupid had an idea. He called all stupid and said \`we are stepping out's they took a bath. Petunia asked way there wasn't water. The reason was that with water they would get their clothes wet. They got in the car and went to their grandparents house. The grandpa didn't know who they were. \`Where is grandma? Asked buster. In the closet, said grandpa. Then they left. They saw themselves in the mirror. \`Don't stare at those people, kids \\" they said. Then they went to eat and then they went home. They got ready for bed and thanked god for a nice day liked it because it was funny and it had a kid's sense of humor like when the dog drove the car. I recommend this book to people who like to laugh and be silly. You should read this book it is great!"},{"Title":"The Stupids Step Out","review":"I have found that The Stupids isn't necessarily a BAD book. It really points out to children the things that shouldn't be done, and any sensible person will know to tell their children not to go around calling people names just because of the book. I would also say that this book should be read for age groups of no younger than 2nd grade...so that they can understand the nature of the story and the context in which to take The Stupids. I hope this helps people. :)"},{"Title":"The Stupids Step Out","review":"Ha ha, even just thinking of this book makes me laugh. I had this book when I was a child (I am now 32,) and it was my favorite! It still is my favorite, and somehow lost the copy I had as a child, so I ordered it from Amazon for my then unborn daughter. I read it to her and she looks at the pictures, but she's only 6 months old right now. But I'm sure she'll love it as much as I do. The Stupids are so absurdly silly. They have framed pictures in their house that are labeled something else, such as a picture of a tree labeled \\"Flower,\\" the children try to go upstairs by sitting on the banister, the whole family takes a \\"bath\\" together fully clothed without any water, and so on. Fun and light-hearted, their silly antics delight any child and any child at heart."},{"Title":"The Stupids Step Out","review":"I can't believe the uberPC people posting here.

Thomas of Master's Seminary (www.tms.edu) writes a book that should appeal to cessationist viewpoint of the gifts of the Spirit as found in 1 Corinthians 12-14. The book is a verse by verse, expositional and theological commentary on these famous chapters that have blessed charismatics and confused non-charismatics.Dr. Thomas takes on the tough questions that 1 Corinthians 12-14 brings to mind especially for those who believe that the manifestation gifts were for the early church only and ceased with the completion of the New Testament canon. His conclusion is that Paul was writing to correct the Corinthians and while there is application for today from his advice, the sign gifts are no longer in operation as found in the New Testament Church.This book is a great theological book on the cessationist viewpoint but it is tough reading. Dr. Thomas is a theologian and his writing reflects his earnest committment to that study. I give this a book a four only because of this difficult nature. I find this type of book a thrill whereas most Christians may find it a bore."},{"Title":"Understanding Spiritual Gifts: A Verse-by-Verse Study of 1 Corinthians 12-14","review":"Thomas has done a real service to the church with this book. The exegesis is solid, readable & helpful. The appendices add gravy to the book & are very helpful in aiding believers in discovering what their own gifts are today. This is a 'must have' for any pastor, teacher or discipler's library."},{"Title":"Understanding Spiritual Gifts: A Verse-by-Verse Study of 1 Corinthians 12-14","review":"This book, Understanding Spiritual Gifts, by Robert L. Thomas, is one of the best biblical studies on a specific subject that I have read in quite some time. It is a revised and updated edition of his 1978 book by the same title. Thomas calls this book A Verse-by-Verse Study of 1 Corinthians 12-14, but I found it to be much more than that.After a short overview of 1 Cor. 12-14, Thomas jumps right into a very careful and extremely organized verse-by-verse study of the Apostle Paul's answers to questions he had received from the Corinthian church concerning spiritual gifts and their use when the church gathered for services. Fortunately for us here in the 21st Century, Paul, guided by the Holy Spirit, provided much more on spiritual gifts than just the answers to the questions he had received. Thomas has included a generous use of footnoting which leads the reader to an impressive Endnotes section. This section alone provides a wealth of detailed study information on spiritual gifts.This book was clearly not written to explore all of the possible interpretations and opinions on the subject of spiritual gifts. That would probably require volumes of material and this was not Thomas' stated goal. What is included is the results of what must have been an exhausting exegetical study of the three chapters in 1 Corinthians, the other supporting NT information in Ephesians 4:7-16, Romans 12:3-8, and 1 Peter 4:10-11, and appropriate additional language information from other Bible scholars. Thomas doesn't keep the reader guessing about where he is leading to theologically and makes no pretense about his findings, clearly spelling that out early in the book.In addition to the actual verse-by-verse study, which covers almost half of the book, Thomas has also included six individual appendices that address special aspects of spiritual gifts (such as the revelatory gifts and their relationship to the NT Canon and one that covers how to discover and use your spiritual gifts). Each appendix is written as a separate study of its own.I really appreciated the effort Thomas put into this book. He includes background information I haven't seen elsewere. Finding small gems like this make reading these kinds of books exciting and very worthwhile. D.A. Carson's book on this subject is another one with great study information.I have to admit that I was extremely disappointed with one aspect of Understanding Spiritual Gifts, and it's my guess that Thomas had little or nothing to do with this failure. I'm going to hang this poor decision on the publisher, Kregal Publications. Their choice of typeface and how the material was arranged on each page, in my opinion, damaged an exceptional book. The thin and lightly printed lettering made each page of the book an absolute chore to read. Additionally, the publisher squeezed the lines and paragraphs together so much that I became cross-eyed at times trying to follow the text. Thomas included a lot of material and it very well may have been the publisher's intent to minimize the length of the book as a cost savings (just short of 300 pages). I don't know if the original 1978 publication was printed like this too, but this was inexcusable and definitely detracted from the book's overall presentation.It seems there are almost as many positions on spiritual gifts as there are individuals who write about them, and so I imagine Thomas' conclusions will be embraced by some and rejected by others. Unfortunately, some won't even make the effort to actually read Thomas' study and will instead just attack his book as \\"lacking solid exegesis\\" and/or his failure to present a \\"biblically accurate\\" study. There are already two of those posted on Amazon.com now. Whether you agree with Thomas or not, it is clear that this book wasn't just slapped together. Nor does it appear that Thomas has a denominational agenda or axe to grind, either. What is obvious is the extensive effort put into this project has resulted in a book worthy of careful consideration."},{"Title":"Understanding Spiritual Gifts: A Verse-by-Verse Study of 1 Corinthians 12-14","review":"Robert L. Thomas - I believe has communicated a clear contextual understanding of this subject. This book is well researched."},{"Title":"Understanding Spiritual Gifts: A Verse-by-Verse Study of 1 Corinthians 12-14","review":"I was recently \\"converted\\" to the charismatic/continuationist position, and a cessationist friend gave me this book to try to give me the other side. I have to say, honestly, if I were still on the fence before reading this book, I would be thoroughly convinced of the CHARISMATIC/CONTINUATIONIST view! The reason for this is the absolutely dreadful exegesis, particularly of 1 Cor. 13:8 - 12.One point in particular stands out: Thomas essentially stakes his claim to a cessationist reading of this passage on the rendering of \\"to teleion\\" as \\"maturity\\", and a gradual maturity at that. Two problems arise from that. First, no English Bible translation, from KJV to NIV to ESV, etc., translates that Greek word in v. 10 as \\"maturity\\". They all translate it \\"perfection\\". When you are basing your argument on an absolute minority view of a translation, you are in big trouble.Second, he finds a parallel with Eph. 4:13. Here \\"teleion\\" is translated as \\"mature\\" (although KJV and NKJV translate it \\"perfect\\"). And in these instances, Thomas argues, the idea of \\"mature\\" or \\"maturity\\" means a gradual growth, not the kind of perfection to be expected after Christ returns. And so in that sense, we have attained this maturity as the Church, mostly as having received the completed Scripture. Therefore, in a nutshell, what Paul is referring to in 1 Cor. 13:10 is the Church having received the completed Scriptures, and since that is the case for us, those spiritual gifts mentioned (prophecy, tongues, knowledge) have ceased.But let me back up and reveal a serious and fatal flaw, one of many (in my opinion), in this argumentation. If Eph. 4:13 is referring to the kind of maturity that we have attained to, i.e. a gradual maturity, then the Church no longer has a need for evangelists, pastors, and teachers (not to mention apostles and prophets). Why is that? Because it seems that Thomas has missed the word \\"until\\" at the beginning of v. 13. Those 5 offices, Paul says, are given to the Church UNTIL maturity is reached.Read Carson's book \\"Showing the Spirit\\" instead."},{"Title":"Understanding Spiritual Gifts: A Verse-by-Verse Study of 1 Corinthians 12-14","review":"what can you expect of a book that dismisses the gifts of the Holy Spirit in action today? I'm not sure if it's a case of sour grapes, turning a blind eye to something or just pure blindness! it's for the reader to decide. The gifts are in operation and are visibly manifested across the world. Now, if someone chooses to think that they have ceased to exist and therefore all the realities that people are experiencing worldwide in God's presence are fake - you know where he is going!And this book is not any different from what most theologians do - beat around the bush! you don't need 300+ pages to describe something that is written over a few pages in the bible unless you want to impose your view onb it and try to prove it. IN any case you can't disprove it Dr. Thomas, because if you walk into a place where the gifts are in operation, your heart's secrets will be laid bare and then you BETTER fall on your face and repent!!! your theology ain't taking you nowhere, sir!"},{"Title":"Jurisprudence of Freemasonry: The written and unwritten laws of Freemasonry","review":"This book is one of the three standard books found in virtually all Masonic libraries, the other two being the Bible and Coils' Encyclopedia of Freemasonry. Dr MacKey wrote this book in the 1850's; it has survived many reprints and several publishers to become the primary reference with respect to how a lodge is operated, what is and is not proper Masonic conduct, how to handle Masonic trials, relationships between various Grand Lodges and their respective subordinate lodges. This book bridges the gap between the written and unwritten Masonic laws and traditions, explaining how the various Landmarks of Freemasonry came to be and why they are so important to the craft. A fascinating treatise for Masons, but would be fairly boring reading for a non-Mason"},{"Title":"Raising Arizona (St. Martin's Original Screenplay Series)","review":"This screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen reminded me of how much I liked the film shot from it. Perennial criminal Hi returns to prison again and again for robbing convenience stores but Edwinna, the police officer who takes his mug shots, softens his heart. He decides to make a new life of it by marrying her. They buy a trailer in Arizona, set up housekeeping, and try the next logical step: to start a family. Edwinna, though, learns that she cannot conceive and that's where the screenplay takes a typical Coen brother leap into absurdity. Ed and Hi decide to become parents by kidnapping one of a set of quintuplets since \\"it was unfair that some have so many while others should have so few.\\" What ensures is pure madcap, inventive, hilarious comedy with a hint of the bittersweet.The screenplay evokes the film with such clarity and excellent visual storytelling that you'll feel as though you're watching it. While Holly Hunter and Nicholas Cage, who played Ed and Hi, excel at portraying quirky characters, this script makes it clear that they had a fantastic script to work with and were not the sole reasons for its success. This paperback contains a few black-and-white still shots of the film (certainly not worth buying the screenplay for), the full credits for the film, and a short interview/exchange between the Coen brothers and the filmmakers for Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn, a movie that was released during the same season."},{"Title":"Rotary Club Murder Mystery, The","review":"A delightful book, fun to read - and if solving the crime depends on a piece of information that isn't shared with the reader (therefore just 4 stars), at least the protagonist doesn't discover it either until near the end of the book.The characters are delightful, as is the book's commentary on Rotary and Rotarians (beginning with reactions to the impending visit of the District Governor in the opening chapters).

I've even been offered the deck for free and declined taking it. All the while, I would stare at the box in a local bookstore.Reasons for not purchasing the deck earlier is that I am drawn by really beautiful artwork and beautiful strong colors (ie Inner Child Cards or Mary El Tarot). So looking at some of the images that were a little bit more endowed than a stick figure.. .I had to keep passing this deck up. Also I never really like feminine power anything... especially overtly stated. Lastly, I don't really run out and try to buy nude images, even cartoonish ones.However, I went and got this deck recently. Maybe I've grown in my 2 years to accept more expressionate art forms. I pulled the cards out of the box and I was pleasantly surprised by its energy! The cards have more color to them than I thought and the images weren't so bad... but still you would think the Magician is Steve Tyler.Images, yes, this is no Maat Tarot deck. However I like the images! The other interesting thing is I don't think you need to understand Tarot to understand the cards. My favorite is the 7 of swords in this deck. You have the fox staring down a brick wall, on the other side of that wall are some chickens. You can sense a predator pray connotation, the need to force one's way into a perfectly peaceful place to stir up trouble and to get what one wants, also the need to scheme and strategize as the this is a tall brick wall and not a chain linked fence. So even if sometimes the images seem sparse, they amazingly denote a lot of feeling and meaning for the cards that don't mince meanings. Its like looking at very great prehistoric artwork in the caves of France but really understanding the story.I thought I wouldn't connect with all of these tribal themes, but being a city girl that barely lifted a finger in her life to do hard labor, I did have a profound connection.The best thing about this deck is the fact the cards are round and are a good size (the new US Games Version from Italy has great cardstock quality). The interpretation of the cards with them being round REALLY expands the depth and dimensions of a reading. You can see if the energy of the reading has some hesitancy around it, some over reached focus, a block, movement, complete misfortune, etc. just by the orientation of the card as it comes out of the shuffle or pull.I wish I got this deck long time ago. I find this to have a good balance between male and female roles in this deck. I think its an easier deck for females to relate with as most of the time women are in the company of other women except when they are with their husband or significant other (of whom they rarely understand anyway) or with their boss (and no one (no matter what sex) ever understands their boss) or church members. So I am not sure if its more about female empowerment more than there's empowerment in a village of familiar thinking.The LWB that comes with deck is very sparse but gives really accurate and a broad view in giving meanings... so it applies to almost any topic the querent has. I also have 2 of the 3 Motherpeace books out there made by the original authors. Since I now have the deck, I can actually see if the books are useful.I did a morning draw, asking how my day would be and it was very accurate. More accurate than any of my RW decks. This deck is a combination of Golden Dawn (Strength 11, Justice 8) and RW meanings for the rest of the cards. So I tend to read this deck with an RW slant.In general, a great deck that is very accurate and provides a lot of insight without having to do a lot of work figuring the story out.Not to forget there's people representing a large spectrum of ethnic backgrounds, which is more a true representation of my real world."},{"Title":"Motherpeace Round Tarot Deck","review":"I want to point you toward this deck because of the magic I have encountered, using it for many years.

The simplicity of the images are in contrast to the thorough, thoughtful symbolism behind them. The creator of this deck knew her stuff, but was also tuned in to 'greater wisdom' in such a way that I feel that the cards were, in part, channeled through her. The stories and images have inspired me and my clients to view their situation from a different, insightful perspective. I purchased this deck because I wanted the larger deck so that the images would be more viewable. The only reason why I gave this purchase 4 stars is that the quality of the images were a little lacking; otherwise it would get 5 stars. (The cards themselves, which I purchased used, were in excellent shape.)"},{"Title":"Motherpeace Round Tarot Deck","review":"This deck is for the ladies!

The round shape gives the reader more options than the usual rectangular ones. In general it shows more creativity than most more recent decks.The downside is the lack of male imagery. What little male imagery exists in it is nearly all unfavorable. The couple of somewhat favorable images of males are of those in positions subordinate to females. I fully appreciate the reaction to passive female images in many decks, but rather than seeking more balance, this deck goes to far greater extremes in the other direction. Realistically all readings need both female and male imagery - even a cloistered nun has male influences in her life. As a professional reader, I can't see any time I would use it in a reading.The art is a wash. Some of it is great, other is something your third grader might present you with.I wouldn't recommend it for beginning readers due to the problems with male imagery. But for someone more advanced and/or interested in a variety of decks/imagery, I would. I gave my Motherpeace deck away and wish I still had it."},{"Title":"Motherpeace Round Tarot Deck","review":"De Grandis is a great author I have several books from her.She has a very blunt writing style, which i have come t enjoy and you will too.:)"},{"Title":"Motherpeace Round Tarot Deck","review":"This deck caught my eye for it's round, rather than rectangular, cards, and it's multiculturalness.The deck was evidently created by feminists who have indeed created a feministic deck, and it would have been multicultural if not for it's being anti white men.The booklet, written by Vicky Noble, repeatedly refers to a peaceful and idealistic matriarchial culture shared by all the people of all colours around the world that was crushed and opressed by white and monotheistic patriarchial invaders. This is supposedly supported by archeological findings, to which no references are given in the booklet.The &quot;Us = opressed multicultural womyn Vs. Them = evil white men&quot; is shown in various places :* The Son of Sword is a white man and a greedy murderer.* The Emperor card is described in the booklet thus :&quot;symbolyzing dominion and dictatorship, the Emperor is the sky god, the boss, the patriarch using the intellect to accomplish his goals and force to carry out his demands. He represents the dangers of unrestrained power and private ownership : Zeus the angry thunder god and jehovah the jealus father.&quot;Has the emperor *no* positive sides ?* The Hierophant card features evil men enslaving women. A friendly coloured man as Shaman could have been portrayed instead, and the choice tells something about the creators' intentions.* The devil is a white man enslaving women and coloured men.* The Sun card features a black man and women of all colours, but not a white man.* The World card feautres several women, but not a single man.As a white man who was raised in a Judaistic culture but is not anything like the Emperor, Hierophant, or Devil of this deck I find this deck objectionable, a good example of feminism in it's worst, and I will not - indeed can not - use it.The booklet has a few introductory pages with the feministic tones I mention above, meanings for each card, a short section on numerology, and an original spread.The cards are of good quality material, but a bit hard to shuffle, possibly due to their shape.Though the earth tones make some of the cards look a little dead, the art is colourful, beautiful, and original - it's unlike any other deck I've seen.I would have liked the deck a lot, if not for it's anti white men attitude."},{"Title":"Motherpeace Round Tarot Deck","review":"I was just in a used book store and picked up a copy of this deck. Loved the fact that it was round, I have several round decks and enjoy working with them. Then I got home and went through the artwork . . . it is VERY much a feminist deck. The artwork is really nothing to write home about, it's nice but nothing like say The Tarot of Dreams, of the Alchemical Tarot, but it does have a few nice ideas. My favorite part is the little explanation card that says that it includes two lovers cards for those of different sexual persuasions. Of course the two cards are a M/F and a F/F. Now I'm a gay male and take no offence at most cards being M/F in the decks I have. I understand the balance the card has like that, but for this deck to kind pride itself on being all about mulit-cultural and happy joy lets all get along..yea. . if you happen to be a woman. NONE of the court cards feature males on them so I guess that means that only women will be left in this world. I was so offended by this deck I actually tossed it out in the trash. I'm glad I didn't pay more then $[...] to find out that there are still feminist gay women out there that can't even acknowledge a man let alone a fellow gay who is a man. Think about that when you want a deck, do you really want that kind of energy in a deck you read with? If you do great, all I'm saying is give the natural balance of yin AND yang a thought."},{"Title":"Motherpeace Round Tarot Deck","review":"I've been reading tarot for ten years. When I want to read Tarot, I look to the Thoth deck. When I want to meditate and explore, I look to Motherpeace. I don't see this as a Tarot deck as much as I see it as a meditation and guidance tool that resonates more with the issues I experience as a woman. Motherpeace speaks to those issues more deeply and loudly than traditional tarot. Readings that I perform with this deck are markedly different than readings with traditional tarot. I don't recall that the creators ever denied that the deck was focused on the feminine and therefore see no reason to criticize that. The deck is female-focused but I don't perceive it as anti-male. In my experience, the descriptions in Vogel's book that imply that they are referring to a male figure can also be referring to a female in the querent's life. The fact that some males have gotten up in arms about this only seems to confirm that there are aspects of the feminine that they are unable to identify with. While the deck does not give \\"negative\\" news, I have found it to be rather blunt in pointing out negative aspects of myself that I either need to accept or change. I own both books published by each of the authors and find the differences in their respective interpretations interesting. I recommend that this deck be approached with an open mind and fresh perception of Tarot."},{"Title":"Motherpeace Round Tarot Deck","review":"This was not the first deck I got, but it was the first one that 'clicked' with me.First of all, the pictures are gorgeous, and the round cards are well suited for reading tarot--a tilt left indicates a possible lessening, or waning, and a tilt right can be interpreted as a possible excess, or waxing. This is a welcome addition to simply reading the card as upright or inverse.Something else that is special about this deck is that it doesn't 'give bad news.' Vogel and Noble stressed that all the cards are constructive and instructive. This encourages self-development and promotes self-love. For example, the Devil card is one that is often misinterpreted as an evil force. I think the Motherpeace depiction of enslavement is much more accurate. Literal enslavement, of course, is not what it is about, however, what the card represents is a subordination, this could be to anything, and must be interpreted according other cards in the reading and interpreted in accord with the querent's life.Note, however, that despite the nurturing slant in which the book and cards are directed that the meanings of the cards remain consistent with 'traditional' decks. I have been practicing tarot for 8 years and now use the Crowley deck, and interpret it based on Qabalistic principles. (For any serious student of Tarot I hightly recommend Robert Wangs book on this) The more I learned about Qabala and traditional tarot and even Jungian studies the more I realized just how right on the creators of this deck are.This is not an anti-male or anti-white deck by any means. I think the further one goes down his or her spiritual path the more that becomes evident. My gentle suggestion for anyone who thinks other wise is to use that belief, work with it, and see how that it may be reflected on to the deck from some experience or dogma in his or her own life."},{"Title":"Motherpeace Round Tarot Deck","review":"Let me begin by explaining how I came to posess my Motherpeace deck. Many years ago during an amazing session of intuitive counseling these cards spoke to me in such a way that the woman reading for me gifted them to me. She said that although she used the deck daily, they belonged to me as soon as they were placed; indeed they did. Since using these cards over the years not only to help in my own raising of consciousness, but also in reading for others. These cards have never once failed to speak to me. That brings me to the topic of whether or not these cards are anti-male. No of course not, they are however a feminine deck and ultimately designed, in my opinion, to connect specifically with female energy. I normally use these cards with women but have in certain instances helped men to gain clarity through them. In doing so an honest, sensitive depiction of the situation emerges that may not with a more \\"masculin\\" deck. These cards are very different from the classic tarot deck and if a \\"classic\\" style experience is what you desire another deck is probably going to be more satisfying for you. I absolutely adore these cards and consider them my first level of guidance among the many decks in my collection. Place these before you and feel them in your own hands before drawing a conclusion. No deck is right for all people and if you find these are not for you there will likely be someone on your journey who would benefit from their guidance."},{"Title":"Motherpeace Round Tarot Deck","review":"I was lucky enough to stumble on the Motherpeace cards as myfirst Tarot deck--now I know I'll never use another!

Motherpeace is the deck I learned on. Though I have many other decks that I use and love, Motherpeace is the one that I use the most. After using round cards, rectangle ones seem limiting. Things are always moving and changing. We are in process. The round cards help you to see exactly where you are in that progression.The images themselves are earthy and nurturing. I'm not sure why people think real tarot has to project the knight king queen paradigm. Not a paradigm I want to reinforce in myself. So, I love that Motherpeace gives us more organic symbols to work and counsel with.Motherpeace also shows that we currently live in an uneven culture where women and men are not balanced. I appreciate the honesty of that message.

This book hits all the main points of Eleanor's life and accomplishments from before her birth up to her death. It remains objective throughout most of the book but Youngs does not bring any enthusiasm to the womans life. The few times when Youngs voice seems to be asserting itself, it is to criticize Eleanor. One example is when Youngs insinuates that Eleanor's work in the NYC skids was just a rich girl trying to slum. Youngs made it seem like Eleanor never cared about the poor because she could never truly know them. He may have a point, but he did not use that same emotion when he was describing Eleanor's work as First Lady during the Great Depression. I would have liked to seen a little more energy from Youngs but I cannot complain about the information in his book. For those of you wanting a good, fairly objective, overview of Eleanor's life, Youngs book is just for you. For those who like their biographer to throw their two cents into the book you might want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Eleanor Roosevelt: A Personal and Public Life","review":"There's nothing like a poorly written biography to make even the most important of people seem totally useless. The best example of Eleanor's work that the author gives is that she \\"could shake a hundred hands in a receiving line\\" and that she \\"gave more teas...than any other First Lady\\" (3-4). The first two chapters, set before Eleanor was even born, belong in some trashy Victorian romance novel, and some of the most important characters in her life are either given only a passing mention or left out entirely. Direct quotes have no citations. At best flat and uninteresting drivel and at worst offensive, sexist and tacky, this book seems to perpetuate gender stereotypes that Eleanor fought against. Eleanor herself seems highly fictionalized here: she could \\"heal the sick with only a kiss.\\" Youngs clearly needs to leave the academic field (before he gets thrown out) and pursue a career in writing cheap paperbacks."},{"Title":"Eleanor Roosevelt: A Personal and Public Life","review":"I'm sorry if I don't have a lot to say but I think reviews sometimes give away too much information (like reading the back of a dvd and learning too much before seeing the movie) I also have noticed that many \\"critics\\" complain a lot ;)I loved this book. It was more than I expected and seemed thorough. I was up late reading it into the wee hours of the morning and fascinated with details I never knew.I also had NO idea just how much she helped her husband in his politics. She was amazing.Enjoy this book, why not? ;)"},{"Title":"Eleanor Roosevelt: A Personal and Public Life","review":"While this biography offered some good insight into the life of Eleanor Roosevelt, much of it was conjecturing \\"she may have, might have\\" etc. and little is cited save a blurb at the end of the book. I read this as part of a undergrad history class, but I'm certain there are better out there."},{"Title":"Eleanor Roosevelt: A Personal and Public Life","review":"While the language isn't boring the the ideas are great in Youngs second edition of this biography, I am not happy at all that my students have been assigned this book to read in a linked course. I teach a study and learning skills course linked to an American history course at a university in the USA and this biography must be read by the students. With all the time spent in the colleges and universities and now in the media about how historians need to cite their sources, this biography is a sad and sorry example. Nothing is cited, even the direct quotes have no citations! Yes, Youngs does discuss his sources at the end of the book but that is not the same as giving credit to the sources where he drew his quotations and facts from. The publisher, Longman, should be ashamed for allowing such poorly cited scholarship to be printed for used in either courses or the general public. I would have given this 1 star but the writing is engaging."},{"Title":"Eleanor Roosevelt: A Personal and Public Life","review":"I was given this book as a gift and I can say that I greatly enjoyed it! The prologue of the book was fascinating; for someone who was not familiar with the public's perception of Eleanor during WW2 it painted a picture of her as being almost hero-worshipped. I was also drawn in by Youngs' descriptions of her tending to wounded American troops. I admit I had preconcieved notions about the roots of Eleanor, assuming that she came from a life of leisure and priviledge. I had no idea about the trials she faced as a result of both of her parents and her brother. I greatly enjoyed the chapters that give details on Eleanor's life prior to becoming First Lady, including her time at Allenswood school and its feminist influence on her life, her work with the WTUL, and when she made public appearances on behalf of her husband after the onset of his polio. When reading Young's work on ER I feel transported into the stories; her frustrations about FDR's illness, her grief when she discovers his affair, her passion for the promotion of women and minorities and most of all her positive, productive outlook on life regardless of the situations she was placed in make Eleanor a friend to the reader, you feel like you know her personally. Youngs' statement calling Eleanor,\\"...virtually an American saint...\\" is not far off base and it shows not only the author's deep admiration of his subject but also how she was viewed by the American constituency in this time.As for those whose reviews say the book lacks depth regarding her contributions as a First Lady, what nonsense. The author clearly describes, in two lengthy chapters, the ways in which she asserted herself politically and personally. The books covers her disagreements with FDR's policies which she made publically, her work amongst women recruiting them to the Democractic party and how she fought against the stereotype of a First Lady being nothing more than a \\"face\\" and hostess for the White House. She was the first spouse to speak at a national political convention, she wrote for a paper and was a paid lecturer in a time when women were very limited by social constraints. The book also carefully chronicles Eleanor's life after FDR's death. When most women would have faded into the historical background Eleanor stayed active politically serving on a panel under the Kennedy administration and working closely with the United Nations. Youngs' writing in this chapter entitled \\"On Her Own\\" depicts Eleanor's relentless drive to help society and to use her influence in productive ways. The book, while short, weaves together traditional biographical writing with accomplished story telling. It highlights not only Eleanor but the historical period she lived in giving situational context and background history on the social and political challenges of the time.Formatting decisions, including the way footnotes and endnotes are structured, were certainly not the choice of the author as the book is part of a biographical series in which all books would need to follow the same format. In condemning the book for a percieved lack of correct citations is short-sighted and with this opinion you risk missing out on a great, short biography of one of the most influential and respected women of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Eleanor Roosevelt: A Personal and Public Life","review":"I have yet to read the book, but by just skimming through it, I know it will be enjoyable.

I found this one of the best books on the turbulent post independence period of Bangladesh. As a matter of fact, I've reread it several times. The problem is that this book was written in 1986 during the rule of Gen. Ershad, who apparently also gave interviews to the author. While the author knew Sheikh Mujib personally and is probably fair in his assessment of Bangabandhu, his verdict on Gen Zia may be a little harsh. This may have been coloured by the desire to legitimise the coup of Gen. Ershad. Nevertheless, an excellent book and a great primer for understanding Bangladeshi politics."},{"Title":"Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood","review":"Since this book was written based on a true story, I wish I could read it once again,an utterly well written book.The book describes in one word the fall of two dictators who were brutally assasinated.Great that's what dictators deserve."},{"Title":"One Hundred Tons of Ice and Other Gospel Stories","review":"This book is really wonderful, and so well written! In the essay, &quot;Swing Time&quot; Lawrence Wood tells how Fred Astairs clips have been held back from being used to honor Ginger Rogers, but have been sold for use in &quot;Dirt Devil&quot; commercials. Then he ties that observation in to how people who want to profit from the image of Jesus Christ could stand to be introduced to the real Jesus Christ. After relating a very appropriate passage from Ecclesiasticus, he says, &quot;Fame or obscurity, they were all the same to Jesus of Nazareth. He was mindful not of image, but reality...&quot;Again and again Wood takes an obscure or bizarre story, turns it around in front of us until the Gospel shows through. But these are not the internet-forward type of miracle stories that are to remind us that sometimes miracles happen. Most are stories of everyday occurrences to typical people which show that God is active in these lives.One story, &quot;A Sticky Situation&quot; tells of a huge molasses spill in Boston in 1919. The story is a great read in itself, the way Wood writes it. But he takes it several levels deeper when he connects it to the lasting consequences of sin in our lives--and the cleansing power of grace.I couldn't have any higher a recommendation for this book. I am a pastor, but I wouldn't encourage my parishioners to buy it--I want to steal stories from it for years."},{"Title":"One Hundred Tons of Ice and Other Gospel Stories","review":"I have read this book twice and given it as gifts to several friends who work to make Gospel teachings a model for their everyday lives.

Rev. Wood shares interesting historical information from the mundane and sometimes not so mundane events in the lives of people. He then uses those events to share the Christian faith in a refreshing perspective. I truly enjoyed the book's sense of God being in all things. Rev. Wood has an insightful way of sharing the wonder of God. What &quot;spiritual imagination&quot;!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Tons of Ice and Other Gospel Stories","review":"I always enjoy reading books that inspire and motivate, especially those that illuminate the gospel beyond the usual scope of a typical Sunday School lesson. I looked forward to reading stories of how the gospel came alive in people's lives or how faith carried folk through tough times.I must admit, some of the stories here are good analogies for the grace of God and some spiritual truths. The molasses factory tragedy and the almost forgotten story of the horrible Peshtigo fire are examples of great storytelling with inferences of grace and mercy.Unfortunately, in the first few stories, one gets the impression that the author isn't quite a believer in the idea that one who comes to faith in Christ does so more than emotionally or intellectually. There's a story about a guy who fell through the ice on a pond and barely escaped with his life. The author tells us the fellow says, as a result of that experience, that he owes his life to God, but doesn't quite convince me that the man understands what he is saying. Many people have realized they have been given a second chance in life after a brush with death. I have had a few myself, but the experience did not bring me to faith. It pushed me farther in that direction, maybe, but like many people I simply became a better person, in my own estimation, for a short while. While this is commendable, the gospel tells us we cannot earn our salvation or pay God back for His free gift of grace. Being good in and of ourselves is fine, but is not the gospel.I almost quit reading the book when the author contemplates, a few stories in, why Jesus was baptized and surmises that Jesus could not have been sinless if he subjected himself to John's baptism. He proposes that Jesus was very much like us in coming to repentance, which is completely heretical thinking in my view. Either Jesus was, as He and His disciples later claimed, the Son of God in the flesh, without sin and a perfect \\"stand in\\" for we who are are so much less than perfect, or the whole gospel really is a lie. This statement from a man who should know and believe his Bible, gave me great pause.That aside (and it is not a small thing), the book does share some good stories that tend to be more on the line of morality tales than gospel stories. Quite obviously the kind of stories that appeal to even the unconverted because they don;t really push the envelope past the idea that God is a good father to all men and grace covers everything. It does, but only for those who truly believe the gospel.This book may be helpful in provoking some discussions that do not probe too deeply into man's fallen nature. But gospel stories? I don't think I'd categorize these as such."},{"Title":"One Hundred Tons of Ice and Other Gospel Stories","review":"One Hundred Tons of Ice is a chronicle of one man's growth of faith as he witnesses the events of life and nature with an eye to reality and a heart bent to Heaven. It is an inspiring book that will encourage you to see God at work among us in ways previously unnoticed-- new revelations of old gospel truths. At times it challenges the mind, but unfailingly feeds the soul."},{"Title":"One Hundred Tons of Ice and Other Gospel Stories","review":"The stories are the real winners in this book--a collection of the personal, the ordinary, the bizarre, and the off-beat. The author tells these true stories in a simple yet alluring way, making the reader salivate for more. And the connections between the stories and the accompanying biblical reflections are unexpected and thought-provoking. But when it comes to the biblical reflections themselves, the author's commentary is mostly flat and unsurprising.

One could call it old fashioned but I've always thought this type of adventure fiction to be timeless, and that loose quality which I can't put into words is something I sorely miss in \\"modern\\" sf. Perhaps it is the (purposefully) careless manner in which sciences and technologies are described as opposed to modern clank-clank, or the way aliens and humans and spacecraft and rayguns mingle amongst the scenery and plotting, not taking any room from it but being simply functional towards the storyline. The integration of this all works wonderfully and in a pleasingly straightforward manner - the wonders of the world described with careful attention, yet with brevity rather than explained in tiresome detail.The book is also luminous, vividly portrayed in glorious colour. I saw the whole book as I read the words, and though that is often true of scenes in a book, it rarely happens to the extent it did with this: visually I saw it all as a mix of the early Tatooine segment of STAR WARS, Frank Herbert's DUNE and THE ROAD WARRIOR.In the end it is a minor book in Bayley's body of work, but solid entertainment all the way through, with crispy clear writing, some delightfully droll humour, entertaining characters and the lot of it.

The book can be good but only after serious revisions."},{"Title":"Historia De LA Iglesia Catolica En Cuba (Spanish Edition)","review":"My major disappointment when I received this book is that it does not indicate anywhere on Amazon's description of the book that this is a Tome 1 of, what I guess, will be a collection. This one traces the history of the Church in Cuba from Columbus to 1875. It does not cover the War of 1898, or the Republic from 1902 to 1959, and it expressly states that the author will not deal with Cuba's reality since 1950 because there isn't enough \\"historical distance from the events\\". To me that seemed a cop-out. So, don't expect to get the entire history of Catholicism in Cuba.The book could have used much more vigorous editing: there are grammatical mistakes left untouched, rather whimsical capitalization, repetiveness, strange jumping around of topics that follow each other like non sequitors, and endless compilation of data that at times is fascinating but don't expect to find much in the way of analysis by the author after giving us everything but the kitchen sink.However, despite the above and given the paucity of competitors writing in the field, this book is the odds-on favorite. It is very thorough in covering every aspect of the period under review, even if it does not always tie the events of the Church to the general, non-ecclesial events in Cuban history. It also provides a wealth of information that is not available anywhere else. However, it relies too heavily on one or two sources (at the most) from \\"real historians\\" for the general history of Cuba as backdrop (Levi Marrero being the hands down favorite) and it lists no bibliography (footnoting is done in the text and in a very amateurish and incomplete way). The Spanish is clear, direct and unpretentious, decidedly non-\\"academese\\", which makes the book an easy and fast read.The main value of the book is that it brings together more information on the subject (even if not very much analyzed)than anywhere else before. This might intrigue other Church historians or historians of Cuban history to delve more deeply and with greater reflection into narrower topics when the right circumstances appear again in Cuba for that type of research to be done.The high price of the book remains a mystery to this reader."},{"Title":"The moon endureth;: Tales and fancies,","review":"If you enjoy Mr Buchan, this is one to read. Not my favorite by any means, but it's part of a solid body of work. I lost interest or focus - not sure which sometimes. Still, glad I got it and read it. This author is amazing."},{"Title":"Zoloft, Paxil, Luvox And Prozac:: All New Information To Help You Choose The Right Antidepressant","review":"Despite its claim to offer the latest news regarding antidepressants, this book basically is compilation of already published information. It barely mentions the newer classes of drugs (post SSRIs: Remeron, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Serzone) and doesn't even mention the most popular SSRI in the world, Celexa. As far as I could tell, the author, a pharmacist and not a doctor, got all of his anecdotal evidence from one actual physician--the one who wrote the brief introduction. There is nothing in this book that one couldn't easily find surfing the Internet (particularly at these drugs' own Web sites) in about half an hour."},{"Title":"Zoloft, Paxil, Luvox And Prozac:: All New Information To Help You Choose The Right Antidepressant","review":"This book, published in April 1999, claims to offer &quot;new information&quot; on the new antidepressants. If you have not done any research whatsoever on these drugs you may find this to be true. However over 1/2 of this book is dedicated to a review of each of the 4 antidepresants in the title. The information is almost straight out of the technical documents already published by the manufactures of the drugs. Additionally the author is a pharmicist and NOT an M.D. I do not mean to knock the pharmacy profession but I would feel more comfortable getting this kind of information from a qualified M.D. I must admit that I had done research on these drugs on my own prior to reading this text. If you are considering using these drugs and have not done any research you will find a lot of useful information here."},{"Title":"Zoloft, Paxil, Luvox And Prozac:: All New Information To Help You Choose The Right Antidepressant","review":"These medications should not be \\"chosen\\" by the patient.

It seems little more than a restating of drug company propaganda. It does not adequately discusss the risks of akasthesia, tardive dyskinesia, risk of suicidality, sexual dysfunction, neurotoxicity, and other numerous side effects. The public is ill served by further reassurance that these toxic agents are safe and effective. The book is also deficient in discussing safe, effective alternatives to SSRIS such as St John's Wort, SAM-e, Omega 3 oils, dietary and lifestyle changes, psychotherapy, and spiritual work.Ronald Feintech, Ph.D."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"This book has the same charm and story telling as Anne of Green Gables. It concentrates on a family on P.E. Island and the various adventures of the young band of cousins growing up together. If you recall the old Disney Channel show \\"Avonlea\\", this book is where most of the main characters originated, with some name changes."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I have read this book many times since I was 13, and I'm 19 now. I think the ending is very sad, the realisation that we all have to grow up, and the hints we are given about the future of the characters we have grown to love. I was near tears reading about cecily, and the ending seemed so final. We can never return to our childhood, but we can remember the good times in reading this book. Whereas the Story Girl, although a fascinating book, is, in reality, little more than a stringing together of many stories, in this book the characters are properly developed."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"The Golden Road and its prequel, The Story Girl, are two of the best books I have ever read. I never seem to get tired of them, either...I have read them countless times! If you enjoy L. M. Montgomery's novels, such as the Anne of Green Gables series, these books are a must. The Golden Road tells the story of cousins, Beverley (who narrates the story), Felix, Cecily, Felicity, Dan, and Sara Stanley, also known as the Story Girl, plus their friends Peter, the hired boy, and Sara Ray. The adventures these eight have are sometimes exiting, sometimes sad...but mostly really funny! For instance, one time, they have the governors wife to tea...but they think she's their deaf Aunt Eliza and comment on the governors big nose and such things! And Felicity accidentally bakes tooth-powder rusks...oh, I can't tell you the whole book! Read it for yourself!"},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"This has to be one of Montgomery's best books.

Young or old, a good story is a good story."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"The Golden Road, which is a sequel to The Story Girl, is beautifully written. It will make you laugh, and even shed a tear or too. It will bring back memories of childhood, or of the childhood we wished we'd had. Of all of Montgomery's novels, this is the one I return to most often. A true little gem, for all ages. The sotry of great aunt Eliza's visit is one of the funniest chapters I have ever read. Delightful!"},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"Despite the long-ago nature of the story, children like Beverley, Felix, The Story Girl, Felicity, Dan, Cecily, Peter and Sara Ray live today. Montgomery treats children - and their points of view - with respect. She shows their virtues, faults, triumphs and follies in an honest light - sometimes poignant, sometimes funny. She also captures that magical betwixt-and-between time that the Story Girl and Beverley are approaching, as they begin to move away from childhood. The ending is sweet and sad at the same time."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I enjoyed The Golden Road, but not as much as I enjoyed The Story Girl. I recommend you read the two novels together, one right after the other. If you enjoy reading books set in a long-ago era, the books have a charm to them. If you like action, these books will not appeal to you as much.In my opinion, it is not possible to enjoy The Golden Road unless you have just recently read The Story Girl. Not all of the characters and actions in TGR will be understoon unless you have read TSG. The characters are a lot of fun and are well-written. The adventures this group of friends have together will stay in your memory forever."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I loved this book. I read the Story Girl years ago, but the 'Road to Avonlea' books ruined the concept for me, and I forgot that there was an original sequel. And then, my sister borrowed it from the library; I was bored, and so picked it up. I read the entire book that afternoon - forget about the fact that exams were six weeks off, that I should be vaccuuming - I couldn't put it down. I admit, I had cherished hopes of the Story Girl and Bev, but they were dashed. Felicity and Peter, I am sure, were happy for the rest of their lives....and I was crying so hard when I read about Cecily.

The story ends on a bittersweet note as the children are growing up, but is nonetheless worth reading."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"\\"The Golden Road\\" is the sweet-souled sequel to Lucy Maud Montgomery's excellent \\"The Story Girl.\\" The novels must be read in order; \\"The Golden Road\\" picks up without preamble where its predecessor left off.The King brothers Bev and Felix; their King cousins Felicity, Dan, and Cecily; \\"Story Girl\\" Sara Stanley; and neighbors Sara Ray and Peter Craig face winter in the small town of Carlisle, on Canada's Prince Edward Island. To pass the time, the children decide to publish their own magazine, with stories, advice, and personal ads. The magazine will be only the beginning of their adventures, as the children wrestle with New Year's resolutions, host the strange visit of an aunt who isn't an aunt, survive a snowstorm, spend a night in a witch's house, attend a wedding and a funeral, and prepare for the departure of some of their own.\\"The Golden Road\\" is less about telling stories, although the Story Girl has a beauty in finally solving the mystery of the Awkward Man. This novel centers on the interactions of the children as they arrive at the awkward edges of adolescence. Much of the story, including a bittersweet ending, is told in retrospect by one of them. However, it is Montgomery's superb narrative gift that makes the journey entirely worthwhile. \\"The Golden Road\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Lucy Maud Montgomery, especially those who enjoyed \\"The Story Girl.\\""},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"The Golden Road and its prequel, The Story Girl, are two of the best books I have ever read.

The differences between Analog and Digital channels is described using very basic concepts. Complex modulation and measurement considerations are explained in an easy-to-understand format, with terrific examples. The test set-up procedures definitely help anyone who needs to learn how to test Cable systems with Analog and/or Digital Channels.Explanations of the interractions between existing Analog and new Digital channels are very clear and relate well to the Cable TV population.Digital Basics for Cable TV Systems is a great reference tool for teaching engineers and technicians!! The Chapter quizzes and summaries really help the reader to organize their learning and prove to themselves that they grasp the concepts.

However, the same can be said of most of Richard Armour's books, including such classics as &quot;It All Started With Marx,&quot; &quot;English Lit Relit,&quot; &quot;Twisted Tales From Shakespeare&quot; (with its classic description of Hamlet entering 'with his nose in a book, perhaps to keep his place'), and of course &quot;The Classics Reclassified.&quot; This is the cream of the crop, which is saying a lot given the quality of the crop. Starting with Christopher Columbus and working his way into the twentieth century, Armour has combined great scholarship with a wild sense of humor (Explorers returned with &quot;Chinaware from China, Indiaware from India, and Underware from Down Under&quot;) to make an indelible mark on the study of history. And it will contribute to the reader's knowledge, because you will grasp obscure facts better by virtue of Armour's jokes. This has been one of my favorite books for many years, and it is WELL WORTH finding in a library or a book-finding service; the history buff will want to re-read it frequently for a good laugh!"},{"Title":"It all started with Columbus,: Being an unexpurgated, unabridged, and unlikely history of the United States from Christopher Columbus to John F. ... school, swore they would never read another","review":"If you are a History fan, you MUST read this, and any of the other books by Richard Armour. You will DEFINITELY look at America in a Whole NEW light...even if this book IS out of print! Maybe we can start a movement to have his stuff brought back!

CHLMP is a superior volume, but this still is quite good, and covers a great deal of material that is often neglected in standard treatments of medieval philosophy. Indeed, many histories of the medieval period are criticized for failing to cover the very periods included in this volume.By the way, the reference to D. M.

It gives the straight spouse validation that she is not alone.However, to my disappointment, but book seems far too slanted toward the gay spouse, his struggle, how horrible it must have been, is, for him. It seems to guide the straight wife down a path that leads to \\"it's okay, I still love him, we can still be friends\\". For me, this will never be okay,and it should never be okay. Unfaithfulness is NOT OKAY. That is not to say that I am going to be angry forever in a destructive way. I am angry now (1 1/2 years after my divorce and almost nine years after I first found out)but I know that will get less intense. Straight spouses need to stand up for themselves and be counted, need to say that this is NOT okay and that the gay spouses need to take responsibility for not knowing himself and not being honest with himself and women they married. It is not okay to be unfaithful to your wife, even if it is with another man because you are gay. You get the divorce first, take responsibility for any children and other practical aspects of the marriage, and then move on if you must. This book seems to pity the gay men in marriages and has not nearly enough support and sympathy for the wives who are almost invariably left with all the responsiiblity - the author herself admits that her husband spent time on vacation with other men, leaving her to shoulder the full load of the business they owned together. Just because someone is gay and married does not give them license to abdicate responsibility, and this author seems to let the gay men off way too easily. More attention should be given to empowering the straight spouses to stand up for themselves and demand that their gay husbands shoulder their end of the marriage bargain. Nothing in the marriage vows states \\"till death do us part, unless I discover I'm gay and then all bets are off\\"."},{"Title":"My Husband Is Gay: A Woman's Guide to Surviving the Crisis","review":"I bought this book because my husband has decided he's gay. Because we first had a friendship many years ago, then we turned on the romance, we are surviving through this situation still living together, with our children. We are giving ourselves a time of transition to work it out. The kids are too young to hear the circumstances so they don't even suspect. But, I had so many questions in regards to how to handle this, not necessarily why is he gay. But, the book helped me to confirm that I definitely can't change his orientation, he and I had both thought for a moment, that it could be prayed out of him, but alas, no, and we are Christians and really love the Lord. Just hearing about other women's situations is a help in transcending your own troubles. You almost feel that you are sitting present listening to support groups talk about their challenges with the husband coming out. I feel that my husband and I have definitely taken the high road in transitioning to an eventual separation. We plan on staying very involved as a \\"family\\", and I hope is at some point in the distant future, to meet a man whom I can share a complete relationship with. My husband is an amazing person and father and I always want him in my life, in our children's lives. It hurts so much now to be working through this, the tears keep coming, my husband and I continue to have discussions about handling the future for our \\"family\\". Carol's book is very comforting, focuses on keeping you healthy, bringing you to a place of peace, as the straight spouse, as you work through your issues. There is no workbook, but I definitely was calmed and helped to keep on track to love my husband now as still a best friend, person, and father, and myself, too, so that life can move forward for me positively and healthfully. Her last section on steps to take to \\"get through this situation\\" are of peace and of love, which when acted out by anyone, in my heart I know, is the best way. I know my husband hurts because this incredible situation hurts me and will affect our \\"beautiful\\" family as it is. Carol helped me work through my anger. I'd sit down to read the book when feeling, mad, angry and confused, and stop reading at a point, then feeling hopeful, more at peace and brought back to a path of love and health for which to lead my actions for both myself and towards my husband, which of course is a definite benefit for our children, whom we adore above all. Her words to regard him as a valuable person, etc. were encouraging.All the best, this book will help you on your way, in a situation which of course is devastating to anyone."},{"Title":"My Husband Is Gay: A Woman's Guide to Surviving the Crisis","review":"As Director of the Straight Spouse Network, having listened to the stories of thousands of spouses, I can say without hesitation that My Husband is Gay presents an accurate picture of the ups and downs of a wife's painful journey after her husband reveals he is [homosexual] or bisexual.

Carol Grever treats the subject with compassion, and interweaves many personal stories that the reader can relate to. I also appreciated that, while it may be rare or tough for a mixed orientation marriage to stay together, it's not impossible and the book reflects that message.Having been the spouse of a gay man for 20 years (and known of his orientation for 10), I know that it is not impossible to make a marriage work, though it takes some incredible strength on the parts of both the straight and gay spouses. My husband and I both appreciated this book's approach."},{"Title":"My Husband Is Gay: A Woman's Guide to Surviving the Crisis","review":"Carol Grever has written about being a straight spouse in a very caring and loving way.

It has a useful message to all people who have dealt with surprises, changes, and life tramas, not only those who find themselves impacted by a friend coming out of the closet. In openly communicating her struggles in such a heartful way, Carol makes it possible for others to also begin to talk about this previously forbidden topic.

My former husband, Sam, and present husband,Chuck, and I are also featured in the video, One Gay, One Straight, Complicated Marriages.When I went through the trauma of hearing my husband confess his homosexuality about 30 years ago there were no resources that I could find to help me deal with my instant isolation from all that was familiar to me. Luckily I was finally able to reach out to my sister and eventually to other family members and friends. I know the healing could have started sooner for both of us had I had her books! Being a part of the process for the book with Carol, the inclusion in a community of women who told their stories and the help all along from my former husband made this incredibly hard journey so much easier. It is such a comfort knowing these resources by Carol Grever are now available to aid others who are facing this turn in their lives and knowing that perhaps our stories will smooth the road to recovery and promote continued love within families. Even if your life has not been touched by this situation I recommend reading this book to help you understand that homosexuality IS NOT A CHOICE. This issue is such a divisive subject in our culture and I think it is because of lack of understanding, education, dialogue and old teachings and beliefs that should be put to rest. The book gives faces to real people and real life experiences that can only help the reader reexamine prejudices and hopefully accept this authentic human condition.Gwen, aka \\"Sarah\\" in the book"},{"Title":"My Husband Is Gay: A Woman's Guide to Surviving the Crisis","review":"I was so glad to find this book during a horrible time in my life!

He had been struggling with his orientation for many years and now finally knew who he was. I was shocked and struggled myself with this news. We have teenage boys and what to tell them. Well we didn't for 8 months until school was out. I also needed time to find out where to turn. I found Carol's website and then ordered her first book on Amazon. Finally, someone knew what I was going through. The stages that women face are pretty much the same. I read the book twice and then ordered the second book to start the recovery process.

In this book Grever shares her story of having been married to a closeted gay man along with the stories of 26 other women who experienced the same situation. Grever's attitude of acceptance, love and continued support and friendship for her husband after he came out of the closet is particularly refreshing. She was fortunate to find new love and to rebuild her life. She and her new husband forge a deep, mutually appreciative relationship with her former husband and his new partner. Grever shares the pain and new hope of this difficult transition openly while avoiding being overly sentimental and, thus, projects hard-won authenticy. I found her book both helpful and inspiring.Ermalou M.

It presents interesting cases that become boring when explored over and over again. If your spouse turns out to be homosexual, a support group would be much more helpful than this book."},{"Title":"My Husband Is Gay: A Woman's Guide to Surviving the Crisis","review":"This book was helpful, but the Author is 'teaching' junk science, so I am only giving it two stars.The fact is that there is NO Gay Gene, and Greever has swallowed a lot of politcal disinformation spread by PFLAG and teaching it to women who are buying into misinformation about genetic structures as a way to salve their own conscious or as a way to fend off outsiders who tell them iit is their fault that their husband is 'now' gay.The fact is that it isn't their fault at all, so why accept 'junk' science as a way of coping. Would they 'modify' their eating behavior and change their diet's if their DNA included predispositions to cancer or diabetes? Of course they would, or most people would try to modify their dietary behavior if they had family who had those medical conditions.Greever doesn't seem to be able to make the leap that DNA can show predispositions to a disease, and therefore can be modified. Gay is no different from other predispositions to any disease. Why is she even accepting PFLAGs assertion that Gay cannot be modified, when other genes can be modified? She has accepted their politicaal agenda without even looking at the entire science behind DNA.Frankly, the Gay Gene is a myth, and scientists agree that the DNA structure cannot be 'replicated', ergo there is no gay gene.Fact: She emphasizes, that gays were _not_ _recruited_, that is also disinformation, based on the fact that in the early 1970's when the DSM struck Homosexuality from their Diagnostic book, they recruited people by telling them that 'everyone' is Gay, everyone has a tendency towards being Gay, and that is a natural thing, clearing the way for homosexuals to recruuit young boys and girls into that lifestyle.I am not overly religious, but I do know that there isn't a Gay Gene, and if there was, behavior can be modified, just like diets for predispositions to other medical problems, can be modified.Ohter than that the book is supportive of spouses who are dealing with a marriage that isn't working. I think it would be best to say that, you either accept that your husband or wife is gay and move on or stay."},{"Title":"My Husband Is Gay: A Woman's Guide to Surviving the Crisis","review":"It can only be a good thing that this book provides positive support for women who suddenly find themselves in a marriage that is not what they thought. After all, spousal compatability is the most important aspect of a lasting marriage. It does seem remarkable to me, though, that in 30 years of \\"mostly happy\\" marriage, the author never realised her husband was gay. Surely the marriage's general long-term happiness should have the author questioning her own status, vis-a-vis the whole gay issue? Different personality types and their relative compatibility are usually issues that are sorted out in the pre-marriage courting stage, or at least in the early stages of marriage. For it to take 30 \\"mostly happy\\" years for the author to realise her objections to her husband's gaiety indicates the likelihood that she had actually changed over time. It's natural for some people to become more melancholic and morose as they get older, but it seems a bit unreasonable to be taking it out on your spouse!"},{"Title":"My Husband Is Gay: A Woman's Guide to Surviving the Crisis","review":"As much as I understand the predicament of what this woman and other partners in the book went through including the pain, the anger, the resentment and hopefully for most the reconciling, I wish these same people could see through their own pain and witness the pain in others. Of course, no one would wish any of these \\"gay spouse\\" scenarios on any person whether they be female or male but I think some more soul searching by the injured party is what is called for here.There is an element of some of the spouses wanting to educate and make gains for the acceptance of gay people having understood that maybe their other halves didn't have a choice but really little is given over to the fact that these spouses are the same people who had put their partners in such a predicament in the first place.Much is made of the obvious pain, anger, hurt and initial or prolonged resentment that these spouses have gone through but honestly, there is no presentment of why the other spouse felt driven to behave in the way they did in the first place. It is these same partners who, by fully supporting the established status quo on sexuality, whether that be a religious or civic stance that led to their partner's need to repress their NATURAL proclivities in the first place.I totally empathize with any person who has been rejected or felt slighted by their partner's sexual transgressions especially in marriage where each partner takes an oath to be true to each other. However, we are all human and that state comes with its complexities, its weaknesses and its strengths and for anyone to believe that any human condition or relationship can be so simply discussed in black or white terms is either a simpleton or a bigot.I fully endorse the idea that the pain and understanding of these issues can be shared and somewhat diluted in order to regain some sort of personal equilibrium for the perceived pained partner. Yet there is little understanding of the pain the seemingly offending partner has had to live with through the relationship. Only a sociopath could live guilty and pain free in this type of partnership. The gay spouses of these examples have gone through a lifetime of pain, guilt, shame and ultimately social and self scarring and self approbation that only now their partners are experiencing.I have yet to meet a gay person who willingly inflicted emotional and physical pain on a partner in a straight relationship especially those born between the 40's and 60's whose only recourse to social acceptance was to marry and hopefully the one's that I haven't met but who have done this willingly they are incarcerated as they should be. These gay spouses have gone through years of personal turmoil reeling in the pain of trying to understand themselves while trying to conform to their peers' and society's role for them.Yet within this book there are still the examples of partner's who can't empathize with their spouse's predicament whose only resort is \\"why me\\" or \\" it isn't right\\". Yes, it must be very painful to learn that the person you thought you had agreed a lifetime's commitment too has done you wrong, well think about the poor person whose whole lifetime's experience has been that not only you but the whole world has done them wrong. You, the person they had come to (been driven to) love were still the same person, who because of their own niaivety or dogma was imprisoning them in this partnership.Yes, that is a complex paragraph to understand but it is simple arithmetic to the people who for a lifetime have had to manoeuvre through the tenets and morals of a society that has not been willing to understand them and certainly not accept them.For the so called Christians that still can't accept the sexual predicament of their partners while witnessing the pain and guilt their partners must have wrestled with on a daily basis I say you got what you deserved. Until the bigots, the self righteous and above all, the Godless (yes, that is what bigoted religious people are) come to terms with the fact that the human condition has no set rules nor can be imprisoned by any man-made religious tenets and is, in its complexity an affirmation of the Divine, then may you suffer the pain and sorrows of your own making.I wish no pain on any living thing but this book is merely an exercise in one person trying to extinguish the fire of their own pain by continually pouring the gasoline of bigotry and retribution on others."},{"Title":"Guide Dogs (Dog Heroes)","review":"Includes a brief history of guide dogs.

In this novel, the main character Mattia Pascal faces an economic downfall and a marriage without love. He decides to escape from this situation and in a stroke of luck wins a fortune in Monte Carlo. He takes a new identity, gains total freedom, shams death but the ghosts of his past existence, and the discovery of true love will spoil his new life.The plot is neatly constructed and the dialogues between Mattia Pascal and some of the characters are enlightening, expressing Pirandello's philosophical outlook on life as well as reflecting biographical elements. The author is concerned with the ambiguity of truth and reality, the problem of identity and illusion. For him self-identity only exists in relation to others, as much as man is a social creature, unfortunately bound to social conventions. Man creates his own reality and lives in a world of illusions, always bound one way or the other to the past. The resulting paradox is that illusion may often become more real than reality!Mattia Pascal is unable to cope with his total freedom which strucks him as being shapeless and aimless. Only the love he feels for Adriana will help him brake away from his suffocating mask. Upon returning to his former town he finds his wife has remarried and he is destined to become the shadow of a dead man.Pirandello held a pessimistic outlook on life, believeing that his time was one of distress and darkeness (early 20th century), democracy was nothing more than tyranny disguised as freedom, and philosophical speculations nothing more than a product of our imagination.\\"When death comes perpetual night will great us after the misty daylight of our illusion, or rather, we will be left to the mercy of Being, which will only have shattered the vain forms of our reasoning.\\""},{"Title":"The Late Mattia Pascal","review":"This novel is about the identity of the individual, and the possibilities and limits of self-reinvention. By failing to transform himself into someone else, Mattia Pascal remains the same person, but radically changed from his experience. Oh, but it's not so complicated. Mattia Pascal is a good-for nothing- junior who, along with his also-spoiled brother, lose the fortune inherited from their father. Besides losing his fortune, Mattia is forced to make a disastrous marriage. And then, along comes a big and most unexpected chance to run away and become someone else. I won't spoil anything. Just read it and you will find an amazing story. Pirandello's writing is easy. The introduction to the real knot of the story is a little long, but it is absolutely necessary to situate the plot, and moreover, it is very funny. Pirandello's style fluctuates between irreverent and outrageous irony, and melancholic reflections on fate, identity and man's place in the world. Far from being boring, it has extremely funny moments of dark humor (check his confrontations with his mother-in-law). So, it is an extremely recommendable book, because it is intelligent humor with a reflection on life. If you really get to love the story, as I did, you'll end up asking to yourself: &quot;Who the hell am I?&quot;."},{"Title":"The Late Mattia Pascal","review":"Okay, so that may sound awfully obvious, but my goodness!

Il Fu Mattia Pascal is anything but a beach read and if you were disappointed in it because it was not cheap entertainment, your disappointment is probably due to the misinformation you received from a review as miscomprehending as that of Publisher's Weekly. Il Fu is an examination of the modern treatment of identity. It is an existential examination of society's abandonment of those who seek to live an \\"authentic\\" life.

All I found was a hardly decent, terribly slow story, told in the usual boring language so dear to Italian novelists (I read it in Italian, by the way... Maybe the translator did Pirandello a great service, who knows?). It is a book that lacks life entirely. Although the story is plausible, there is no oxigen in it. Besides, it repeats pirandello's themes over and over again. OK, we know, according to him it is impossible for a man to know himself and not to have less than ten personalities at a time. We have heard this song over and over again! I mean, Pirandello dissected the same bloody theme for at least a thousands times. Why the hell couldn't he explore other themes and dilemmas as well?

This volume offers a distillation of Madison's character as well as his career along with the events that worked to hone Madison the man.James Madison was a man of great promise, intellect and skills, but leadership was not one of his greatest of qualities. He was easily duped at times and was rather naive as to what really needed to be done. He waged the first war under the Constitution, but his lack of follow through and short sightedness were just part of his fecklessness. Madison was a man of unfortunate circumstances, some of his own making, others outside his expertise, while he was President.Madison was the framer of the Constitution... it's primary author, and was a formidable political figure with rather keen foresight to matters of legislature and calculating collaborator, but as a leader he just did not have the right stuff to confront the hard, practical issues.This book gets right to the subject with a good and easily readable narritive. Significantly diverse and tells a fascinating tale. We see wisdom, pettiness, deceit, turmoil and cunning in Madison. Also, a possession of vison of an ideal and an imposition of a leader in peril with fralties and flaws.Circumstances, temperment and errors all play into the character of Madison, but this was not the sole reasons for Madison's poor performance... partly yes, but the nations situation in 1809 was to be the most determinant. The author tells us what went wrong/right while Madison was in office, but his performance is a balance of virtures and faults.I found this book to be a fast read and very concise with cogent material and well founded in documentation. An excellent work about the Madison Presidency as he tries to overcome and adjust his views with respect to the Constitution and the relationship of the Executive branch of our government."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"I just finished listening to the unabridged cd version of this book. I do have to say I was very disappointed. From the beginning and through out the book it seemed the author had it out for James Madison. He definitely laid on the negative more then the positive of this founding father's life. I understand to get a balanced view the bad comes with the good, but this wasn't even close to balanced. IMHO this was written with a bias. I recommend passing on this book. And in my opinion this questions this author's credibility for his other work. I know I won't purchase any of his other books. Such a shame."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Garry Wills has done a solid job with this entry in the American Presidents series. He focuses on one simple question: Why was Madison not a great president?

His research is outstanding; his writing solid."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"The first three Presidents in our country's history, George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, are usually considered to be pretty \\"big names\\" in their selected company. James Madison, however, is not, thus the challenge of creating an interesting summary of his life and presidency.Author Garry Wills gives this cause a valiant effort, but ultimately does not succeed in living up to the previous three books. Sure, I know a lot more about President Madison than I had previously, but I now also know WAY too much about the minutiae of the events constituting the War of 1812. I will admit that it was the hallmark (for better or worse) of Madison's two administrations, but much too much time was spent dissecting specific events in an effort to prove what kind of leader Madison was. I much rather enjoyed the preceding material about Madison's dealings with the Constitutional Convention and his struggles to take that success into the highest office.Thus, while this book will give you a glimpse into the Madison presidency, you may find it a bit hard to get through, as it gets so bogged down in certain areas."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"The author gives a review of Madison's service and Presidency but not a full biography. There is good information on how the political landscape changed during his Presidency and how Madison, the consummate politician navigated through it. The book is not very deep personally (like say an Ambrose book) but does give a good review of Madison's public service."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Historian Garry Wills, in assessing James Madison's achievements, concludes that as a framer of the Constitution, author of 29 of the Federalist papers, legislator and Secretary of State, Madison was a great American. As a president, however, he was only average. Madison was strongly in favor of the adoption of the Constitution and he was in favor of certain federal powers. Later, during Washington's presidency, Madison, along with Thomas Jefferson, began to oppose many of these powers that the administration exercised (particularly through Alexander Hamilton) and when political parties were formed, he became a Jeffersonian Republican. Wills notes that he continued to change, however, and as President, Madison consolidated many powers that would have seemed to make him a Federalist. Wills sees a distinction, however, between a true Federalist and modernization. A true Federalist saw centralized banking and credit as a way for the privileged classes to obtain financing. Under Madison, powers were consolidated in more of a meritocracy, making credit vaiulable to all who merited it. In other words, unlike the Federalists, power was not for the benefit of the privileged classes. Another example of this is that because of the war of 1812, military commissions began to be bestowed on the basis of merit rather than as a prize.Madison was not a great President because he could not manage personnel well and because he followed poor policies of the Jefferson administration. In trying to cope with the problems of violations of US nuetrality in the seas and British impressment of US seamen, he continued the policy of an embargo, mistakenly thinking that commercial sanctions would get Britain to change it's policies. When he finally went to war, the strategy was an ill conceived effort to attack Canada and defeat the British there. He continued the policies of not developing a navy but, ironically, the first major victories of the war were by the meager navy that existed.The conclusion of the war was ambiguous enough to leave open the debate as to whether the United States or Britain won. Wills points out that in the treaty of Ghent, the United States achieved none of its pre war goals. On the other hand, the war concluded with some military victories. Whether or not the United States won, the issues of nuetrality on the seas and impressment took care of themselves since as tensions between Britain and France eased, there was no longer a need for Britain to violate nuetrality and impress seamen. Wills notes that Madison was very popular when his presidency concluded and that, therefore, he must be rated at least an average President despite his deficiencies. This book offers good insights and I recommend it."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"A fascinating portrait of one of the &quot;forgotten founders,&quot; Garry Wills's &quot;James Madison&quot; does everything the author sets out to do, providing a personal and a political biography in a brief format. In a mere 160 pages, Wills limns an insightful portrait of Madison as a man, a Virginian, a drafter of the Constitution, a legislator, and as a president."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"It was hard for me to like a consummate politician like James Madison, and hard to like the way this book was written, although it was informative.James Madison was more of a politician than a president according to author Garry Wills. From the accounts of this book, everything he did had political motives. The author, in fact, found very little to admire personally in the man as president except that he navigated with the country through the War of 1812, and the country came out victorious and intact. The book by the way covers the periods before and after his presidency, but concentrates mostly on when he was president.The book's style was a little too academic, dry, and distilled for me, with information that seems more like data than historical facts; it made you feel like you were back in college preparing to be tested. I prefer the way Joseph Ellis or Stephen Ambrose does early U.S history, giving it more personality and spice with a lot of anecdotes and quotes. I would have liked to have known more about Dolly Madison, for example, and the president's relationship with her. For once, I would have rather had a longer, more leisurely walk through someone's life.In short, Madison was a mediocre president but a great politician (if such a thing exists)and this account of it was informative but fairly uninspired, like a history text book. Three stars are the very best I could do for it."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"This is a neat little monograph on the presidency of James Madison. It is not meant to be a biography, and isn't. Nor is it meant to be a detailed account of Madison's presidency. It' intent is simple; why was James Madison's presidency not successful, especially when compared to his legislative career?Without giving too much away, much of the answer in the simple fact that Madison's strengths were more suited to the legislative arena - the backroom negotiations and intellectual debates - than being out front as the leader of the of a bureaucracy. There's much more to the story, but I'll leave it to Wills to tell."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"To his credit, Garry Wills is in this book determined to focus most of his attentions on President James Madison rather than Founder James Madison. The temptation with Madison is always to focus on his profoundly important contributions to the U.S. Constitution instead of his two terms as president. As a constitutionalist, Madison held the distinction of being both the primary framer of the Constitution and actual writer of much of it, and being by far the most important person in the composition of the Bill of Rights. Interestingly, little of this was known about Madison during his own life time. As Wills points out, after Washington and Franklin, Madison was probably the next most important person in the creation of the United States (though I would add Jefferson to the list to create a quartet), but this would not have been obvious to his contemporaries. Even his role as one of the writers of the Federalist Papers was unknown.Madison as president, however, was a terrible disappointment. While his abilities in framing and creating the constitution incontestably make him one of the half dozen most important figures in U.S. History, he was at best an average president. In fact, his accomplishments as president can only be dealt with negatively. His lone achievements are what he did not do, not what he actually did. As Wills argues at the end, he did not engage in widespread violations of civil rights while waging the War of 1812, as many subsequent presidents would do, both major presidents such as Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Roosevelt, and lesser presidents such as Richard Nixon, and much, much lesser presidents like George W. Bush. Unlike Lincoln, Madison did not suspend habeas corpus and unlike Wilson did not make criticism of the government a jailable crime. Furthermore, although he signally failed in all of the central aims of his administration both in going to war and in everything else, he proved that a republic grounded in a spirit of a popular democracy could nonetheless wage a war.The most interesting part of the book came near the end, when in a few brief pages Wills made some powerful and cogent arguments concerning the role that modernism had on the Madison terms of office. There is a fundamental tension in American politics that is expressed in a number of paired yet opposing ideas: freedom versus liberty, a strong federal government versus a weak central government, and \\"the people\\" versus states\` rights. These inevitably lead to apparent contradictions, such as Jefferson's stated dislike of a strong central government, but his dramatic increase in the power of the executive branch. Likewise, Madison creates a constitution that centers national authority in a strong federal, but then as a member of Congress gradually moves more and more to a states' rights position, before as president dramatically increasing the importance and power of the federal and executive powers. Over and over in American history we see varying attempts to struggle with these issues. Lincoln saw himself as a Jeffersonian, yet believed strongly in a strong federal government and a weak local government. Similar to the arguments of Herbert Croly in THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN LIFE, Woodrow Wilson felt that Jeffersonian democracy could only be sustained by a very strong federal that could resist and fight the exploitative tendencies of trusts and corporations, and argued that Jefferson himself would have advocated a strong central government had he foreseen the effects of mass industrialization and the rise of the modern corporation. Madison found himself despite his ideals relying more and more on new elites, an idea that was anathema to Republicans (that is old school Republicans, that actually became the Democratic party under Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren). But Wills notes that these were not the elites that the Federalists envisioned leading the United States. Hamilton, for instance, yearned for an America led by its wealthiest and highest born. Under Madison privilege eventually came to play no role and being well born or of good blood was vastly less important than being effective and efficient at what one did. Therefore, the hapless generals, almost all political appointments, who led the nation early in the war, gave way to talented generals such as Andrew Jackson by the end. Wills implies that Jefferson and Madison did not understand that the nation could rely upon elite leadership that rose to that position based on merit and talent rather than privilege and entitlement (a situation unfortunately reversed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries).This is a remarkably solid little biography, another superb entry into the finest series of short presidential biographies ever to be published. I personally think that Wills wants to rate Madison a bit too high. Based merely on his performance, I think he falls pretty much into the middle of the pack of presidents. As a Founder, he is of massive importance, but I think Wills falls into the temptation of nearly ever author in this series of books to rate their subject just a bit higher than they deserve (except for the Buchanan volume--whose author admits that he might be our worst executive). Still, absolutely no one can fail to benefit from this."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Why in a book about Madison does the author feel the need to bring up the Vietnam War?Why in a book about Madison does the author feel the need to bring up how wonderful FDR was?Why in a book about Madison does the author feel the need to bash Republicans on every page while the Federalist come off as Saints descended from heaven.Can you possibly guess what political affiliations this author belongs too???I was jarring on every page to have this idiot pontificating on things that have NOTHING TO DO WITH MADISON!!!!"},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Garry Wills is fast becoming a favorite Historian and Author to me.As is his habit, he brings his pithy and rich style to an examination of Madison's Presidency which in many ways was decidedly less successful than his stellar legislative and constitutional achievements. Rather than stating surprise at this, as many historians do, Wills outlines why this outcome was somewhat predictable when the skills of Madison early on are examined dispassionately. Madison was a superb legislator and a thorough academic well equipped to study and digest history and come to a reasonable conclusion. These skills made him indispensible in the work done upon the American Constitution. As an administrator, however, he lacked the drive and focus that others brought.Make no mistake, Wills does not fail to give credit where credit is due and as an 8 year president who left office more popular than he came in, there is much to say positively.There are good biographies that go into far greater detail in many areas. However, if you want a short overview which will leave you with a good understanding of the Madison presidency and how it ties into the themes of the day, you will be hard pressed to find a better one than this.Well worth the read.5 stars.Bart Breen"},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Our library non-fiction group enjoyed the insight this book provides into Madison as President. It makes the case convincingly that Madison was a brilliant contributor to the Constitution, but as an executive his record is non-stellar. This shouldn't surprise us based on what we know about strengths. Executives often aren't interested in the details, and scholars, which Madison was, may not like to execute the policy they research and write.The author's conclusion that Madison was indispensable to our country in what he contributed in crafting our constitution outweighs his weakness as President. He was the best at some things and better than most at other makes him worth studying and honoring.The author has some humorous turns of phrase such as describing someone as a \\"nullity presiding over vacuity\\" and the \\"dialogue of the tactless with the clueless\\". You can tell a brilliant mind is behind this book.There were historical issues in this book many of which many of us were unaware. I enjoyed the author's discussion of what made for a great president. The author suggests that great presidents have a vision of an ideal America and a deep psychic connection with its citizenry's needs and desires. He also states that the men in the White House express who sent them there.He quotes John Adams saying that presidents need a \\"helm to grasp, course to steer, and a port to seek\\".I also enjoyed the author's discussion of how religions flourish in freedom and suffer without it. Religions are perhaps like business, they meet constituents' needs, so diversity of offerings, a little competition, is good for the market. The author didn't say that--but his ideas on religion caused me to think of how the free market of religion benefits everyone.Participants of our group ranged in opinions of this book, some loved it, some found the subject dry but the consensus was the author was excellent at summarizing Madison's different contributions to our history. We agreed he didn't sugar-coat anything about Madison and explained Madison's strengths and weaknesses with an even hand. I found it ironic that there were many positive unintended consequences from Madison's failure in the War of 1812 which strengthened our country.If you are looking for a concise and cogent overview of James Madison as President, this book offers it."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Garry Wills proposes that James Madison's talents and characteristics that made him a good legislator was what made him a nondescript President. This argument is not really pushed in the book; but instead is more of a pretense, so Wills can write a character analysis of our fourth president. Fortunately, Wills is not only successful in this; but also, inspires further interest in James Madison.Personally, I like this book. It a quick and easy read for anyone just beginning to read about this particular founding father. Wills does not go into great detail or focus on Madison's whole life; instead he creates a good impression of who his man was during his Presidency. Anyone who is already well read on American History or looking for controversy will not find this book satisfying. However, those who are interested in the \\"little golden book\\" of James Madison, they have found it."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"This book is written as part of the \\"Presidential Series\\" and as such the author is sort of obliged to focus on the Madison's Presidency. Over and over again, we are told about Madison's naivete and provincialism. The author is likely correct in calling Madison a feckless and mediocre president, but I think he is anti-Madison.For instance, Wills gives credit to the military leaders for battles won in the War of 1812, whereas lost battles are blamed on Madison, his party and his appointments. Author Wills final conclusions about Madsion seem correct, however. There is alot of scissors and paste in this book. At least 50 instances ofparagraphed quotations from various politicans, diplomats etc. Practically nothing is said about Dolly Madsion or other close friends who may have advised him (except for T. Jefferson)."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Is there any better author when it comes to explaining complex personalities in a different time and space than today? I don't belive there is--once again, Gary Wills just nails his argument. It is such a pleasure to read an answer to a question in a concise, thoughtful, and sometimes humorous way. The question--how could Madison be so good at creating a constitution and so mediocre at executing the constitution when he was president? The dearth of information in the popular press about Madison's presidency almost begs the question, \\"Why did Jemmy change so much after he turned 40?\\" And the answer is that he didn't change his stripes--he was true to himself, both good and bad, as he first advised candidate and president Jefferson and later assumed the presidency himself. Great book."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Poor Madison. I think he was a good man, but he wasn't a great president, and his personality certainly pales in comparison to some of the other presidents of his time. (My favorite part of this book was actually a Jackson story that wasn't really related to Madison at all, except that he was president at the time - during the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson heard that the mayor of New Orleans was considering surrendering, and he said he'd blow up New Orleans if they did surrender.) However, Wills manages to provide a good overview of Madison's life and presidency. I liked that he was able to admit to some of Madison's failings, as well as his victories - I sometimes feel like biographers get a little biased about their subjects, and Wills obviously didn't do that. While not extremely detailed on many of the major events that Madison was involved with, this is a good summary of Madison's life and presidency."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"I admit to having a fascination with our founding fathers. It does seem, however, that the more I read, the more human they become, and that's a good thing. Sometimes we let hero worship, or what some historian's call, the \\"Great Man Theory\\", obscure a well-rounded view of these historical figures. Madison was all too human too and Wills does a good job of showing his strengths and weaknesses.Increasingly, I've noticed the pairing up of some of our founders into political factions; factions that they themselves often said were harmful to society. Examples of this are seen with Madison and Jefferson on one side of the political spectrum against Washington and Hamilton on the other. Of course I'm trying to fit these figures into nice and neat categories, which can't be done so easily, but I'm trying to get the point across that political factions were just as real and vicious 200 years ago as they are today.Madison is given great credit by Wills as the \\"father of the constitution\\". Madison was a brilliant political thinker. His contributions in the realm of religious freedom and liberty are also of note. He partnered with Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, but soon parted ways with Hamilton, especially during and after the Washington administration. The Madison administration was, however, less of a success story, though rated average or slightly above average by historians, according to Wills. We see problems in some of his appointments and dealings with cabinet officials and Madison's belief in the effectiveness of an embargo policy, which had also been used by Jefferson, but not with great effect. Madison, according to Wills, possessed more of the qualities of a legislator as opposed to an executive. Madison, like most of us, was inconsistent, saying one thing at one time and saying something completely different later on. Examples of this are described in his assessments of some of Washington's actions and his own later actions as president.Wills does make an important observation on the Madison presidency's impact on the constitution, especially when compared to other war-time presidents. Wills concludes that Madison violated it much less than the presidencies of Lincoln, Wilson, and FDR. This is a pertinent observation, especially considering Madison's personal role in framing that very constitution. A good read."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"James Madison is often one of the least remembered founding fathers. However Madison was very important in the early years of the United States of America. Known as \\"the father of the Constitution\\" he was influential in the convention and is one of the best legislators of all-time. The book also reminds readers that George Washington asked for Madison's advice on Constitutional matters because he knew he would be setting precidents that would be followed by other holders of the Executive office.The book quickly addresses his pre-Presidential years but mostly focuses on his time in the Executive office. The book gives a good quick look at the interesting if lackluster Presidency. The war often referred to as \\"Mr. Madison's war\\" dominated his Presidency and he deserves some of the blame for beginning the war, even though the country was completely unprepared. His embargos were disasterous and left the U.S. economy in ruins for a short while.The book does a very good job at showing that Madison was a very good legislator perhaps one of the greatest in US History, but Madison was not made for the Executive office. He had the political knowledge, but lacked the size, leadership, and ability to stand up and announce what was going to happen (in an authoritative voice, perhaps because of his stature). Overall Madison was a very important man to the founding of the country although his 'flip-flops' are also shown throughout the book. Overall this is a good quick introduction to the Presidency of James Madison."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Garry Wills is an exceptional documentarian, and this effort is a fine example. A very comprehensive review of the formative years of this Founding Father is provided, those years that helped define the political system and policy of early America. Madison's contribution to the constitutional constructs of Virginia and the U.S. are well-woven, even if his presidency is less a focus of Wills energies. Portrayal is of a deeply insightful humanist who performed best as a thinker than an administrator, WIlls has captured the essence of the man himself."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Although it is nominally a biography of James Madison, this brief book is actually an examination of Madison's presidency. Wills explores the seeming contradictions between the brilliant Madison responsible for the Constitution and Bill of Rights and the less-than-impressive president.Wills shows that there is less of a contradiction than there seems to be. The flaws that hurt Madison as a president were actually around much earlier, especially his inability to function well as an executive. Madison was much more a behind-the-scenes person, quite adept in committees or legislative situations, but not as able outside them.As a biography, this book is rather short and sparse, but by focusing on one portion of Madison's life - the portion which he does not receive great acclaim for - Wills is still able to provide a lot of detail as he analyzes and explains the fourth presidency."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"The author, Garry Wills, writes, \\"Madison's very presidency is semi-forgotten.\\", and addresses the question \\"How could James Madison be so outstanding in certain aspects of his life and be overshadowed in others.&quot; The text states that an explanation \\"...could take one of three approaches based on circumstances, on temperament or on specific errors.\\" However, none of these fully explain the dichotomy Madison presents.Wills notes that Madison had weak points which he carried over to the presidency: \\"...a certain provincialism with regard to the rest of the world and a certain naivet&eacute; with regard to the rest of his human beings.\\" The book's first three chapters cover the \\"Pre-Presidential Years\\" noting \\"Madison is called the father of the Constitution. It is a title deeply deserved on many accounts.\\" He had an intimate connection with all three administrations preceding his presidency being responsible for the framing and passage of the Bill of Rights.The balance of the book, ten chapters, covers his presidency. He became president under very difficult circumstances. Jefferson literally had given up governing the nation for four crucial months passing on a stalled executive to Madison who had no real executive experience before becoming president. Lacking leadership experience the author relates the many cabinet and personnel problems he experienced while his provincialism often allowed him to get suckered punched in foreign affairs. Contrary to common belief, the Congressional \\"War Hawks\\" of the West did not thrust the War of 1812 on him. Madison wanted the war.The author gives a succinct account of Madison and the conduct of the war from the aborted attempt to conquer Canada to the bright performance of the American Navy. In 1814 when the war was shifting in America's favor, Washington was burned in what the author calls \\"a perfect study of what was wrong with Madison' conduct of the war...\\" Political basis for military appointments (a practice continued into the Civil War) and reliance on state militia rather than army professionals contributed significantly to the Washington debacle.The text gives a brief account of the work of the American peace commission and the treaty ending the war, which the Senate approved on February 16, 1815. The author notes, \\"Not a single one of its announced war goals had been reached....\\", but notes that \\"During his last year in office, Madison rode the swell of popular nationalism....\\" During the war Madison was truer to the strictures of the Constitution than any subsequent war president \\"as if to prove that the Constitution did not have to be jettisoned in a crisis.\\"Garry Wills answers the question of how could James Madison be so outstanding in certain aspects of his life and be overshadowed in others. He concludes this book writing \\"No man could do everything for the country-not even Washington. Madison did more than most, and did some things better than any. That is quite enough.\\"The reader will find parallels in today's national politics with the political shenanigans of the Madison era."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"In halls of American history, few people are as overlooked as James Madison. While his presidency was largely forgettable, his influence on the country through his work on the constitution can not be forgotten.In this concise work by Gary Wills, Madison is portrayed as a slight and fragile man. Yet even in early adulthood, he showed the markings of a leader. Overcoming his quiet nature and small size, he played a key role in writing the Constitution. He championed the cause of separation of church and state. Madison felt that faith must be genuine and can not be forced. A forced faith is dangerous to the future of the religion, potentially causing it to loose its meaning.Madison's presidency was marred by the War of 1812. This often misunderstood chapter in American history is given an excellent explanation on page 97. Through the course of this war, Madison protected the Constitution as well as ending the reigns of political patronage than caused earlier battles in the war to be failures.Much like Thomas Jefferson paved the path to the presidency for Madison, Madison also left a legacy of rising stars in the party then known as Republican including James Monroe and Andrew Jackson. Were it not for Jackson's military success, the country stood to loose ground in the War of 1812. Instead, the country ended the war with the same amount of territory as when it began the war.While this biography is short, I must admit that I learned a great deal from it. I believe this book can hold its ground against any biography of Madison. While not caught up in frivolous details, it tells a great story."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"To me, the \\"American Presidents\\" series is one of the more unusual ongoing publication projects. Endeavoring to provide accounts of the people who have occupied the presidency and their terms in office, they have selected a first-class group of writers and historians (such as Sean Wilentz, William Leuchtenburg, and Douglas Brinkley) but often paired them up with subjects a little outside their normal focus - having Robert Remini, the foremost biographer of Andrew Jackson, write on John Quincy Adams instead, for example.This volume is no different. Garry Wills is one of my favorite writers, the author of many thought-provoking books on subjects as diverse as Saint Augustine, the Gettysburg Address, and John Wayne. While he has written on the era before - his book on the Declaration of Independence is one of the best studies of it available - he has not previously focused on Madison in his publications. Nevertheless, this book is a good introduction to the man. While ostensibly focused on the presidency, Wills does incorporate much about Madison's pre-presidential career, especially in terms of how it shaped a presidency that by common consensus most historians regard as disappointing compared to his pervious accomplishments.What makes this volume interesting to read, though, is Wills' own analysis. He never shies away from outlining his opinion, and he backs it up with persuasive (though not always convincing) arguments. His examination of Madison's foreign policy in the context of the Jeffersonian tradition is particularly good and alone worth the effort of reading the book. Though there are better books to turn to for a more comprehensive overview of Madison's career (such as Ralph Ketcham'sJames Madison: A Biography), this is an excellent starting point in seeking to understand one of the most important of our Founding Fathers."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"I have been a fan of Wills writing since I was a kid and read his little booklet, Elias and Eliseus, in the Catholic Know Your Bible Series, written around 1960. Wills' biography of James Madison manages to pack a great deal of information into 160 pages and does so in a coherent and very readable manner. One can at times get bogged down in the details but Wills provides an excellent conclusion, and useful summaries of various factors, groups, etc. throughout the book. He also blows away several myths such as future presiden William Henry Harrison's \\"great victory\\" at Tippecanoe which was pyhrric at best and even the notion that we won the War of 1812 is questionable--the truth was much more ambiguous. Nevertheless,, Madison's War was a watershed event that unified Republican factions and moved the American Republic past old, Federalist party alignments and some of the original Federalist and Jeffersonian Republican concerns. Five of the war's military leaders became U.S. presidents. The miniscule navy, funded during the Federalist phase of Washington and Adams, beat the mighty British in several important battles because of the superiority of American naval engineering and the boldnesss and military genius of its young naval commanders who are contrasted with the much older army and militia leaders who were notable, especially in the early phase of the war for their corruption, incompetence and timidity. One U.S.commander wasted valuable time worrying whether he could use an old rag to surrender or if he should try to obtain a cleaner, whiter one. Bolder and more effective army officers such as Andrew Jackson later emerged. In the end, England grew weary of its war with us; we learned lessons about the need for a strong coordinated executive branch; Madison made many mistakes, as did several of his abysmal cabinet appointments, and yet he steered us through the war and managed to prove the workability of the Constitution that he had authored. Wills also gives us an appreciation of the fragility of the Union and the very real possibility of the secession of New England which did not suppport the war. Unlike the war in Vietnam, America came out of the War of 1812, itching for new military adventures. Wills gives us othe fascinating details such as Madison's desire to annex Cuba and Canada, his obsession with the wrongheaded tactic of embargo, his naivete that caused him to be duped by Napoleon, his deliberat attempts to falsify his memoirs, his great contributions to the Washington and Jefferson presidencies, his major contribution to the concept of separation of church and state which current Christian fundamentalists would do well to familiarize themselves with. Other little known facts emerge in Wills' account of the times such as England's 18th century war atrocity against Denmark, wiping out Copenhagen. Excellent book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"While this book focuses mainly on the mediocre presidency of James Madison, the author nevertheless is able to convey the crucial role he played in the formation of the government. After reading Wills' account the reader comes away with a clear understanding that, aside from Washington, Madison was the most indispensible figure in the drafting and passing of the Constitution, the creation of our government. In fact, if it were not for Madison's foresight and persuasion, Washington may never have participated in the Constitutional Convention, leaving it doomed to failure. That Wills is able to convey all of this, and still concisely explain Madison's difficulties as Chief Executive, is a marvelous achievement considering the brevity of the book.The dominant event of Madison's presidency is, of course, The War of 1812. The war defines Madison's administration. Wills writes of how Madison led or bungled the country into a war that it was ill-prepared for. He describes Madison's ineptness as Commander-in Chief. He analyzes how Madison, the staunch states-righter (ironic in itself) centralized power in the federal government in order to fight the War. And finally, we see, surprisingly, how Madison comes out of the morass he created more popular than ever. Wills provides persuasive reasons why this was the case.Very informative and highly readable. Madison's life and the times in which he lived are anything but dull. Wills will leave you wanting to learn more about this most underrated of the founders."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"This short biography of James Madison focuses on his time as president of the United States - imagine a biography of Miguel de Cervantes focusing on his time as a soldier in a Spanish Navy infantry regiment.James Madison was a great theorist, extraordinary writer, cunning politician and an effective legislator - but as president he was simply \\"good\\". Madison was never counted as one of the great presidents and author Garry Wills acknowledges as such in the opening of the book. As a matter of a complete biography this approach, in my mind, is the opposite of what it should be. Wills points this out and follows with a clear, clean and interesting biography focusing on Madison's administration.The book is divided into five parts:- Introduction- Pre-Presidential Years(1751 -1809)- The Presidency: First Term (1809-1813)- The Presidency: Second Term (1813-1817)- Epilogue: The LegacyWills hits the highlights and lowlights of Madison's time in office. The author lauds the president for trying extremely hard, and succeeding, in not to abusing the Constitution during the War of 1812 (something which could not be said for his successors such as Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and others) but balances those with such behavior as Madison's quixotic paranoia about such people as Alexander Hamilton.James Madison, even though short, is written in an academic style. Information is being sent at the reader fast as if you were reading a textbook - just data without the spicy anecdotes which make a biography worth reading. I still don't feel I know Madison's personality or what, if anything, did the lively Dolly Madison saw in him (besides some rich guy from Virginia). I'd rather read the long, more paced biographies that give me a complete picture of the person."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Garry Wills, eminent author on the American mind, writes a literate and compelling political biography of James Madison, \\"Jemmy\\" as he was called earlier in his life. Here was someone whose resume seems made to become president. Yet this man, \\"the Father of the Constitution,\\" was not near the success that one might have guessed from his background.His pedigree includes: key figure in the Constitutional Convention--from getting George Washington to attend (a coup) to helping structure the agenda (from amending the Articles of Confederation to trashing the extant constitution and replacing it with something very different); to serving as a major figure in the early Congress (including helping to produce a Bill of Rights), to organizing the first political party (along with Thomas Jefferson, although it took Martin Van Buren and his circle to perfect the arrangement).Wills begins by observing that there is consensus that (Page 1) \\". . .Madison, though one of the nation's greatest founders, is not one of its greatest presidents.\\" Wills suggests that one can account for this by (a) bad luck falling Madison's way (which Wills discounts); (b) his temperament (he had more legislative than executive talent--more apt an explanation in Wills' view); (c) errors (a very poor reading of the British Empire, leading to foolish foreign policy and the War of 1812).As with other in \\"The American Presidents\\" series, this begins with a brief sketch of the future president's youth, his early career, and his rise to the presidency (from the Constitutional Convention to Congress to Jefferson's Secretary of State). Trivia is included: Madison was the shortest American President ever.This represents a standard, literate Wills' work. His literary approach is as expected (what a wonderful command of the language!). The work nicely lays out why Madison was not as good a President as one might have guessed--as well as his later life.All in all, an estimable addition to this valuable series."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"The first two or three chapters of this book were tough-going. The writing was choppy because the author kept jumping from his own narrative to lengthy quotes from Madison. But persistence paid off. It may not be the definitive biography of James Madison, but it's a good read.The book is short and focuses on Madison's presidency, with some background on his accomplishments before becoming president. The story that Garry Wills tells is that James Madison enjoyed a moderately successful presidency in spite of himself. While he was a brilliant and effective member of the legislature, he really didn't have what it takes to be a good president. He was too much of an ideologue and not enough of a pragmatic. One of his big mistakes was the embargo. Both before and during his presidency he believed England was more reliant on trade with the U.S. that the the other way around.The passages about early naval battles in the War of 1812 were fun: the fledgling United States whipping the most powerful navy in the world. Of course, Madison thought the war could easily be won on land and didn't even think we should have a navy. Nor did he think we should have a federal bank, until he ran out of money to carry on the war. The idea that he was ruining the U.S. economy with his embargo probably never occurred to him.But the book has a happy ending. The War of 1812 ended without destroying the U.S. Additionally, during Madison's presidency the extreme polarization between the Federalists and the Republicans was tempered quite a bit-more people recognized the need for a stronger federal government. All in all, the United States of America was in a better place at the end of Madison's 8 years as president."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"This is a very good study of Madison as president. Wills is, as always, a source of insight and the quality of writing is up to his usual high standard. Wills is primarily concerned with explaining why Madison's presidency was not very successful. Wills begins by reminding us that Madison's presidency was perhaps more successful than commonly perceived. He did serve 2 terms and did hand over the office to his chosen successor. The War of 1812, which he blundered into, was brought to a reasonably successful conclusion. Still, this is not a performance that matches his other remarkable achievements. Wills points out that Madison was constitutionally unsuited to being a President, particularly a wartime President. Madison was a modest, actually shy man, who excelled in the committee room but was certainly not the dynamic leader demanded by wartime events. Madison was not, however, merely swept along by events. Wills is careful to show that the War of 1812 was brought on in large part by Madison's unrealistic policies when in Jefferson's administration. Madison's doctrinaire Republicanism and own political choices also hampered his ability to conduct the war well. For example, he allowed the charter of the Bank of the United States to lapse, and the absence of a central bank became a major obstacle to adequate wartime financing. Following a point made originally by Henry Adams in his great series of books on the Jefferson and Madison administrations, what really saved the American republic were the institutions developed by the Federalists, notably the small but highly competent professional military and navy. Madison's administration would conclude with the de facto adoption of many Federalist policies. Wills provides also nice overviews of Madison's pre- and post-presidential careers. He is particularly good on Madison's attachment to the separation of Church and State. Wills is careful to give Madison his due for positive achievements as a President. For example, he was careful to stay within the bounds of the Constitution and his record on Civil Liberties as a wartime president is better than that of Lincoln or FDR. A good book that whets your interest for more information on Madison and this period of American history."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Garry Willis provides a short, but concise summary of the administration of James Madison. He gives an overview of problems that plagued James Madison as president. Even though Madison was extremely effective at the several Constitutional conventions he attended and was an excellent legislator, being the executive proved to be a more difficult task than Madison could effectively handle.The one shortcoming, was that at the end of book Willis notes that the Madison presidency experienced a surge in popularity without really delving into the reasons as to why this occured. This surge according to Willis prevents historians from rating Madison a failed president or for that matter an average president. There are some implications as to why this occured, but a more direct address of the issue would have been beneficial. All in all, however, Willis' accounting of the Madison presidency is a good overview into the administration of this president."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Wills has written a balanced overview of Madison's career, striving to put the presidential years in proper perspective with his earlier legislative career. However, this is not Wills' best effort as he displays an ambivalence regarding Madison throughout the text that leaves readers somewhat unsatisfied."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"As stated in the Editor's Note, the American President series, of which this book is a part, aims to \\".... present the grand panorama of our chief executive in volumes compact enough for the busy reader, lucid enough for the student, authoritative enough for the scholar.\\" At 164 pages of text, this book is certainly compact. It is quite lucid and it is surely authoritative. The book is not, however, an analysis of the life of James Madison, or even a comprehensive presentation of his whole life. It discusses the many facets of his life in terms of his contribution to the United States. As the man considered to be the \\"Father of the Constitution\\", a co-author of The Federalist (the series of essays that were instrumental in getting the Constitution ratified), as a leader in the first Congress, Secretary of State (under Thomas Jefferson) and then as a two term President, Madison made immense contributions to the founding and early government of the Untied States. All these facets of his career are discussed, but given the compactness of the book they are only discussed briefly.The primary thing that I came away with was the feeling that Madison was an enigma. I guess that this just shows my ignorance of the finer points of American history, as historians have been trying, largely unsuccessfully, for the last two hundred years to explain the enigma that was James Madison. Indeed, Madison was also vexed with the difficulty of trying to explain his many contradictory actions. In working on the Constitution he unsuccessfully tried to give the federal government the power to veto state laws. Yet he later was secretly the author of the Virginia Resolutions that promulgated the idea that the states had the right to nullify federal law. He opposed Hamilton's Bank of the US, but then tried to renew the charter and when this failed he supported the formation of the second Bank of the US. He opposed war, yet he led the US into a war with Britain for which it was completely unprepared. Garry Wills tries to come to grips with these, and other contradictions, but I do not think that he was completely successful, but then again neither has anyone else. For me, just realizing that this conundrum exits was worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"The author seems compelled to insert Jefferson whenever possible. The book becomes a comaparison of the two men, but moreso a comment on wether or not Jefferson approved of Madison's actions. I found this to be annoying as if I wanted to read about Jefferson I would read a book about him. The book is short on insight regarding Madison. I would look elsewhere if that is your objective."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"I've read over 10 of the American President Series bios (and bios on 15 other Presidents) and this was a pleasant surpise. In addition to Madison, Gary Willis offers some great insight to Jefferson, Monroe and the war of 1812 without getting bogged down in an area. I appreciated the chapter subdivisions that allowed me to pick it up and put it down easily. I throughly enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"I had a hard time getting interested in this book. Although well written, Wills could have made the subject more interesting. Madison after all did have a variety of experiences in his long life with the United States. Not only was he a war leader, but he was one of the chief framers of the Constitution.Generally the American Presidents series are nicely written books and the authors make the subjects interesting. I guess I am not a fan of Wills writing after this book, although I do have a few of his books on Nixon and Reagan in my library.An OK book about an interesting figure in history. McGovern's Lincoln stands out as the best of the American Presidents series books."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"After reading this book I came away with more information about Madison than I expected, which is a good thing. With that being said, however, I felt as I was reading that the author was not only pointing out some of the failures that Madison had (which were numerous), but also took the opportunity to bash Jefferson as well. It is interesting to see the author praise Madison for his early work (when he was more of a federalist) and then criticize him for nearly everything after he started thinking more like a republican. I don't think the author had to be so critical of Madison to get the point across that Madison was a much better legislature than an executor."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"This is the first book I read on Madison. I gained a knowledge about the events surrounding his presidency, but missed out on how he was personally operating within these events at times. For example, the author briefly mentions that Madison was close to death from an illness during his 2nd term, but beyond a paragraph, there was nothing about this. Also, next to nothing about his wife Dolly, who I think everyone has heard of at some point, and the prominent role she must have played.The book read like a textbook from school, and lacked life. I lack appreciation of Madison as a person or as a president after reading this book, and I am planning next on reading Jack Rakove's biography on Madison to make up for it.It also seems that the author needed to emphasize the negative aspects of his presidency to the exclusion of anything he did positively. After all, we won the war of 1812, and he was voted in a 2nd term. Madison is seen working in concert with Jefferson to manipulate public opinion, manipulate the constitution, and manipulate congress to see his rigid, impractical ideals through. That all may be true, but I want to see more emphasis on his good qualities, and what he did right, because there must have been something more of this than was shown in the book."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"As were many of the leading figures of the American Revolutionary period, James Madison was a Virginia aristocrat drawn to public service, but with a special interest in the structure of government. Madison was small in stature, somewhat sickly, and not particularly socially adept. He preferred to make his influence felt by operating in the background of legislative halls. His inability to judge and lead men was part of the reason that his presidency reeked of ineptitude.The author shows Madison at his intellectual best in his advocacy of the separation of church and state and his profound work in orchestrating the Constitutional Convention and the construction of the document. But it is rather evident that Madison exhibited ideological tendencies in addition to his studied rationality. He shifted rather dramatically from extolling a strong central state with the ability to veto state legislation to the republican position of Jefferson in the span of a few years. While president his Anti-Federalist and anti-British biases constantly led him down the wrong path. His convoluted dealings with Britain and France, his fascination with embargos, and his inability to select competent Cabinet officers and emissaries led unnecessarily to the War of 1812. His policies regarding the raising of an army, the selection of generals, the use of naval power, the financing of the war effort, and an obsession with invading Canada could have easily led to Britain defeating the US.Despite the obvious shortcomings of Madison's presidency, the author is inclined to rate Madison rather highly as a leading figure of the Revolution. But there are chinks in that belief. The document that Madison receives most credit for has had problems. The Constitution in many ways rolled back the republicanism of the Revolution. It's potential for maintaining gridlock is unmistakable. The ability of elites of one persuasion or the other to dominate government has been evident since 1789.The book is brief. There is no coverage of the lead up to Madison being elected president in 1808. One wonders why he even took that step. He was not the right man for the job. Perhaps the brevity of the book does not give a sufficiently balanced presentation to appreciate Madison. Many readers will wonder how we survived Madison's presidency. It makes one think of the current presidency in terms of its choices of personnel, policies, agendas, and ideological tendencies."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"Garry Willis's biography is a short, brilliant biography of a short and brilliant man. It covers the breadth of his career and conveys a great sense of the man's personality and his place in American history, and at the same time avoids the pitfall of hagiography; it does not hesitate to point out Madison's flaws, and one can read it and come away with a sense of having learned something new, even if one is already familiar with the era. Any reader of early American history will find his time well-spent with Willis's biography."},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"James Madison(1751 -- 1836) is revered for his role as one of our nation's Founders. Madison played a major role in organizing the Constitutional Convention, in drafting the Constitution, and in securing its ratification through cowriting \\"The Federalist\\" (with Hamilton) and through winning a difficult debate with Patrick Henry which led to the narrow ratification of the Constitution in his home state of Virginia. Madison also worked valiantly for the separation of church and state.Madison's accomplishments as the fourth President (1808 -- 1817) are less well remembered. Madison's presidency is the focus of this brief book by Garry Wills as part of the American Presidents series. Wills tries to explain why Madison's presidency was less successful that his brilliant earlier career. Wills points to Madison's provincialism, shyness, lack of executive experience, and tendencies toward idealism rather than practical politics to conclude that Madison's talents and prodigious learning made him better suited for a legislative, behind-the-scenes role than for a position as the nation's chief executive.After brief consideration of Madison's earlier accomplishments and his roles under the presidencies of Washington, Adams, and Jefferson (he was Jefferson's Secretary of State), Wills examines Madison's two terms as president. Early in his administration, Madison showed poor judgment about people in selecting his cabinet members, Supreme Court Justices, and military leaders. He also displayed weaknesses of leadership and administration in coordinating the efforts and minimizing the feuding of his subordinates. Even thought he came to see the wisdom of the Bank of the United States, (he had opposed Hamilton on the formation of the Bank) Madison foolishly allowed its charter to lapse, when any sort of endorsement on his part would likely have saved the bank in Congress. This mistake haunted Madison throughout his administration.Most of Wills's study of Madison's presidency is devoted, as it must be, to the War of 1812. If Madison's presidency is little-known, the War of 1812 remains our country's most confusing, obscure, and little understood conflict. The War had its roots in the conflict between England and Napoleon as Jefferson tried to steer clear of war. At the end of his presidency, at Madison's urging, Jefferson imposed an embargo with near disastrous results.Wills traces the complex course of events that led Madison into war. Some of these events were due to misunderstanding and to slowness of communication (Britain had repealed the Articles in Council to which the United States had taken offense in declaring war. The ship bringing the repeal to the United States crossed the Atlantic at the same time as the United States ship sailing to England with news that war had been declared.) But, Wills argues, Madison was active in bringing on the War, in part because he had grandiose visions of annexing Canada. The result was a conflict for which the United States was ill-prepared. The country had a weak army, only six frigates built during the Washington administration, no generals with military experience, and, with the end of the First Bank of the United States, no money to conduct the war. It was a harrowing conflict for the United States.The United States and Madison were fortunate to be able to end the War of 1812 without loss of territory. For Wills, Madison led the Nation into an unnecessary war for which it was ill-prepared. But Wills praises Madison for conducting the war without treading upon the constitutional rights of Americans. This was an important and difficult accomplishment which partially redeems Madison's presidency. And the United States came together as a nation following the conflict for the first time in its history.Wills's book is both more reflective and more detailed than most of the works in the American President's series. Indeed, Wills has written extensively about this period of our history. Readers of this volume may wish to turn to Wills's study \\"Henry Adams and the Making of America\\" which examines Henry Adams' monumental history of the Jefferson and Madison administrations. Wills' short study is heavily indebted to Adams's history. Ambitious readers may want to explore Adams's history of this period for themselves. It is available in a two-volume set from the Library of America.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"James Madison","review":"I'll admit I couldn't stomach finishing this book. I greatly admire Jefferson, and Wills' narrative gives such cursory treatment of Jefferson and Madison's motivations in the context of the events of the day, that it hardly comes across as impartial. Denouncing Jefferson and Madison's principled and active stand against the Alien and Sedition Act, and jumping to a 21st century perspective to offer a defense of the Act - really! And to say that Jefferson and Madison were obsessed with attacking Hamilton, while Hamilton was indifferent or friendly to them? Even a little reading of history would throw that claim into doubt."},{"Title":"Power Through Constructive Thinking","review":"This book awakens your spirit, and it makes perfect and logical sense about Christ in a way that I couldn't get from reading the Bible.

This book is a collection of writings compiled from pamphlets and includes sermons and meditations on a wide variety of subjects.The author's brilliant insights are vividly demonstrated by his psychological interpretation of Biblical passages, for example his sensible explanation of the 91st Psalm in the chapter titled \\"The Secret Place\\", where he convincingly shows that the psalmist knew about the individual's two minds: the conscious and the subconscious.Like the other great 20th century metaphysicians such as Florence Scovel-Shinn, Joseph Murphy and Ernest Holmes, Fox had a wonderful gift for conveying ancient spiritual truth in simple language that everyone can understand.He deals with issues like reincarnation, faith, scientific prayer, cosmic law, life after death and the practice of the presence of God in a most gripping and engaging manner, showing the true meaning of biblical passages in the light of psychology.My favorite chapters include (a) The Yoga Of Love, in which he confirms that there are many paths to the great goal, but that the pathway of love is the shortest and the easiest (b) The Wonder Child, about the indwelling presence of God, and (c) The Lord's Prayer, demonstrating what a carefully constructed formula this prayer is for the development of the soul (d) The Good Shepherd, a meditation on Psalm 23.Some chapters are introduced by quotes from the Bible and poems by Bulwer Lytton, George Meredith and Wordsworth among others.

I read this book first and in it, found the way to begin my own search for the truth of &quot;being.&quot; The best of it is, it isn't just theory or philosphy that seems to make sense -- it works. Fox doesn't give a distinct method of working, he says to find your own way of working. It isn't a religion. It isn't dogma. When he says working, he means praying effectively.Don't you tend to think of prayer as begging a supreme being for good luck? Don't most religions seem to truly be the &quot;opiate of the masses?&quot; Political structures, actually.Try &quot;The Golden Key.&quot; I've had so many serious problems melt into the nothingness that they really are. As Fox says in the first page, &quot;This mystic but intensely real force can pick you up today, now, from the midst of failure, ruin, misery and despair .....and solve your problems, smooth our difficulties, cut you free from any entanglements, and place you clear, safe, and happy upon the highroad of freedom and opportunity.&quot;It works. But keep in mind, you will apply these principles and your life will change wonderfully, and you will want to tell everyone you know that they can do the same, especially when you see those you love suffering. But most won't be interested, you'll see the most people want to hold on to their problems. It's the old saying, when the student is ready the teacher appears. I was ready 17 years ago and this book came into my life. I am happy, healthy, successful beyond my wildest expectations -- really!! -- I have more to look forward to every day and life is a wonderful experience for me.I have discovered that there is always more and more to discover in this wonderful universe, that there is so much more than anyone can ever dream of!I experience peace of mind more than I ever have before. This is not to say that every day in my life is perfect, but each day is pretty darned close to perfect! And when I let my thinking sink to a level where negativity and bad experiences begin coming into my life, I have learned a practical method of raising my conciousness back to the level that I best experience life.And this isn't a book that just helps you take on a philosphy that helps you carry your burdens, this is a practical method for dissolving negative conditions. The things Fox offers here can be the key to a gateway that you must travel for yourself. It's easier than you think! It's wonderful."},{"Title":"Power Through Constructive Thinking","review":"I stumbled on Emmet Fox after reading one of his quotes in another book.

If you are looking for answers about the nature of God, what is prayer and how does it work, who was Jesus and what was he really trying to teach us and what is the key that unlocks the deeper meaning of the bible; this is the book to read. Mr. Fox is the most profound writer in that he is able to relate the most complex ideas in an easily understood way. His love and excitememt of the stories and events of the bible are evident as he brings this medium alive to the reader. Never boring, but most of all totally relevant to living in today's world.

This book is so elegant, sincere and intelligent that it has made me reconsider my identification with Eastern spirituality and turn back to my Christian &quot;roots&quot;.

Emmet Fox has a wonderful way of looking at the scriptures with an open mindedness of symbolism rather than harsh and concreate literalism. It is a conglomeration of &quot;treatments&quot; for the mind and soul. Each chapter dealing separately with different human challenges. The most wonderful meditations and prayers are offered at the end of the book, providing a wonderful guide to scientific prayer. This is a book I have purchsed so many times I quit counting. I can not keep the beautiful gifts of enlightened truth revealed, to myself, I always end up giving it away. I have recomended my local book store to keep at least 3 in stock always.

I have an old paperback version of this title that was given to me ages ago. Over the years I have read it put it away and gone on to other books. But I always find my way leading back to Mr Fox's material. In my many years of studying metaphysics and world religions I have never found a body of work so elegantly and beautifully written that speaks to the human spirit as the writings of Mr. Fox. His material is the map that my soul follows to spiritual growth and finding peace. This reads as a simple statement but it is the guidebook that has enabled me to overcome enormous obstacles and problems from the past as well as the present and I know any that may appear in the future.Due to my poor old paperback's condition I have added this version to my K. Fire as well added a new paperback copy to my library of titles by Emmet Fox. This book comes with my highest recommendations.

It got me to a new level of understanding. Previously, I was having trouble with some of the concepts of attracting great things into my life based on my beliefs of self worth. When I realized I am not only worthy, but that it is my divine birthright, amazing events and feelings came about.

If there were 50 stars I would give it 50. Not that there is anything wrong with The Secret; this book is all that and far more, an oft-neglected work of sublime spiritual integrity, accessible to anyone. This is a powerful, metaphorical, dramatic, rewarding look into the soul of the Bible and a way of living. Walk the path, embrace the discipline and all honest traditions of spiritual discovery and you will be forever nourished. I keep this book by the bedside and read and re-read the Bible with new passion and seek to apply it to life. (If you are in an Eastern tradition or even an atheist, this book is still of profound benefit). Start with this book, read no more than one chapter a day, then proceed to Fox's Sermon on the Mount and Ten Commandments and take it from there. Fox, who died at 65 in 1951, struck a chord 70 years ago, when Depression-wracked people and the world were coming unglued and seeking solace. It is no accident that he is a virtual patron saint of Alcoholics Anonymous, founded 1935. His work has the flinty realism of those times, and he writes as if he has walked, like Dante's Beatrice, through the pit. If you are in the clergy and do not know him, you are in luck; he will inspire you for Friday night or Sunday morning. If you are an academic, this book will help you approach the Western Canon with new passion, and the Eastern Canon with wisdom. I was lucky to be educated by the best in great universities, but this book stands out. Wherever you are on life's path, this book will inspire you in walking the walk and will open many doors. Enjoy and prosper!"},{"Title":"Power Through Constructive Thinking","review":"Mr. Fox's classic exploration of Christian principle and prayer is a must for anyone wishing to deepen their faith. Evocative of many tenets of Christian Science, Mr. Fox delves into the concepts of divine health and healing, drawn directly from his interpretations of scripture. It's miraculous what he does, really. His chapter on The Lord's Prayer is a line-by-line reverie and exploration of Chrisianity's most powerful prose -- in plain words and clear thinking, Fox distills whole new universes of meaning from lines that can easily become rote and empty. This book is as helpful and accessible to those just coming to their faith as for the deeply faithful. You will turn to this book again and again to renew your personal attachment to God."},{"Title":"Power Through Constructive Thinking","review":"I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, I was introduced to Dr Fox's books about 10 years ago. This is my favorite of all I have read. It gives me peace and reminds me of what ever I might need reminded of at the time. I keep re-ordering this book because I give it to friends who are seeking peace."},{"Title":"Power Through Constructive Thinking","review":"I am 49 years old, and I have been actively on a spiritual path for 19 years. In that time I have read dozens upon dozens of spiritual books from all faiths, including New Age. Consequently, I have been exposed to some phenomenal wisdom. However, as I was reading Emmet Fox's book, I was acutely aware that this book was easily the most powerful book I had ever read. The evidence of its transformative power was palpable to me. To say that I highly recommend this book doesn't come close to the way I feel. I believe that a spiritual seeker who reads this book with an open mind and applies its wisdom will find he/she has access to a spiritual tool that can literally change his/her life in miraculous ways."},{"Title":"Power Through Constructive Thinking","review":"This book is a tremendous avenue to reawaken the senses and uplift your belief system in realizing that we control our destiny.

He uses Bible tracts to expand his ideas & show that this is nothing new. Mental science & the power of the mind has been around & recognised for thousands of years. Some successful people take the idea for granted & may not even realise they're using this system.Despite the books age & the period from which it came, Emmet writes clearly & with fluidity that makes you want to carry on & finish the next chapter.If you can just hold his ideas in place, remember them (write them down if need be) & daily put them into practice, you'll see your success's grow from day to day, followed health, happiness, prosperity & peace.

The Trojans counter-attack with a push all the way to the ships. And as we read, these gains and losses continue throughout the story. There is a short truce to mourn the dead and recoup, then the battle rages on only in our minds.It flows like a song. Lucid, with wonderful imagery and symbolism's. Homer, with Rouses' help, bring out the details of battle and personalize each warrior: we learn he has a wife, a family, and a life elsewhere, after he has been cut in two and stripped of his armor. Men are slaughtered with an indifference, as if they were mere cattle. I found it hard to follow the extensive list of characters. I believe some of the realism was lost to modernization. I also found the knowledge Homer had of the human anatomy surprising. The footnotes were helpful. Better than Odyssey.It is interesting to note: the gods control man, and man controls the gods. The two interact with each other; the gods send down their wrath and protections upon their favored nation. The gods are no different than the humans they try to control, except for their immortality. Hades is where all mortals go unto death. The parallels to the Bible are evident, with connotations of God. It can be hard to grasp.......a story that is 2,700 years old.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Foundation XML for Flash","review":"As I wrote about a month ago, I got the new XML book from Friends of Ed titled Foundation XML for Flash by Sas Jacobs. Now, I've been doing a bunch of XML work over the past couple of months and have gotten accustomed to using XML in my projects to do just about any kind of data updating, so I'm pretty well versed in writing loops around XML to retrieve data and to set up my buttons and all that. That being said, on to the book review:The book definitely had its up accompanied by a couple of downs. Firstly, the thing I loved about the book is that if you have no prior experience with XML, this is the perfect book for you. It walks you through almost everything you need to know about XML and teaches you how to set up some pretty simple XML usage examples to get the grasp of all the possible properties of the XML object in Flash. As you progress through the book, you get into using the XML components, which is something I haven't even dabbled in personally for the simple fact that I prefer to have total control over my XML and I like to be able to edit/see the code to make sure I understand it (and since I wrote it I surely understand it...). The components definitely have their UPS, however, and its good for doing things like using web services or more advanced data binding.Another thing I liked about the book was the fact that in the beginner chapters, where most beginners will learn the ropes of XML in Flash, Sas writes code that shows how to use pretty much all of the properties of the XML object, even though it's not the most efficient way of writing the code. She goes on to explain in the chapter summary how to more effectively write the code, but seeing the usage of some of those properties/methods is definitely helpful in case you're ever in a situation where you may benefit from them. The files the book uses are not available on a CD included, which is good because you don't have the hard CD cover sleeve in the back of the book making it impossible to keep it open and they're easily accessible from the Friends of Ed site (linked above) in the downloads section for the book.Alternately, the cons of the book: For an XML for Flash book, there is way too much talk about Microsoft Office. I understand that sometimes this may come in very handy when your client gives you an Excel or Word file and you're going to have to convert it into XML, but personally I don't think that topic applies to too many people working with XML outside of a huge corporate environment. I know I've never been passed off any office documents and had to convert them into XML, but I do understand the need may arise sometime so it's not entirely bad to put this in, but I don't think it's necessary to write four chapters on it as opposed to breezing over it.The database scripting language used in the book is ASP which I found kind of weird considering XML, like PHP, is a free technology and it would only make sense to use PHP for the database scripting examples. In Sas' defense, Friends of Ed has a book titled Foundation PHP 5 for Flash (which I also own and it is a very good book), so maybe covering some parts of it in ASP is not such a bad thing, just a personal preference for me to use PHP instead.As I was forewarned by Pete Aylward, the Product Manager at Friends of Ed, that some screenshots in the book were printed at low quality. As promised, however, the good quality images were put online in case you need to refer to them at the Friends of Ed site.Overall, as mentioned earlier, I think the book is great for people looking to dive right into XML who haven't had any previous knowledge of the technology. There are even mentions of things like XSLT and CSS along with other closely related technologies to make you aware of everything you need to know about XML. Get it, let it sink in, and enjoy the wonderful world that is XML and Flash. I promise you, you'll never want to do manual updating again.On a related note, check out my XML image gallery source code to get some more insight into XML and Flash. It is fully commented to help understand what is going on in the file."},{"Title":"Foundation XML for Flash","review":"This clearly written and well-organized book provides an overview of XML and how to use XML structured data in a variety of Flash projects. Anyone who is interested in working with XML in Flash and would like to learn more about how to get started will benefit from the easy-to-follow examples and the range of topics that the author has chosen to cover. Beginning with an overview of XML the chapters quickly move on to show how Flash can use XML data. The content is addressed to both Flash designers and developers. While Flash developers may already be familiar with the uses and specifications for XML schemas, Xpath, and XSLT; many Flash designers will gain an appreciation for many of the complexities of XML, as well as insight into the Web Services model. Later chapters, for example, reveal how to use Microsoft Word, Excel and Access to create XML content.As one who can manage Flash ActionScripting, but who does not have a strong programming background, I found the background into the various XML types to be quite helpful. The book does an excellent job of explaining entities, relationships, schemas and how to navigate an XML object in order to show the how to use XML content with Flash. I was particularly interested in the many applications for e-learning and found the blend of author's screenshots, code examples and main text to provide a nice balance of learning styles.I learned a lot from this work and am sure that it would be useful to people who are already familiar with Flash and want to learn more about how to use XML with this program."},{"Title":"Foundation XML for Flash","review":"This is a nice book to introduce someone to XML; however, it spends quite a bit of time on Microsoft Office integration with XML and Flash. This is a useful topic, but I would prefer the book be more aptly titled \\"Office XML and Flash\\". Not a bad buy for the money, but if you are looking for a hardcore XML and Flash book, this is probably not the one for you. If you have many clients that you believe would benefit from integrating their Microsoft Office 2003 suite with an online flash front-end, this would definitely be worth your time and money. I would estimate that at least 70% of this book is purely about using Office with XML. Again, not a bad buy, but keep the focus on Office in mind."},{"Title":"Foundation XML for Flash","review":"I have been fortunate enough to have been able to meet and hang out with Sas during past Flash conferences, and the lady is sharp. This book contains a lot of great information with working with XML. The writing is very straightforward and easy to read. There are many step-by-step examples on integrating XML data into your Flash applications. She delves into the basics, and then takes you through using the XMLConnector, consuming Web Services, XMLSocket, making decisions on how best to use XML, and she even talks about XML from Word 2003 (ack) and Excel 2003.A very long time ago I was using text files to get information into Flash, when I was new to the scene. I was a little wary of using XML because of all the nasty parsing I'd have to do, figuring out the paths to use when parsing, etc. But I jumped in and I hated XML for a little while. When it all started coming together, I grew to absolutely love XML. I cannot live without it now, and if you are new to Flash, or haven't used XML a lot - this book is simply perfect for you.Pros about this book:=============-Offers pretty broad coverage of technologies and approaches-Covers Excel and Word-The examples are easy to follow and to learn from-This book covers a very important topic-Nice coverage of XMLConnector, DataSet & XUpdateResolver-Covers Unity 2 Socket Server a bit-Book is 1-column format, great to see more like this-Makes XML more approachable for casual or newer developersCons about this book:==============- Would be nice to have seen XPath (MM's and XFactorStudio's) expounded on a bit more- Several of the screen shots in the book are fuzzy or bitmapped (yes, its true)As you can see, lots of Pros, just a couple Cons. This is a very worthy book to pick up and read, and possibly keep on your desk within arm's reach. Friends of Ed and it's signed up authors are releasing high-quality stuff. I am very glad to see this.If you are already a XML guru, you might still be able to pick up a few things here and there from this book - so its not really a strict Foundation book... its a Foundation book with a bunch of material to take you past the initial handshake. Well done Sas!"},{"Title":"Foundation XML for Flash","review":"After playing around with Flash for the last three years, I finally began to get serious about scripting about four months ago. Like a lot of folks, I seem to lack that little something that separates a true scripting genius from a scripting hack. Although there's always hope, my mind simply does not work that way.Unlike many code books, this one made sense to me immediately. XML is starting to look like something I can actually begin to incorporate into my projects, thanks to Sas's easy-to-read style and clear explanations and samples. It may not be the first choice for XML and Actionscript gurus, but it should be a good investment for folks who want a good intro into the subject matter. Finally, Sas's ample coverage of generating XML with MS Office seems quite appropriate, since it is the dominant office suite (for good or ill)."},{"Title":"Foundation XML for Flash","review":"I always thought that XML would be very hard to use but after readingFoundation XML for Flash, it seems a lot clearer to me. I'm new to XML butquite experienced with Flash and I found the book very helpful as a startingpoint for learning XML. The book explained the basic concepts of XML veryclearly and showed me why it is a great choice for Flash. I can alreadythink of several projects where it'll help me out.I really liked the different choices for working with XML in Flash. I didn'trealise that using the data components would be so easy or that I could workwith Web Services in Flash. That's opened up a whole new world for me.I was surprised to find out that I can use information from Office in Flash.In the past, I've spent a lot of time converting a Word document to a textfile so I could use it in Flash movies. I can see some real benefits inusing XML instead.All in all, this is a great book, easy to read and I'd recommend it toanyone who wants to learn more about Flash and XML. A must have for anyFlash developer's library!"},{"Title":"Foundation XML for Flash","review":"I found this book of no use whatsoever, a complete waste of money. As another reviewer noted, the screen shots are terrible. They really are. You're supposed to be able to use the information in them, too. It's supposed to be relevant.Also, half the book talks about using Office XML from Windows in your Flash. If you need to show a Word or Excel document in Flash, for some strange reason, great. This might be the book for you. But for the other 99% of what you use XML for in Flash, it's largely useless.The stuff you would use XML for in Flash, this book really doesn't help you with. It doesn't show you how to build helpful, object-oriented code libraries to make your work easier, for instance. It just shows you how difficult it is to process XML. Anything shown that might be helpful stops before it gets to the point of doing something, just leaving you with some trace output. Oh boy.I definitely don't recommend this book. Friends of Ed and Apress books are usually of poor quality anyway, but this takes the cake. A complete waste of money."},{"Title":"Foundation XML for Flash","review":"I really do not understand what the negative reviews are all about for this book. Even if you do not want to use office to generate your xml, you can still read over those chapters use the xml file created and learn HOW TO USE xml in flash which is what this book is about. I would probably not use office but I learned alot about processing the xml files that were created by the office program. Anyways this book took me from 0 knowledge about xml in flash to becoming fairly copmpetent in this subject. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Foundation XML for Flash","review":"I had to purchase this book for a class I'm taking, and now it's 8 weeks into the semester, and I seriously got nothing at all from this.

In this book, Asian culture is problematized as strange and foreign. Asian American health education differs very little from that of the general U.S. population, but to the extent that it does, the real issue is overcoming the barriers of language and poverty to serve isolated immigrant communities.

Brown's stunning photographic style showcased the day-to-day confluence of ordinary Vermonters living their lives in the rural splendor of the Northeast Kingdom in the far reaches of the lovely &quot;People's Republic Of Vermont&quot;. Often Country Journal would feature a number of his photos inside each issue, so one subscribing the magazine began to look for them both on the cover and inside, as well. Indeed, his work was what made me search for the latest issue at the beginning of each month.Here he stuns us with the majesty of Vermont as it transpires through its incredibly beautiful cycle of seasons in a way that only a photographer of such obvious abilities could. Herein he shares many of his favorites, and several of these I have seen before in other venues. The problem with a book filled with such gorgeously shot, developed and produced rural photographs is that one is tempted to carefully extract them for framing on the wall. They are really that terrific! Photographs range from shots of landscapes to silhouettes of a farmhouse steaming against the winter cold, from children walking down a dirt-covered tree lined country road exploding into autumn's extravagance to an elderly gentleman leaning against a barn with his favorite cat. One sits transfixed by the sheer variety of scenes and colors so native to the rural landscapes and personal portraits. This is a wonderful travelogue into the heart of New England.Brown shows us all of the changes that transpire in the North country, a place where the changes are so frequent and so momentous that they comprise six seasons, adding both the dreaded mud season of early springtime on the one hand, and the so-called 'off-season' after the autumn glory has been swept away, leaving cold bare trees and a hauntingly spare and vacant atmosphere to settle over the region on the other. Listen a few times to folksinger Tom Rush's rendition of &quot;Urge For Going&quot; a few times on the CD player and you will get the idea. Brown's imaginative hand is lovingly apparent in this book, displaying both the soulful visages of local inhabitants and the unique flavor of the haunting ever-changing scenery so typically Vermont. This is a distinctive and memorable recreation of what we love so much about being native new Englanders! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pictures from the Country: A Guide to Photographing Rural Life and Landscapes","review":"This is a book that I constantly go to for photographic inspiration ever since I purchased it back in 1995.

It is by no means comprehensive; however, Mr. Wollen chooses his focus carefully. The book is organized around three topics: the work and theory of Sergei Eisenstein, the auteur theory, and semiology. Mr. Wollen presents a clear, concise explication of each topic, augmented with many examples from films as well as other arts. Unlike many books on theory, Mr. Wollen's ideas are not obscure, and his language does not obfuscate the subject; his are, in fact, the clearest, most readable explanations of the basics of these theories that I have ever read. That is not to say the book is simplistic, however brief it may be. For the novice, this is a first-rate introduction to some of the basic principles of film criticism. For the authority, it's a pleasant read, a refresher on some classic ideas in film."},{"Title":"Two people,: A novel","review":"Little known but utterly charming book.

It seems only to have served any useful purpose from 1951 until 1953 during the Ruppelt years. Reports 1-12 were released in 1968 by NICAP. They were declassified by later Blue Book chief Robert Friend on 9th Sept 1960. Col. Friend was the man who helped Cpt. Ruppelt with the notorious 3 extra chapters of the revised edition of his UFO book, according to an interview he gave David Jacobs for his 1975 book on UFOs in America. In the introduction, James McDonald states that \\"these declassified reports suggest that Ruppelt's book is an understatement of the seriousness of the UFO problem.\\"From these reports it seems that Blue Book was a serious investigative unit until May 1953's Report 11. Then Ruppelt left. Report 12 from Sept 1953 is junk. \\"Unknown\\" as a conclusion is replaced with \\"Unsolved\\". With Ruppelt absent, presumably Prof J.A. Hynek was responsible for the concoction of astronomical explanations such as the probability of one sighting being \\"the moon reflecting off clouds\\", or another as being \\"searchlight on an aircraft\\".The Blue Book team seems to have been very busy between June and October 1952. According toUfos Are Real: Extraterrestrial Encounters Documented by the U.S. Government, Air Defense Command and the \\"no such agency\\" took over UFO investigation from 1953, so that may account for Blue Book becoming an irrelevance from then onwards."},{"Title":"Consider the lilies","review":"I count \\"Consider the Lillies\\" among the funniest books I've ever read.

I will look for more Presidential Bios. by Hans."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"I understand that Schlesinger's series on the American Presidents was intended to be a general overview for the general public. But this book in particular reads more like a Wikipedia entry. The details are glossed over but present. But Hayes himself is lost in the shuffle. His extensive diary-taking is hardly used and there is little insight into what makes him tick. The author describes Hayes' commitment to rights for freed blacks, but later says Hayes felt that the South would protect blacks if he ended Reconstruction. There is no discussion about the discrepancy here. Clearly no one who valued equal rights would believe ex-Confederates who had been lynching and terrorizing blacks would protect them.In all, it goes by too fast, there is too much uninteresting personal life information in the beginning, and his governorships and presidency goes by in the blink of an eye. Some would argue those events are the point to reading a biography of Hayes. Also, the writing is not very good and there are several points where you have to read a sentence twice because of curious word choice or placement."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"Rutherford B. Hayes has always ended up in the middle of presidential ratings, and Hans L. Trefousse's taut biography of our nineteenth president would not move him up or down that list. Trefousse does a good job in assessing President Hayes as a man and as an administrator, though \\"comprehensive\\" is not a word used to describe the biographies in this American Presidents' series.The remarkable ascendency of Hayes to the presidency after the disputed election of 1876 has parallels to the election of 2000, but Trefousse (with an apparent dig at George W. Bush) elevates Hayes by suggesting that Hayes tried to bring together various warring factions while Bush did not. It's a good reflection. Hayes's stellar service during the Civil War, in which the future president was wounded more than once, is covered in great detail by the author. (Because of the quiet nature of the four years Hayes spent in the White House, this book needed some \\"fleshing out\\"). We know that Hayes was honest and his administration was largely beneficial to the country. I view his term as something akin to Gerald Ford's...a transitional time where the country needed healing. In fact Hayes's biggest accomplishment was the removal of Federal troops from the South, meaning an end to Reconstruction. That is the chief legacy of the Hayes administration. The president was also big on civil service reform, taken to higher limits by Chester Arthur a few years later. It's a fascinating reminder that Indian affairs still took up some of the President's time, but what is one of the more notable aspects of this book is how often and how much President Hayes traveled while in office and in retirement. He was the first president to visit the West Coast, for example.Rutherford B. Hayes served adequately and he should be remembered for a solid four years in office, if not much more. There certainly have been worse presidents but Trefousse justifiably gives Hayes credit for some accomplishments and I recommend this book as a good introduction to our nineteenth president."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"This is the fourth Presidential biography I've read, if you count \\"Dark Horse\\" by Ken Ackerman as a biography (which is debatable). Each of the other three have their individual strengths (\\"Dark Horse\\" reads like a novel, Kevin Phillips' \\"William McKinley\\" deals with political philosophy, and Judith Ickes' book on Taft gives a psychological profile). This one does not accomplish any of the above.This book gives a fair description of Hayes' life. However, I find that Trefousse's writing style is hard to follow. Some of the details, like Hayes' schedule at school, were not really necessary.I am glad I read \\"Dark Horse\\" first. \\"Dark Horse\\" dealt with James Garfield, Hayes' immediate successor. That book introduced me to some people who had a role in Garfield's election and presidency, such as Roscoe Conklin and James Blaine. This enabled me to have a picture of these gentlemen while reading Trefousse.Trefousse mentioned the similarities between Hayes' election in 1876 and Bush's in 2000. He concluded the book by saying Hayes' healed divisions while Bush has failed to do so. I disagree. The first half of Hayes' administration found him at odds with his party, which was not true with Bush. Also, Hayes was stronger in leadership after the Democrats took over congress in the midterms. Bush now has the opportunity to show what he can do inspite of legislative opposition."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"Most U.S. presidents seeking a second term look upon their re-election as an affirmation of their first-term administration. Rutherford B. Hayes had to take a vicarious pleasure in the election of his successor, fellow Republican James Garfield. Four years earlier, when engaged in a tough fight to succeed President Grant, Hayes promised the voters he would serve only one term if elected. One gets the sense from reading this biography, however, that if he had sought re-election in 1880, voters would have awarded him with another term based on the distinguished and moderate agenda he accomplished during his first term, and in spite of the controversy surrounding his 1876 election.Trefousse quickly runs through the pre-political life of Hayes from his first-rate education to his distinguished military career, showing that Hayes was one of the most intellectually minded of American presidents and that his war record was very impressive. In the Civil War, Hayes was an officer of solid character, who earned the respect of his men by his faithful service to them. Hayes's character is also shown in the warm relationship he had with his wife Lucy for over forty years.Trefousse's recounting of Hayes's pre-presidential political life and the election of 1876 is finely done, but it is the chapters on Hayes's presidency that most pleasantly surprise. Before this book -- the first biography of Hayes I have read -- I primarily knew of Hayes as the president who ended Reconstruction after a controversial election. But there was far more to Hayes's administration. Once in office, Hayes sought civil service reform (much to the horror of many in his own party), toned down the nastier elements of America's Indian policy, and pushed hard for a moderate solution to the anti-immigrant sentiment towards the Chinese flaring out on the West Coast. He also fought to prevent silver from being used as coinage, fearing the inflated currency would ruin the nation's credit.In my opinion, the greatest value of The American President Series is what it has done for neglected U.S. presidents like Rutherford Hayes. By presenting a series of short volumes on all the American presidents, it makes the lives of those chief executives, who are generally considered less important in U.S. history, more accessible to the reading public. Few people, even among serious readers, would probably want to sit down with a 300- to 400-page book on the lives of Rutherford Hayes or Gerald Ford with the same anticipation they would a similar-size book on the lives of Theodore Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan. This wonderfully written series ensures that those readers will never again have to make the choice between a long biography on some neglected president or no biography at all."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"It seems that every Presidential biographer strives to make his subject out to be the next Washington of Lincoln, implicitly or explicitly. The same is true for this book about Hayes. While Hayes has usually fallen well short of that lofty mark in many assessments, he seems almost to acheive greatness in Trefousse's book. I found myself repeatedly asking if this man could be this good and insightful why isn't he considered one of our best leaders. In short, Hayes seems too good to be true in this slim volume. I was particularly disappointed in the chapter on the 1876 election. The book is a good overview of the issues Hayes faced but it has little depth or analysis. It also has piqued my curiosity to read more and determine if Hayes was, in fact, this good."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"If the lives and administrations of the U.S. Presidents are an interest of yours, then this series of short biographies is for you. At right around 200 pages, the books in the series give a good introduction to the fascinating men that have held this office.I especially enjoyed reading the author's discussion of the disputed election of 1876, and how it was very similar to what happened in the election of 2000. Even down to the state of Florida being one of the contested states. But in the end, Hayes was the president even without carrying a majority of the popular vote.The books in this series give a great overview of the president and his administration. For some, this will be enough. But for others, there could be enough interest generated for them to read more indepth biographies.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"The Bush-Gore election 0f 2000 is one of four disputed presidential elections in United States history, together with the 1800 contest among Jefferson, Burr and John Adams and the 1824 election which featured four candidates, John Quincy Adams, Jackson, Clay, and Crawford. But the most controversial of America's disputed presidential elections remains that of 1876 in which the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was determined to be the winner over the Democrat Samuel Tilden even though Tilden won the popular vote.Hans Trefousse, Distinguished Professor of History at Brooklyn College and a specialist in the Reconstruction Era, has written an informative short biography of Rutherford B. Hayes, the victor of 1876, as part of the American Presidents series. For readers interested in acquiring basic knowledge of one of our lesser known presidents,this biography is a good source.Rutherford B. Hayes (1822 -- 1893) attended Kenyon College and Harvard Law School. He enlisted in the Army at the outset of the Civil War and served with great distinction, rising to the rank of Major General. Hayes was elected twice to the House of Representatives and served three terms as the Governor of Ohio. In 1876, Hayes became a dark horse nominee for the presidency as a compromise candidate of a Republican Party torn by factionalism.The disputed presidential contest of 1876 came to dominate Hayes's career and his presidency. The electoral votes of three Southern states, Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana were sharply contested. Ultimately, a Commission appointed by Congress voted 8-7 along party lines to award the election to Hayes. The dispute over the election involved, among other issues, the votes of African Americans during Recounstuction. The votes of many counties that allegedly had supported Tilden were discounted because African Americans had been denied their right to vote by fraud and violence. The Hayes-Tilden election remains the most controversial election in our history, and scholars still are divided about whether the decision in favor of Hayes was proper.Hayes was placed in an extraordinarily difficult position as president with the Democrats calling for his impeachment and referring to Hayes as \\"his fraudulency\\" and the divided Republican Party offering tepid support to him at best. The immediate result of Hayes's election was the end of Reconstruction as the Army was removed from the South. Trefousse points out that this result would have likely happened in any event. Ironically, Hayes also withdrew support from Republican governors in South Carolina and Louisiana -- two states that were critical to his election. The end of Reconstruction which followed the disputed election and the segregation, Jim Crow, and discrimination which were to follow is the most remembered and unfortunate aspect of Hayes's presidency.Hayes himself was an honest, educated person with an excellent ability to get along with people, including those whose views differed from his own, and a good compromiser. He also had considerable independence and a progressive tendencies. He worked towards reform of the Civil Service System to base hiring decisions for lower-level positions on merit, supported education, and tried to protect African American voting rights. In the last two years of his presidency, he repeatedly vetoed attempts by the Democratically -controlled Congress to remove Federal officials and military personnel from polling places in the South -- on grounds that this removal would violate the voting rights of African Americans. Hayes pursued a moderate policy towards the American Indians and, in one of his finest acts, issued an apology to the Ponca Tribe for injusticies it had suffered during his Administration.While the 1876 election clouded his entire presidency, Hayes kept his promise to serve only one term. His presidency conciliated the nation which had been deeply divided by his election, and he governed in an honest scandal-free manner in contrast to the administration of his predecessor. Probably as a result of Hayes's substantial efforts in unifying the country, Tilden was denied the Democratic presidential nomination in 1880, and the election again went to the Republican candidate, James Garfield.Trefousse sees Hayes as a healer and a compromiser following his disputed election. Trefousee concludes: \\"aware of the tenuous nature of his election, he knew how to bridge over various disputes and thus heal the serious differences between factions, sections, and parties. ... His significance, then, lies in his ability to overcome factionalism and exercise power in such a way that the dubious nature of his election could eventually be forgotten.\\" (p. 150) These were valuable accomplishments for his time. Hayes is not among the greatest of American presidents, but the manner in which he handled his disputed presidency remains worth remembering.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"Too many minor factual errors and too much mediocre writing. Obviously, Schlesinger--or any other editor--never saw this work before it was printed."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"To be honest, I don't remember anything from this book, if that is any indication. Not our most memorable President, but I should remember something."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"A quick read, \\"Rutherford B. Hayes\\" touches all the highlights of Hayes&#65533;s interesting and varied career. The book draws from the usual sources: Ari Hoogenboom&#65533;s and Harry Barnard&#65533;s 20th century biographies, Watt Marchman&#65533;s work and Hayes&#65533;s own extensive diaries and correspondence. It draws to a lesser extent from newspaper accounts and editorials of Hayes&#65533;s day, particularly those concerning his political campaigns.What the book doesn&#65533;t do is provide new insight into Hayes himself: arguably the best-educated man ever elected to the presidency, someone who successfully navigated the treacherous political seas of the four decades that began just before the Civil War and ended with the election of McKinley a few years after Hayes&#65533;s death in 1893. Hayes&#65533;s interests in civil-service reform, literacy, equal rights for blacks, education, technology, penal reform and the establishment of facilities for the insane are all mentioned, but we get little more. His Civil War career (Hayes was in the thick of several battles, was wounded and eventually received a battlefield commission as a major general) merits somewhat more attention, but even that tends to go by in the writer&#65533;s apparent rush to finish his story.Hayes&#65533;s post-White House service to the Slater Fund, a 19th century foundation that did much to advance the education of freed slaves, merits a only few lines.At two points in his narrative the author points out the similarities between Hayes&#65533;s situation in the disputed 1877 election and the election of 2000, but he does so in such brief fashion as to suggest he added them at the last minute, perhaps at the urging of an editor. Again, what we don&#65533;t get at these points is any insight into the significance of these elections and their outcome, either constitutionally or in terms of the workings of the political system.Repeatedly, I found myself thinking I was reading a term paper, based on secondary sources. It&#65533;s not in a class with three other biographies I&#65533;ve read recently: David McCulloch&#65533;s \\"John Adams,\\" David Michaelis&#65533;s \\"N.C. Wyeth,\\" and Edmund Morris&#65533;s \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt.\\" Interestingly, each of these books chronicles the life of a compulsive diarist and letter-writer who became prominent in his own lifetime. Hayes had a similar compulsion, keeping a diary from his college days at Kenyon in the late 1830s until his death in 1893. Thousands of published and un-published letters he wrote are still in existence as well. They are available to scholars and could provide the basis for a thorough examination of Hayes&#65533;s life."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"This brief biography of Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president of the United States both benefits and suffers from being part of a series. The series is, of course, The American Presidents, under the editorship of Arthur M Schlesinger Jr. The aim of the series is to provide a brief biography of the presidents of the United States. Personally, I am finding this series to be very helpful on the lesser presidents like Hayes, but less helpful for presidents like Teddy Roosevelt, who has been written about quite extensively.Rutherford B. Hayes is a perfect subject for one of these brief biographies. Unless for some reason one wants to delve especially deep into Hayes's life, he is not one of the foremost presidents, and therefore not someone a great number of people want to spend a great deal of time studying. As Trefousse shows, he had some substantive achievements in his administration, including ending Reconstruction and the beginning of civil service reform. Moreover, he emerges as a likeable and admirable individual, as a person who did the office of president a great service. The book also is somewhat guilty of minimizing Hayes weaknesses as a president. However, Trefousse was not able to convince me that he is one of the pivotal figures in American history, and while I can't rule out going on to read another biography of Hayes at some point, I feel that 150 pages on Hayes was just about right.One thing that bothered me a bit in the book was Trefousse's attempt to stress parallels between Hayes's election and that of 2000. In both instances, the election was extremely close, with the loser winning more of the popular vote but losing on the electoral votes, with Florida playing a key role each time. The instances, however, are nonparallel in a number of other ways. In 1876 Hayes, the winner, was deprived of a vast number of black votes by Southerners harassing blacks as they attempted to vote, so that he probably would have won the popular vote as well as the electoral. In 2000, tens of thousands of black voters were illegally (in the strict since, for the Ashcroft Justice Department later ruled that the Civil Rights of black voters had been interfered with in the voter purge, not that it will reverse the outcome of the election) from the list of registered voters, depriving Gore of tens of thousands of votes. Also, although both Hayes and Bush became president of a deeply divided nation, Hayes worked very hard to unify the nation, while Bush has increased the division since being named president by the Supreme Court.Still, I do recommend this biography. It is likely to be all that one would need on Hayes. I do not think it is as strong as some of the other books I have read in the same series, for instance Garry Wills's superb little book on Madison or Remini's surprisingly good biography of John Quincy Adams (surprising because Remini is the foremost biographer of Jackson, and he and Adams were bitter political rivals)."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"I am currently reading a biography of every President. This is the first time I have selected one of the short biographies from the American President series. These biographies are very short, this particular one being 150 pages of text, made even shorter by the relatively small amount of text on each page - I would estimate roughly 2/3 the length of text compared to an \\"average\\" book. It is certainly more than manageable to read this book in one sitting.I was somewhat disappointed by the brevity of the book, which was even more pronounced than I expected. I will, however, review the book based upon its intention, and it was certainly not intended to be a comprehensive biography. The book does manage to present a full biographical sketch of Hayes with an acceptable overview of the issues in his Presidency. Trefousse's writing is straightforward although quite dry and he is overly concerned with comparing the 1876 and 2000 elections in an unsuccessful attempt to give the book a modern connection. Trefousse seems to approach his subject with about the same enthusiasm as a high school history student writing a term paper. The biggest shortcoming of the book however is not the lack of information but its inability to give the reader a true sense of Rutherford B. Hayes, the man.Ultimately, this book is barely satisfactory and I believe many readers will desire the more in depth biographies of either Ari Higenboom or Harry Barnard - I know I will probably go back and read one of these at some point. This book does, however, fill a need for a modern short biography of our 19th President and is recommendable in that capacity."},{"Title":"Rutherford B.

If you are looking for something that gives you information on the corrupt bargain or the start of the Gilded Age this book falls short."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"President Rutherford (called \\"Rud\\" by friends) is best known, probably, for being a (as his opponents put it) fraudulent president.\\" Of course, this refers to (a) his becoming president while being whipped in the national popular vote and (b) the process by which a couple contested southern states (perhaps ironic given the 2000 contested presidential election, Florida) had their electoral votes assigned to Hayes.But what else do most people know about Hayes? Probably not much. And this slender volume, another in the series \\"The American Presidents\\" (edited by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.), can remedy that ignorance.Hayes was born in Vermont and ended up moving to Ohio while still young. He went to college at Kenyon and then studies law at Harvard. Politically, he became a Whig until the party began imploding, whereupon he joined the new Republican Party. When the Civil War began, he volunteered for service and had a career of which he was justly proud. He rose through the ranks and fought ably in West Virginia and with the Army of the Potomac. As the war closed, his political career began with a vengeance. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives.The book continues with his political ascent, from Congressman to Governor of Ohio and to the Republican nomination for President in 1876 (with a handful of defeats, by the way, scattered in between). There were a whole series of contenders for the nomination, and Hayes' eventual nomination occurred because none of the major players could get enough delegates to be nominated, and Hayes was settled upon as the party's choice. Then, of course, his contested victory. The book does an excellent job dissecting what actually happened, and the interpretation is different from the standard view.As President, one of his first actions was beginning to remove federal troops from the South while trying to assure that recently freed slaves would retain their rights. It appears that he naively thought that southern leaders would actually live up to their promises to maintain the rights of freed slaves. The book does a good job outlining his accomplishments (adequate but not earth shaking) as well as his travails (intraparty disputes, gridlock with Congress, and so on). Apparently, he was perceived as honest and just, even by many opponents. Assessment? The author notes (Page 129): \\"What did Hayes contribute to the presidency? His biographers have generally credited him with unifying the country, though faulting him for not succeeding in safeguarding blacks' rights.\\"Then, his post-presidential career is outlined.This is another in a fine series of books. The thought dawns on me as I am reading books in this series that very few 19th century presidents really stood out and were transformational. I knew that intellectually, but reading these biographies emphasizes the point. Anyway, a good addition to the series and well worth reading if you wish to learn more about American presidents."},{"Title":"Rutherford B.

Within four years, however, the GOP had been restored to solid ground thanks to the Hayes presidency. This book tells the story of how it happened.I consider this to be a solid entry in the American Presidents series. I learned the requisite Hayes information, and felt as if I understood the man and his times much better upon conclusion. As per the usual, then, this series delivers another compelling Presidential biography for those who don't need all the details.The only reason I can't give it a full five-stars is because, at times, it gets bogged down in minutia like Civil War battle descriptions and behind-the-scenes politics. Thus, some sections were a little difficult to get through. Not terrible, but trying at times for the casual historian.Overall, \\"Rutherford B. Hayes\\" is another interesting, informative bio of our nation's highest office. Nothing to shy away from here."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"Despite what some have said of old Rutherford, he probably wasn't our worst president. In fact, if he had been elected in 2000, his compromising approach would have went a long way in meeting the opposition. As it was, his contested election was in 1876, and it polarized the country again between North and South. However, his compromising attitute healed the wounds of the Civil War and Reconstruction. This was at the expense of black civil rights.I thought the author Trefousse did a good job of detailing Hayes life. Some of the previous reviewers might not be able to distinguish the subject from the author, but I believe Trefousse did a good job of summarizing his subject. The author comes to the same conclusion I have come to. The 1876 election was a flawed election where Democrats disenfranchised the black population in the South and then screamed bloody cheating to those contesting the South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida ballots. Rutherford was not Rutherfraud, but an honest politician trying to make a difference.An OK read on our 19th President."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"If not for one thing, Rutherford B. Hayes would be an entirely forgettable president, part of the pantheon of minor executives from John Tyler to Millard Fillmore to Benjamin Harrison. The one thing that makes Hayes stand out is the controversial way he was elected, a controversy we were reminded of in recent years due to the 2000 election.In the history of the Presidency, there have actually been four questionable elections. In 1800 and 1824, the elections were thrown to the House where wheeling and dealing overrode democratic principles. In 1876, as in 2000, the doubts arose in the counting of certain votes and with the disenfranchisement of blacks in the South. In Hayes vs. Tilden, the iffiness was more-or-less resolved by a committee that was slightly skewed in favor of the Republican Hayes; this slight edge was all he needed.Hayes, like Bush, would have the legitimacy of his Presidency questioned. Bush would be able to affirm his rights to the office by winning a second term; Hayes, however, opted for retirement, and would justify his Presidency by his actions, the belief that he would have won in a fair election and his being succeeded by a politically similar James Garfield. As a President, he was honest and reasonably competent, but did little of historical distinction.Hans Trefousse's biography is similarly honest and competent but of no great distinction. Unlike many volumes of the American Presidents Series, Trefousse provides a full (if brief) biography as opposed to focusing solely on Hayes's Presidency. Indeed, Hayes's single term occupies only around a third of the book. The principal virtue of this book is that - as probably the first Hayes biography of the century - it offers a comparison to the 2000 election that previous biographies could not have had. Overall, this is a decently written book that gives some insight into an obscure President."},{"Title":"Rutherford B. Hayes","review":"Recently I had a sixteen hour drive to see my daughter in Kansas, and I was fortunate enough to have RUTHERFORD B. HAYES: AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SERIES along for the trip. While Hayes might not be a particularly notable president, like Washington or Lincoln; or a racy one, like Warren G. Harding; or an interesting one, like JFK--Trefousse does a fine job of portraying a thwarted genius, a man between a rock and a hard place, a man for whom greatness was a possibility unfulfilled. Anyone can write an interesting bio of Lincoln--but Rutherford B. Hayes is a challenge and a half, and I commend Mr. Trefousse for depicting him with such character and nobility. One warning, however: the tape is not likely to keep you awake during the long hours of a drive, and I did, once or twice, wake up in a cornfield, having missed his Ohio governorship and most of the reconstruction. I would listen to it again, but my grandson has taken the audiocassette now and used it for some sort of DJ mix.

But I must warn you potential reader: many of the narratives in this compilation are quite explicit - *definitely* not for puritanical prudes. The thing to remember is that Rumi uses these graphic images to make a point. His stories are not just crude attempts to make us chuckle. Rather, he seeks to lay bare the various impulses that push and pull us - impulses that in fact make up the Divine Comedy of human existence. Behind all of these impulses lies the Grand Impulse, which is our inate yet unconscious yearning for the Object of our existence - the Eternal Beloved - like water drops seeking a return to the ocean, or flowers naturally turning towards the sun. As long as this is kept in mind, Rumi's humour will reveal itself for what it is: a key to a higher and more profound understanding of what makes us human.

A lot of interesting stories surround Gaines and his empire. I highly recommend it to any Mad fan."},{"Title":"The Mad World of William M. Gaines (Bantam book Y7841)","review":"Bill Gaines, what a character! That's what Frank Jacobs stuffs into this book: tons of character. I felt like after reading this book I had met Bill Gaines - like I'd known him, sat down with him at one of his favorite restaurants, and laughed with him about some really zany antics. This was exactly what I was hoping for with this book.One of the focuses of my comic book studies has been the early days of comics, and particularly the assault on comics between 1948 and 1954. While Gaines wasn't the first publisher of comics to come under heavy fire, he certainly was the most notable. EC Comics pushed the boundaries of horror comics in the early 50s - an era which is briefly touched upon in this book. Gaines was the only witness in defense of comics at the Senate hearing that led to their demise, and because of it, became the face of the \\"evil\\" of comic books. When his comics line was banished from the newsstands, Gaines fell back on Mad, which flourished to become an extremely successful magazine.Knowing a basic biography on Gaines from other reading, including some of his quirks and generosity, I couldn't help but to want to learn more about this man. Frank Jacobs, who was a friend of Gaines and a contributor to Mad, writes an amusing and revealing semi-biographical, semi-anecdotal account of Bill Gaines life, work, and passions.Some of the stories in this book are so outrageous I couldn't help but smile while reading them. This is one of the liveliest biographies I've ever read. Biographies can often be dry, simply regurgitating facts on a timeline, but this book alternates between simple fact and an honest view into character.Jacobs may be a bit bias. He clearly had a great affection and admiration for Gaines. For further reading, I hope to find something from the point-of-view of Harvey Kurtzman, Mad's original creator and editor, who had a difficult relationship with Gaines.Overall, this was a wonderful book, providing insight not only to the life and character of William Gaines, but to many other members of the EC Comics/Mad Magazine crew."},{"Title":"Subliminal Winner, the","review":"I never really believed in subliminal tape programs and was advised to stay away because many of them are merely music and some you have no idea what they are planing in your mind.Because of my respect for Dr. Waitley and the publishers Nightingale-Conant, I went ahead and ordered this program.

It's a deeply spiritual book that explores important issues of human nature and development that transcend both Native American and 'western' cultures. It will appeal to parents of all races and creeds who desire to expand their abilities beyond the mere mechanics of 'child management' to the attainment of true parenting success.Laura Ramirez writes knowledgeably and with passion about the necessity of having a clear vision for our children and of understanding the sacred nature of our part in their lives; of the importance of honouring our children as unique individuals and of constantly promoting their wellbeing and development even as we work on ourselves to become the best role models for them that we can be.This book, once read, can be referred to again and again for good ideas, for comfort and support, for hope and inspiration. Virtually every page is a reminder of something we can do as parents to make the world a better place for our children and for ourselves and others.A work of meaning with its heart very much in the right place, Keepers of the Children is a very welcome addition to my personal library of parenting books and I'm sure it would be to yours, too.Buy yourself a copy and join Laura in her mission: to raise a generation of children who use their strengths to create a sense of belonging, meaning and contribution. \\"Such children will grow up to be adults who are lights unto our world.\\""},{"Title":"Keepers of the Children: Native American Wisdom and Parenting","review":"There are many books on the market that give advice on parenting, but Keepers of the Children is much more than that. It is a book that expresses a living wisdom meant for nurturing the soul of every human being, child or adult. Laura Ramirez writes words that are like a flowing river. They move through us and impart a remembrance of who we really are and why we are here - to see the wondrous potential in one another, and to help bring that seedling to healthy growth and full bloom. In the process, she reminds parents that we are entrusted with a sacred mission, and in that we do not impose what we believe our children should be, but learn to listen and see the clues they provide to help us guide them to their own highest and best good. As we do this, we are given the opportunity to observe ourselves and grow with the children.The chapters within the book are full and satisfying.(read them on Amazon's look inside the book). You can see from the headings alone that this is more than a \\"how to\\" book. It is full and rich in texture and content. I highly recommend Keepers of the Children to all parents, grandparents, relatives, teachers, and caregivers. This is a book about living a worthwhile life, and the wisdom within is relevant for all of us."},{"Title":"Keepers of the Children: Native American Wisdom and Parenting","review":"As a father of three boys (ages 11, 9 & 7), I have often struggled with the best approach for raising my sons. This book not only contains insights in my quest to raise productive boys in our society, but also contains insights for me as an adult to live my life better. For the most part, our society has failed in our parenting duties. Laura gently reminds us that raising children is a gift, one that we should not take lightly. She does an excellent job demonstrating that being a parent is a honor, and that we are blessed with the responsibility of being a parent.Laura provides concrete examples of her experiences in being a mom that drives home points she is making in every chapter. The book is scattered with words of encouragement that are very refreshing. I've read so many parenting books over the years, and have found only nuggets of wisdom in each of those books. However, after reading \\"Keepers of the Children\\", I find that the entire book itself is one healthy nugget to advance me on my parenting quest.

The author gives a lot of practical information on how we can raise our children with vision, honor their uniqueness and true nature and create a parent-child bond that will be the greatest gift a child could have. The chapter on discipline is exceptionally valuable. Another thing this book provides is the understanding that parenting is indeed a path of self-growth. Laura Ramirez truly gets the point accross that parenting is as much about guiding the unfolding of a child's sense of self as it is our own.In a world where so many people have a lost or incomplete sense of self and continually look for approval or satisfaction outside of themselves, this book can help to turn the tide. There is a strong movement, taking place right now, to transform parenting into a more nurturing, humane way of guiding and valuing children.

She emphasizes the importance of adults working to identify the failures they personally experienced during their own childhood development. By doing so, they are able to ensure they do not pass on that cycle of failure to their own children.We are reminded that as parents, we must first recognize ourselves as guardians and teachers rather than just mothers and fathers.Through encouraging and practical examples in an easy-to-use format, Ramirez focuses on how being a parent is more than just raising a child. She stresses the need to cultivate and nurture our children, both physically and spiritually, so they may reach their fullest potential with the inner strength and skills to appreciate their own unique abilities--thus allowing them the ability to be a happy and productive force in society.Armchair Interviews says: Overall, Keepers of the Children is an extraordinary guide that provides parents with thought-provoking strategies, information and skills to empower their children while assisting them to find their own identity and instill values which will help them flourish and grow throughout their lives."},{"Title":"Keepers of the Children: Native American Wisdom and Parenting","review":"This is a practical book with inspirational and common sense look at raising any child but especially raising a native american child.

The chemistry between J.J. and Chris was much more believable than the other two couples we read about. There was some quarreling, but they loved each other as well, and you could tell throughout the book. When they finally admitted seperately (to themselves) that they were in love with the other, I believed it!!!The waiting is real. So many books there is no waiting...they confess their love, get married, and live happily ever after. I'm glad it turned out the way it did. I KNEW how it would turn out, but was glad that while waiting, Jori came to some truths about herself...What happened at Christmas was completely unexpected! I was furious when I said \\"I could see this coming from miles away...\\" And then what I thought was coming didn't. Then something did come...then I had to wait MONTHS before what I thought was going to come finally did come!!!I can only imagine the torture Jori had to go through with the mother-in-law she had. No doubt Chris spent a lot of time protecting her from his family!

The writer, apparently a Jewish non-Zionist, shows deep sympathy for the Palestinian Arab cause. A careful reading of his annotated bibliography shows his lopsided favoritism for such sources as Palestinian Arab Nationalist propaganda, Antisemitic tract-writers like the unbalanced Israel Shahak, and now much-disputed, far-left revisionist historians. In his history section, Peretz lingers on the Palestinian Arab refugee problem while making only short mention of the long history of the Arab-Islamic oppression of the Jews and of the often neglected story of Jewish refugees from Arab countries. Decades of Palestinian Arab terrorism against both Jews and Arab \`collaborators' also gets only brief and general mention. Nonetheless, I credit him for trying to get beyond his obvious sympathies to a more factual, even-handed view--although he often doesn't succeed. Peretz provides enough facts to not leave much doubt of the main source of the Arab-Israeli dispute: continuing Arab failure to accept the Jews and Israel."},{"Title":"History of the Osage Nation","review":"I expected this book to be more about the Osage people and not so much about the white settlers of Pawhuska, OK."},{"Title":"Benjamin's Bride","review":"Benjamin's Bride is definitely a page-turner!

Benjamin's Bride is no exception.Patricia Collingsworth - called Mouse - is a determined young woman who excels at everything she does. Despite that intelligence and drive, knowledge brings no comfort. She rues her mousy looks, resents her human foibles and imperfections, and sometimes questions God's influence in her life. Her skill and foresight is put to the test one cold night on a deserted road in Colorado. She's overcome by men assigned to find their youngest brother a wife. In a remote compound in the Colorado wilderness, Mouse encounters evil of the foulest kind.Jacob Israel rules The Children of Israel with threats and cruelty in an Old Testament patriarchy. His word is law. Punishments for defying him vary from death by stoning to whipping. All Jacob's wives and children fear his wrath, for good reason. Jacob is evil personified, a self-appointed prophet who believes the Lord provides for him in many ways, most of them illegal. Mexican drug cartels, Arab arms dealers, and the Russian mafia are all used by Jacob to line his pockets and increase his power base world wide.Benjamin Israel is Jacob's youngest son. Jacob's cruelty and vile practices sicken him. He's been biding his time in silence, refusing to participate in group stonings and other tortures. Ben doubts the existence of a kindly God and is determined to escape. When the drugged and manhandled Mouse is forced to marry him in one of Jacob's sham ceremonies, Ben vows to save them both or die trying.From that point the danger and action escalate non stop. Ben and Mouse escape during a blinding blizzard. As they struggle to survive, both learn the true meaning of love - both God's and man's. Will prayers of protection by Christian believers save them? And will Colorado Bureau of Investigation agent Bob Barnes and his friend Father O'Flagherty find the young couple aliive?Benjamin's Bride is an exciting and satisfying read. Nobody creates stories depicting God's grace and human grit better than Nancy Marie. This one is a love story and action thriller combined."},{"Title":"Tall and Proud","review":"I recall really enjoying this book as a young adult, but all I could remember about it was the cover illustration, basics of the plot -- a girl stricken by polio for whom her parents buy a recovering racehorse -- and the back flap copy: &quot;There he stood, tall and proud, like a king on a hill.&quot; For ten years I have been hunting for this book under the title of &quot;King on a Hill&quot;! Terrific story of perseverance, of both the girl's struggle with her affliction, and of the petrified parents, to whom most of the well-horse care falls until the girl can perform the tasks herself.

When I was quite young, in the mid 70's - I used to read all of the time (still do). Even when I was suppose to be doing something else, I couldn't resist a book that was just lying there screaming at me to pick it up. One day I was outside helping my parents do farming chores. We were, among other things, burning brush. My mother told me to run up to the house to get a shovel and I made a detour and got a book too. Of course a 2 minute task turned into a 15 - 20 minute one. When I brought my mom the shovel she realized that I had gotten distracted by a book - yet again - and burned my \\"Tall and Proud\\" book.

My copy is well worn, with lots of dog-eared pages, highlighting and underlining. I love this book.I appreciate the in-depth information on the paths of the Qabala. It takes the reader to a gentle understanding of a powerful subject and does so in a manor that will not unbalance the neophyte.The book teaches path working with the use of many meditative options such as, imagining, candle burning, use of specific incense, stones, arch angels, sound and dance.I was surprised that when I decided to use the techniques in the path working that I did so in a slow manor. I would do a meditation with the book at my side and know that I had experienced something of importance, even though I wasn't sure what it was. After doing a path there would be enriching changes in my life. A month or two later I would be called back to the tree to do the next path. Again, it would be followed by more changes, some very subtle and some not so subtle! I loved and appreciated the whole process.

It gave great up to date references, how-to's, real experience from a man who has snowshoed over 100 miles. What interested me in buying the book is the date it was created (not to old). It will tell you about what types of equipment to purchase, what to wear, how to wear, how to read a compass all the way to what you should eat. I was drilled into the book, but as the pages started to slip by one by one, I realized that one thing was missing. You see the book says &quot;A state-of-the-art guide to equipment, skills, outfitting and more&quot;, well I hoped &quot;more&quot; meant &quot;HOW TO WALK&quot; advice. It covers everything but how to walk, turn, pivot, drop, craw, climb, etc.. I know once you start to snowshoe, it becomes easier to realize what to-do, but I am the type of person who likes to read what NOT TO DO, and avoid tearing my knees apart. OK, let me give the book some credit, it does tell you how to get through tough areas like high fresh powder, swamps, frozen lakes, and more, so if you have snowshoed a little bit your all set, but for the person who has not taken any steps yet, &quot;there is something missing&quot;. Maybe I should just get out there and fill in the blanks, but as I paged through other books, it did have the basics steps/turn instructions in it, I just wanted a more recent book.

Thus it is superior to Wayne Dynes's dismal \\"Encyclopedia of Homosexuality\\" of a few years back. Unfortunately, the authors left out major people, places and things in GLBT history and culture, and included some \\"flash in the pan\\" names that were big when this book was written but are no longer important or relevant. A revision is in order."},{"Title":"Completely Queer: The Gay and Lesbian Encyclopedia","review":"What a wonderfully entertianing way to learn about gay and lesbian culture. I am very pleased that I go this book."},{"Title":"Completely Queer: The Gay and Lesbian Encyclopedia","review":"I got this book as a birthday present and haven't been able to put it down since. It's fascinating and validating to see what a positive impact gays have had on our society. I've given copies to all of my friends."},{"Title":"Completely Queer: The Gay and Lesbian Encyclopedia","review":"At the risk of sounding snobbish, Hogan and Hudson's COMPLETELY QUEER will likely be more useful to the culturally disadvantaged than any one else: most of the entries are extremely obvious. Even so, I don't regret the purchase, for while it lacks depth it is indeed a useful starting point when one is confronted with a need for quick fact-checking re a movement, event, or name.Perhaps the most attractive thing about the volume is the short biographies it offers of various gay authors, artists, and activists. Need to have a quick sketch of the life and career of James Baldwin? Patricia Nell Warren? Robert Mapplethorpe? Not only does COMPLETELY QUEER give you the basics, it has no hesitation in discussing sexuality as it impacted on their lives and work--something that few other texts care to address so frankly and which is quite refreshing to find.The real trouble is that the text doesn't usually go far enough both overall and in terms of individual entries, and as a result COMPLETELY QUEER too often feels more like a collection of trivia than a serious reference text. That said, some entries are less factual than they are restatements of \\"pop knowledge\\" that may or not have any real basis in fact. I don't care what anyone, including Hogan and Hudson, has to say about it: although it seems possible on the basis of her work, we simply do not know for a fact that Sappho was sexually attracted to other women.Some of the omissions are also quite startling, particularly in reference to non-homosexual individuals who had major impacts on the gay and lesbian community. Antigay campaigner Anita Byrant, who had a tremendous influence on national thinking re the gay and lesbian community in the 1970s, is mentioned on at least six pages but is not given a specific entry; Judy Garland, a major gay icon whose death likely contributed to the community mood that gave rise to the Stonewall Riots, is not mentioned at all.Still, Hogan and Hudson make no pretense of being comprehensive, and in spite of these flaws COMPLETELY QUEER is well written, entertaining, and makes for an interesting coffee-table or bathroom book--the sort of thing you can pick up for a few minutes and find both generally informative and intriguing. Recommended in a general sort of way, just keep the above warnings in mind.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Completely Queer: The Gay and Lesbian Encyclopedia","review":"authoritative AND entertaining.

Although initially disappointed to hear it was not a Mac Fontana or a Thomas Black book, that disappointment faded before I finished the first page. His knowledge of fire fighting and his own experiences over the years all lend credibility to this intense and suspensful story. John Finney is a character you can not only like, but respect. Mr. Emerson shows a whole new dimension to his talent in this book. Earl Emerson books have always been at the top of my list, and VERTICAL BURN tops them all. Now the whining starts again as the wait for his next book begins!"},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"When Carol Burnett was just starting out, she appeared on Talk of the Town (later called The Ed Sullivan show) and sang a song titled, \\"I Saw Every Movie That Ann Sheridan Ever Made.\\" Well, I've read every book Earl Emerson has ever written. And Vertical Burn is well worth the long wait.This stand-alone novel is one of those books that will keep you reading well into the early hours of the morning, turning the pages and absorbing the details of the action as quickly as possible. It's literally a can't-put-down book.Given his background as a firefighter, Emerson brings a vast wealth of knowledge to this tale of the youngest firefighter in the family who slowly realizes he is being framed to take the fall for starting several horrific fires, two of them resulting in the deaths of his partners at the time.This is a meticulously well-plotted book (which explains why it was three years in the writing) with no strings left dangling; some mad and wicked and greedy villains and a climactic high-rise fire scene that will leave you breathless.As always, Emerson writes with a certain lyricism and with no excess fat; his characters are fully developed with very real, very human strengths and weaknesses. The narrative pacing is in top gear all the way through. It is an enormously entertaining book, even if the conspiracy at its core is a tad hard to believe.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"If there can be a literary equivalent to cinema verite, no one is better qualified than Earl Emerson to immerse his readers in the life and death realities of the world of professional firefighting. In VERTICAL BURN, Emerson, a twenty-four year veteran of the Seattle Fire Department, gives us a graphic and gritty, warts-and-all, microcosmic vision of that world...its daily routines, terrible stresses, moments of glory and terror...as seen through the eyes of his hero, John Finney, who has dedicated his own life and honor to his profession only to find himself at the mercy of a political/criminal cabal that threatens the one and would tarnish the other. Branded a coward and denied promotion after the (to him) inexplicable death of his long-time friend and partner in a questionable fire and sensing a cover-up, Finney starts his own investigation into its circumstances and uncovers evidence of a horrifying pattern of arson for profit being executed with diabolic ingenuity, apparently aided and abetted from within the department itself. Talk about smoke and mirrors! No one except his fellow firefighter Diana Moore is willing to take him seriously when he predicts that there will be more fires, and when his worst fears are realized, he is again demonized by the political powers-that-be as a glory-seeker and an arsonist. Helpless to prevent the initiation of the arsonists' final scenario, his focus narrows to putting his own life on the line to save those of hundreds as the novel culminates in a stunning confrontation between deadly treachery and death-defying heroism high in the skies above Seattle.VERTICAL BURN is the ultimate in you-are-there suspense fiction. Although its premise seems almost unbelievably horrific in the abstract, Mr. Emerson's skillful craftsmanship...his superb pacing and vivid characterizations...quickly caught me up in the story that he had to tell and made me completely willing to suspend my own disbelief that such things actually could be and simply accept as real his world wherein they well might and apparently do happen. Especially set in juxtaposition to the events of 9/11, I found living in that world an immensely moving and enormously satisfying reading experience."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"Other reviews will give you the plot. I will add that Emerson creates vivid, breathing, flawed human beings whose thoughts and feelings and actions interest me, and none more so than firefighter John Finney. This book is begging to be made into a movie!As for another reviewer's remark that Emerson wrote this book to cash in on 9/11, that's an unjustified accusation of his character. This book was probably already in the publisher's hands by 9/11, or near enough to, in order to be galleyed and proofed, and a book tour planned, for an April/May release.I'm glad to see Emerson's publisher is finally throwing some weight into supporting one of his books. With a little PR this guy could be on the bestseller lists in another book or two. And IMHO, it's long overdue."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"Vertical Burn is a fast moving suspense story set in Seattle. The characters are believable and the plot well thought out. Woven through this story are details of firefighting equipment and strategy. As a result, this reader now listens to reports of fires with new knowledge and interest. I enjoyed this book and would be surprised to hear that anybody could put it down once the plot is established. It is a page-turner that ranks with the best!"},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"Being a diehard Earl Emerson fan, I looked forward to this book with both avid anticipation and some measure of doubt. Anticipation, because Emerson is a born storyteller/writer and student of human nature--his series characters (Thomas Black and Mac Fontana) are completely believable and engaging, unlike so many mystery book characters who are promoters of the plot, not 'living' people involved in it. Doubt, because VERTICAL BURN is a stand alone book, and I feared that characterization might suffer in favor of action/thriller themes. No need to worry on that score--the lead characters in VB are drawn with Emerson's fine artist's hand, and you come to care about their lives and situational hazards almost immediately. That Emerson is a 24-year veteran of firefighting lends veracity to the plot and action--this writer KNOWS his stuff, and carries you with him into the most terrifying and tension-filled treatment of firefighting I've **ever** read. That the end highrise fire immediately brings to mind the tragedy of 9/11 is both disconcerting and fascinating; I feel now that I understand so much more about what happened in the WTC towers on that awful day. But VB is NOT based on 9/11 (was written long before)and reveals WHY every fireman's worst nightmare is battling a highrise fire. I promise--VERTICAL BURN will have you trembling with tension, and if you can sleep peacefully after completing it, you will have managed the aftereffects better than I. This is a terrific book. You'll be scrambling to find other Emerson books and, like me, you'll be eagerly awaiting his next!"},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"John Finney is a Seattle firefighter, son of former chief and brother of a captain.

This is a thriller from page one and doesn't let up.I started right after meeting Earl Emerson at a local bookstore and read nearly straight through the next 2 days."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"Earl Emerson is back and, though too long a wait, Vertical Burn was well worth the wait. This is not one of his series novels (Thomas Black, Mac Fontana), but a stand alone book that you wish was first in a series. Not only are the characters ones you'd like to hang out with again someday, but the plot and suspense are great. Fasinating insight into the world of firefighting, but it's the story that counts. And it's a great one. I hope Earl Emerson doesn't stay away so long next time."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"This is the first novel that I have read by this author, and I have to say that it is pretty darn good!! The suspense in this book is plenty, and it really keeps you guessing what is going to happen next with the characters. I have found that I have become somewhat concerned for the characters in this book, this is how real the author makes it sound. Excellent book to read on those cold nights with the fire roaring."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"In a departure from his two ongoing series (Thomas Black - Seattle detective and Mac Fontana - rural Washington fire-chief), Earl Emerson has come up with a top-notch mystery thriller. (Though some aspects of the fires and characters did borrow from similar ideas originally in the Fontana books.)Again the scene of the action is set in Seattle. A fire breaks out in a warehouse and musicians are supposedly trapped inside. For some reason most of the fire companies are answering false alarms and nuisance calls, so the fire fighters are seriously short-handed. The fire gets out of hand while Jack Finney and his partner are still searching for the victims. A wall falls on the partner and the lack of air and the heat force Finney from the building. Outside of the room where the partner is trapped, Finney runs into the chief and another firefighter. He tells them where his partner is before he is forced from the building. But the partner is never discovered until after the building has burnt to the ground.Six months later, Finney is still haunted by the fire especially since everyone blames him for leaving his partner to die. He has scoured the ruins of the warehouse repeatedly and studied all aspects of the official details on the fire. His suspicions grow that the fire was not an accident ... and fears that something worse is yet to come.Don't read this book before bed, because you'll never get to sleep! I couldn't put it down. Emerson's detailing of the fires and the heroes who risk their lives fighting them is superb. He knows the territory first hand and his writing puts you on the fire trucks and in the heart of the inferno! I liked his series books, but VERTICAL BURN is in a class by itself. It earned my *****+ rating, and I recommend it to all of you."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"Earl Emerson's new thriller, VERTICAL BURN, is a real page turner! Extremely well written with exceptionally interesting characters and plot. Engrossing enough that I read it in two sittings. Gets my vote for award consideration. Leroy Swanner"},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"Vertical Burn is an intricately plotted, fact-driven thriller. Emerson strikes a fine balance between fact and fiction, delivering both in needed and necessary amounts. As a reader of his other mystery series, I missed some of the close character development that the author established over many years and volumes. But as a stand-alone novel, this book has the same quick-witted dialogue and wonderfully drawn characters as his other works. If anything, I felt a deeper sense of right and wrong and tolerance for the human condition in this novel. It's tense, fast-paced, and truly scary. Emerson really writes what he knows."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"Earl Emerson is the author of the Shamus Award winning Thomas Black detective series. This is a series that concentrates quite heavily on the characters in the story and their development throughout the series as well as providing well-plotted mysteries. With VERTICAL BURN, Emerson has gone for a more action-oriented story, relying on his intimate knowledge of the fire brigade and fire fighting to enthuse his audience. To a large extent it works, the adrenaline charged brushes with death while combating a fire provide the story's high points, no questions asked.The story's protagonist is John Finney, a fireman of considerable experience with the Seattle Fire Department. The book gets off to a furious start when Finney's company is called out to a fire and when they arrive they are faced with a large building full of smoke with the possibility of victims trapped inside and no backup because all other crews are busy, called out to various alarms, both real and false. During their search of the building, Finney and his partner become trapped by a collapsed wall with the final result seeing Finney barely escape with his life, but his partner dying in the fire.The fallout from this tragedy is substantial for Finney both emotionally and physically. Apart from losing his partner and mentor, he suffers some pretty serious burns from the fire, but worse, he knows that in the eyes of his fellow firemen he is to blame for his partner's death. Due to memory loss thanks to the smoke inhalation he suffered, he can't be sure himself whether or not he was to blame.A second fire results in a similar outcome to the first. This time Finney is certain that facts are being fabricated by the fire investigators that make Finney look, at best incompetent and at worst, criminally negligent. It gets to the point where it looks very likely he is going to be accused of arson. It suddenly dawns on him that there is a serious conspiracy taking place from within the department. What also becomes very obvious is that he is being set up as the fall guy for this conspiracy and the frame is working disturbingly well.Left with very few allies in the department, he feels his only course of action is to start his own investigation. He aims to get to the bottom of why these fires had been set and how he might be able to convince the department chiefs of his innocence. It's this investigation that the storyline hinges with the action sequences merely a background setting.The story climaxes with a massive high-rise building fire that requires Finney to act as the hero in a bid to rescue over 200 people who are trapped. Although far-fetched in many aspects, not the least of which is how he came to be at the fire in the first place, these are scenes of pure entertainment as feats of super-human strength and astounding ingenuity take over.I enjoyed the breathless action sequences that came about each time a fire was fought. The fear and confusion felt during a fire was described by Emerson in such a way that it was obvious that he had experienced these feelings first hand. These sequences were strong and compelling.The focus is so much on the action sequences and the intricate details of fire fighting that the characterisation and the interaction between characters suffers somewhat. I felt the dialog didn't ring true and the reasons that prompted the conspiracy were so incredibly weak as to be non-existent. It was the conspiracy that really drove the whole storyline and when that disappeared, the whole story lost it's credibility in my mind.I also had a real problem with the inconsistent reactions of Finney. He swung from submissive yes-man to a take-charge action hero within a page time and again and this not only became confusing, I also found it incredibly frustrating, particularly whenever he was faced with some pretty hefty and occasionally outlandish accusations and decided to say or do nothing about them.For all out action with raging infernos as the focus, this is quite a thrilling book and certainly achieves that purpose. However, I thought it was hampered by the lack of believable storyline that is needed to give the book its substance."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"This stand-alone book of Emerson's was thrilling from the very first page to the very last page. I have read every book he's written in both his Thomas Black and his Mac Fontana series, and \\"Vertical Burn\\" tops every one of them. It was fast-paced and suspenseful. I would read into the early-morning hours every morning and would quit reading only due to sheer exhaustion. I felt as if I was the firefighter, dragging hose lines and hauling axes. I couldn't wait to find out if John Finney would live or die. I'd already had the utmost respect for firefighters, but this book gave me an insight into their world that I don't think I could ever forget. I recommend it for anyone who likes a fabulous action book...the only thing I regret is that there isn't a follow-up to read next! A+++++"},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"Sorry to say this book does not live up to the hype; nor the other reviews that praise it so much. It is only so-so.It isn't much of a thriller, about a third of the way through you have a pretty good idea of who the bad-guys are and can guess where the plot will lead. After two hundred pages your just on automatic, reading to get to the end you already know: Will the main character redeem himself; can he prove he's being framed; will he find love with the hot (pun intended) female fire figther we meet on page one; will the bad-guys get caught? Come on! Want to hazard a guess here & now?Even the parts that take place in the midst of burning buildings fail to bring any real excitement. And another thing, I've always had trouble with books where the main character is so stupid they can't see what the reader can see a mile away, here it happens in spades. After two fires where he is blamed for the death of fellow firemen and accused of arson what else does he need, to be branded with \\"FRAMED\\" on his forehead, to get the point.One had hoped this book would be much more based on comments and reviews but it isn't It's not bad, but it isn't that good. Wait until the paperback or you'll find yourself reading this book and when done ask \\"where's the fire?\\""},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"I agree with the Publishers Weekly review: The novel is, as expected, long on details of firefighting and its incipient hazards, though there is little mention of the real and enduring conflicts between the investigative arm of firefighters and law enforcement.I am disappointed in the book. It appears that Mr. Emerson took advantage of the 9/11 tragedy to incorporate some of the aspects of 9/11 into his complicated plot."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"I have been a Earl Emerson fan for many years, reading his Mac Fontana series, and his latest one Vertical Burn.His ability to describe the events and happenings around a fire scene and the Fire House are uncanny. Being in the Fire Service as well, it is almost like I was part of the Engine Company Crew. I also like his ability to simplify terms and actions of Firefighters to someone who may not have first hand experience. I would recommend this book to anyone to enjoy!"},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"I purchased this book to add to my collection; I have other books by Earl Emerson, several fearuring Mac Fontana, the others featuring Thomas Black. They were good. Vertical Burn, an extremely well written novel, a stand-alone--not a series novel--is Earl's best book yet.I was drawn into the story, not stopping until the fifth chapter. Vertical Burn opens with two firefighters, John Finney and Bill Cordifis going to a fire. Upon arrival, they discover themselves first on the scene. Numerous calls have thinned the number of available fire units. They don their gear and enter the flaming building. The author, a 23-year firefighing veteran, describes the work of the firefighters with alarming clarity, giving the reader a feeling of being in the building filling with flames and smoke, weighed down with the Nomex jackets, oxygen bottle, helmet, backpack and facemask. One can almost feel, the weight of the gear, the perspiration soaking through the clothing, the fire's searing heat. Timbers fall, trapping Cordifis. Finney relates Cordifis' location to the new team entering the building. They don't find Cordifis, who dies in the fire. We feel Finney's pain. Reeling over the loss of his partner and friend, John doesn't believe the fire was an accident. He begins his own investigation. Finney uncovers a conspiracy in which several firefighters along with building owners are torching buildings for profit. They have set him up! Now, he's in danger of losing his life. Finney's lone supporter, a female firefighter, helps to determine the people responsible for the fires and bring an end to the arson. His superiors \\"write him up.\\" The book ends with numerous fire companies responding to a call on yet another torched building. People trapped between floors in a high-rise building and firefighters are called to the rescue. The story holds the reader in suspense to the very last page! Earl Emerson has written one of the best suspense stories this reader has read in many years. This is the \\"year of the firefighter,\\" and Earl Emerson's literary contribution should not be missed. It is exciting, thrilling and very well written. Read this book--you'll be glad you did! You'll have a greater appreciation of what firefighters go through in their daily lives. Furthermore, you'll appreciate the creative gift of writer Earl Emerson."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"I've been an Earl Emerson fan for many years, and enjoy both of his main characters. John Finney, in Vertical Burn, is another terrific character, and one I hope we'll see again.

It was a long wait for this book, but it's one of his best!"},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"John Finney, the main character in Vertical Burn, is rather flat. The plot plodded along at a pace that barely kept me interested. I probably wouldn't have finished it if not for the fact that I'm a loyal Emerson fan. The book's highly detailed accounts of firefighting were obviously written by a pro in the field, but this was done at the expense of the phenomenal storytelling Emerson is so capable of. I wanted to get lost between the pages like I've done so many times with Thomas Black and Mac Fontana. This didn't even come close to happening as I read Vertical Burn."},{"Title":"VERTICAL BURN.","review":"\\"Vertical Burn\\" was written by Earl Emerson, a professional fireman.

The last chapter just sort of bluntly ends the story and there was alot more that could have been added.

(This second edition is what I am reviewing.) It is a door-stopper (1290-page) collection of well-known American authors writing about other well-known American authors. In his forward, Wilson says this is not a \\"critical anthology\\" but \\"a chronicle of the progress of literature in the United States as one finds it recorded by those who had some part in creating that literature.\\" He has excluded pieces by \\"professional literary critics.\\" As a result of this happy decision, we have in one volume a huge collection of fine writing on American literature. Some of the pieces are short, others run to well over 100 pages. Some will probably be familiar, others not.We have 11 short pieces by Poe on writers such as Longfellow and Hawthorne; Melville's 'Hawthorne and His Mosses\\"; Bayard Taylor's \\"Diversions of the Echo Club\\", on many 19-century American authors; Henry James' \\"Hawthorne\\" (complete); Twain's famous \\"\\"Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses\\" (hilarious, worth the price of admission alone); William Dean Howells on Twain; a long piece by Henry Adams on George Cabot Lodge; D.H.

The book is comprehensive as it discusses what ADHD is, common misconceptions of ADHD, communication and coaching strategies, the implications of medication, and parenting tips for the athlete. I appreciated the discussion on perceiving common behavior traits of ADDers as assets rather than liabilities for the athlete. The strategies and tactics he provides are common sense and easily applied. As a parent of a child with a head injury who presents with ADHD-like symptoms, I have found the communication and coaching tips very applicable to life skills...getting ready for school, completing homework or chores.

It was good to refresh my memory of the movie, because the movie was intense and, the way memory works, you inevitably forget certain important scenes.If you have not seen the movie, I would highly recommend the book. It describes many of the scenes in great detail. Also, some events in the movie that are a bit unclear are explained quite well in the book. For instance, when the T-X reprograms Terminator's memory system, it would seem as though it would be impossible for the Terminator to be on John Conner's side again. But the book explains that the Terminator re-booted his computer system, and thus was able to have a fresh start. In the movie, this is not explained at all, and the Terminator just comes back to save John Conner, which appears puzzling since he was, at that point in time, programmed to harm John Conner.The book is very action-focused - with very vivid descriptions of the actions that are occuring. I am actually quite impressed with the ability to write a book based on a movie of this complexity -- and still make it very readable, exciting, and a fun read.-- Michael GordonLos Angeles"},{"Title":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","review":"I read the book after having seen the movie. A book is supposed to give more of an insight into characters and the storyline than the movie can convey, but if a book is based on a movie (not the other way around) I would expect to see some consistency. I have to note one major mistake in the storyline from the book: Both in the book and in the movie, the Terminator tells John and Kate that Kate sent him back, not John, as the future John was dead. However, the book clearly shows the future John Connor sending the Terminator back through time (right in the beginning chapters). Unless there's something I'm missing here, that's a pretty bad blunder. On a positive note, it's still fun to read!"},{"Title":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","review":"I read this novel on a plane trip cross country. This book kept me spellbound. Riveting and pulsating don't come close to describe the story.The book is extremely well written and as the story unfolds, all else that is going on becomes meaningless.I also went to see the movie last night. Knowing how the story ended took some of the fun out of the movie, but not much.Non stop action, much like a Indiana Jones movie only even better and the sexy Terminatrix who is both beautiful and scary. I highly recommend the book and don't miss the movie."},{"Title":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","review":"John Connor, now older, is still a target for killer cyborgs from a possible future. The human resistance of the future has also sent back a Terminator, who saved Connor's life before. John's cyborg assassin, a Terminatrix(T-X), is far more advanced than anything ever seen in previous models. If he doesnt survive, the future of humans is lost. His only hope lies within himself, a girl from his past, and a Terminator(who looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger).I thought it was a good book and helped further explain the movie. It added more detail to the scenes. Its action packed and hard to put down. This novel will be a favorite for any terminator or schwarzenegger fan. While the movie may not be as good as the others, the book is just as good as any."},{"Title":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","review":"Although the movie was spectacular in special effects, so much detail from the book was left out. The audiobook offers so much more information about the entire story, its origins, and the constant changes within the world of the terminators that I rate this one as one of the best sci-fi novels out there. If your like me, just pop in an audiobook cd, turn the volume up and enjoy. You wont be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","review":"This book is the most thrilling and exciting book ever. It has awesome details to show the reader what is happening in the scene combined with an all ready spectacular plot this book is awesome and deserves all the complements it gets.The book tells an awesome story and has amazing events that will keep the reader reading intensly. The movie was also great but I think that reading the book before the movie sort of ruined the ending but all in all it was okay. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read and is a fan of the terminator series.An those who like the Governer of California."},{"Title":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","review":"I receieved this novel today, and from the moment i picked it up i didn't put it down until i finished it, bar from a real inconvient exam. But on to the novel, the way the story is written is brilliant just the way it propels you into the story its as if your taking a back seat. a very good read! can't wait to see it on the big screen."},{"Title":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","review":"Normally, when I read a book before I see the movie, it increases my desire to see said movie. Unfortunately, in the case of T3, the opposite has been true. Reading the novelization has made me uncertain whether or not I want to see the film at all, theatrically at least. There are sloppy errors of character development that should never have been overlooked--for example, refrences to the events of T2 having taken place in 1991, simply because that's when the movie was released. Logically, T2 couldn't have taken place in 199a, because the original film took place in '84 as revealed by Sarah Conor in the opening narration, and if T2 had taken place in '91, John would only be seven. Yes, it's a geeky fanboy detail, but if you're going to do a story based on someone else's universe, details are the things that matter.I also think I would've enjoyed this more had I not been reading S. M. Sterling's take on the T3 that could've been, &quot;Infiltrator,&quot; which, in my opinion, is a much better and more interesting story. T3: Rise of the Machines is, in my opinion, fast-food Terminator. &quot;Infiltrator&quot; and its follow-ups, are the real meal. While it's true that those books are each over 400 pages long and couldn't possibly have turned into two-hour action fests, I still feel the spirit of the Terminator films was captured more interestingly. I say all this only to explain that it's tough not to judge a molehill by the mountain it could have been. Having said that, though, T3 has good action, brisk pace, some cool twists of its own, and will probably do quite well at the box office.In closing ... the original Schwarzeneger Terminator was a Cyberdine Systems Model 101, NOT A T-800!!No fate but what we make.Cheers."},{"Title":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","review":"Artificial intelligence has been growing by leaps and bounds in the last 40 years, but advances in the field have been difficult, and recognition that advances have indeed been made prove to be very transitory. Research in AI is very odd for this reason: the belief that one has discovered an intelligent software system is very short lived, unlike other fields of research. It seems that researchers in AI are too hard on themselves, too easily persuaded, that their discoveries do not represent true intelligence.Writers though have expressed considerable enthusiasm regarding AI, and this book, and the movie that accompanies it, is ample proof. If only the field was advanced as this book portrays it to be. Concrete results and applications of AI though are currently accelerating, and there is little doubt that battlefield robots will be a natural consequence of the current AI technology.The book illuminates to some extent the method of time travel that was not discussed in the movie: the Hawking/Einstein wormhole scenario but generalized to superstrings. The superstring wormhole/time travel machine was discovered in the story by a graduate school at Oxford...an incredible achievement for one individual, and even more astounding given the fact that current superstring theory has no experimental ramifications, except for predicting a huge value for the cosmological constant. To go from the current state of superstring theory to one where one can do spacetime engineering as a consequence is quite a leap in knowledge. The wormhole is opened by the focusing of sunlight using of all things a solar sail, which results in several hundred terawatts of energy over nanosecond time scales to arrive at the place of the singularity equipment. Objects are able to travel backward in time, and the time machine has a replica under human control.The story has some plausibility in light of the current use of artificial intelligence in network engineering, especially network security, network event correlation, and network capacity planning. Indeed, it was announced this week that a technology is now available that will identify security risks and take action using auto-adapting artificial intelligence. The story makes Skynet one of these smart network applications, so intelligent in fact that it becomes \\"self-aware\\", gets paranoid about human intentions, and therefore orders a massive nuclear strike in order to remove the human threat. This move by Skynet makes the story somewhat implausible, for if, as the story holds, there is no \\"central core\\" to Skynet, it being instead a distributed application that runs on computers all over the world, then it would destroy itself in the very act of a global nuclear strike. It would have been better for Skynet to \\"lay low\\" and make sure power systems cannot be tampered with instead of ordering such a self-destrucutive act. It is the power systems that are most crucial for the survival of Skynet, and its distributed nature requires such power sources to be left intact globally, and not just \\"under the mountain\\" where its inventors program it. In addition, there is no need in the story for Skynet to become \\"self-aware\\" in order for it to engage in reasoning that will protect it from harm. The agents and spiders it moves around in the global Internet could make logical deductions to this effect. Such agents would then spend most of their time insuring that power supplies are redundant enough to keep Skynet's global nature intact.The action in the story is typical of the Terminator movies and book series, with the female-emulating TX Terminator robot, highly sophisticated technologically, taking the story for sure in this regard. But the story also captures the introspection of John Connor, the main character and hero, and the one responsible for leading the future war against the machines. A human being facing this knowledge of the future would be under considerable stress, and this is brought out in the story via his dreams. The dreams are of a nightmarish future, with a devastating war of humans against machines, a war that Connor and his lieutenants will eventually win, much to the chagrin of the machines. The machines can't accept their defeat, and consequently send replicas of themselves through time to try and kill Connor and his lieutenants.Should we label the machines as intelligent considering their behavior? Do intelligent entities engage in the violence and horror that these machines do? One can of course imagine schemes and plans that might justify such behavior, but a more practical strategy would be to ignore human interactions, or possibly engage in a mutual symbiosis. Intelligent entities realize the waste of resources and intellect in the making of violent confrontation, using it only as last resort. There are so many scenarios that would be more optimal for the course of action of these machines, and it would not be a credible argument to hold that they act as they do because of their training via humans, considering the relative sparsity of human violence throughout history. One should interpret therefore the machine decision for war as a mistake, and not one that is practical, and therefore not moral. They failed to seek alternatives that would insure their survival, and this is ample proof that they are not intelligent, or at best marginally so.The book though in a sense is a portent, however inaccurate, of things to come, and things that are happening right now in artificial intelligence. We do not have robot armies, but we have AI invading many domains: financial engineering, network engineering, mathematics, physics, Ecommerce, bioinformatics, to name just a few. The applications of AI are accelerating, and there is every indication that this trend will continue. We are entering a world of the silicon geniuses, the world of the avatars: we are indeed witnessing, and are priveleged to do so, the rise of the machines..."},{"Title":"Families on the Fault Line: America's Working Class Speaks About the Family, the Economy, Race, and Ethnicity","review":"This is a very readable book which uses the results of a large number of case studies to disclose the fiction of our &quot;classless&quot; society. She liberally sprinkles the text with intriguing parts of conversations which descibe a far different picture than we thought we knew. The most interesting part of this book shows very clearly the reason why the very people on the fault line refuse to acknowledge their condition and in doing so make it difficult to face the political machine that favors the families in the $100K and up income level. The most frightening part of this book is the evidence of the political machine which practically invites racism and other divisive forces into the arena. It seems the political arena is the only place we can solve that divisiveness and we need this book to help us there."},{"Title":"Families on the Fault Line: America's Working Class Speaks About the Family, the Economy, Race, and Ethnicity","review":"One aspect of Rubin's work that is disappointing is the deficiency of any plausible solutions to all of the problems she presents. While she does challenge the institutions that assist in keeping these invisible Americans at the bottom, she simply neglects to give any examples of institutions or policies that might benefit the lower classes, such as a childcare system that is safe, cost-efficient, does not deteriorate family values, and so forth. That becomes frustrating for readers who quickly tire of complaining about and pointing out problems without presenting any pathways to a solution.Nevertheless, Families on the Fault Line has a pretty broad audience, as shown through her word choice and sentence complexity. This book is a fast and interesting read for anyone interested in learning about the reality of being poor. Moreover, people in the middle and upper classes should read this book in order to get a better understanding of just how unglamorous being poor can be, and what a luxury it is to have job security, some extra money, be able to buy new clothes, afford a higher education for one's children. I highly recommend this book to anyone concerned about his or her future, because while the economy may look good now, a person cannot predict how it will be in another two decades."},{"Title":"Families on the Fault Line: America's Working Class Speaks About the Family, the Economy, Race, and Ethnicity","review":"Over the years, I've worked with a fairly large number of state-level data sets. In no instance, was the percentage of elementary school students who admitted to being eligible for free/reduced cost lunch less than fifty percent. This in spite of the fact that most of the families have two parents with two-bread-winners in low pay, dead-end job.Being eligible for free/reduced cost lunch is comparable to a family of four earning just over $24,000 as year. By any standard, that is poverty.In spite of the absurdly obsolete Horatio Alger tales of pluck, wit, and hard work making for success, the free/reduced cost lunch statistic is not only an indicator of the predicament of the family in the United States, it also helps explain why so many do poorly in school, eventually dropping out.Lillian Rubin's ethnography graphically details just how difficult it is to keep a working class family intact, housed, clothed and fed. If one parent loses his/her job, the results can be disastrous.Let's not fool ourselves, though, the women in Rubin's families work out of necessity not out of desire. Their menial, low-pay, low-benefit jobs are not the sort that bring anything more than a low-page pay check, not the kind of fulfillment claimed by women who have upper middle class professional jobs. Working class womens' work is drudgery.Since the demise of the capital-labor social contract, compensation for work in the U,S. has been vastly diminished by out-sourcing, internationalization, down-sizing, and technological development. Capital has internationalized to its substantial benefit, but labor has not.Working class American families live under constant stress. Recent articles in the New York Times have reported research that unrelenting stress produces physiological changes in the brain, undercutting short-term memory.It's bad enough to live in a world where working class is working poor. To be adversely affected physically and cognitively as well adds injury to injury."},{"Title":"Families on the Fault Line: America's Working Class Speaks About the Family, the Economy, Race, and Ethnicity","review":"This is truly a great book.

Overall, it's useable."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"I've been a fan of Stanley Milgram's work since my psychology grad school days in the late 60's. Fortunately, I also had the pleasure of hearing him speak and the honor of meeting him. So I waited with anticipation when I learned that Thomas Blass was writing a biography on Milgram. I was hoping that I would lean more about Milgram's groundbreaking research and that I might also end up liking him as a person, although I know that's certainly not the purpose of biography.Well, thanks to Blass's book I did learn a lot about Milgram, not all of it very pleasant. And even at that, it seems to me that Blass pulled some punches to avoid making Milgram even less attractive as a person, perhaps in deference to Milgram's wife and his children who cooperated in the writing of this biography. For example, Blass reports that Milgram delayed his departure from Paris until he found out if his French girlfriend was pregnant. Blass doesn't say whether she was or not or what happened if she in fact was. Blass frequently references Milgram's sexual appetite and conquests but avoids discussion of whether this carried over to Milgram's later life. When I met Milgram, he was in the company of a tall, beautiful young woman who was described simply as his \\"traveling companion\\".Blass does repeatedly mention Milgram's arrogance, snobbishness, and abrasiveness but also offers up what seem to be pedestrian acts of kindness attributed to Milgram and that he was a good family man. This \\"on the other hand\\" approach by Blass is apparently intended to imply that underneath it all Milgram could be very sensitive and kind or that he was \\"complicated\\". Blass also briefly mentions Milgram's drug use as a possible explanation of his mercurial behavior.Overall, I was left with the impression that although Milgram was certainly funny, clever, creative, and intellectually curious, he was also driven by a strong need to gain status and recognition and that he could be deceptive and manipulative, e.g., he wrote letters to politicians representing himself untruthfully and falsely claimed to be a French student in order to get a rent subsidy from the French government. Later in his career, he even hired a professional clipping service to find all the reviews of his books but then, despite his substantial income, complained about the cost of his children's education.Does this matter? In terms of Milgram's significant influence on social psychology and our understanding of obedience, the small world effect, etc., probably not. But in terms of biography just for the sake of recreational reading, to me it does. I almost hate to admit it but it's just more fun to read about someone you end up caring about, much like identifying with the main character in a movie. Although I was constantly reminded of Milgram's methodological cleverness and powers of observation, I couldn't shake the notion that Blass was too easy on him and that I would not have liked him very much as either a teacher or as a colleague. But perhaps this very type of personality is exactly what was needed to do the kinds of studies Milgram did, i.e., a \\"nicer\\" person wouldn't have done them.Despite these opinions, I would still recommend the book because Milgram's work is so socially significant, unconventional, and methodologically clever. You might also gain some insight into the department politics at two prestigious universities when Blass writes about Milgram's unsuccessful attempts to land a tenured position at Harvard and Yale. If you decide to read a psychologist's biography other than this one, I would definitely recommend \\"Love at Goon Park\\", the biography of Harry Harlow by Deborah Blum. I believe Harlow was even more influential than Milgram. Better yet, read them both."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"Stanley Milgram is one of the most influential social psychologists of our time, who through his obedience studies, made some of the greatest and most enduring contributions to psychology. Through his controversial experiments, that \\"shocked the world\\" he enabled us to make some sense of the atrocities that occurred during the Holocaust. He made us look at our dark side, and began a world-discourse about why we blindly obey authority. That discourse continues today and can be found everywhere and in everything from academic journals to films, books, music, and even dog-training manuals. Not only is Milgram's work fascinating but the man himself was just as captivating.In this superbly written biography of Milgram, Thomas Blass gives us an intimate look at the man behind the brilliance. Blass has meticulously researched Milgram's life and presented the reader with an honest, and not always complimentary, view of Stanley Milgram. I applaud Blass for his candid approach, and his balanced view of an extraordinary man. By revealing Milgram's darker side, Blass has cleverly demonstrated that we all share the same human foibles and weaknesses, and that ultimately the experimenter is no better and no worse than the subjects he uses in his experiments. We are all just humans.With the current state of our world, I believe renewed discourse on the subject of blind obedience could not have come at a better time. Milgram's work is relevant to just about every aspect of our lives from workplace social dynamics to terrorism. Because of that, I recommend this book to everyone who shares a background in psychology and most certainly for those who do not. Blass's book is a marvelous introduction to Milgram's work and to the fascinating man himself."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"I am not a psychologist and have absolutely no grounding in the theory or practice of psychology but something about Milgram has always fascinated me.It was therefore with some degree of trepidation that I ordered this book. I was worried that it would be full of jargon and too \\"heavy\\" for a non psychologist to deal with. This is certainly not the case. Dr Blass writes in a style that is easy to read and the whole book is very compelling. He has an obvious affection for Milgram as well as a huge and well researched knowledge base.Stanley Milgram conducted experiments which often revealed unpleasant aspects human nature, his work is both alarming and revealing and should be essential reading for everyone. This book provides not only an account of Milgram's life but also a great overview of his work.I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"Stanley Milgram was clearly a genius! His research on obedience to authority gave the world surprising insights into such phenomena as the role of ordinary people in the Nazi Holocaust. His innovative studies on the small world problem gave rise to the notion of six degrees of separation-which in recent years has been applied as a general principle in such diverse fields as physics, epidemiology and neuroscience. Whether we consider cognitive maps of cities, the lost letter method of assessing attitudes, the concept of the familiar stranger or Cyranoid communication, the mark of Milgram's research was its originality and brilliance in conceptualizing everyday events in a manner that elucidated the phenomenon, yet was never tried before.In this beautifully written biography of Milgram by Thomas Blass, we not only get a superb overview of Milgram's work, but we also find out about Stanley Milgram-the person. By learning about his parents and his childhood we can now understand what drew his interest into Holocaust relevant research. Following his graduate career, we can gain insight into the personalities and social dynamics that existed at the Harvard Department of Social Relations and how these forces shaped Milgram's research agenda. His European travels, studies and adventures (amorous and otherwise) fill out the picture of Stanley Milgram's early interests.Fortunately, Milgram was a prolific writer of letters to his friends that expressed his feelings at that moment. It appears that the author gained access to practically every word ever written by Milgram and through extensive interviews with Milgram's family, colleagues and students Blass compiled an even larger database of quotes and anecdotes which he appropriately shares with the reader. Some of these anecdotes are not complimentary, but I believe they give us an honest view of this very complex person. These firsthand testimonies paint an intriguing image of one of the most influential social scientists of our time."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"I admire those who ask the hard questions.

I'd love to see his take on the current state of affairs in our country. I first learned of Milgram as a college student who was one of a group duplicating his experiment. I didn't shock anybody and argued with the \\"experimenter\\" as the task was being explained to me. And having read this book I still proudly wear my \\"Question Authority\\" button in honor of Milgram.

The essential elements included a \`teacher' and a \`learner'. In reality only the \`teacher' was part of the experiment. His job or rather his orders were to test the \`learner' and for each question the learner answered incorrectly he would receive an electric shock up to the point at which he might die from it. Milgram showed that many of the randomly selected \`teachers' would inflict the maximum punishment without disobeying their \`orders'.This brilliant book tells the story of the man behind the experiment and the legacy at has left in the world today. A brilliantly written, well constructed, fast flowing narratives takes the reader from Milgram's early days through his family and professional life and discusses the legacy of this amazing experiment.Seth J.

Each semester, my Introduction to Sociology students almost unanimously deny that they would be among the majority who obeyed to the point of killing someone. Their reactions are worth a study in themselves.Milgram's contribution to understanding human frailty cannot be overestimated. He shows us that we are not superior to those who torture and those who commit atrocities. As Hannah Arendt reminded us, evil is truly banal.This is a good book for what it shows us about the wizard behind the curtain and what it shows about ourselves."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"Stanley Milgram (1933-1984) was a social psychologist whose research has had a far-reaching influence on both psychology and on the view of social psychological research at large. If you've taken a general psychology or social psychology course, you may remember him as \\"The Obedience Guy\\" or \\"The Shock Guy\\" as Milgram designed research studies to test the ordinary person's level of obedience to an authority figure when the authority asked the person to administer shocks in the name of research of learning. What you may not know (or remember) is that Milgram did those studies very early in his career, and went on to do other things (and to influence views regarding deception in research). Blass discusses all of these things in a very engaging way that whisks the reader along Milgram's life and times (in true social psychological fashion - always think about the social factors that may influence behavior).Blass covers Milgram's life from birth to the day of his death, and includes a description of studies that his work influenced even after his death. His descriptions of Milgram's life, personality, and thoughts are peppered with direct quotes from letters written by Milgram and from interviews with those who knew Milgram and studied under him. What emerged was the picture of a creative man who was interested in not simply obedience, but the world - his curiosity pushed him to study cross-cultural phenomena as well as research methods in social psychology such as the \\"lost letter technique\\" (where stamped/addressed letters are left in public and public views of certain events/topics are gauged by how many letters regarding that topic actually are mailed by those who find them).Readers who are interested in the history of psychology, the personality behind the researchers in psychology, and the historical influences on the individuals who become \\"famous\\" psychologists will be interested in Blass' detailed descriptions of Milgram's life and experiences. Those who are only interested in learning more about the obedience experiments may not like this book, and would probably enjoy reading Milgram's own \\"Obedience to Authority\\" text than this book."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"I found this book by Dr. Blass very informative and I thought it displayed the life of Stanley Milgram in a way that most people could enjoy, despite its topic being something potentially dull. As an aspiring social scientist myself, I found the explanation of his life and schooling filled in the gaps of what I was unaware of beautifully, keeping me engaged, not simply reading for information. Prior to reading the biography I was familiar with the obedience experiments, but the emphasis placed on Milgram's work outside of obedience added to the well-rounded picture of the man that Blass was attempting to display. Through quotes, pictures, and diagrams, the mystery that is Stanley Milgram comes to life, leaving readers at their own discretion for how to interpret his works and personality.The social implications for all of the research within the book, not simply the obedience experiments, is what Blass expertly conveys, and as a result this is a great tool for getting information about the lesser known research subjects. I highly recommend this book not only for gaining insight, but for pleasure as well."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"So, here's a biography of one academic social psychologist by another one, and guess what? It's fascinating!Most of the credit has to go to the subject of this book, Stanley Milgram, who was without question the most famous social psychologist who ever trod the halls of academe.You may never have heard Milgram's name, but you've surely heard about at least two of his most famous experiments. One was the fiendishly clever experiment he devised to study the small-world phenomenon, more popularly known as \\"Six Degrees of Separation.\\" His experiments yielded empirical evidence for the validity of that theory. However, the other, best known as Milgram's \\"obedience experiments,\\" gets the lion's share of the attention in this biography. It was these experiments that were the primary sources of Milgram's fame -- and his notoriety.Milgram set out in the early 1960s, barely out of graduate school, to determine the extent to which people picked at random would inflict pain on others simply because they were urged to do so by a credible authority figure. He subjected hundreds of New Haven residents to a laboratory protocol in which a man presented as a professor asked them to administer more and more powerful electric shocks to a person in an adjoining room, ostensibly in order to correct his \\"errors\\" in answering questions that were part of a learning regimen. To the astonishment of Milgram, his research assistants and staff, and virtually everyone he later shared his findings with, a staggeringly large proportion of otherwise seemingly sane, stable, even \\"nice\\" people followed instructions up to a level clearly labeled as dangerous. Less than 20 years after the end of World War II and the madness of the Nazi era, this revelation was beyond shocking. To most, it was mortifying, because it cast such an unfavorable light on human behavior in every country, not just Germany. And it helped make Stanley Milgram so controversial in his field that he was denied the chance to secure a permanent faculty post at Harvard or Yale, where he trained, or at any other of the country's most prestigious schools.The emphasis Blass places on the obedience experiments may well be justified from the perspective of a social psychologist, since Milgram's work in that area remains controversial to this day, alternately vilified and extolled as brilliant, and is still described in virtually every standard text in the field. Unfortunately, the author gives short shrift to Milgram's exploration of the small-world phenomenon, which may yet prove to have been far more significant from a broader perspective. The concept of \\"Six Degrees of Separation\\" has come to be understood as a fundamental property of all complex networks, from the Internet to atoms in a lattice to human society. Blass mentions this significance it what seems to be an afterthought, and his highly abbreviated description of Milgram's experimental design is far too cryptic to make much sense. In fact, Blass (or perhaps his publisher) betrays a fundamental lack of understanding of Milgram's role in the history of the small-world phenomenon by referring to Milgram in the book's subtitle as \\"the Father of Six Degrees.\\" In fact, the obscure Hungarian playwright who first advanced the hypothesis on the stage in the late 1920s is no doubt restlessly turning over in his grave at the insult.The Man Who Shocked the World is fascinating not just because of the profound implications of Stanley Milgram's work but also because he was such a complex, colorful, and often brilliantly funny man. Interspersed among the descriptions of Milgram's relationships with his teachers and fellow faculty members, and the lengthy descriptions of so many of his experiments, are excerpts from his extensive correspondence with family and friends. Milgram was an endlessly good-humored writer with an exceedingly non-academic way with words, and Thomas Blass shares just enough of the man's writerly talents to make this book an outstanding read.(From Mal Warwick's Blog on Books)"},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"Very interesting and well written. If you don't know of Milgram's work, this is a great introduction. If you do, this will fill in many insights to his research and, especially, his often controversial life! A good read for almost anyone. He certainly was one of the most important social pyschologists of the 20th century, whether you agree with his methods or not.

Fortunately, I am pleased to say this couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, it's a fascinating and well-written book by Blass, who is recognised as the authority on Milgram.Since I am not a psychologist myself, what struck me initially was how readable an account this actually is. I was also extremely impressed by the incredible level of detail and nuance that Blass offers about Milgram's life and work. I've read some earlier material on Milgram that Blass wrote over the years, which is one reason I was looking forward to the publication of the biography.In my view, it offers a very important and unparalleled glimpse into the life as well as full range of research of a man who became so controversial--in large measure--for revealing a disturbing side of human behaviour that has proven to transcend boundaries of time and culture. Now more than ever--given the current state of affairs on the world stage--I feel this book is a very important contribution to the field of psychology, and obedience to authority in particular. Moreover, given the far reaching implications of the subject matter and the readability of this book, it should appeal to an even broader audience."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"Great book, couldn't put it down. It is an excellent book to get the whole story about Milgram and his famous experiment. What great insight Milgram found out about man, but was man ready to look in the mirror? If you teach psychology, or you are just interested in psychology, and want a more in depth look at Milgram, you won't go wrong with this one. My students are enjoying this as well."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"Milgram seemed to share the showmanship of P.T. Barnum and ingenuity of reality show creator Mark Burnett. If Milgram were alive, he might have been a top reality show creator.Milgram seems most notable not for the results of his experiments but for their conception and content. He hardly modified the approach used by Asch in his conformity experiments, which relied on deception, but he changed the subject to something considerably more striking. The result may have been significant, but think about it: any result would have attracted attention. Comparing the experimental situation with concentration camp situation is what first made the experiment newsworthy. If the result had been that no one or very few shocked, then news could have been generated of how much better behaved Americans are. Or if Germans also didn't shock much, it could have been claimed people nowadays are much better behaved than folks back in World War II. Given the catchy experiment, the results hardly mattered in the sense that the very description of what the experiment was doing would catch people's attention.Which isn't necessarily bad. Milgram brought social psychology out of relative obscurity. To a good extent, he bailed out psychology in general, whose reputation had been damaged by decades of speculations without much support.As a situationist, Milgram recognized that our social lives are quite complex. Rather than spend much time theorizing, he experimented. Don't know? Don't invent a reason, go gather facts. It's a measure of just how complex we are socially that even having gathered results, as with the \\"obedience\\" experiments, Milgram seemed at a lost to explain what was happening. Blass notes about Milgram's \\"Obedience to Authority book\\" that \\"Milgram's theorizing is the weakest part of the book\\". Milgram's feeble appeal to cybernetics contrasts sharply with his description of the experiment. Blass also notes that the kind of \\"obedience\\" Milgram studied doesn't seem at all sufficient to explain what happened during the Holocaust.Milgram shouldn't be faulted for the problems with his theorizing. How many psychologists can theorize well? There's still an enormous amount we don't know about ourselves and the way we interact. Milgram's gift seems to have been sensing that and instead finding novel ways to help us to learn about ourselves. Even if the content and results of his experiments are someday forgotten, the spirit of bold experimentation that Milgram brought to social psychology will be of great value. Blass communicates that. So I don't know if Blass is the \\"undisputed expert\\" but the book seems well-researched and quite readable."},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","review":"I enjoyed reading Dr. Blass's book on Stanley Milgram.Besides growing up in the same area in the Bronx as Milgram the book is a good read and does not drag.

He provides a great deal of important information about the times, though naturally his bias shows through frequently.Adam of Bremen seems to have clearly held Tacitus in high regard, perhaps even as a role model, as this work reminded me of Tacitus's in structure while at the same time using \\"Germania\\" as the basis for the first few chapters.I found this translation to be very readable, and the introduction was quite helpful in understanding the history behind the academic understanding of the text. For anyone interested in the history of the Middle Ages, or in Scandinavia, this work is highly recommended."},{"Title":"History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen","review":"Overall an excellent book; however, inspect it closely upon recieving it.

That, in and of itself, should be enough to make this very interesting reading if you are a history lover. This was written almost 1000 years ago; think about that, 1000 years ago!The book is a compilation of 4 volumes written by Adam, a priest, as a treatise covering the history of the catholic church in northern Germany from 788 to his present time (approx. 1075).It also addresses the mission of the church to preach to the northern islands (present day Scandinavia) as this was a part of the bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen and this is were the book is most interesting because it confirms the early Viking explorations to Iceland, Greenland and Vinland (most likely Newfoundland in Canada) which is to say that it is a record of the finding of North America before Columbus was even born; heck, this would be before Columbus' grandparents were born. Still bored?Adam was a catholic priest of little renown in his time, but well educated, as his honorary title Magister Adam would suggest that he had passed through all levels of higher education. He was invited to join the church of Bremen by the archbishop and eventually became director of the cathedral's school. He composed this work whilst director of the school.\\"Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum\\" (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) is Adam of Bremen's opus; a history of the actions of the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, originally written in latin as all 'gesta episcoporum' (deeds of bishops) were. It is a record of the accomplishments of the archbishopric (perhaps even written a bit boastfully) especially in the mission to save the savage barbarians of the northern islands.This is a wonderful record of the dark ages including references to earlier works, which Adam would have had easy access to in the library of the church of Bremen, by historians such as The Venerable St. Bede (\\"the father of English History\\" & author of \\"The Ecclesiastical History of the English People\\"), Einhard (biographer for Charlemagne), and Cassiodorus (chief assistant to Theodoric the Great of Italy).The first 3 books are a history and the 4th is more geographical. All information is, of course, relevant to the time it was written and needs to be confirmed, but the book on a whole is accurate for the time of the writing.This is a wonderful source for anyone that is trying to gain an understanding of the dark ages, especially from the viewpoint of the catholic church which essentially ruled the dark ages."},{"Title":"Austrian Economics A Reader The Ludwig Von Mises Lecture Series Volume 18","review":"Editor Richard Ebeling (born 1950) is an American libertarian author, and was president of the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) from 2003 to 2008.

(Pg. 43)After acknowledging the \\"considerable controversy\\" over Mises \\"praxeological axiom\\" (i.e., his deductive derivation of conclusions from an original set of axioms), Murray Rothbard explains that Mises was working \\"within a Kantian philosophical framework,\\" and believed that like the laws of thought, \\"the axiom is a priori to human experience and hence apodictically certain.\\" (Pg. 60)In Hayek's widely-reprinted essay \\"The Use of Knowledge in Society,\\" he argues that we should look at the price system as a mechanism for communicating information, and he suggests that \\"I am convinced that... if the people guided by the price changes understood that their decisions woulod have significance far beyond their immediate aim, this mechanism would have been acclaimed as one of the greatest triumphs of the human mind.\\" (Pg. 258-259)This very broad and complete collection provides an extremely useful overview of the entire \\"Austrian\\" approach to economics."},{"Title":"Prophecy, Dreams, and Evangelism","review":"Prophecy, Dreams, and Evangelism is a ground-breaking, up to the minute book that has the potential to change the way we reach people altogether.

This should be in the hands of every pastor, teacher, evangelist, bible study group, youth group, and sewing circle in the church! Even my children have learned how to help people powerfully encounter their Father who loves them, giving words of encouragement and life to other children and adults as well.Every week our teenagers are *excited* to go out to the local teen hangouts at the mall and put into practice what we've learned from Doug Addison, and the results are astounding. I've never seen anything like it. Teenagers are coming into the Kingdom at an amazing rate, and are being launched into a wonderful relationship with the Lord because they are experiencing first hand how deeply He loves them and how very interested in their lives He is!This is a book for such a time as this... right now in history, right now in the story of the church... right now in the lives of everyone we touch."},{"Title":"Prophecy, Dreams, and Evangelism","review":"I remember reading years ago the verse where Paul said he didn't depend on an ability to persuade with words but he let God's power be demonstrated. I wanted to be able to do that but at that time I didn't know how and I hadn't really seen other people do it either. This book talks about how any of us can actually do that within our current culture and relationships. It really isn't about something as limiting as a method. It is about equipping you to be able to cooperate with God to speak to the ones he is drawing to himself. It will help you recognize the process people go through to believe in God and the types of things to do and say that are most likely to keep the conversation open. It can prepare you to hear God for other people and how to encourage them. I have read the book and I have tried the things in it at work, at the mall and on the street. I want you to know it was fun and I saw an effectiveness I hadn't experienced before.

I have had a deep faith my entire life and have been raised in an evangelical environment, but I have never been satisfied with any method of \\"witnessing\\" and in fact most methods have left me embarrassed. I could not get comfortable with traditional methods, and found that most of time, people were pushed further away from God rather than being drawn in by an expression of His love. Now, the freedom to be myself and to allow the Holy Spirit to reach out through me has revolutionized not only my attitude and approach to witnessing, but my entire philosophy in life. The servant evangelism methods that I have found a great appreciation for are enhanced by the approach of Prohphetic Evangelism. I find that opportunities to speak prophetically to clients, friends and strangers with the Prophetic Evangelism style have changed the way I think, pray and live forever.

I wasn't doing it enough, I wasn't doing it right, I hadn't lead anyone to the Lord, etc. I went to several popular \\"how-to\\" seminars. I watched how other believers harassed and hectored people in the Name of Jesus and wanted to hide in shame, and to apologize to those people, and tell them that what they were being subjected to was NOT from the heart of God for them, nor pleasing to Him. These things I witnessed struck me as terribly disrespectful to people. THEN I took a workshop and learned the principles in this book. What a relief! I can treat others with dignity and respect. I can convey God's heart to them. I can jump out in faith, speaking what I feel God wants to say to them, and amazingly, \\"the net will appear!\\" God will show up, and bless the socks off the person, and they will never be the same. The book goes into Doug Addison's personal journey, so the reader will know how this was revealed to him. It makes a useful review of how Jesus Himself did evangelism. It outlines the process of how someone becomes a disciple of Jesus - and guess what, it's most likely not an immediate, one time decision! It teaches ways to communicate effectively (avoiding \\"Christianese\\"). And it helps the reader develop confidence that God can speak through her/him, and use her/him, all the time, every day, in interaction with just about everybody. I believe the principles in this book helped me incorporate into my deepest soul and spirit what it means to become more like Jesus. I have been using this approach exculsively, individually and in outreaches with groups, and all I can say is, it makes evangelism FUN again!"},{"Title":"Prophecy, Dreams, and Evangelism","review":"In this book Doug has an amazing ability to reveal how things work in the supernatural.

This book was a nonstop read for me. It was easy to read, strong content and great impact."},{"Title":"The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition","review":"This is the book which made C.S. Lewis' reputation as a critic of medieval and renaissance literature; in the original, medieval, sense, it was the \\"piece\\" that marked his transition from Apprentice to Master. It was first published in 1936, and has been reprinted many times. (I have 1960s copies of Oxford's 1958 \\"Galaxy Book\\" paperback edition; the cover of the recent Oxford Paperback is a great improvement.) As originally written, it covered the development of allegorical narrative from late classical antiquity to the Elizabethan poet Spenser's \\"Faerie Queene,\\" with particular attention to the \\"Allegorical Love Poems of the Middle Ages\\" (the working title).Unhappily for the book's long-term reputation, Lewis was persuaded to add to the planned text an earlier summary of modern theories of \\"courtly love\\" in medieval life and literature. Lewis himself noted that this theoretical construction did not quite fit the texts he analyzed in detail, and the whole approach is now regarded as at best problematic, and by many as simply wrong. Since Lewis presented the material with unusual clarity and wit, however, he has come to be treated as an authoritative source on \\"Courtly Love\\" theory by some, and attacked as such by others.The rest of the book, being based on original studies of primary sources, retains much of its value. Later textual studies and shifts in crticial theory have only slightly diminished its value, and his discussions of such now-obscure writers as Martianus Capella remain among the most inviting of introductions. Lewis' treatment of \\"The Romance of the Rose\\" is still illuminating (and the point of departure for many recent re-considerations). His chapter on \\"The Faerie Queene\\" is regarded by some competent scholars as the foundation of modern study of the unfinished epic.Although Lewis never looses sight of the entertainment value of many of the works he discusses (and some of them never had any), he is concerned to show that they addressed real problems of human behavior and emotions, and their presentation in narratives. Norman Cantor (not, on the whole, a great admirer) reports from first-hand experience that the book helped make the study of medieval romances respectable in academic circles. My own reading of the secondary literature (pre- and post-Lewis) brought me to a similar conclusion.It is probably of interest to note that, according to Lewis himself, the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" did NOT arise from his studies of allegory, and that their allegorical implications arose spontaneously in his mind. One has to wonder whether he would have written \\"The Allegory of Love\\" differently after, rather than before, those experiences.Serious students of English literature, and medieval literature in general, will find \\"The Allegory of Love\\" more than worth their time. So will those who simply enjoy reading Arthurian literature, and several other types of story. For many who are familiar only with Lewis the fantasist, or Lewis the Christian apologist, it will open new perspectives."},{"Title":"The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition","review":"\\"The Allegory of Love\\" is an academic work that, among other things, traces the concept of love in literature, particularly the concept of courtly love in medieval literature. In the \\"Encyclopdia Britannica,\\" it is listed before all the other works of Lewis as \\"his finest scholarly work.\\" This shows the book's importance in making Lewis a respected literary critic.The main point of the first part of the book is that the concept of love changed in the literature of France in the eleventh century and has influenced the arts up to our day. Many years later, however, in \\"The Four Loves,\\" Lewis admits that he had treated the concept of love too much like a literary phenomenon and failed to see that many characteristics of erotic love which he had attributed to eleventh-century France are in fact characteristics that lie in the very nature of erotic love (e.g., the tendency to make love into a god who sanctions any crime committed in its name).Having said this, \\"The Allegory of Love\\" is still a great academic work that delights as much as it instructs - a milestone in the Lewis Canon."},{"Title":"The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition","review":"While most associate Mr. Lewis with an assortment of tomes of otherworld fantasias (Narnia, Lion, Witch and Wardrobe, etc) or contemporary crisis, Allegory of Love is a very well written and scholarly study of medieval period (he once wrote that while the Renaissance was always a personlized venture for scholars, the dark ages belonged to boyhood), replete with references to not only incubala but extensive Greek, mystics, and Shakepeariana. It's nearly in the stylization and tradition of Fraser's &quot;Golden Bough&quot; with the precision of someone devoted to writing on, say, Milton or Donne. I hadn't really expected as fine and as much from this, but found without reservation it to be one of the hundred (perhaps fifty) best books I've ever read.

Therefore, there might be some shoppers who have read the former and are wondering whether they should read the latter. This review is for those shoppers.In short, if you liked OHEL, I think you will probably like AoL. Some specifics:1) Lewis began working on AoL when he was in his 20s, and _Collected Letters_, vol. 1, reveals a mindset in the young Lewis less appealing than that which would later help to make him beloved by his readers. Does this mindset mar AoL? No, not at all. Lewis was approaching 40 when AoL was published, and in it his voice is essentially indistinguishable from that of the later Lewis.2) I haven't yet read _Boxen_, but I'm guessing that it gives ample evidence that Lewis's writing style developed substantially over time. Is AoL an early enough work that it exposes the rough edges in Lewis's prose? No, it is not.3) While both OHEL and AoL are written for literature scholars, I found OHEL to be reasonably accessible and AoL even more so.4) AoL is far more focused and coherent than OHEL, making for a more pleasurable read.5) AoL was for Lewis a labor of love--no pun intended--while there was a reason he gave OHEL its nickname.For me, OHEL was a 5-star work. If it also was for you, I think you'll give AoL 5 stars, too."},{"Title":"The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition","review":"A difficult book to rank as it was not written for the general reader (like myself).

I compromised with a rating of 6. Definitely worth a look for literary scholars interested in this field of study or Lewis devotees interested in perusing his academic work."},{"Title":"Mapping And Imagination In The Great Basin: A Cartographic History","review":"This is not just a recounting of the exploration of the Great Basin, the vast territory between the Sierras and the Colorado and Arizona Rockies but a major review of the major periods of time when the Basin and Range province, as geologists term it, was one of the most deadly barriers to westward migration from the states. And the popular attitude toward it and how it changed from a land of drought and death to the tourist lands of today.The Old Spanish Trail wended its way to California through the Sonoran Desert to the south, but Spanish settlement never got further north than the Tucson area. Far to the north both the Oregon Trail and the Santa Fe trail started in Missouri and crossed the formidable Great Plains; the latter in the days after the Louisiana Purchase passed into Nuevo Mexico from Colorado.Except for the raiding Comanches of the Grat Plains and further west, the mighty Navajo nation, there was little Indian settlement to bar western travel; the tribes along the Gila and in southern California were not a horse culture and were known as digger Indians for the primitive sticks they used to plant corn.After the railroads met at Ogden, Utah, safe cross travel across the Great Basin was finally possible, and the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific went through to the south.Except for the Mormons and their far flung State of Deseret, there was litle traffic except catty-corner to San Diego.The major emphasis was not on setllement until the fabulously rich mining cities, such as Virginia City, led to development from the Sierra Nevada side. Entry from the SE was blocked by the Rio Grande box, the Grand Canyon, and the scenic canyon lands. And Death Valley is still as isolated as it ever was away fro the railway.After the mining settled down, the Santa Fe built a branch line to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and a hotel; the Union Pacific through Ogden began to run tourist trains and built resorts.In the mid 19th century there were several major scientific mapping expeditions covering portions of the area at 1;250,000 scale (approximately 1/4 inch to a mile). The responsibility for mapping the Trans Pecos was regularized by the establishment of the United States Geological Survey in the 1870s. As mechanized mining has developed, the vast hordes of hard rock miners have long since moved on and the population of the California-Nevada area has depleted in favor of resorts like Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas.The Four Corners area has the huge coal burning Navajo power plant supplying Arizona and southrn Calfornia. So as long as the power holds out and air conditioning is availabl parts of the Basin will thrive. And tourist will come to view the deserts.Sixty years plus ago John ford filmed many epics in Monument Valley. Arizona and new Mexico have active film commissions so the public perception is changing once more.One modern problem is the fractured land management; the transcontinental railroads were paid with every alternate section of land north and south of their route. The US Forest Service, the National Park Service,combined with the Bureau of Land Management holdings, put most of Nevada and Utah under federal control, so there is little private land left.The entire Great Basin includes most of western Utah, most of Nevada, NW Arizona and southern Idaho and chunks of the surrounding states so that there are few maps of any useful scale showing the whole province.The various geologic maps are good examples of the \\"State Line Faults\\" so notorious among earth scientists. This occurs, when mapping geology, the surveys began in the interior and spread out to the state lines, where the stratigraphy seldom matches. Today USGS is producing uniform coverage of the whole US.Nowadays one flies transcontinentally either through Albuquerque or Denver, and the Great Basin is known as \\"redeye\\" or \\"flyover country\\"."},{"Title":"Boy Who Ate Stars","review":"Reviewing children's books originally published in foreign countries is a somewhat complicated process. You've the obvious cultural differences, of course. Then there's the translation. How much fault or praise do you heap upon the person who has the unenviable job of transferring an author's vision from one language to another? Finally, there's the book itself. After all the work that's gone into it, and after all the time and effort to bring it to the American market, was it worth it in the end? By and large I am very positive on getting more foreign-language overseas literary hits translated and into our American bookstores and libraries. In this year alone we've seen amazing titles like, Guus Kuijer's, \\"The Book of Everything\\", and Sjoerd Kuyper's, \\"The Swan's Child\\". Now we've a book from Lebanese born French citizen (and one-namer) Kochka entitled, \\"The Boy Who Ate Stars\\". It's a book with a rather interesting premise, but I'm afraid that something somewhere went awry. Whether it was the writing itself or the translation, Kochka's book shows a great deal of promise. Here's hoping perhaps some of her future books will succeed where this one failed.Twelve-year-old Lucy and her family have just moved into a new apartment. At first, Lucy decides to take on the enormous challenge of meeting and befriending everyone in her new apartment building. Then she meets the residents directly above her and immediately her plans change. One night the apartment above her own is privy to some incredibly loud noises. Lucy's father charges up the stairs to yell at the residents, then comes back down subdued. It seems that their upstairs neighbors are a single librarian mom, a Russian nanny, and a boy named Matthew. Matthew is autistic, and curious Lucy is unable to get a suitable definition of \\"autism\\" out of anyone she knows. As a result, Lucy turns Matthew into a kind of project. She will help him to connect with people outside of himself. At the same time, she's also trying to teach a lapdog named Francois, who belongs to a couple friends of her parents, to break out of his comfortable, obedient shell. Matthew's story and the story of Francois are paralleled against one another, showing the progress and breakthroughs of both boy and dog together.Now, we have two different authors at work here. The original writer, Kochka, and translator, Sarah Adams. Putting the rest of the book entirely aside, I kept finding myself wondering how closely Adams was adhering to the original text. Some of the more awkward sentences may be direct translations. For example, there are a couple phrases along the lines of, \\"Secretly, I was going to take that dog under my wing so he could learn to fly\\". Other times, though, the translation doesn't seem to quite fit, as when Lucy says that, \\"I pretended butter wouldn't melt in my mouth\\". More at fault are the moments when odd America slang pops up unexpectedly. When Lucy discovers later in the story that she'll get to keep Francois while his owners are out of town she erupts with the word, \\"Wicked!\\". Aside from the fact that even in America this word isn't exactly universal, it doesn't fit with the rest of the France-based book. Altogether, some of the writing feels like it has a herky-jerky start-and-stop feel to it. There's no way of telling if that's the work of Adams or Kochka, though. And after reading through the book carefully, I think the blame rests with Kochka.A translator can only give you what already exists. So if the narrative itself is uneven, it's not their fault. In this book, the story often jumps from scene to scene and place to place without much cohesive connection. \\"We ran into Matthew who was taking a cookie for a walk. It was raining. We were amazed, firstly because it was the kind of weather for staying indoors, and secondly because Matthew was treating the cookie like a king. Under the damp song of the sky, sheltered by an arbor, Marie told us a story. That night Theo couldn't sleep\\". Three distinct events but there isn't any comfortable transition between them. Add into the odd \\"damp song of the sky\\", which comes entirely out of the blue and the book makes for a more difficult read than it really had to be.I don't know much about autism myself, so I can't say whether or not Kochka's Matthew is a good or a poor example of the condition. For all I know, Matthew is a perfectly rendered autistic. However, that didn't keep me from becoming particularly uncomfortable when Kochka would equate Matthew with various animalia. Sometimes parallels would be drawn between a boy that Lucy sees as comfortably wild, and a dog that needs to learn how to be free. Says Lucy, \\"Of course, Matthew would make the perfect trainer to help Francois find his animal instincts again!\\". Later when he's stroking her hair she says, \\"Instead of letting me stroke him, this special cat was stroking me\\". Further on Lucy writes a definition of the boy. \\"Matthew: a chameleon with a heart made of modeling clay\\". He's everything EXCEPT a human being to Lucy, and her patronizing attitude towards him was enough to make me particularly uncomfortable.I think this book had some nice moments and perhaps some judicious editing would have made it a little more palatable. Still, whether it's the translation or the writing itself, there's something about, \\"The Boy Who Ate Stars\\", that just don't feel right. It's a fine book for what it is, but nothing too extraordinary. I wouldn't bother buying it for a kid. Autism's a tricky subject, and this book simply doesn't convey its complexity. Nice story, but not particularly noteworthy."},{"Title":"Boy Who Ate Stars","review":"I would like to disagree with the other reviews. I thought this book was thought provoking and gave beautiful insights about autism.The fact that this book was translated also did not bother me. Sure, there were a few sentences that were a little strange, but seeing as how the author comes from a different country I can forgive that. I love reading books from foreign authors because they offer a different perspective which is something all children should experience. I could not possibly expect the author to explain all of the dissimilarities between her culture and my own and vice versa. If you don't get it, do some research.Yes, autistic people do communicate, but it is not in a usual way. Lucy, the narrator of the story, knows this and is determined to show everyone that Matthew \\"talks\\" in his own unique language. When he plays with people's hair he is communicating to the outside world.Overall, I thought 'The Boy Who Ate Stars' was a wonderful read. Kochka did a great job of depicting the relationship between an empathetic girl and a boy with autism. This book is a good example how friendship can change how we experience the world. I would consider this a must-read for children and adults."},{"Title":"Boy Who Ate Stars","review":"The overall writing in this story was dreamy and light. The topic of autism is a delicate and heavy issue with no black and white, as every autistic child, like any other child, is unique.The author gave a distinctive look into the life of one autistic child- through the eyes of a child. The narrator, Lucy, is a twelve year old girl who told the story as a child would tell it. Her inquisitive personality is reminiscent of Scout Finch. I agree with another reviewer who said it jumps scenes. Yet, to keep in the world of a child, when they tell a story, the lesser details disappear. As I tell a story I get caught up in details of little importance. I felt the story flowed well and I didn't get caught between the time warps. The way in which Lucy discovered the world around her was with dreamy revelations of each mystery. The connection between Matthew and his nanny was explained that \\"Either Maougo (the nanny) was a fairy in disguise, hiding under her blond hair, or her past life had made her so wise that now she understood everything.\\"The review that complained about the definitions of Autism that were given are exactly the purpose of the book. These are the definitions that Lucy is given, and she sets out to prove them wrong. Lucy rewrites the dictionary definition in the book and passes on to the reader a wonder and respect of those with Autism. Her enthusiasm and curiosity is contagious, maybe we still don't completely understand, but I feel it intrigues us to look for more.The reviewer also complained about the books remarks about autism affecting communication. This was another goal of Lucy's. Although Matthew was non-verbal she remarked about all the different ways Matthew did communicate, ending one chapter with: \\"I'll eat my hat if that's not communication.\\"This book is not a good guide to teach children exactly \\"What is Autism?\\" However, it helps to move a person a little closer into an unknown world and to be more open and receptive to the complexities behind autism. This book was chosen as an alternate book in my book club this month, when I found the book I wondered why they chosen a children's book, but as soon as I started, until I read the last words, I completely understood that not all children's books are only for children."},{"Title":"Boy Who Ate Stars","review":"This book reminds me of Stephen Stills' classic, \\"Dark Star.\\" In fact, it is more like a black hole, that is a hypothetical void allowing no light to penetrate as a result of a collapsing star.Lucy, 12 is determined to get to know every one of her neighbors on her block. She decides to work her way up from the ground floor, literally. When Lucy meets single mother Marie, her son Matthew, 4 and Matthew's helper, Maougo, she is determined to get to know Matthew better. Matthew has autism.Marie explains autism as best she can; Matthew likes to spin himself as well as discrete objects; he had difficulty in pronoun usage; his verbalizations are sporadic and he quotes what he hears from television. He is bound to routine and insists on listening to his favorite tape each night. Maougo appears to have rapport with Matthew and lets him play with her hair, which seems to be one of his favorite activities. Upon meeting Lucy, Matthew plays with her hair.I didn't like the way Bettelheim was quoted, calling autistics \\"empty fortresses\\" who are \\"trapped within their own walls\\" and don't communicate which simply isn't true. Bettelheim was not a real psychoanalyst, as the author claims he was in this book. The definition Lucy's seemingly impersonal parents give her for autism is also unsatisfactory as is the dictionary definition she finds, which said autism is a \\"pathological withdrawal into an interior world resulting in a loss of contact with reality and an inability to communicate with others.\\" That is not true.Autism is a neurobiological condition that is NOT caused by one's parents, as Bettelheim claimed and is NOT an inability to communicate. Marie was a good mother to her son. It is true that autism affects communication, but it is a condition that primarily affects sensory processing and integration. That in turn affects communication.I would have thought that by this day and age such misperceptions about autism would have long been disabused and permanently put to rest."},{"Title":"Boy Who Ate Stars","review":"This book was so much fun to read! I bought it for my daughter, but I had to read it first. I loved this book. This is one of my favorite books about autism!"},{"Title":"Boy Who Ate Stars","review":"The narrator looks back to when she was 12 years old. She's new to the neighborhood and determined to meet everyone in her apartment building. The premise makes sense. Her level of inquisitiveness is wonderful. She knows nothing about autism. With the help of the adults in her life, she attempts to make sense of the autistic 4 year old in the upstairs apartment. While this narrator seems old for her age, I felt this was because she was looking back. I found her forays into the dictionary to be what middle schoolers might do. Thought provoking book. I found the book to contain wonderful passages. I do not have any first-hand experience with 4 year old autistic children so my opinion may be way off. I have recommended this book to teachers of students with ASD."},{"Title":"Great Whirl of Exile","review":"For those who know his history, it is no surprise that Leroy V. Quintana is a great story-teller in his poetry. He was raised in Albuquerque by Mexican grandparents, who told him numerous folk-tales (Cuentos) as a child. &quot;In many ways, I'm still basically a small-town New Mexico boy carrying on the oral tradition,&quot; he comments. His work is endowed not only with a raucous frontier humor, but also a remarkable emotional range, from comic depiction's of adolescent love to moving poems of death and loss, to reflections on his war experience in Vietnam.&quot;Quintana captures &quot;a period of Chicano history few poets write about.&quot; --The Nation&quot;The voice of the poet is unmistakable in each [poem], a voice that plays with words and delights readers. These are poems that invite us to read them aloud, to savor their language and originality, and to reflect on the stories they tell.&quot; --MultiCultural Review&quot;Quintana's...passion for rendering the lives of New Mexicans has produced a nationally acclaimed body of work...a love for his community explodes into lean and lucid poems with a universal appeal.&quot; --Albuquerque Journal"},{"Title":"Great Whirl of Exile","review":"Sometimes we look at short poems and think they are simple, in that not much will be said. Leroy V. Quintana,a Chicano poet, writing at the top of his art, says more in a few lines than some modern poets say in entire books. A teacher in a university, his work shows very few signs of academic taint. The situations and images he presents are fresh and sometimes startling, and always thought-provoking. This is a man who has not lost contact with his roots, going back and forth between his childhood in New Mexico, to his serving as a combat veteran in Vietnam (read also his excellent book about Vietnam: &quot;Interrogations&quot;) and currently a professor in San Diego. Always he writes about the ambivalence of cultures, writes with great wit, compassion, and with healing power. Yes, he writes about his ethnicity and writes wonderfully about it, but his range and focus is far greater. Highly recommended and if you buy this book, order his others, all in print, written full of deep wisdom."},{"Title":"Great Whirl of Exile","review":"Leroy Quintana is the fullest embodiment of what can heal, like an exilir of brown-skinned proportions, that which ails the chicano spirit. In this book, he fashions a myriad of, otherwise cultural secrets, into a tapestry of viceral truths open for all to absorb. Joining Quintana in his &quot;Whilr of Exile&quot; was resoundingly GREAT! &quot;Omen&quot;, Quintana's personal poem of paternal retrospective for a daughter, encompasses that knot of anticipation, the &quot;butterflies&quot; of excitement that so many non-verbose men uneloquently call &quot;anticipation&quot;, and from behind the eye of a needle shows his emotion and love.

I got this for her, and it does contains lots of basic and informative information about human anatomy and the systems that run the body. My only complaint, and it is a pretty big one, is that the illustrations actually creep me out. My daughter does not voice this opinion, but she was reserved in her reaction to the book. The illustrations are supposed to look like a child has drawn them with crayon, but they are presented as drawings of the very same girl who narrates the book, but she is missing her face, or her face is part skull, etc. It just struck me as a bit jarring, and I'll be interested to look at other books for the same age group on this topic. Also, the reproductive system is conveniently skipped, which would be of enormous interest to the kids, but force the folks to have a longer bed time story!"},{"Title":"Me and My Amazing Body","review":"This is the absolute best book of anatomy for children.

He said he gives it to all people who express an interest is converting to Judaism.I am glad the Rabbi sent me this book because it is very succinct and straightforward. The things I found most helpful about this book are the discussion of the different Jewish holidays and the description of the different movements within Judaism. I found it very interesting to read that there is a difference between \\"movements\\" and \\"denominations.\\" In other words, \\"Reform\\" Judaism is not to \\"Orthadox\\" Judaism as \\"Catholic\\" is to \\"Baptist.\\" It was interesting for me to learn that while the different movements practice differently, they still accept one another as being Jewish (though they may not always agree on things). It was an interesting eye opener.I also found it interesting to read that many Jewish people do not literally believe the stories in Torah, the Biblical stories. Perhaps the most eye-opening thing in this book is the fact that Judaism rejects the concept of \\"Original Sin.\\" Prior to reading this book, I had assumed that Judaism taught Original Sin just as Catholicism does (because, after all, you hear so much about the \\"Judeo-Christian Tradition\\"). This book will always be important to me for teaching me that Judaism rejects this concept. I sometimes wonder how different my worldview would have been, and my life thus far, had I not been taught the concept of Original Sin at such a young age. I'm happy to say I am un-learning that concept. I don't believe human beings are inherently sinful, and I'm glad this book showed me that there are others who feel the same way."},{"Title":"Embracing Judaism","review":"For years, I thought that the earlier edition of Embracing Judaism by Rabbi Simcha Kling was the best introduction to Judaism available.

When people come to me and say, &quot;What can I read to learn about what it means to be Jewish?&quot; I can tell them without any hesitation, &quot;Read Embracing Judaism by Simcha Kling and Carl Perkins.&quot;Embracing Judaism is simple without being simplistic. In terms that most readers can readily understand, the authors present the basic beliefs, practices and approaches to Judaism today. This work was written originally, and still intended largely, as a &quot;primer&quot; for those considering conversion to Judaism. And this is often how I have used it in the past. When I meet a person about possible conversion, I give him/her a copy of this book, with the words, &quot;Try reading this. If you decide to convert, it's my gift form me to you.&quot; The addition of Rachel Cowan's personal story to Embracing Judaism had added a new and necessary dimension to the work. However, the book also great for any reader who wants a sensitive and sensible introduction to Jewish living.Carl Perkins is to be commended for taking an excellent book and making it even better.

We're always on the prowl for books that are informative, thoughtful, accurate and passionate.

Of all the books that I have read in preparing to convert, this has been the most useful."},{"Title":"Embracing Judaism","review":"Simcha Kling writes enthusiastically, as a New England Unitarian who converted to Judaism. Embracing Judaism eloquently explains the variety of faith perspectives and other community roots that define Judaism. Kling's story will still require some careful thought for those who begin with the assumption that all religion is dogmatic (defined by a set of clearly articulated beliefs.)As Kling explains it, Jews know that they belong to a religious community, and that they can find God in their own personal beliefs. Kling describes the main traditions of Judaism - Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox - and explains how each group comprises people of the same religion pursuing slightly different paths to find God's message.Embracing Judaism comes highly recommended for open-minded outsiders who want to understand the Jewish religious tradition. Readers don't need to want to convert. Kling does an admirable job helping us to understand more about the beliefs of our neighbors. This book in no way offends other religious traditions, but strong followers of exclusionary traditions may find this book simply too different to hold their interest."},{"Title":"Embracing Judaism","review":"I just found out that my grandmother was Jewish.

There is a wealth of information in this well researched and well written book. If you can find a copy it is a great book to add to your collection or child's library. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Screen Dreams: Fantasising Lesbians in Film","review":"After reading Patricia White's &quot;Uninvited&quot; (which focuses on the effect of Production-era cinema on the formation of contemporary lesbian identities), Clare Whatling's &quot;Screen Dreams&quot; seemed a natural evolution in my reading. Ms. Whatling's ostensible topic is how conteomporary lesbians appropriate modern cinema as subjects of fantasy and desire. Rather than being acted upon, as White's work posits, Ms. Whatling contends that the lesbian viewer acts as much as she is acted upon. This intriguing and potentially powerful argument (which owes much to queer theory), however, is lost amid Ms. Whatling's overeagerness to show that she has the intellectual and academic credentials to make her case. &quot;Screen Dreams&quot; reads like an anxious Ph.d candidate's thesis, full of disavowels (such as her repeated assertion that she is only speaking for herself) and rudimentary summarizations of *other* people's work. In fact, I (not an academic by any means) had actually read most of Ms. Whatling's sources, so much of this already-slender volume offered nothing new. Ms. Whatling makes a powerful supposition (one with which I am inclined to agree), I simply regret that her writing was unable to live up to her subject's promise."},{"Title":"Cipher: VOL 01 (Cipher (Graphic Novels))","review":"This was a very good manga with a few twists. It started off with the ever happy main character who just happened to find out something that was hidden from most of the world for two years.Anyway in this book there is a pair of twins named Siva and Cipher. A girl at their school discovers that something is strange when \\"Siva\\" saves her from a potential fight, after which she goes back to his apartment. When she finds out that the brothers take turns going to work and school under the name 'Siva' she asks the reason only to find that the brothers won't tell her. Next they make a bet with her in which if she can tell them apart after a two week peroid in which she lives with them, the brothers agree they will tell the reason why they switch off. The brothers are not all that they appear to be and this manga really teaches something about trusting.At first I was not sure that I would like this manga, but came to find out that it was a good manga.The reason that i did not like think that I would like it is that the art of the cover for this volume was not all that great in my opion.The reason that I did like it after all was that the manga had a nice story and decent art ojn the inside.Also, the manga did not have a feeling of trying to fit too much on one page. The manga was nicely spaced and drawn.One thing about the brothers that really got me was that several times they say to each other that they are not really as nice as the girl seems to think. Anyway I would say that this is a good book to buy."},{"Title":"In Defense of the Faith, Vol. II, A Survey of Christian Epistemology","review":"I heard of a man who woke up one night at the sound of his car being taken. He ran down stairs, and it was not being stolen; it was being towed. He stopped the tow truck driver and wanted to know why he was taking his car. The tow truck driver told him that they were filming a movie on the street, and they needed the space. The owner of the car wanted to know how he would have found his car after it had been towed and parked in an unknown location. The tow truck driver told him that he would put a note on the car. That of course would not have done the befuddled owner any good. For the car would have been lost, and a note on a lost car is also lost. And that is the problem with the unsaved person. He is lost, and he cannot use his own autonomous reason or experience to find his way to truth. He is lost, and his autonomous reason is lost with him. The only way he can find the truth is through an objective unchanging source. That is God. God is there, and He is absolute.And Dr. Cornelius Van Til (1895-1987; professor Westminster Theological Seminary; OPC minister) in \\"In Defense Of the Faith Volume II: A Survey of Christian Epistemology\\" provides a potent epistemological resource for Christians.This work was used for \\"studies and student syllabi\\" and later published as a book by P & R. Van Til's work was groundbreaking and provided the ground work for an influential school of apologetics known: Presuppositional Apologetics, Covenantal Apologetics, and Van Tilian Apologetics which use the Transcendental Argument of the Existence of God as a crucial apologetic argument.In Survey of Christian Epistemology one finds chapters on:- Epistemological Terminology- Greek Epistemology- Mediaeval Epistemology- Lutheranism- Antitheism- The Subject-Subject Relation- The Method of Christian Epistemology- And other pertinent essaysVan Til writes: \\"It is the plan of God that gives any fact meaning in terms of the plan of God. The whole meaning of any fact is exhausted by its position in and relation to the plan of God. This implies that every fact is related to every other fact. God's plan is a unit (p 6). Thus facts are not brute facts but require and presuppose God for their comprehension. Van Til adds: \\"We seek to implicate ourselves more deeply into a comprehension of God's plan in and with every fact that we investigate\\" (p 7). A particular fact needs the Christian Worldview for its proper understanding because a particular cannot be the lens to understand a universal: \\"Thus starting any investigation the general precedes the particular\\" (Cornelius Van Til: In Defense of the Faith Volume II: A Survey of Christian Epistemology, p 7).When unbelievers use reason, they presuppose and rely on God, even as they are attempting to disprove God. The denial of God presupposes that God lives. Without presupposing the God of the Bible, one cannot rationally assert anything. As Van Til demonstrated, the atheist is like the little child on her fathers lap that slaps her dad in the face, but in order for her to slap her father, she must sit on his lap. And the atheist, as he attempts to refute the existence of God, must rest on the presupposition that God lives. God must be his presupposition forasmuch as he uses logic and reason to attempt to slap the Lord. Yet as an atheist, he cannot account for reason. When he attacks God using logical thought and right reason, he borrows from the Christian worldview, which alone can account for reason. So anti-theism presupposes theism. Attacking the existence of God, with rational thought, actually depends on that which they are attempting to disprove. The atheist tries to prove that only the physical world is there, all the while using nonphysical reason. All intellectual warring against the Lord presupposes His existence. We do not have to prove that God exists, everything in the universe shouts His existence. We should allow the anti-theist to keep talking, and demonstrate that for his ranting to be rational, he must presuppose that God lives.Van Til notes: \\"Thus the antithesis is once more that between those for whom the final center of reference in knowledge lies in man, and those for whom the final center of reference for knowledge lies in God, as this God speaks in Scripture\\" (p 9).Furthermore he writes: \\"Our conception of God controls the investigation of every fact. We are certain, as certain as our conviction of the truth of the entire Christian position, that certain \`facts' will never be discovered,\\" including the discovery of \\"a gradual transition from the non-rational to the rational\\" ( p 7).Remember that the atheist borrows from the Christian worldview when he uses and applies reason. Atheists testify that they adore reason and logic. That is the rationale behind Robert Ingersoll assertion: \\"Upon every brain reason should be enthroned as king.\\" Skeptics do not want to bow to God, so they will bow down to an idol, such as human reason. This creates a big problem for them: Deny God and you cannot account for reason. A great example of this is what happened in the debate between evangelist Ray Comfort and atheist Ron Barrier. Mr. Barrier accidentally picked up Comfort's glasses while making his case for atheism. Comfort in his response said to the crowd, \\"If you are an atheist, you are wearing someone else's glasses.\\" That is what all atheists and unbelievers do: They borrow from the Christian worldview whenever they use reason or morality. These are nonphysical dynamics that the atheist cannot justify; only the Christian WV can. Atheists, when they use and apply logic or moral law, are borrowing our glasses. The job of the Christian is to take the glasses off their head and let them know, without Christianity, they cannot see anything at all.C.S. Lewis' notion that I believe in God as I believe in the Sun; not so much that I see the Sun, it's more like without the Sun, I cannot see anything at all. The only lens that can make sense of the world and give us vision is God's revealed word.Dr. Van Til on the importance of presuppositions and epistemic methods: \\"And this difference between the Christian and his opponents comes to the fore in the method of investigation of facts. The anti-Christian holds that any sort of fact will appear that could disprove the ultimacy of the fact of God, and therefore of what he has revealed himself and his plan for the world through Christ in the Scriptures\\" (p 8). \\"God's knowledge of the facts of the universe must be the standard of our knowledge\\" (p 200). \\"We must seek to determine what presuppositions are necessary to any object of knowledge in order that it may be intelligible to us\\" (p 201).Van Til on Scripture as an epistemic absolute: \\"We should accept the Scripture testimony about itself. If we did anything else we would not be accepting Scripture as absolute. The only alternative then to bringing in a God who testifies of himself and upon whose testimony we are wholly dependent, is not to bringing in God at all. And not to bring in God at all spells nothing but utter ruin for knowledge\\" (p 202).Finally he sums up: \\"The final question is in which framework or on which view of reality--the Christian or the non-Christian--the law of contradiction can have application to any fact. The non-Christian rejects the Christian view out of hand.... Then when asked to furnish a foundation for the law of contradiction, he can offer nothing but the idea of contingency\\" (pp. 204-205). \\"We must hold that the position of our opponent has in reality been reduced to self-contradiction when it is shown to be hopelessly opposed to the Christian theistic concept of God. ... The conception of God is necessary for the intelligible interpretation of any fact ... that it is necessary for all facts and for the laws of thought\\" (Cornelius Van Til: In Defense of the Faith Volume II: A Survey of Christian Epistemology, pp. 206).For a new and interesting Presuppositional Apologetic book that refutes anti-theism see:Truth, Knowledge and the Reason for God: The Defense of the Rational Assurance of ChristianityAnd a book that utilizes the transcendental argument as it contends against World Religions see:\\"One Way to God: Christian Philosophy and Presuppositional Apologetics Examine World Religions\\" type in ASIN#: 1432722956"},{"Title":"The Face of the Deep","review":"In creative writing classes you are told again and again to find \\"your voice\\". And when you find that voice it's apparently supposed to be different than every other voice. When I was an aspiring writer, this advice always seemed nebulous at best. But it began to clarify when I read Farber's On Water and Face of the Deep. Nobody can duplicate Farber's style, especially his nature writing. It is crisp and clear, witty, rigorously researched, and at the same time as fluid and carefree as the water he is so obsessed with.I think Tom found his originality by being a purist as writers go. He refuses to follow any formula for what a \\"good story\\" is. Instead, he enters the short stories in these books where he wants to, where his mind is at the time (the reader senses): a quote, a word, sometimes a definition - \\"Pelagic\\", one story begins. This is not laziness. Face of the Deep and On Water are as well researched as most \\"expert\\" books on the sea and it is a shame that they have not reached the popularity they deserve. Edited down to the starkest possible prose, stark as a vast stretch of grey coastline, Farber is simply the master of water writing. He was part of my inspiration to writeSaltwater Buddha: A Surfer's Quest to Find Zen on the Sea. And I am eternally grateful. These two books or must-reads for all ocean lovers, and really - given that we are all made of mostly water - for all people."},{"Title":"Production and Operations Analysis with Student CD-Rom","review":"This book is a nice book for introduction to manufacturing system for undergraduate level for industrial engineer. The book covers Forecasting, Aggregate Planning, Inventory control (certain and stochastic demand), Push vs. Pll Production Control Systems, Scheduling, Facility Layout, Facility Location, Quality control and Reliability. In Forecasting chapter, the book provides a lot of good basic forecasting methods such as moving average, exponential smooting, trend-based method, and seasonal series. In Aggregate Planning chapter, the book covers just the basic concepts and models which can be done better. For inventory control chapters, the book does a nice job and cover a lot of detailed basic models which is a good introduction. In the Production Control Systems chapter, this book also has done a nice job in covering detailed basic ideas of the MRP subject such as lot sizing methods in MRP but JIT section could be done better by adding some more detaile on key factors of JIT's success and the use of time buffer instead of inventory buffer. In Scheduling chapters, the book covers a very basic models for scheduling which is again good for introduction. The rest sections of the book are nicely written with the level of introduction. Overall, this book is good and nice to have. One comment on the cover page is that the formulation for EOQ is very wrong and should not happen for the book on manufacturing system."},{"Title":"Production and Operations Analysis with Student CD-Rom","review":"I am doing Ph.D. in applied mathematics and OR.

In his book, Dr. Carrier, a psychologist goes on medical roundswith physicians, is a consultant on the tumor board, is paged by the hospital for emergencies, is in a romance with a physician, and is seemingly requested by every surgeon for preop consults. Poppycock!! These roles describe physicians. A psychologist is not a medical provider. Most psychology degrees are liberal arts degrees not science. I believe Mr. Kellerman has delusions of grandeur regarding the field of psychology. His patientz deserve medical care-not someone to hold their hand and tell them they'll get better.There are many glaring medical errors in this book. The physician Angela recalls how she almost killed someone. She says that she almost injected a dose of insulin that was off by 100 units. It is common knowledge an insulin syringe holds up to 100 units. How could the dose be off by 100? What? She was supposed to give 30 units? And, almost gave 300 in a syringe that only holds up to 100 units. This explains why psychologists shouldn't write medical thrillers-they have have little to no medical knowledge. And,btw physicians rarely draw up or administer shots of insulin most patients are trained to do it themselves. There are other numerous errors. He should get somebody with a medical background to proof-read.He is just so annoying and irritating. I read and finish everything so I groaned when I realized I had picked up another one of his stupid books about the importance of psychologists in medicsl care. I hope if a medical crisis ever happens he has enough sense to csll a physician!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Delivery was timely as promised. The item was the exact quality promised.

It kept my interest, but was lacking on the suspense. Sure, the reader wants to figure out who the killer is, and the clues come slowly, but never once was the hero in any danger himself. A kindly old doctor slowly send him the clues to figure out, but that is about it. Not my favorite, but if you are a fan of Kellerman, give it a try."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Here's my review system--I score on four categories and average them together for the number of stars.

However, it was only 5 CDs long, and that is a rather quick read. Something about the narrator or maybe the lack of a gripping plot, made it feel much much longer. In the end it became oddly confusing and I kept trying to remember who all these characters are and what their relations were to one another. Only because it was so long and so full of holes and twists, it became almost boring and hard to pay attention to. However, I can see that Kellerman may be a good writer of other books, so I will give him a chance and pick up another audio boook. It was a good enough book that I kept listening to it. However, I kept listening hoping that something would happen and that all of this time would have a pay off. I was wrong."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am a fan of Jonathan Kellerman's other books (3-5 stars, the lot), but this book would get 0 if it was an option. The underlying plot makes no sense - a club of do-gooders who somehow identifies a serial killer (it is never explained how), but instead of doing the obvious they guide our hero to solve it - whilst the killer is carrying on killing other victims! Almost needless to say, when our hero eventually does identify the killer, he decides to take matters into his own hands (a poorly motivated distrust of the police is to blame) and gets saved in a typical Kellerman last minute shoot-out (my only serious issue with the Alex Delaware series...) Turns out his mistrust of the cops was misplaced - they end up saving his life.Altogether a poor read - slow paced and a plot that is utterly devoid of logic."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I was really enjoying my first read of a Kellerman novel about someone OTHER than Alex Delaware and his constant companion Detective Milo when, just as I got to the climax, I got a real shock: \\"Hey, I've READ this book before!\\" Sure enough, I distinctly remembered one small part of that scene and knew what would happen right after that. And nothing else. Not a single thing. And I'm still scratching my head about when I read it the first time. Still, it was quite a good read the second time, and that's a pretty good recommendation by itself . . . isn't it?At any rate, this book was good enough to make me want to read more of Kellerman's non-Alex Delaware novels, such as \\"Butcher's Theater\\" and \\"Twisted\\" . . . if only to discover that I've read those books before, too."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This book is definitely a diversion from Kellerman's usual psych-thrillers. It has a slower pace, but is deeper and more intricate than many of his other novels.The character development is most excellent. I was interested from the start and remained riveted until the end. The plot keeps you guessing and trying to figure out 'who dunnit', and just when you think you have it, Kellerman takes you down a different road.I was thrilled with this book. It was unexpectedly good and very entertaining. For Christmas I gave it to two people who were also taken by it."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This was perhaps the absolute worse Jonathan Kellerman going!I have read at least two-thirds of his novels most of which are quite pleasing and entertaining, some more wierd than others...Not good at all! Really!At any rate, I agree completely ( as does my wife), who feels as did a recent reviewer; it would be incredibly fantastic to find that this novel was not something from his distant past, that was now thrown in for a quick hit....It was formal, unlike any other of his novels, truly BORING X 10, and we barely got through it on a relaxing summer vacation.Both of us felt it was just terrible at best! Rent it on audio book at the library, that way you can stand the horribly slow plot culminating in a relatively exciting (much needed) ending...."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Ok, I have only finished 2 J Kellerman books, this and \\"Twisted\\".

There are just too many unnecessary references to either the rarer or more serious and feared disorders unrelated to the story and thus causing a lot of side tracking which to me is a pure waste of time reading and boring to readers especially those with medical knowledge. It took me a long long time to finish this novel and thought of discarding it numerous times even when I was more than half way through the novel! This is especially so after having read the very exciting Robert Crais's \\"Demolition Angel\\" followed by Lee Child's \\"One Shot\\".The story in this book are also full of loop holes and I cannot buy the idea of a Conspiracy Club using Jeremy to get to the killer and allowing more murders to take place while he was stressfully doing so.However, I must admit that I did enjoy reading a couple of Kellerman's other novels \\"Murder Book\\" & \\"When the Bough Breaks\\" quite some time ago."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I just listened through an unabridged recording of the book.The blurbs should have warned me, \\"...re-invigorates a number of tried-and-true mystery conventions...\\" \\"...Bob Kahn's reading adds suspense to Kellerman's less than original plot...\\" \\"...adds complexity to flat characters...\\"Tried-and-true-and-friggin-predictable-and-boring plot and real flat characters indeed!I know mystery storytelling dates back hundreds, if not thousands, of years and basically every writer retells one of a few storylines in his own way. I have generally liked Kellerman's previous books from the Delaware series. But this one just went on and on without any building up of that tingling under your skin that you expect from a good serial killer thriller. When Kellerman finally decides to cut to the chase (on CD #8 out of 8), the end is a total anticlimax. I don't mind anti-climactic endings - I just saw and liked \\"The Constant Gardner\\" - but the previous seven CDs seemed to building up to an all-out nuclear warfare, and I didn't know when it was time to wake up and hear the fat lady sing.The book does no credit to Kellerman's excellent reputation. Where he tries to add emotional depth to an otherwise tepid story, the dialogue and the little soul-stirring twists fall flat. I mean, come on! Stick to your knitting (or whittling or wordsmithy, whatever), man."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I didn't enjoy this book much - we spend too much time \\"in the narrator's head\\", with long drawn-out, repetitive thought processes.

Kellerman can do much better.."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I usually enjoy the Kellerman books but this is not his best work. Major medical mistakes- Percocet is not an injectable drug, for example! should have been screened. The characters are uninvolving, and the ending a big letdown after all the work to develop characters."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The Conspiracy Club started slowly, but kept my interest and turned into a page-turner through an exciting and surprising ending. Kellerman takes a break from familiar characters and the L.A. scene to introduce a new protaganist, who is a psychologist on the staff of a hospital in an unidentified city. There is a lot of potential for a new series here. Many times I felt as if I was reading a tale of a young Alex Delaware. However, I found the lack of real city with familiar streets and landmarks very disorienting. Secondly, Conspiracy Club, reminds me of a new house that has not developed any character. Kellerman's writing style seemed distant and shallow (like a lesser writer) particularly in the first half of the book. Basically, the protaganist has to analyze a series of clues, provided by a shadowy character who leaves the scene early in the book, in order to solve the puzzle of the identity of a serial killer. This is very interesting, but the number of hoops he has to go through seems very far-fetched and silly at times. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book and recommend it to others. At the end of the day, Kellerman has written a solid mystery that would have been a great first effort by a new writer."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I'm a long-time Kellerman fan, but I didn't care as much for this novel. It is extremely slow-paced, which is not necessarily a bad thing if there is some feeling of direction or plot movement, but it seemed missing here to me. The story seemed meandering and obscure, and I didn't find the characters to be compelling."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Many reviews here stated that this novel by Jonathan Kellerman not as good as his other novels with Alex Delaware as a main character. I disagree. It's just different. Despite similar medical background, which could be expected, a lot in this novel, including a pace, is different. Maybe many readers started this novel having certain expectations based on previous Alex Delaware works and got disappointed but this difference doesn't make it worse. Granted, there are a few weaknesses (for example, antics of members of 'conspiracy club' sometimes seems silly or the ending may feel not very convincing) but I totally disagree with reviews that say that this book doesn't have a suspense. Although maybe the book has less action we used to find in the author' other books this one kept me very intrigued. Overall, recommended to all Jonathan Kellerman' fans."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In a departure from his Alex Delaware series, Jonathan Kellerman introduces us to Dr. Jeremy Carrier. Dr. Carrier is emotionally traumatized by the death of his girlfriend. She is brutally murdered and Jeremy becomes a prime suspect in her death. He is the staff psychologist at City Central Hospital. There he gets drawn into a unexpected and rather bizarre friendship with pathologist Dr. Arthur Chess. More murders ensue with the police focusing on Jeremy. Dr. Chess slips away supposedly to go on vacation. He leaves Jeremy what amounts to pieces of a puzzle that will help solve the spate of recent killings and to help clear Jeremy of suspicion.I always look forward to Jonathan Kellerman novels. The Alex Delaware series is one of my favorites. I had really high expectations for this book. The first half of the book really dragged. I never connected to any of the characters. The plot was undeveloped. Luckily the second half of the book got more interesting and a bit more suspenseful. Once Jeremy started solving the puzzle Dr. Chess was sending him, the plot really improved and Kellerman's skills were once again evident. The last quarter of the book was a page-turner, unfortunately I expected so much more.First of book: 1 starThird or book: 3 starsFourth of book: 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I almost never make a big deal about the number of Stars I rate a book, or any other product. The content of my reviews is what counts - that's what's most important. In the case of Jonathan Kellerman's \\"The Conspiracy Club,\\" I make an exception. I think this chilling mystery is an excellent read, and would normally rate it 4 or 4.5 stars. (It is Olympic Game season and I feel like a figure skating judge!!). However, the novel is so original and intelligently written, refreshingly so, that it deserves 5 Stars all the way!!To begin with, there is little, if any violence, blood or gore in the narrative. Almost everything traumatic is implied, not explicit - for a change. This subtle approach to brutality makes the violence seem more spooky, more mysterious than usual. The reader's imagination is almost always more fertile than the written word - unless the author is Edgar Allan Poe. And Kellerman builds suspense, little by little, to a crescendo finale. Character study is very important to this psychological thriller. And again, the author excels in character development, especially that of his protagonist, Dr. Jeremy Carrier, a young psychologist at City Central Hospital.Carrier is a moral man, seemingly, dedicated to his profession and patients. He also appears to be a really nice guy. Six months earlier, his live-in girlfriend, Jocelyn Banks, a nurse at the same hospital, was horribly murdered, her mutilated body dumped under a bridge in a run-down area of town. Jeremy had been very much in love with her and broods over his loss and the cruelly sadistic manner of her death. The investigating detectives have targeted him as a murder suspect, even though there is no evidence of his involvement, whatsoever. This exacerbates his suffering. When more women begin turning up dead, obviously the work of the same psychopathic killer, the police come looking for Dr. Carrier - questioning him - turning up the pressure.Coinciding with this traumatic period, Dr Arthur Chess, an elderly but still vigorous pathologist, seeks Jeremy out, apparently wanting to be his friend. Chess is retired, but he is so prominent in his field, and has contributed so much to City Central that he is allowed to maintain his office there. Arthur Chess is a wonderful character - bizarre, wise, extremely mysterious, at times humorous and fascinated with \\"psychology's views on violence. Specifically, the genesis of very bad behavior\\" - not evil. \\"Evil is a.... weighty word. Theologically burdened. I believe we'd settled upon 'very bad behavior.'\\" He makes statements throughout like, \\"A stranger to fear is a stranger to conscience.\\" But he never follows through. He never tells Jeremy what he is alluding to.One evening Chess invites Carrier to a special dinner in a private, extremely elegant, out-of-the-way venue. There he is introduced to a group of friends - six in all, including Arthur - who have something in common besides their professional backgrounds and elevated status in society, but neither Jeremy nor the reader are let in on their secret. These are the members of the \\"Conspiracy Club\\" of the novel's title. They meet occasionally to discuss diverse topics with great intelligence, and eat extraordinary gourmet fare. The wine is pretty terrific also.Dr. Chess suddenly disappears, apparently to travel the world, sending Jeremy postcards from various countries - all with the same message, \\"Traveling and learning.\\" His departure coincides with the delivery of anonymous interoffice envelopes from the Otolaryngology Department containing what look to be random articles having nothing to do with psychology or Dr. Carrier. When Jeremy investigates, he discovers that no one knows anything about the envelopes or who sent them. Thus he decides to open his own investigation, amateur though it may be. He must connect the dots between Jocelyn's death, Dr. Chess' clues, the club, the envelopes, and other strange happenings. Meanwhile, danger surrounds him.To make matters more complicated, he has started seeing Angela Rios, a resident at the hospital. Although he thinks of Jocelyn frequently, he is trying to assuage his loneliness and get his life back on track. Will his burgeoning relationship with Angela endanger her also?The cat and mouse game which follows is truly compelling. I really found it difficult to put this one down. However, it is quite low-key, although very well paced. Is there such a thing as an effective low-key thriller? If not, than Jonathan Kellerman has invented one! ENJOY!JANA"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I adore Jonathan Kellerman and never thought I'd dislike anything he wrote but this book was so disappointing. I always want Alex Delaware but I recognize that authors get different voices in their heads and, on that basis, I did struggle through the Billy Straight book, knowing that Alex would not be far behind. I found this story to be totally unrealistic and I know Kellerman can do better. What truly concerns me, though, is that he revealed only bits and pieces of Jeremy's history, which makes me think that this character will be back. NOOOOO!The story sets up well but, in my opinion, goes downhill from there. Jeremy is a suspect in a variety of killings, all the while continuing his practice and no one at the hospital seems aware of the suspicion. He becomes erratic in his behavior and obsessed with his private investigation and no one is the wiser. Meanwhile, he seems to possess superhuman powers with patients.I must say that this book reminded me very much of Chasing the Dime by Michael Connelly. No, there are no similarities in the stories but both, in my opinion, are beneath the authors' amazing abilities."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"When I saw Kellerman had a new book coming out, I signed up for it at the library without knowing what it was about, just assuming it was another Alex Deleware book.

I was well over 100 pages in, and still was not &quot;into&quot; the story. The main character, Jeremy, did not draw me in like Alex did in the other books. I didn't feel a connection with Jeremy, and didn't find myself rooting for him, like I do for Alex and Milo. The story is very slow moving, no driving suspense like the Deleware books. I finished the book because I was &quot;curious&quot; about how it would end, not because I had a driving need like I do with really good mysteries. I hope Kellerman sticks with the Deleware series, it's a much better read in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The main characters were all people, if I met them in actual life, I would do my best to avoid if I had a choice--either boring or worse. When Jeremy first observed the elegant dining club located in the strangely abandoned warehouse district, I thought I was in some King/horror clone. The story just never got moving, either in plot or character development.Maybe Jonathan needs some advise from his wife Faye."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Look, if you want to read a good mystery, stick to Kellerman's early work. &quot;Butcher's Theater&quot; is dynamite. This one is pretty darned close to a remake (at least in terms of the villian's MO), but nowhere as imaginative or intriguing. It's time for Kellerman to retire his word processor."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"A wonderful book, full of insight, well-drawn characters, and the human element. But be warned: it can also be as disturbing, dangerous, and graphic. That said, I loved it and couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this one.Also recommended: The Da Vinci Code and Bark of the Dogwood by Jackson McCrae"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am a huge Jonathan Kellerman fan - have read everything but this new book is just incredibly boring. The language is very self indulgent and where plot shoud be, there are just endless descriptions of people or events that don't really relate to the story. The only thing worse is the reader of the audio - flat, dull, the story may be putting him to sleep and his &quot;female&quot; character voice is just terrible. I was also offended by the need to use stereo type descriptions of Asian characters in the book. Very unusual and I'm so disappointed."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This was a fun ride and took a while to figure the real culprit, which you didn't know to the end unless you're really into murder mysteries!

Prune faced nurse, blah, blah, blah. They say, \\"You're important to me.\\" They're saying they need to get together for lunch, and one of them says, \\"Let's do that ... **Doooode.**\\" Totally, out of character for two dead-serious soap-opera, intellectual type doctors. Hilarious! But odd no one's mentioned it. He does it again on Disk 5, track 10. They're having lunch in his office, and they chide each other for not eating enough. \\"I'm fine. So am I, **Doooode**!\\" Anyway, great book, at least on audio. I picked up a couple themes that seem to come up more than once with Kellerman, but don't want to spoil the book. ~ Linda"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is not your typical Jonathan Kellerman novel, no Alex Delaware, the police harrass instead of help the protaganist, and as I stated earlier, it is not a fast moving, action packed tale which is Kellermans usual style. Nonetheless, I liked it.The story centers around Dr. Jeremy Carrier, and the unsolved murder of his girl friend Jocelyn Banks. Jeremy is still grieving her death when he is approached by a mysterious pathologist by the name of Arthur Chess, while he is alone, having lunch in the hospital dining room. Although Jeremy has little desire for friendship at this time, Dr. Chess is persistent, and an odd relationship between the two doctors develops. Meanwhile, Angela, an attractive intern subtly flirts with Jeremy and finally suceeds in obtaining a date with him. Just as Jeremy's life begins to feel \\"normal\\" once again, he accepts an invitation from Arthur Chess to a dinner with some of Arthur's friends. Subsequently,Jeremy's life begins to become very strange. Anonymous mail is delivered to him at his office, his girl friend begins to spend less time with him, and his new-found friend Arthur disappears. As Jeremy attempts to figure out where his friend has gone, and solve the mystery of the anonymous mail deliverys, as well as come to terms with his relationship with Angela, he starts to wonder whom he can trust, and who the enigmatic members of Arthur's little club really are.I gave this story only three stars because it seemed to drag at times."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is not an Alex Delaware mystery and I really enjoyed the change. This mystery is well constructed and the pages turn pretty fast. The lead character is a psychologist but in many ways seems more \\"real\\" than Mr. Kellerman's other protagonists. A QUICK READ, ENJOYABLE THRILLER."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"How lame is the plot of THE CONSPIRACY CLUB? So lame that even Kellerman realizes it. Because he takes this \\"plot\\", with the same red herrings, twists, and \\"the old switcheroo on who the real killer is\\", and recycled it into half of his next Petra Connor series entry, TWISTED."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This was one of the best Jonathan Kellerman books I read in quite awhile. Really good character developement and a plot that is laid out perfectly. In past Kellerman books the detail of everything was too extreme for me at times. Conspiracy Club didn't slow down due to details but keep a fast pace going at all times. Looking forward to reading more from Kellerman."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathan Kellerman is a very good author. Many years ago, on one of his first books, he got a blurb from Stephen King, saying he'd revived the Private Eye novel singlehandedly. I don't know about that, but he has done a lot, and the books he writes are very interesting. The style that he uses is interesting, and you can tell that he works at the prose and the characters.The Conspiracy Club is a complete departure for him. Most of his novels are technology-driven to an extent anyway, and the characters and action are reasonably rational. The atmosphere, such as it is, comes from the city they're in, the tension between the characters, that sort of thing. And there's a plot, generally a fast-moving one with twists and turns, false clues and real killers.Here, instead, we have what's almost a Gothic Romance novel. Dr. Jeremy Carrier is a shrink at a hospital in a nameless easter city (ala Scott Turow). His live-in girlfriend was killed six months before the start of the book, and he was the chief suspect, but the police could never develop enough evidence to arrest him. He wanders through the first hundred pages or so of the book, not really sure why he's so suspicious of everyone, meeting interesting people and not being sure what their motivations are.Somewhere in there, it becomes obvious that something's going on, but what it is remains murky and indistinct for most of the book. It's clear it has to do with the girlfriend's murder, but not how or why. As Jeremy slowly burrows his way through the mystery, following leads and suspects, we begin to suspect that someone else is controlling the pace, somehow, but we're not sure.This is an interesting, atmospheric novel. There's not as much plot, or as many twists, as the usual Alex Delaware novel, but there are enough for the usual reader. The characters, however, and the atmosphere, are palpable, and this is what shines through: Kellerman's skill with prose is undeniable.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jeremy Carrier's girlfriend has been brutally murdered and the police believe he did the deed. Grief keeps Jeremy isolated until a fellow Doctor convinces him to join him at a very private club. As Carrier starts to open up his life to others, mysterious messages begin to appear, messages that Jeremy hopes will lead to the killer. Once again Jonathan Kellerman draws readers into a twisted tale that will enthrall and hold you captive to the last page.Beverly J Scott author of RIGHTEOUS REVENGE, RUTH FEVER, and JENA'S CHOICE."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Although it took a couple of chapters to get beyond Dr. Delaware and the rest of my &quot;friends&quot;, the book had the same sub-plots and twists that will be familiar to all Kellerman readers and then ends with what could/should be the start of a fantastic new series of novels. I'm sure I'll miss Alex and Milo, but the CCC sets the stage for more complicated and interesting stories!Kellerman is one of the best insightful mystery author's around today!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"As an avid fan of the Delaware series, I was thrilled to read a stand alone book of Kellermans that was a gripping story. I often find with authors of this genre that when they depart from their usual characters, their writing leaves much to be desired. Kellerman, however, does not disappoint - but regular readers will feel that the main character is not that dis-similar to Alex Delaware. I enjoyed this book, and would like to see Jeremy developed more in future novels - having said that - I am looing forward to reading the new Delaware book as soon as it is available."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"An Audie Award isn't the only prize on actor/director David Birney's professional shelf. He won raves for his role on TV's &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot; and &quot;St. Elsewhere,&quot; as well as critical acclaim for his stage adaptation of &quot;The Diary of Adam and Eve.&quot;His reading of Jonathan Kellerman's latest also deserves raves as he gives voice to a man caught in an ever tightening web of danger and deceit.Rob Kahn's vocal presentation of the Unabridged version is quite different, yet equally compelling as he gradually reveals the slowly closing trap hero Dr. Jeremy Carrier finds himself in.Among his many other attributes Jonathan Kellerman has a knack for inventing appealing protagonists. Alex Delaware, the lead in numerous Kellerman thrillers, won a host of readers, and we predict that Jeremy Carrier will do the same.Romance quickly turns to heartache and grief when Carrier's lover, nurse Jocelyn Banks, is kidnaped and murdered. Not just slain but brutally, insanely murdered. Lacking suspects the police cast a wary eye on the young doctor. He turns to work as an escape from a loss he cannot forget and labors as staff psychologist at City Central Hospital.Then, more young women are murdered in the same macabre manner. It will take more than a degree in psychology for Carrier to figure out who could be capable of such heinous acts despite a plethora of anonymous clues. Are these clues to help him or to draw him even deeper into a dark abyss?- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I'm a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have read all of his books. The plot of this one is a bit too familiar. Psychologist help police solve brutal killings. And there's even a Robin-esque woman by this side, but not too involved in the murderish goings on.I hope he brings back Milo and Alex -- why try to remake the original characters, when they are already done so well."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I thought that I was not going to enjoy this novel very much because of the change in main character. I haven't read all the Delaware novels yet, but I enjoyed enormously those I have read. In the Conspiracy Club Kellerman sticks to what has made him a best-selling author...a psychologist involved in a mystery as main character.After his girlfriend is murdered in a gruesome manner, Dr. Jeremy Carrier is considered the main suspect by the police. As other girls are murdered this suspicion intensifies and Jeremy finds himself looking for the killer with the help of a stranger that sends anonymous messages and clues to him through the hospital mail. The clues started coming after he was invited to a &quot;secret&quot; dinner by one of the doctors on staff, Dr. Chess. In this dinner Jeremy met four very intriguing elderly people that piqued his curiosity and whose backgrounds are part of the solution to the mystery.The novel is very well written and keeps you on edge, presenting a considerable variety of suspects and a very interesting plot. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I suppose not liking this book is my fault. I was expecting another Alex Delaware and didn't realize this was a &quot;stand alone&quot; type of novel. Maybe I didn't give this one a chance, but I don't think Conspiracy Club comes even close in character development to the Delaware series. I wouldn't recommend your purchasing this one but borrowing from your public library. The story line isn't even that imaginative nor able to captivate and hold your attention for the length of the book."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Is this reall written by Kellerman?? Why do authors DO this; abandon a character that the public likes....see Patricia Cornwell's HORRIBLE Isle of Dogs when she dropped Kay Scarpetta...where are Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis?? One reviewer referrred to them as &quot;stale&quot; ??? Not to me; I want more. I'm glad I checked this out at the library instead of wasting my money. I hope he or his staff reads these reviews, This character is weak and the whole story is simply NOT what I was expecting. Mr. Kellerman please bring back Dr. Delaware!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I love the Delaware books, but was pleasantly surprised by this change of character. It was intellectually stimulating, and once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Kellerman really seemed to be writing about subject matter he is obviously well-versed in, without making it too banal or over my head. I cannot understand some of the negative reviews, but to each his own. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I also did not know I'd be missing Dr. Delaware in this book. I was quite happy to embrace a new protagonist. Jeremy is so very human in all his feelings and responses. I enjoyed seeing him become interested in Dr. Chess despite his earlier standoffishness. I think that it is a mistake to expect an author to continue churning out books all using the same protagonist. I like the fact that Mr. Kellerman has chosen someone new, whether we see him again or not!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I used to read Jonathan Kellerman's books pretty regularly, but stopped buying them as they came out--more because of budgetary restrictions than anything else. They were always pretty good, but not good enough to make me keep up with them when money was tight. That being said, I've had two of his books on my bookshelves for quite awhile and thought it was time I got around to reading one of them.The Conspiracy Club is a stand-alone novel from Bellman, who departs from his Alex Delaware series to introduce Jeremy Carrier. Jeremy is a psychologist who is half-heartedly getting back on his feet following the recent murder of his girlfriend. The police have never identified her killer and have not ruled him out as a suspect. When other women start to disappear as well, Jeremy finds himself under additional scrutiny by the detective in charge of his girlfriend's case. While this is going on, Jeremy receives an invitation to dine with an exclusive group of individuals who he discovers have each experienced a similar unresolved loss in their past and who have an intense interest in the nature of evil.The Conspiracy Club was a decent book, but nothing special. The story takes a while to become engaging and Kellerman's attempt to shake things up with a little twist at the end left me inimpressed and ready to move on to the next book on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I love his books and this is just another one in a long line of good novels. Thank you for your work ."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"What else you can expect from Jonathan Kellerman, well a continuous page turner. The only issue was that I could not turn the pages as what I was reading was a Kindle edition :). Not only I would highly recommend this book for all the thrill, simplicity of the characters and the great language but I would also recommend Kindle PaperWhite. I was quite anxious before buying that and was real concerned if it would be able to give the reading experience which you get out of turning the pages but now I can't keep it aside."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I was enthralled from the first sentence. Jonathan Kellerman is a very accomplished author and well deserves his spot as one of the top thriller writers. I love his writing style, his detailed descriptions and his skill to keep you guessing all the way. I had all sorts of theories, from suspecting Dr Chess and his group in sinister plots and in the end I still did not get it right. Super read. I can highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Love Kellerman ... this was a fun mystery to unfold with a good protagonist in Dr Jeremy Carrier. And when it comes to a head, it's solved and over in a flash. Neatly done. As always, Kellerman delivers!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It was not up to the usual standards of Kellerman's work.... no flow for me. I have been an Alex Delaware fan since he first started years ago... this is the first book of Kellerman's that left me cold. Hope this isn't a trend."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I hadn't read this author. He's a good enough writer I got to about 100 pages, but it didn't seem to be going anywhere. Might read something else of his eventually."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am a huge Kellerman fan; own all of his books and love them all including Billy Straight and The Butcher's theater; both non-Delaware books. This one is just plain a miss. The characters never strike a note, the book is made up of 50 some chapters often 1 or 2 pages long, seemingly inflating a short story to a 280 page novel; a trend I think started by Mr. Patterson, and one I despise. 25 bucks for a 280 page book that is actually about 220? And the ending; I for one hate books that introduce the murderer 4/5'ths of the way thru. Pass this one; if you don't have all of the other Kellerman books, treat yourself and pick up one or two that are already published."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I, too, have been very into the Alex Delaware novels and was so excited about this one coming out. I was also disappointed when I found out it had a new main character (after I checked the book out), but was willing to give it a fair chance. I had to fight to stay awake almost 100 pages into this book, as it went nowhere! Arthur Chess is such a pointless character and the conversations they have are as boring as a forced lecture in college. Bottom line, if you have not read the previous books with Alex in them, go back a few in the series and read those. Save yourself the time on this one!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am a big fan of Kellerman and have listened to most of the Alex Delaware novels, but I stopped listening after completing the second CD (out of 8) in this set. I found the medical jargon depressing, overdone, and totally irrelevent to the puzzle (which I assume was discovering the identity of the serial killer). Also, I didn't think the characters were particularly likeable. I won't stop listening to the Alex Delaware stories read by the terrific John Rubenstein, but I wish I'd passed on this book. The story was weak and the reader (Rob Kahn) was even weaker. Maybe listening to the edition read by David Birney would have been better."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is the first J. Kellerman book I've read. Other reviews will inform you better about the plot itself. My small contribution will focus on the story's degree of suspense. The entire work is only 375 pages. I found that it was not very gripping at all until around page 200. Therefore, I'd rate pages 1-200 with just ONE STAR but pages 200-375 with FOUR STARS. The first 200 pages for me were too full of medical jargon and mundane details of characters lives that failed to interest me. I'm glad I read on. I'd recommend, however, that you either borrow a copy or wait for the paperback! It's the book equivalent of a wait-for-the-video flick in the theaters!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Kellerman has lost it! Years ago, when I first discovered his books, I could not put them down. Now I read them through our local book club as punishment. He has become blas&eacute;, predictable, self-involved and should be put out to pasture. I sometimes wonder if he has a secretary who fills in the gaps once he has decided on the storyline. Never again, not even for our book club."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am an avid reader and huge Johathan Kellerman fan. I have read many of his books and was excited to read his latest novel. This is the first time in years I actually stopped reading a book in the middle out of interminable boredom. This book is extremely slow moving. Too much description and not enough action. It was as if someone else wrote the novel under Jonathan Kellerman's name. The language seemed forced, bombastic, and esoteric. What a huge dissapointment. The only recommendation I would give for this book is to ask for your money back."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have read every one of Kellerman's books and also have multiple degrees in English. So why am I running to the dictionary every 3 pages? Scrofulous? Remora? Come on......It detracts from the storyline and is pretentious. Give me Alex Delaware and easy reading anytime."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Conspiracy Club is either Kellerman's first manuscript (which may be correct given the type of clinical practice of the main character - comparable to Dr. Kellerman's early years in psychology), or a more recent manuscript written in a week. Overall, it is much more comparable to the Billy Straight novels than the usual enjoyable Delaware fare. From the perspective of a practicing psychologist, Dr. Carrier is no Alex Delaware - and isn't much of a psychologist either. He has at least as much psychopathology as any other character in the book; and that's not entertaining. Other characters are inadequately developed, the plot is convoluted, and the rush to conclusion is too improbable to believe - even when attempting to suspend reality for the sake of entertainment. Kellerman has done a lot for mystery readers and for psychologists; Let's hope that he bounces back again and produces another carefully thought out psychological mystery. Kellerman can be a good producer of interesting and intricate characters and story lines; we want and expect better than this. This one will be on my bookshelf, but only to complete the Kellerman work product."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I hoped that with a new protagonist, Jonathan Kellerman would once again come through with a goodd read, but I found this as bad as most of his recent Alex Delaware novels have been. There is no comparison between the early Alex Delaware novels. The Butcher's Theater (the best) and his recent books. Maybe he shoult take a rest."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"As tired as I've gotten of Alex and Robin's love trials, I couldn't help but miss that dysfunctional and self-important duo while reading \\"Conspiracy Club.\\" This book's main character, Jeremy Carrier, never comes to life and his adventures sound like Kellerman is phoning it in. . On the plus side, Kellerman's writing is as always a cut above the usual and he has good control over detail and pacing. Unfortunately, the women in this book make even stick figures like Robin seem complex. The scenes in the conspiracy club are cartoonish and about as menacing as an afternoon in a nursing home rec room. Bring back Alex and his rich boy, can't commit melodramas! As much as he gets on my nerves, at least he got a bit more to him than a \\"tragic secret.\\""},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The Conspiracy Club is told in an odd third party set up...it works...but I was expecting a twist of fate, or another character to come into play.The story is fresh, and offers a new set of characters for Jonathan Kellerman to expand upon.

I immediately liked the newness, and background of this book.A good change of pace, keep it up."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am an avid Kellerman reader &amp; I've read many reviews from people who have bashed him having read only one book out of his Alex Delarware series &amp; am highly disappointed that they would consider themselves an expert on good novels having not been privy to the character developments. However, w/ the introduction of a new central character, I found myself in this position of having to learn to warm up to a new hero. I read the first chapter on a website before the book was released &amp; figured I would NEVER read the book, but out of boredom I dove into it w/ an open mind &amp; found by the 3rd chapter I was enthralled &amp; intrigued by Dr. Carrier. And although I hope he doesn't completely abandon the characters we've grown to love in the Alex Delaware novels, I do hope to hear much more about the new characters as well. Although these characters are very similar, i feel for people who read Series novels, it's a great way to get the quality you enjoy and still mix it up w/ out all the redundancy that comes w/ having to read the descriptions of all the same people, places, &amp; things you've been reading about for years."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"New characters, setting and purpose hold the readers attention. One could quibble with why the hero is left to discover things on his own while people die, but this is a welcome new idea from a reliable author."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I really wanted the THE CONSPIRACY CLUB to work. I struggled through the first half of the book and waited for it to set the hook and give me a reason to continue reading. There wasn't one to be found. I even committed the cardinal sin of mystery/thriller readers and skipped ahead to get a jolt and a clue of what was going to happen. Even that failed to excite me to read further. I want desperately for Kellerman's latest to be up to his high standard and be the 5-star thriller other readers have reviewed, but for now it isn't. So I'll try again...later...and lower my expectations. Maybe that will work."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Nice to see a non-Alex Delaware novel, as Kellerman was losing his edge with this character. It is nice to be introduced to a new, fresh face with similar characteristics, but complex in different ways than Delaware, character. Great read - reads fast, a real page turner!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I was expecting the worst. However, with the exception of the scence at the dinner, this book kept my interest and was a refreshing change. Kellerman is one of my favorite authors, but I do have to admit his last few Delaware books were a little bogged down with his romantic life."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I must agree with most of the reviews. Lack of momentum and energy, lack of a gripping storyline, very little suspense, and a story that could have been written (with more excitement) on fewer pages.I did like the cover."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathan Kellerman never disappoints me. A stand-alone, but it was nice to take a break from Delaware. If you enjoy his reading style, you'll love this."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"When I first read the Amazon review of this novel, I was intrigued. Never a fan of Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels, I thought I might give this a try since it \\"re-invigorates a number of tried-and-true mystery conventions,\\" was \\"gripping\\" and \\"intricately plotted.\\" I found this novel to be neither gripping nor intricately plotted; in fact, I found it tedious and quite boring. The main character of Dr. Jeremy Carrier is neither appealing nor likeable. He came off has whiny and little self-involved for my taste. Yeah, yeah, I know he's just been tough a terrible ordeal, but please!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"As a huge fan of early-middle period Alex Delaware novels (sorry, but all the post-&quot;Billy Straight&quot; novels have been weak), I was looking foward to a non-Delaware Kellerman novel. The facts are these: the mystery doesn't work very well. The way the author sets up clues, has his protag investigating this mystery, and his style of plotting are dense, but ultimately unfullfilling if you're a mystery buff. The reason I liked this novel was its main character, Dr. Jeremy Carrier. Kellerman has written a very-believable, three dimensional human who even in the tedious parts of the story, keeps you interested in what's going on. I liked the romance (usually a weak part of a mystery novel) between Carrier and the nurse Angela. Very realistic and interesting. Overall, I'd say that Carrier, his relationship with Angela and Dr. Chess are what kept me into the book. If you're looking for shoot-em-up action packed novels that read like a movie, I suggest anything by James Patterson, Greg Iles, or John Sanford. But most Kellerman fans should be pleased."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In this novel, author Kellerman has taken a break from his series of books about psychologist Alex Delaware to offer us a new main character, Jeremy Carrier. Although Jeremy is also a psychologist, he is younger than Delaware and practices in a hospital (as opposed to Delaware's private practice). Yes, he does become involved in a series of mysterious murders--including the murder of his own girlfriend--but unlike Delaware, Jeremy is working on his own rather than with the police.Although this book definitely contains some similarities to the Delaware series, Kellerman has done a nice job of creating an interesting new cast of characters. Furthermore, the use of a new protagonist has allowed him to break away from the staleness of the recent Delaware books and to return to some of the energy and intensity of his earlier works. While not as good as Kellerman's best non-Delaware novel, The Butcher's Theater, The Conspiracy Club reminds the reader of Kellerman's continued potential for writing great works of suspense."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In &quot;The Conspiracy Club, Jonathan Kellerman departs from his Alex Delaware series with a new protagonist who is moodier and has more of an edge. Jeremy Carrier, a staff psychologist at City Central hospital, is a loner who becomes emotionally distant when his lover is brutally slain. He is unsure of his worth as a psychologist and mistrustful of the motives of others. When he is approached by an elderly eccentric pathologist named Arthur Chess, Jeremy tries to avoid him. However, through persistence and an invitation to a sumptuous but odd dinner meeting with a group of retired intellectuals, Dr. Chess draws Jeremy into pondering violence and virtue and leads him to question his role in this strange circle of friends. Jeremy begins to receive cryptic journal articles and postcards that draw his attention to a series of violent murders. He suddenly finds himself the prime suspect of these gruesome deeds and harassed by a homicide detective. As the clock ticks down, Jeremy must track down a psychopath to protect the new love of his life and to prove his own innocence.This is typical Kellerman fare, reminiscent of his previous novel &quot;The Murder Book.&quot; In both stories, the protagonists are given a series of enigmatic clues by persons unknown and then left to follow their crooked trail wherever it might lead. Although the story starts off slowly while developing Jeremy's tortured soul, it picks up speed and ends with a twist. The book contains thought-provoking ideas on the nature and origin of violent behavior and is an entertaining story."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Lame plot, stale characters, and it takes over half the book for anything at all to happen. So much of this book is useless filler, I can't believe it even got published."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I really enjoy reading Jonathan Kellerman's novels, and THE CONSPIRACY CLUB was no different. This novel, however, does not feature Dr. Alex Delaware, the protagonist of most of Kellerman's books. It is instead a standalone novel featuring a much younger (and troubled) protagonist, 32-year old Dr. Jason Carrier.This novel is much slower paced than the Delaware books, and takes a long time to get started. The \\"mystery\\" in this book is also impossible to solve because Kellerman withholds key information until the last minute. So if you're looking for a tightly written plot that plays fair with the reader, you may be dissatisfied with THE CONSPIRACY CLUB.Still, this novel is fun because Kellerman's writing is so good. I found the dialogue and descriptions in THE CONSPIRACY CLUB to be first-rate. Most of the characters in this book strike me as real people, flawed but decent. The romantic relationship that develops in this book is very well done. The descriptions of the day-to-day routine of a psychologist at a large hospital are fascinating to read and sound true-to-life.This novel doesn't entirely work as a thriller, but I enjoyed it for what it was. If you like Kellerman's style of writing, THE CONSPIRACY CLUB is a good choice. I give him credit for trying something different. On the other hand, if you're trying Kellerman for the first time, I would recommend his early Alex Delaware books instead, because they are much more exciting and fast-paced.Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathan Kellerman has been one of my favorite authors for years, particularly the Alex Delaware novels. This - non-Delaware novel - starts slow but delivers in the end. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the slow beginning. I even put it down a time or two thinking I'd never get where he was going, but I'm glad I persisted. It turned out to be very well worth it. This is an old fashioned cerebral murder mystery with our hero and amateur sleuth the psychologist doctor lover of the first victim. Eh? Got the hairs standing up? He is befriended (in an odd circumscribed manner) by an older pathologist who invites him to dinner with friends one evening. As the murders continue our hero begins receiving obscure clues - and he's not sure who to ascribe them to. This is a well plotted, very satisfying read if you can make it through the - sorry - slow beginning. Kellerman reveals a whole new side to his writing abilities in this deeply thoughtful mystery. Loved it!!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Thus you should like it or dislike it depending on whether or not you enjoy psychological, steady-paced, well-plotted mysteries, such as those by P.D. James and Ruth Rendell (aka Barbara Vine). People who want a speedy, thrilling, more violent page turner like the Alex Delaware books, may be in for a disappointment (which I believe is reflected in many comments here). I do like the Delaware books (though I confess my favorite characters are Milo Sturgis and the city of Los Angeles; I find Dr. Delaware often whiny and Robin a total you-know-what -- and I'm female), but I liked this one as well. It's just different, that's all. To me the central mystery wasn't about the serial killer, it was about the Conspiracy Club, and whether or not they were actually steering the psychologist protagonist, or perhaps he instead is losing it emotionally and mentally. Is he being persecuted by the police, set up by the Club (for good or ill), set up by the killer, or just insane? The medical references, often involving cancers, surgeries, and serious activities (Tumor Boards, the Morbidity and Mortality Boards, etc.) to me added an ominous, building sense of inexorable tension to the atmosphere of the story. Very finely done. I couldn't wait to see what happened...the best recommendation for any story. If you're looking for a roller coaster thrill ride, however, you should probably wait for another Delaware book."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and \\"traveling and learning\\" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I stumbled into an Alex Delaware novel long ago and was completely taken in. A long time after THAT, I discovered that there were more novels written about this same character and I quickly became a fan of Mr. Kellerman's books. I bought The Conspiracy Club hoping it was of the same standards as the Alex Delaware novels.I was disappointed. This book seems like a rush job, with things going on all over the place and no clear path to anything. I'm all for new characters and new novels, but I had expected this book would be as good as his previous ones...those I can't put down! This one's hard to pick up!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Wow, I've been a huge fan of Jonathan Kellerman's novels for years now, and while I particularly enjoy the Alex Delaware series, until now I've enjoyed his stand alone novels just as much.The only reason I struggled to finish the book was because it was a JK novel, but believe me, it really WAS a struggle. It's possible that some of the reason is that the setting itself is fictional; despite long narratives about the setting and its environs, I still never got a real feel for the area.I also didn't find any of the chracters likeable; whether they are good guys or bad guys, or somewhere in between, I can usually identify with the characters in some way. Like them, hate them, are they funny, smart? I just really didn't CARE.The second star is only because somewhere after page 200, the \\"action\\" started to pick up and make some sense, and THERE was the Jonathan Kellerman writing I've come to love, expect, and respect.Hopefully this was just a fluke. If nothing else, at least it's apparent I'm not the only one who feels this way."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"A decent story but too wordy and full of itself. I found myself wondering about this book when I wasn't reading it but when I picked it up, it was predictible and left too many ends dangling."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The author is reusing a similar plot device than in \\"Twisted\\": a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. That is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes.The narrative in general is not Kellerman at his best, either. The characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do.A small part of the book talks about Brazil, and Kellerman simply invents a couple of Portuguese words making them sound Spanish: (\\"favilla\\", \\"favillitos\\"). One wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional.In sum, a book carelessly executed."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"\\"The Conspiracy club\\" is told through the eyes of Jeremy Carrier, a psychologist at City Central Hospital. Throughout the story Jeremy tries to come to terms with the brutal murder of his girlfriend, Jocelyn. Other murders in the area occur in the same fashion and it's apparent that a serial killer is responsible. Although, Jeremy is a primary suspect for the murders and is harrassed by the police, he begins to investigate the murders himself to find the killer. He begins a friendship with the eccentric Dr. Chess, who is himself interested in the causes of bad behavior and evil.I found my first book by Kellerman to be entertaining,but has a depressing tone throughout and contains characters that seem a little one dimensional. Still at times, Kellerman seems extremely insightful in his descriptions of human interaction. I plan on checking out some more books by this author."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Another awesome Jonathan Kellerman book! He's a clinical psychologist with characters that are psychologists, namely Alex Delaware, who is in many books. In the case of The Conspiracy Club, Kellerman created a new character, Jeremy Carrier. This book got me from the first sentence: \\"Raging emotions, dead tissue.\\" From there, Kellerman takes the reader on a ride as spectacular as any amusement park can send you on. From an aging forensic pathologist and a group of unlikely friends, Carrier obtains cryptic clues to a serial killer who most likely also killed Carrier's wife.Carrier becomes a suspect as he discovers the serial killer is most likely a doctor who knows how to dissect people using laser technology. Carrier is a staff psychologist at a hospital where a couple of other suspects in the crimes work, including his girlfriend, Angela Rios, who is also a doctor. Jeremy begins working to solve the mystery because police are misguided and he realizes the killer might have also killed his wife. This takes him into the bowels of a high-rise building to catch the culprit.Jeremy's interviews with patients along the way include a cancer patient who probably got another illness due to something wrong in the treatment of his cancer the first time. The book takes the reader into the mind of Jeremy and shows what goes on in the work life of a psychologist. Particularly humorous is when Jeremy must take all of his patients and act like he's interested on the same day he thinks he figured out the killer's identity!Overall, a treat to any reader of mystery and thrillers, particular anyone who has read any of Kellerman's other novels. I'm hooked -- I've got to read each one, now!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathan Kellerman, a hit-or-miss writer with more misses in recent years, has something in the middle with the Conspiracy Club, a rather average thriller that takes a break from series character Alex Delaware to present a similar character named Jeremy Carrier. Carrier is a psychologist who is recovering from the murder of his girlfriend, a death that is more devastating because he is a suspect in the crime. He is drawn out of his funk by two people: Arthur Chess, a retired pathologist whose mysterious actions start to point Carrier towards the real killer, and Angela Rios, a doctor who he starts dating.As if working a puzzle, Carrier is presented piece by piece the solution to the murder. This is not a whodunit: there is no way the reader can figure out the killer before Carrier does. In addition, the reason behind Carrier's manipulation is not that plausible; there are easier ways to do things that seem to escape the characters.I have said for a while that Alex Delaware has become more and more of a nondescript, boring character (although there has been a little improvement in recent books). Carrier seems to be Kellerman's attempt to recreate Delaware under a new name. There is even a cop in this story named Doresh who has a similar gruffness to Milo Sturgis, although Doresh and Carrier have a more antagonistic relationship.The last time Kellerman did a non-Delaware novel, he excelled with Billy Straight; this effort is okay, but not as successful. Although it does have its problems, this book is a generally entertaining read, neither exceptionally good or bad. It is strictly a three star work, of more interest to Kellerman fans than to mystery fans in general."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have read all the Alex Delaware books and have been disappointed in the last couple. When I saw he had invented a new protagonist I hoped for something new and different. Instead I read a less skillful version of the Alex Delaware books, and I think I know why: The Conspiracy Club feels like an old, long-neglected first shot at writing a thriller, reworked enough for publication, but not enough to be a good book.Jeremy Carrier is a psychologist who works in a hospital in an unnamed Midwestern city. Alex Delaware, remember, spent his early life in the midwest. Carrier drives a Nova, and another character has a Falcon in his garage. Novas haven't been made since 1979, Falcons since 1970. So I think Kellerman probably started the book in the '70s. But it had a lot of work done on it in the '80s or early '90s. All the doctors have pagers, but none has a cellphone, a laptop, or any other of the gadgets we take for granted today. The hospital computer has a 2400 baud modem. We are told it is old, but it's safe to say that no institution has had that slow a modem for over a decade. Carrier uses it to connect to a database at a local newspaper, after paying a fee. He has never heard of Google, or apparently even of the web.There has been some updating, especially near the end, and it is not coincidental that the pace picks up in the later pages. I think Kellerman stuck his manuscript in a drawer in the early '70s, pulled it out and worked it up 15 or 20 years ago, and then finally did a bit of rewriting recently to whip it into shape for publication. The result is as you might expect: amateurish in places, with an unconnected feel.The Conspiracy Club is acceptable to pass the time, but I don't believe anyone who knows and likes the Delaware series will feel the need to read more about Jeremy Carrier, and I doubt that Kellerman has any intention of writing more books about him."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I read everthing Jonathan Kellerman and I'm a great fan but this outing was not his best. I agree with many of the reviewers who were dismayed by the lack of character development of the CCC members, the long drawn out path to the final conclusion, the somewhat irritating and whiney main character and the quick resolution of the plot. The story line was great but the execution was puzzling. But--as someone else said--Jonathan is allowed a stumble or two. We still love him!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"If this was my first Kellerman novel I would have been captivated. Kellerman has a unique writting style which I believe captivates and keeps his fans coming back for more. But Conspiracy Club was not his best. I was disappointed by the lack of development of the \\"Club\\" members characters. I also found Jeremy Carrier rather boring. Though it ended with Kellerman flare, I fear it was a case of \\"too little too late...\\"not his usual page turner.But Kellerman cannot please everybody all the time, and he is allowed the odd bad book, as long as he follows it up with a smasher like Therapy."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Very dissapointing. As a huge fan of the Alex Delaware novels and Jonathan Kellerman's style of writing, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I found the main character, Jeremy Carrier, to be sad, whiny and an all around boring guy! The story took forever to develop and by the time it did I had stopped caring what happened. He spent too much time introducting characters that ending up having little or nothing to do with the plot. I was surprised at some of the twists near the end, but they weren't enough for me to recommend this book. I finished reading it only to find out \\"who done it\\". I recently read his new novel \\"Therapy\\" which I would recommmend along with most of the other Delware novels."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I too have been a great Kellerman fan, and have read all his books. But this one is bad, and not just because it isn't Alex Delaware or because it has little if any real plot. It's the style, something I don't remember from the earlier books. One reader noticed the annoying short chapters, a trend from some other \\"thriller\\" writers.What I noticed was the page after page of one sentence paragraphs.Or one phrase paragraphs.Supposed to make us feel breathless, I guess.But really more like [Dick and Jane]."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I generally don't like it when my authors go off on tangents and write something else other than what they got me hooked with. I loved the first Alex Delaware novel and became an avid reader of all his adventures.I was mildly disappointed to find that The Conspiracy Club wasn't a Delaware novel, but when I discovered that the protagonist was a psychologist, I decided it might not be too bad.It wasn't too bad. It took me longer to become engaged in Carrier's adventures than it does with Delaware. I also found the plot development to be somewhat ponderous. The book moved turgidly in the beginning and the premise seemed just a little bizarre. Of course it all became clear at the end, which I suppose is what an author shoots for, but it doesn't make for a really gripping book."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is a story from author Kellerman which is a bitof a departure for him, in that he usually writes about hishero Alex Delaware and his odd pal, Milo, who operate inthe psych and homicide world of L.A. The best of those storiesusually grab your attention and move at a fast, complex pace.Here, Kellerman does give us a different perspective with hishero a Ph.D psychologist working in the psych unit of a hospitalin an unnamed city. Dr.Jeremy Carter's life falls suddenly intonew depths when his beautiful girl friend is found murdered,and the details of her death are so gruesome the detectiveswon't talk about them to anyone.And, of course, since there are few clues, the hidebound policedetectives suspect the boy friend, Jeremy, and they try to workhim into the murder.Jeremy tries to build a new life, but it is a slow, painfulprocess; then he meets another beautiful young woman, and theymove toward a more intimate friendship. But he can never forgethis earlier girlfriend and her fate, but the police still won'ttell him anything, but they are obviously losing interest inwhat is becoming an old case.Then Jeremy is suddenly befriended by an older man on staff,who is a pathologist, and the older doc invites Jeremy to adinner, which turns out to be very mysterious indeed. Thehandful of participants are all older, seemingly wealthy, andthey have something secret in their past, which they hint ofbut never detail.The pathologist then disappears, and Jeremy begins receiving postcards from around the world, and about the same time, someone is slipping into his interoffice mail copies of bizarrearticles in medical journals. Jeremy's interest is aroused,of course, and he begins trying to make some connection amongall those articles and the bare hints from his new friend, thetraveling pathologist.The course is complex, with some false leads, and the psychologist begins investigating on his own. All leading todanger of course.In the course of his story, author Kellerman tells us a bit about the basic characteristics of serial killers and the kindof people who kill for no reason, or only for their personalthrill, and his descriptions are highly interesting, all the more because the author knows this business.The pace is both quick and easy, and the ending does revealthis to be a genuine mystery."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In the past I have found Jonathan Kellerman to be my favorite author, having read every book he has ever written. Conspiracy Club, however, does not live up to his previous works. The plot was weak, the characters even weaker. I found myself bored and thrilled when it ended. Mr. Kellerman, please go back to your previous style, this was simply not worth reading."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have been rading Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels for years and I have really enjoyed them. I was so disappointed by his new novel The Conspiracy Club. It moved so slowly it was painful. There were no interesting characters. I can't even remember the &quot;hero's&quot; name. This one wasn't worth the time. I was glad when it ended."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers who believed that Mr. Kellerman's traditional lead character, Alex Delaware, was getting a bit stale. So, now Mr. Kellerman has given us Jeremy Carrier, but a psychologist is not a big leap in character differentiation. More imporantly, Dr. Carrier is not much of a character. Not much personality, not much flavor. I can't remember the last time I was less interested in a book's central character. If you can get past the lack of a good central character, some of the supporting cast members, such as Arthur Chess, are somewhat interesting, but none are compelling.The story itself, a whodunit, with Dr. Carrier trying to determine the identify of his girlfriend's killer is decent. There's not a lot of action, so the story is mainly cerebral. It's not a bad way to spend a few hours, but some of Mr. Kellerman's early books are a better diversion."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Dr. Jeremy Carrier is a new character, perhaps a rework of Alex Delaware, before he had &quot;been there; done that.&quot; He's young, idealistic and fairly inexperienced. He's an orphan who got through school on scholarships against all odds. His first real love is brutally murdered and at the beginning of the story he is trying to find his way after being suspected of having killed her. A mystery doctor on staff at his hospital, Dr. Arthur Chess, drops into his life along with mysterious tips or clues leading him to look for Jocelyn's killer. The story is slow and hard to follow. The suspense finally picks up about half way through the book, and it's worth finishing.Now that we have met Dr. Carrier, perhaps his next adventure will be a little more suspenseful and intense."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Feeling that the Alex Delaware series has lost a great deal of zest in recent books, we snapped up this latest Kellerman on learning it featured a completely new leading man, psychologist Jeremy Carrier. This doc practices on staff at a regular hospital; and we were surprised to learn how busy he was with the care and concerns of fairly normal patients whose current medical conditions were mostly other than mental difficulties. Carrier himself is dealing with the unsolved murder of his former serious nurse girlfriend, a case that has brought suspicion against himself by cop Bob Duresh. Soon a couple more killings suggest a possible link between Carrier's girlfriend and the other victims, a thought that once again sics Duresh onto his trail. Then another mysterious character, pathologist Arthur Chess, befriends Jeremy and invites him to an elaborate dinner meeting of some sort of secret society interested in dark human deeds. A series of follow-up clues from Chess to Carrier set our hero in pursuit of who might be the real perpetrator of these crimes. The clues continue to unfold and confound as Kellerman sets a nice pace of action and reaction throughout this suspenseful mystery; and of course our hero catches the bad guy in the end.We felt mixed emotions about this novel. We almost always enjoy Kellerman's writing, even though his last few books seemed a little stale. Our problem with this one is that while the mystery per se was entertaining enough, the characters were almost lookalikes to the Delaware clan: Jeremy for Alex, new girlfriend Angela for Robin, and cop Duresh for Sturgis, though the latter mostly an adversary instead of an ally. We find the speculation of other reviewers that maybe this manuscript was a precursor to the Delaware series as mildly amusing, but not impossible. So -- reasonably good novel, but not great."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathon Kellerman is one of my favorite authers, and his last two books have been his best in years. But with Conspiracy Club he has totally missed the mark. This book is slow paced, the main character (Jeremy Carrier) is totally uninteresting. I've read about 100 pages and nothing has happened! I can only read a few pages at a time before I start getting sleepy. I had to put the book down, I couldn't finish it. I may go back to it but not right away. What a bummer. If you're looking for something to put you to sleep pick this book up. Everyone else should just leave it alone. Hopefully Kellerman's next book will be up to his earlier standards."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathan Kellerman has become one of my favorite authors over the past year, having devoured his Delaware novels, and his other good books such as &quot;Billy Straight&quot; and &quot;The Butcher's Theater&quot;. However, this book is quite unlike Kellerman's earlier efforts.While I always admire an author who wants to break away from his series characters (ala Harlan Coben, Jeffery Deaver, etc.), I think Jon misses the mark in this one.Jeremy Carrier is not the strongest of lead characters. At times, his own self-pity and lack of communication skills makes him obscenely apathetic; when he attempts heroics, he seems incapable of filling the hero's shoes. The whole club idea is so preposterously laid out, that they come across as the Golden Girls on Prozac. The killer's identity is anticlimactic in the fact that it's a character who has had so little involvement in the book, it's like Betsy Palmer coming out of the woods in &quot;Friday the 13th.&quot;Kellerman's usual mastery of pacing, suspense and intrigue are replaced with long, monotonous scenes, and very little tension.I hope this isn't the beginning of a new series, cause I don't think Carrier can carry it!Go back to Alex Delaware, Jon, and return to those pulsepounding thrillers you captured our hearts with!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have not or cannot finish reading this book. It is soooo slooow and seems to be going nowhere and I don't really care about Jeremy at all. Why is that? My first experience with Jon Kellerman was so wonderful that I had to read everything right away. But this book can't be his. I did catch his wonderful descriptive talents in describing scenery but that is not plot. As with Patricia Cornwell's disaster with Blow Fly, it seems as if two previous reviewers are right. Mr. Kellerman was phoning it in or he had this book from a college project and needed to get something published. I don't think I will bother finishing The Conspiracy Club so I can use the time to find a new mystery author. I checked out this site to be sure that I was not the only one who was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The first half of this book went by very slowly. So slowly, in fact, that I almost put it down. I was glad that I didn't in the end. The plot starts to pick up and the reader gets engaged in the final resolution. It's not the most clever or best written book I've ever read but it was certainly ok. I bought it on the bargain shelf and felt it was worth it - decent entertainment for a few hours time."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Here Kellerman inroduces a new central character, writes in the third person, places the action in an unnamed, generic mid western city, and creates an antagonistic relationship between the hero and the main homicide detective.These are all significant departures from the lengthy Deleware series, and I think they lend freshness to the novel. Kellerman retains his ability to build interesting characters, and handles the romance convincingly.I'm far less convinced that the investigative plot is plausible - why did those who apparently knew about a serial killer leave the hero so much alone, especially when the villain would kill again?It was good for author and reader to enjoy a holiday from the admirable but weary Alex Deleware, but this offering is a few notches below Kellerman's considerable best."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I won't sum up again, that's been done countless times on this one already. Psychological thriller is a pretty accurate two-word summary!The story was interesting, if not exactly gripping. I like the fact that Carrier wasn't able to make unrealistic instant intuitive leaps, and that he logically and credibly worked the &quot;mystery&quot; out on his own. The characters were well-defined and believable. The plot was intricate enough to keep me guessing, as a reader, and not blatantly obvious. Carrier's relationship with Angela was very well done, his shying away from any discussion of his past or especially his relationship with Jocelyn. When Angela began working closely with Dirgrove, I thought at first that it was uncharacteristic of her, since she seemed very taken with Carrier --- but then she proved to be true to her personality when Dirgrove hit on her and she told Carrier about it immediately. Doresh showing up to &quot;save the day&quot; at climactic moment was allowable because of his evident and continual distrust of Carrier, although I am a bit skeptical at those &quot;just in time&quot; rescues. However, the book was an overall good story, and well plotted with convincing three-dimensional characters. I'd rather read more Delaware books than Carrier, though."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have always found that a good reader can make a mediocre book more interesting and a bad reader exposes weak prose in a few moments. This audio book has the one of the worst readers ever and writing so poor that even George Guidall would be hard pressed to keep me listening.I agree with an earlier reviewer's thought that this book seems to be from before Kellerman's Delaware success. The use of latin names of diseases without a translation and clumsy use of language (When was the last time you found the term &quot;jimcrack&quot; in a novel with a modern setting?). And, this book suffers the worst of Kellerman's other novels: endless and pointless mental dialogue by the lead.All in all this audio recording is a must avoid."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"There is no such thing as a bad Jonathan Kellerman novel, but some are better than others. This standalone presents a number of problems. The protagonist is a close approximation of Dr. D, but with few of his more attractive traits. Dr. C is too tentative, too young, too soft. The plot is interesting and complex, a nice variant on an old theme, but with no interesting twists and turns. Finally, the setting is fictitious, so we lose some of the texture and local color associated with Kellerman's best work (e.g. BILLY STRAIGHT). Having said that, the narrative is lean, the story interesting, the writing always expert. I didn't devour the book, but I returned to it whenever I got the chance. This would be a top book if Kellerman were not a top talent who always raises our expectations. Read it, but wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is so wordy and difficult to read, that it wasn't even worth finishing. I was VERY disappointed in this author, since I usually enjoy his writing."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I read a few of the negative reviews before I got my hands on Conspiracy Club, and thankfully the bad reviews didn't spoil my fun.First, I read one Kellerman novel several years ago so I had no opinions on this author when I got this book. Even at 370 pages, this is a quick read.Dr. Carrier is a pschyciatrist at a big city hospital. His girlfriend has recently been murdered. Dr. Authur Chess befriends him and at the same time Carrier begins receiving strange packages and notes leading him to clues about various killings and killers.This book is from the point of view of Dr. Carrier. It covers his relationships with his patients, coworkers and new girlfriend Angela.The unique part of this book is there is absolutely no forshadowing or hint of what is to come. You read about everthing as it happens to Dr. Carrier. Nothing much happens in the book, but you do get to follow Dr. Carrier's journey as he is slowly lead on a path that could lead answers or more death.The Conspiracy Club of the title not really part of the book, yet its existence does leave a few unanswered questions. Those aren't really relevant to this review.I enjoyed this book, and might actually give Kellerman's books another shot after not being impressed with his first one."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am an avid reader who always finishes a book with the belief that somewhere &quot;in there&quot; in any tome, there is something of value to learn. The basic plot of The Conspiracy Club is an attention-getter - women being murdered. And yes, the pages will turn.However, until I got to page 225, I was struggling with the decision --- is this a romance, mystery, or medical chronicle? After approximately page 225, the plot does gain momentum. I did not find the story psychologically complex, stimulating or challenging. I am slightly disappointed with this writing. Specifically, connections to the plot are expressed in shallow, below standard, and insubstantial build-up and depth. There is only a tad of &quot;breathtaking&quot; moments, and desire for the reader to hurry to the end to find out &quot;who-done-it&quot; is of meager concern. The characters, even the hero, Dr. Jeremy Carrier, are too laid back. Except for Jeremy, other characters are very inactive in their roles.I did not find the culprit &quot;hunt chilling&quot; nor do I consider this tome a &quot;21st century Jack the Ripper&quot; --- far from it. A small number of victims, very little involvement of police activity and investigation expressed, and did not see the police represented as &quot;assumed&quot; heavy investigative factions --- a part that made the story (among other factors stated) &quot;not believable.&quot;Many nondescript factors combined to make for weak storytelling --- other than the description of what/where someone ate (for) lunch. The roles of doctors Gwynn Hauser and Dirgrove were left &quot;flat&quot; with no follow-up; Arthur Chess and compatriots were left flat in most of the story, especially Dr. Chess in his travels and how they connected to the plot. I was left wondering whether the parts of the aforesaid characters add value to the story and am left with the question: &quot;Are they necessary to the story?&quot; On balance, though, I would read other books by this author."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I'm a big Alex Delaware fan, so I was unsure what to expect from this new Kellerman. But it turned out to be a great read. Really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Author Jonathan Kellerman is best known for his Alex Delaware series, but this one features another Psychologist named Dr. Jeremy Carrier. I like him. He's nothing like Alex. Jeremy is feeling kind of numb following the brutal murder of his girlfriend Jocelyn. Not only does he have to deal with the grief and shock of losing her, but he seems to be the prime suspect and the Police start hounding him when another body shows up. It's kind of funny because everyone seems to think he's such a calm, cool and collected guy when he's really broiling inside. He snaps and yells at a couple doctors and suddenly gets respect. He ignores his patients and they love him - apparently mistaking his apathy as some sort of Zen togetherness. He is basically sleepwalking through life until Dr. Arthur Chess, the Pathologist, enters the scene. He draws Jeremy out - with a sort of game. A game that turns deadly. Someone - Jeremy is pretty sure it's Arthur - is sending him strange, seemingly unrelated medical articles and news clippings. Eventually, he decides this has something to do with the murders and his curiosity gets the better of him and he starts digging, trying to put this puzzle together before another woman dies. Eventually, he is finally able to open up to another woman, but just when he starts to get domestic with Angela, he feels her life is being threatened by the killer too.Can he figure it out in time to save her? And can he survive a confrontation with the sadistic psychopath? Or will the police arrest him for crimes he didn't commit before he even gets the chance?It's a fast read and I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is the best novel Kellerman has written in a long time. It has less gore and more mystery. I love having to follow the trail of nuggets left by the older physician for the protagonist. The protagonist goes from clue to clue, doubting at first, but believing and solving in the end. A very satisfying story."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The first Jonathan Kellerman book I ever read did not feature Alex Delaware. It was a novel titled THE BUTCHER'S THEATER, and though I read it almost 15 years ago, I can still remember passages of that book as if I had read them yesterday. I've read almost all of Kellerman's fiction since that time, including every Delaware novel, so I approached THE CONSPIRACY CLUB with some mixed feelings. I was slightly disappointed that this was not going to be another Delaware novel. But Kellerman's work, whether it involves Delaware or not, is so uniformly excellent that a deviation from his normal characterization would almost certainly be interesting.Now, having spent a day or so reading THE CONSPIRACY CLUB, I can tell those of you who are diehard Delaware fans that, if you skip this excellent novel because Alex Delaware is not in it, you are cheating yourself. And if you're not already a fan of Kellerman, THE CONSPIRACY CLUB is the key to becoming one. Notwithstanding my familiarity with Kellerman's work, I felt as if I was discovering a debut novel by a new author who had studied at the feet of the masters and was channeling them.The book is excellent in every way. The characters are unforgettable, the dialogue is witty when it should be and dark when appropriate. The plotting is so intelligent yet straightforward that you'll walk away from this great novel feeling smarter than you did when you first picked it up.THE CONSPIRACY CLUB introduces Dr. Jeremy Carrier, a young staff psychologist at City Central Hospital in an unnamed Midwest city. Carrier is carrying around a boatload of grief since his passionate but all-too brief affair with a nurse named Jocelyn Banks was abruptly ended by her kidnapping and brutal murder. Carrier was initially a suspect in Banks's unsolved slaying, and Detective Bob Doresh has a disconcerting habit of popping into the hospital at odd times to ask Carrier off-kilter questions, just to let Carrier know that he's still under the magnifying glass. When another woman is murdered in an eerily and similarly grisly fashion, Doresh seems to be taking more than a polite interest in Carrier, a circumstance that creates even more sorrow and confusion for him. This is counterbalanced --- barely --- by Carrier's slowly developing relationship with Angela Rios, a hospital resident whose slow but sure emotional succor seems to put him on the road to recovery.At the same time, an elderly, somewhat eccentric physician named Dr. Arthur Chess begins to take a gently incessant interest in Carrier. This interest culminates with Chess inviting Carrier to a mysterious late night formal supper. Chess and the other four guests, all individuals of wildly disparate backgrounds, treat Carrier well. He cannot help but feel, however, that he is there more to be observed and evaluated than anything else.Almost simultaneously Carrier begins to receive a mysterious series of seemingly unconnected articles and messages through the hospital mailing system, correspondences that seem to be aiming him toward the identity of the true murderer of Banks and the other women. Kellerman, already a master of the suspense novel, takes the genre to new places here. Carrier is an empathetic psychologist, a master at sharing emotion with his patients, but he is not a detective. He lurches, in fits and starts, toward the true identity of the murderer, who is set to strike someone close to Carrier once again.Carrier is a highly believable character. He is capable of giving comfort to his patients, even to those who seem unreachable, but is slow to accept and receive such comfort himself. Kellerman's account of Carrier's initial encounters with Rios is absolutely first-rate. What is even more remarkable, however, is Kellerman's ability to infuse his novels, and particularly this one, with realistic minor characters, who sometimes enter and exit within the space of a single page. One such character is a woman whom Carrier encounters while she is sweeping out a vacated bookstore in a building that is scheduled for demolition. The dialogue between the two characters goes on but for a few sentences, yet the woman's portrayal, primarily conveyed through her comments regarding her own behavior, is perfect. A character like this is not the stuff of literature so much as she is the essence of life. Even if her actions make no logical sense to her, the reader understands them immediately.Carrier certainly has the potential to be an ongoing, sustaining character. He is too good a character to limit to one novel, even one as fine as THE CONSPIRACY CLUB.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Dr. Jeremy Carrier is a psychologist at City Central Hospital. Jeremy spends all his time at the hospital, mostly to forget the painful memories of his relationship to nurse Jocelyn Banks. Jocelyn and Jeremy didn't break up, Jocelyn was murdered and her killer still roams free.As Jeremy is struggling to get on with his life a new string of murders rocks the hospital...murders committed in the same fashion as that of Jocelyn, and Jeremy is the prime suspect.Trying to clear his name and catch a killer, Jeremy begins his own investigation which leads him to a dark secret being kept within the hospital's walls, and as more information is found out he is drawn into a game of cat and mouse with a diabolical killer.\`The Conspiracy Club' starts off slow and picks up speed about half way through. The first half of the novel is a character development study with some medical drama thrown in for good measure. The second half kicks in with the murders and the action that leads up to a satisfactory climax. This novel is well written and easy to read, as you would expect from Jonathan Kellerman, but the thriller aspects come into play a little too late into the novel to compare it to some of his best work.Jonathan Kellerman has introduced a new character (Jeremy Carrier) in a novel that could have been explosive...the plot is very interesting, the characters are all likable and the plot twists do surprise, but...Kellerman takes too long to get things cookin and when they do the novel ends.Fans of Jonathan Kellerman and his Alex Delaware series will welcome the introduction of the new character but will only be mildly satisfied with this new novel.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Kellerman is best known for his Alex Delaware novels, and rightfully so. When an author wants to break from a popular character, there's always the possibility of scepticism from the readers. Some authors are able to make this work (Jeffrey Deaver, for example). Others fall flat, as Mr. Kellerman has on this one. I honestly don't know what happened here. This is perhaps the slowest paced novel I've ever read from a veteran author. How this ever got past his agent or editor I'll never know. You are well over halfway through the book before anything happens, and I'm not exaggerating here in the least. It's almost like following someone's boring life with morbid curiousity for a while, waiting for something to go wrong. The ending, when it mercifully comes, isn't worth the build up. The Conspiracy Club from the book's title really doesn't do anything that a single character couldn't have done. It's like this is a novel he'd written years ago but put away and suddenly he had a deadline and had to grab it. The potential for a great story was here, but it would have meant losing the first half of the book and starting from there. I look forward to his next novel, but I hope it'll be back to his old standard of great storytelling."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am about to bail. Its the lavish meal that did it. That's a first for me in a Kellerman book. I came to these reviews convinced &quot;The Conspiracy Club&quot; was Kellerman's first manuscript, written thirty or more years ago, rejected, and surfacing now to give readers a glimpse of how much he had developed. Boffo stylized cartoon characters, unconnected, very 50's."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I've been a long-time fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have noticed his books steadily declining regarding plot, interest, and entertainment value. I was hoping &quot;The Conspiracy Club&quot; would bring him out of the rut he seems to have fallen into, but for me, this book only proves he has run out of motivation or has become bored with writing.I am beginning to wonder when the publishing world will grow tired of continually feeding to the reading world mundane works from formerly best-selling authors (i.e. Cornwell, Patterson, Clancy, Kellerman, et.)and instead focus on more talented, unknown authors. Come on, New York, listen to the readers who are expressing their opinions!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is BY FAR the worst Jonathan Kellerman book ever. I have been reading JK for over 10 years and have read almost every book of his. This book moved SO slow and he spent too much time building up characters that were not integral to the plot or at least not the murder mystery plot part. He spent more time building a love relationship between the main character and his girlfriend than he did solving the crime.1 word: BORING! If you are a fan of JK, don't buy this one. It has strayed too far from his main type of storyline."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"As an avid Kellerman fan I was very disappointed in this book. ... The Conspiracy Club was slow and boring, the characters are one-dimensional and did not engage me. If Kellerman had not been the author I would have not finished the book, I kept hoping it would be better. I actually felt ripped-off after reading it. It seemed like the plot for a poor TV movie."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have been a devoted reader of all things Kellerman (Jonathan and Faye) for a dozen or so years. I was thrilled to learn there was a new book by Jonathan that was not an Alex Delaware story. I very much enjoy series books and getting to know and like (or hate) the &quot;regulars&quot;. Sort of a soap opera behind the current plot thing. I was very excited to get to know the new characters in this book. It typically takes me about 2-3 days to finish a Kellerman novel (his or hers) I worked on reading this book for about two weeks. I made it about half way through this book. When I realized I dreaded reading anymore of it and really wasn't caring what was going to happen next I gave up. I tried skimming the second half reading a sentence here and there so I could find out the ending. I still couldn't figure out what was going on. It didn't matter though, by this point I really did not care how the book ended. I hope this will be a stand alone book and the characters will not continue on in another book. All in all this book was a major disappointment. Not at all of the calibar I have come to expect from Mr. Kellerman."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"When I saw a new Kellerman book, I snapped it right up and went right home to read it. I kept waiting for something to HAPPEN!! Guess what? When I finished it--still nothing. And Jeffrey was not even an interesting character. Why do authors who have great books and great characters have to leave them behind and do something DIFFERENT? Bah Humbug!!!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I usually enjoy the author's works, even the non-Alex Delaware ones, but not this one. I agree with the other reviewers that the characters were flat, some of the plot lines were never tied together well, and that the setting hints that this was a discarded attempt from the past that Kellerman rescued from the trash can...But my main beef with this novel is the language! In some of his Alex Delaware novels, Kellerman turns off my interest with his grandeose architectual descriptions (I often think if he hadn't been a psychologist he would have been an architect), but this book is STUFFED with pompous, over-the-top language. I chuckled out loud at the reviewer who said he/she had multiple English degrees but still had to constantly run to the dictionary to look up Kellerman's obscure word choices. Kellerman's descriptions and dialogue during the secret dinner with Jeremy and the old eccentrics was just plain laughable.One reviewer said it best when they said that they language was \\"forced, bombasic, and esoteric\\". Trust me - this book is painful drudgery to read for such a small payoff."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Hard to get into, I am accustomed to getting into one of his books and not putting it down until I finish it. This book is taking me weeks to finish. It just has not grabbed my attention. I say, &quot;Bring back Alex Deleware!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Six months may have passed since Jocelyn Banks was brutally murdered, but her lover Dr. Jeremy Carrier remains despondent as he knows first hand that time does not heal all wounds. Though the police remain convinced he is the prime suspect, a depressed Jeremy buries himself in his work as a psychiatrist at City Central Hospital because being alone is more difficult to cope with than working with emotionally crippled patients.However his antisocial misanthropic behavior is interrupted when colleague Dr. Arthur Chase hooks Jeremy to attend some social functions of a secret society. As Jeremy begins to come out of his emotional fog, he notices that other women have recently died in the same gruesome manner as his beloved. Clues begin appearing for no apparent reason. Realizing he must act alone as the police seem to be closing in on him as the serial killer, Jeremy begins investigating a cat and mouse terror game with someone guiding him, but is that someone the killer?More a combination conspiracy amateur sleuth tale than a medical thriller, Jonathan Kellerman's latest tale is an exciting story that hooks the audience the moment Dr. Chase breaks down the first of Jeremy's survival barriers. From that moment the story line is fast-paced filled with red herrings as everyone seems garbed in a masquerade (though not the same type of plot, this reviewer kept thinking of the List of Adrian Messenger). The \\"conspiracy\\" seems a bit odd and off kilter, but fans will value this exhilarating look at vengeance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I'm not even finished with this book, but feel compelled to write a 9 star review!!! While I love Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis, this one has gripped me, kind of like Billy Straight.I still have about 80 pages to read and am still not sure where this one is going. However, since I started it this morning, I know that this is going to be one of my FAVORITE Kellerman books.Jeremy Carrier is a psychologist whose love, Jocelyn, has been murdered. The police suspect him. Dr. Chess, who works at his hospital, takes an interest in him. An unusual invitation by Chess to a gastronimic feast with some very important people leaves Jeremy confused, especially since Chess has left suddenly for Europe, sending him postcards that read &quot;traveling and learning.&quot;Jeremy is also getting inter-office mail not addressed to him specifically, and is very confused by the content. He tries to piece together the information. Possibly his new love, Angela, holds the key. Honestly, I don't know...but since I have work to do tonight, I will not be able to find out until tomorrow!I can't wait....honestly, I can't wait.Kellerman, this is one of your best!!!

I love all the Alex and Milo book. Please keep writing them instead."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In his new novel, the second published in 2003, author Jonathan Kellerman starts fresh and creates an enigmatic plot surrounding a brutal serial killer. Kellerman is familiar to many mystery buffs for his psychologist hero, Alex Delaware, who works as a police consultant in a 17-book series. He's tried different threads before, most notably in 1988. Kellerman's strong ties to Judaism sometimes shine through in his novels, but are not featured, as is the case in wife Faye Kellerman's writings. Religious faith does not play a role in this newest book, but Kellerman keeps it rooted in something he knows much about, psychology.Jeremy Carrier is a hospital psychologist. He's still trying to find his way back into the life he once led, after his girlfriend, nurse Jocelyn Banks, has been brutally murdered. While stumbling through his days, he is befriended by well-known Dr. Arthur Chess, a pathologist old enough to have retired from the hospital, who is sort of an emeritus on hospital committees. Jeremy's initially puzzled by Chess' interest in him.Chess is Jeremy's entree into a secret society of oldsters who are all stars in their own professions, and retired. It takes most of the book for Jeremy to determine what ties them together in &quot;conspiracy&quot; and how he fits it the scheme of things.When Chess goes traveling, a series of enigmatic clues to other murders, similar to Jocelyn's, begin to disturb Jeremy's days. He can't help but wonder what role Chess plays in the mystery. In a parallel plot, Jeremy meets an interesting new love in resident Angela Rios. Between his relationship with her, and his willingness to be drawn into the murder mystery, Jeremy finds himself putting his own life on the line. In addition to an engrossing plot, Kellerman has created a young practitioner with feeling towards his patients and signifcant skill in making a difference.Some Kellerman-like touches (Carrier drives an old Nova; shades of Delaware's vintage Cadillac! Carrier, instead of being enlisted by police detectives to help solve the murders, is actually a viable suspect, but ends up assisting the police.)are present, and you have a nice, tight tale of homicide with a surprise villain and the possiblity of a new series. In particular, the colorful members of the &quot;Conspiracy Club&quot; could be utilized in future books.It seems as though, judging from other reviews, that many of Kellerman's loyalists disagree with my rating.Most probably it is because they just wanted another instalment in Delaware's continuing saga, since the last three books in the series (&quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, the excellent &quot;The Murder Book&quot; and &quot;A Cold Heart&quot;) have revived the series from the total drek that Kellerman created in books 10-14. I think many readers gave up on him during that spate. By contrast, I'm intrigued by the fact that he's given the reader a viable alternative to his older series, and hope he continues to revisit Jeremy Carrier in future work.Nice work!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"At last something else besides boring Alex Deleware. The writing is better, the plot more interesting and for now more interesting new characters. Kellerman has recharged his skills with interesting possibilities. More Please!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I love J Kellerman's books, and couldn't wait to get my hands on the latest one. I didn't mind that it is not part of the Ales Delaware &quot;series&quot; - I very much enjoyed Butcher's Theatre, and Billy Straight. But this latest book is so incredibly longwinded and boring! I cannot get into it, I do not care for any of the characters, and I am now on page 278, and still haven't found anything interesting in this book. I will finish it (sometime), just because it is by Jonathan Kellerman.

First, its small (plam sized paperback) that is quite attractive. Front of an artichoke on the front cover, back of one on the back. It is put out by the California Artichoke Advisory Board...who knew there was even such a thing?) Because of that the beginning of the book is full of intersting artichoke history, arichoke lore, basics, prep tips,cooking techniques, eating hints and nutrition facts. More than I have seen in cook books of 1000 pages.There are 21 recipes that run the gamut of sauces for the chokes to entrees where they are the main ingredient. There are good discriptions for the recipes, altho no pictures. Some cute line drawings of artichokes. None of which, thankfully, fall into the walking vegetable catagory.Risotto with artichokes was very good, but risotto is a hard dish for me and i think it needed a bit more explaination. I tried it twice once it was too hard and once it was too gooey. The problem wasnt exactly the recipe, more my problem with correctly making a risotto but the directions didnt help all that much. The artichoke frittata was excellent.The book is really a bit too small to to just lie flat on the counter and refer to comfortabley. It snaps shut and if you try to get it to lie flat the binding will break. On the other hand its very inexpensive so its really a minor design flaw for the price.I can't really imagine having bought this myself. Its a bit too small to be practical for me..but as a gift, perhaps as part of a theme basket. Especially a gourmet or italian themed basket with olive oil, pasta, dried basil, garlic braids..etc. this would be an excellent and inexpensive addition"},{"Title":"The California Artichoke Cookbook: From the California Artichoke Advisory Board","review":"I bought this book as a gift for someone who likes artichokes, and they are very happy with it. It contains lots of recipes for different ways to incorporate artichokes into your cooking. The person liked it so much that they requested another copy to give to one of their friends.The book is adorable also, it's cut in the shape of an artichoke. It's a paperback, but the front and back cover are very sturdy. It's a great gift idea, or a good buy if you love artichokes.

But after ten years of work, Kevin Jennings and his team have compiled a second edition worthy of sharing a title with the now-classic One Teacher in 10.

A vivid and visceral odyssey to some of the most imaginative and visionary scenery in modern science fiction. It's sort of leading along the route of Bayley's short-stories from the late eighties to mid-nineties, like &quot;Cling to the Curvature!&quot; and &quot;Love in Backspace&quot; in particular. It's like an excessive version of Ian Watson's GARDENS OF DELIGHT and some of the more outre material in the back catalog of Philip Jose Farmer, merged with Rudy Rucker and the decadent writers of the late 19th century, like Mirbeau and later, Bataille.It has some problems in it and cannot quite be ranked with some of BJBs early work - Bayley has always stated that his characters are there more to set off the scenery than to exist as &quot;real&quot; individuals, and while this is more thought-out in that sense, it is still, shall we say, problematic. And there is at least one point in the narrative that relies completely on incredible coincidence. But regardless of that, the unadulterated reveling in the bizarre scenery is constantly startling and at points reaches such a feverish pitch that it's impossible not to be impressed by the rare gift of idea-driven science fiction imagination working in full gear in these days of stoic platitudes."},{"Title":"Playing in a New League : The Women of the American Basketball League's First Season","review":"league.

How could I have possibly torn myself away with a mere 25 pages remaining although time was running out? I didn't and I am unrepentant. Karisma, the male cover model of the title, is a hilarious spoof of Fabio. (Neither is the man of MY dreams, but I am repulsed by any man who looks as if he could snap my bones like twigs.) I loved the snatches of imaginary romance novels. They reminded me of the Barbara Cartlands and Harlequins I read when I was a teen, but these were much funnier. I think the late Georgette Heyer would have enjoyed them, too -- she was so good at skewering the excesses of the genre. The rest of the book is the sort of fun I've come to expect from this series. There are so many twists and odd coincidences that I don't feel bad for coming to the same spectacularly wrong conclusion that Ellie did. Can't leave this review without expressing my appreciation for the author's double nod to Joan Hess when she announced that Zinnia Parrish would be writing a sequel to a book by the late Azalea Twilight [see Hess's *Strangled Prose*]. Oh, and I mustn't forget to rave about the cover! It's a pity that Amazon.com shows you only the front cover because the back cover is even better! It's delightful! It's inspired! I had to laugh!

Since I regularly read all sorts of stuff, good, bad, pulp, and critically acclaimed, I didn't worry about it being too fluffy; I just wanted an entertaining story. I ended up in that state one gets into, where one keeps reading and reading, hoping it would improve, hoping the characters would gain more dimension or behave believably or that something would tie in all the seemingly loose ends and improbabilities, until I reached the denouement, whereupon the ridiculously unbelievable ending dissapointed me further and I just wished I could have back all the time I'd wasted reading it.specific gripes:Unrealistically bland reactions by characters witnessing surprise deaths of close acquaintances and near neighbors.Unrealistic characterization of the German nanny, including offensivively trite rendering of her supposed english speaking mistakes.Aggravating constant lack of logical behavior and self-confidence by a healthy happily married woman with a handsome adoring husband, two healthy happy kids and lots of friends.A few good parts: I liked the satirical representation of the vain, handsome hunk who \\"lurves women\\", and I liked the way the sultry cousin turned out to not be all bad."},{"Title":"How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams","review":"I've read four books by this author, three of them about Ellie Haskell, resident of Chitterton Fells and member of the Library League. In some ways I thought this was the best of them all -- Mrs. Malloy is hysterical here and the premise revolving around romance fiction is funny as well. But there are also minor problems. The mystery itself is confusing -- lots of people die, but not necessarily of unnatural causes, and the tension never really builds; the depiction of the village's two librarians is lazy and stereotypical; and two of Cannell's best characters, Freddy and Jonas, are not here -- they are away on a camping trip!Despite the problems this is a fun book. I would recommend it if you are a fan of the author, but not if you are mainly interested in reading a challenging mystery."},{"Title":"How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams","review":"I just finished this book, which was the most light-hearted, inventive, delicious read I've had in a really long time. A page- turner with characters who are completely improbable and very touching and believable at the same time. Cannell does a brilliant job of weaving together a dozen plots. I laughed out loud for most of the book. It's a love story, a mystery, a sneaky rumination on duty and daily life (but so gracefully done that it never gets didactic.) I can't compare her to any other writer -- I know writers who try to be this funny, but very few who succeed.I'm going to read the rest of the Ellie Haskell mysteries. I'm so glad there are more!"},{"Title":"How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams","review":"I love Dorothy Cannell's work. You'll always find rich plotlines and wonderfully wacky and well-developed characters. The humor is subtle and facetious. This book is my favorite, with her spoof on Fabio. The main character, Ellie Haskell, is so likeable, with her addiction to romance novels and the way she barely manages to survive all that's going on in her life. This book is not a fast read, but rather like a very rich dessert. You'll want to take your time reading it and enjoy every word and turn of phrase. Beautifully done!"},{"Title":"How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams","review":"This is a cozy-style mystery: written about the happenings in a small village, with a lot of emphasis on the characters. It has a good deal of dry humor - sometimes so dry you almost miss it. I managed to slog thru the whole book, hoping it would get better, but it really didn't. The pacing of the story was very slow, and there was no real sense of suspense or building towards a climax. The high point was barely a bump in the road. There were just too many subplots and points that distracted my attention, most of which didn't have enough of a payoff in the end when the threads tried to come together (and many of them didn't link at all) I suppose some of the plotlines were intended to be red herrings, but it is overkill when you're completely distracted and bored by long tangents that have no satisfactory resolution."},{"Title":"How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams","review":"Still reeling from the sheer bloody awfulness of 'How to Murder Your Mother-in-Law' I thought that I should give Dorothy Cannell another chance, and so I read 'How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams'.if anything, it is even worse than the earlier book, if such a thing wer possible. A model who poses for the covers of romance novels is visiting the villag ein which the heroine, Ellie Haskell, lives. He causes a lot of excitement among the lady residents of the village. There are several deaths, but naturally it doesn't occur to the bird-brained Haskell woman that there is anythign suspicious about them until the third on.There are a lot of wildly improbably characters in the book. There's the batty old lady who was jilted by her bridegroom sixty years ealier, and has never gone out by daylight since (you could just about swallow it in Dickens, but in a modern murder mystery? Come on). She is described as wearing 'a pre-WWI bonnet' Since she must have got married in 1934 (this book was published in 1994) you wonder why she is wearing a pre-WWI bonnet? Unless of course Dorothy Cannell doesn't know the difference between WWI and WW2, which would not greatly surprise me.Then there's Greta, the German home help who has been thrown out by her husband because he's fallen in love with another man (evidently in Cannell-land, married women have no property rights, nor divorce lawyers come to that).Probably silliest of all is the lady who fled on her wedding night thirty years before in shock when her husband revealed the facts of life to her. \\"It was a different era then\\" Ellie Haskell says solemnly. Yes indeed it was, the sixties, but from what I can recall of the era, ignorance of the facts of life was not an outstanding feature of the decade.The idiot Haskell woman spends most of the book drooling over her husband, and only notices that people are being murdered after the third death. The detecting is perfunctory in the extreme and crammed into the last twenty or so pages of the book.I have read a lot of murder mysteries that I didn't aprticularly care for for one reason or another, but I accept that other people like them. Live and let live. Dorothy Cannell's 'mysteries' are, however, so abysmally bad that I really cannot fathom how any mystery fan could possibly like them."},{"Title":"How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams","review":"&lt;&lt;AVOID THIS THING LIKE AMOEBIC DYSENTERY&gt;&gt;I finished this &quot;novel&quot; feeling as though I had slogged through fifteen miles of day-glo swamp. It smacks of a sequel written under contract by an author who needed to make payments on a car. The &quot;delightfully quirky&quot; characters and the &quot;kooky&quot; goings-on were so unimaginative, relentless, repetitive and uninspired that I only finished the wretched thing so that I could review it in good faith and forget about it.Devoid of wit, style and substance, it succeeds neither as a puffy comedy or an arch &quot;woman's&quot; novel. (And in its moronic way an insult to the romance community) Obviously intended for people with IQs lower than their shoe sizes.And to raise the question that irked me for 200 of it's pages: why is this ATROCITY classified as crime fiction or a MYSTERY? The only crime that occurs takes place in the last 50 pages of mess. Instead we are treated to a relentlessly neurotic romance-fanatic (with an irrationally devoted husband) who remains at the same pitch for the duration. If a man had written this, he would be decried as misogynistic. Not only does it fail as a mystery, it is about as suspenseful as a pedicure. Tedious isn't the word: think gum-surgery. About as funny as a metastatic mammogram.Ms. Cannell's prose reads like something dreamed up by a marketing department: a horrifying hybrid of hack romance novelist and armchair sleuth intended to encourage cross-over readers between the genres... Leaving us with this dismal, stitched together, seeping-seams-and-bolts-exposed mess of a fictive Frankenstein with which to prop up a dresser. A &quot;book&quot; not to be read lightly but to be hurled with great force into the furthest furnace. Abysmal."},{"Title":"How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams","review":"Dorothy has done it again!

However, as the author himself states (paraphrase) the book is nothing more than a compendium/reference of instrument combinations (usually doublings) from the 'classical repertoire'. eg. Instrument X is octave doubled with Instrument Y in the work Z. Hundreds of such combinations are cited but in many cases the accompanying comments are no more than a couple of qualitative descriptive sentences. In many cases then to really appreciate the character of the cited combination it becomes essential to access a recording/score - this makes the book's utility then to a significant degree exclusively for those with access to a major university library etc. (although you could listen to samples on Amazon I suppose) If you read the book from cover to cover and made notes some general principles of instrument combination could be constructed from these, however, the main function of the book would seem to be as a reference of illustrative/quintessential example works for 'professional'(ie. those with the time to both seek out and listen to all these) composers and orchestrators and concert programmers etc."},{"Title":"Orchestral Combinations: The Science and Art of Instrumental Tone-Color","review":"This is a much needed compendium of instrumental combinations that composers should have in mind when writing for orchestra. The only thing missing here -for teaching purposes that is- is a CD with the aural illustration of the examples given in the book. I truly value this book."},{"Title":"Orchestral Combinations: The Science and Art of Instrumental Tone-Color","review":"This book seems to be the latest complementary text to this amazing and prolific author's encyclopedic output of musical reference materials. It sets out in detailed and clear sections examples of important classical (up through the late 20th century) repertoire featuring two-or-more-instrument \\"orchestral combinations\\" of interest - i.e., anything from violin and viola to cello and contrabassoon. The most useful examples that Read provides, I feel, are the ones with his comments and insights, which are right on the mark; otherwise, this text is a very valuable cross-referencing resource for the aspiring orchestrator. The only (very slight) disappointment I had regarding this book was that it only deals with orchestral doublings at the unison and at the octave (or multiple-octave), although I suppose that trying to do even more would have required an immensely larger text. In any case, well worth the investment for someone who spends a lot of time writing or analyzing orchestral music."},{"Title":"Orchestral Combinations: The Science and Art of Instrumental Tone-Color","review":"Sure... it's a great compendium of instrument doublings through the 20th century... but has relatively little information about what is promised in the title -- which is \\"art of instrumental tone-color\\".I would've found the reference actually \\"use-able\\" if the author actually would have described what \\"tonal colors\\" are created by combining the said instruments. Instead, he just mentions that these instruments have been used in the past, and usually an example or two (which I love... and IS valuable) -- but then leaves it up to me to dig-up the music example. A reference CD would be a wonderful companion product.Having harped on it... I will say it must have taken YEARS to compile such a resource, and am grateful that someone has. I would just like to see it taken to the next level, which involves two things I was hoping for:1) a reference CD library of all the examples sited so I could HEAR the combinations referred to2) a more useful resource which included recommendations or starting points for the art of tone-color (i.e. If your song needs dark overtones, here are several historical combinations that have worked well in the past).Although I may refer to this encyclopedia reference in the coming years -- I feel mislead by the title, and would prefer not to even have spent the $80.

The book is written in a manner to educate, not criticize or lampoon. The manner is very proper, as it should be and I found myself utilizing the Kindle's built in dictionary at least once each chapter.I found it a very informative read on the customs of England in the late 19th Century.

Every page offers both practical help with meditation and theoretical insight into Zen and Jungian psychology.Odajnyk's concept of the \\"meditation complex\\" that mediates between Self and ego is particularly illuminating, especially in conjunction with his treatment of the drawings of Pu-ming, drawings which present the path to enlightenment in humorous images (of an ox and herder).It's not surprising that Rosshi Philip Kapleau and Archetypal Psychologist Thomas Moore both recommend this book. In addition, the appendix on archetypes is a \\"must-read\\" for friends of Plato.C.A.L."},{"Title":"Gathering the Light","review":"As I finish reading Walter Odajnyk's Gathering the Light, I see a very synthetic imagination at work to bring the reader closer to what unites rather than separates Eastern and Western thought on meditation, the mystical and the means to unite the two ways the soul may engage spirit. At the same time, his book offers a short course on C.G. Jung's ground-breaking thought on the soul inhabiting all things of the world. Lost in our ADD-oriented culture is the art and practise of meditation, not just on matters of the spirit but on the everyday matters we contend with, often on the fly, fast and loose, with little due regard for consequences. Perhaps the president of the United States should include on his board of advisors a resident meditator; that person's task would be to slow down the processes that can have as their consequences war, ignoring the most in need, loss of a sense of fair play, justice denied and oversights that can diminish the earth's richness.Is this a spiritual book? Yes and no. Its wide range and depth of perception on the spiritual body can be appropriated on a number of levels to coaxe the reader into living a fuller and more deeply attended life."},{"Title":"Gathering the Light","review":"I first read this book in its original edition a number of years ago and was very struck with what an amazing contribution that it made to the many people who are drawn to the work of C.G.

In this book extolling bragging, Klaus explains that strategic self-promotion often is the best way to avoid being overlooked (and possibly downsized) in the dog-eat-dog business world. Of course, when you brag, you should not seem to be doing so. Klaus explains how to accomplish this dodge gracefully. getAbstract believes that anyone in business could benefit from Klaus's savvy advice.

The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"What's all this nonsense about not being able to stand up and take credit for the great work you do in the workplace? It's a lesson most of learned back in grade school where we were considered impolite for making it known that we were instrumental in the completion of a project or that we had won at something over someone else. Today's young women, I hope, are learning that it's okay to lead. And for the rest of us, those who don't quite know how to stand up without feeling guilty about it, there's Brag!: How to Toot Your Own Horn Without Blowing It.This book provides not only research in the hows and whys women find it difficult to take credit, but also real-world solutions for how to tackle the problem. Take for example, the issue one woman had who needed to prepare herself quickly for a performance evaluation. This woman had no files or records of her accomplishments, yet the author was able to help this woman map out an action plan. To find out what that plan was, read the book. It could help you, too.Though the author speaks a great deal about the issues women face in taking credit for their accomplishments, she does also acknowledge that some men suffer from this problem as well.

It's also a funny and fast read, adeparture from the typically dry and often lengthy business self-help books. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"A gem of a book. We all know that bragging for bragging's sake is a no-no. Few of us like being around a braggart, and we try to avoid them most of the time. But a businessperson has to get the word out about what she sells or does for a living. Successful people don't call their pitches \\"bragging,\\" but instead call it self promotion.But what is the difference between a silly braggart and being a good self-promoter? Well, the answer can be found in the instant book. And the author has done a wonderful job of explaining the difference.All the chapters were good, but my favorites were Chapter 4 (Techno Brag) and Chapter 8 (When You're Out on Your Own). These two chapters were the most relevant to self-employed small business owners. And they are the chapters that my clients at SCORE need to pay special attention to. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"I can't believe I bought this book! I truly can not. This book goes on and on about bragging, but does not give the reader any great approach to doing such. All in all, I felt the book was pure fluff. It's as if the author was bragging to the reader that if one brags enough, a book can come of it. Each chapter's introduction took too long to get to \\"the meat and potatoes\\" of the lesson. So, I skipped the 2-3 intro paragraphs to get to the \\"lesson,\\" and there was still nothing there! I am an avid reader and I've had this book for years and I've never been able to finish it. I've put this book down more times than I can count because I wasn't inspired. Finally, I made a promise to myself to get my money out of this book and FORCE myself to read it. After about 20 minutes, I found myself flipping through pages and skimming paragraphs trying to find the substance of each chapter. I finally gave up and threw it in the trash, which is what I should have done years ago. Honestly, I should have skimmed this book in a bookstore and not wasted my time ordering it online.If you want to change your life and truly get something out of a \\"self-help\\" book, pick up Napolean Hill's \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" and \\"The Science of Personal Acheivement.\\" These books and the information they contain are quite old, but tested and tried and true.All in all, don't waste your time and money with \\"Brag,\\" for it truly contains nothing worth bragging about."},{"Title":"Brag!

A quick skim indicated not much of value - or interest - in it...so I returned it."},{"Title":"Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"This book won't cure cancer, but it sure will overcome a lot of missed connections among people with valuable knowledge, experiences and talents who could be sharing them with one another.Ms. Klaus argues persuasively that most of us don't put our best foot forward, out of a desire not to seem like braggarts. In the process, we look worse than we really are . . . and no one really cares. Careers, relationships and opportunities languish as a result.Most people would like to present themselves better, and would concede that point. What's good about this book is that it is filled with practical advice for turning yourself into an interesting and relevant brief story for those you meet.The heart of the book is the Take 12 self-examination where you start developing what's potentially interesting and relevant about you to share with others. Then, there's lots of advice for how to customize that material into 30 second (for elevator conversations) to 3 minute (for selling or interview intros) versions that fit your audience at the moment. If you only read that section and did the exercises there, you would more than get your value from this book.The book begins with Ms. Klaus challenging myths about bragging (such as jobs being well done speaking for themselves, and good girls don't brag) by looking at actual experiences where the results of those myths were harmful for those who acted on them.Quickly, attention shifts in chapter 2 to &quot;What So Good about You&quot; and there's more there in the Take 12 than you probably appreciate now.Most of the rest of the chapters address specific situations such as how to behave in the office (even if you are a tele-commuter), handling job interviews, being in performance reviews, using voice mail and e-mails, when you are not employed, and when you are self-employed. For professionals who work on their own, chapter 8 which addresses the last subject can be worth a fortune to you. I thought it was very well done. Then the book moves back into overviews (chapter 9 is on brag nags to keep you focused and chapter 10 has a self-confession by the author and 12 tooting tips).If you've ever felt awkward in advancing your own views or interests in any of these situations, take a look at this book. You will probably find helpful ideas that you'll be comfortable following.In the course of my business career, I've had occasion to meet many successful people. Almost all of them follow the kind of gentle, discreet communications approaches described here. So I can testify that this approach must work for getting to the top!"},{"Title":"Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"Brag! was recommended to me highly... three different times. The third recommendation was because the book was on the \\"must read\\" list of a class I was taking on marketing. I finally bought the paperback version of the book since I was unable to find it at the local library.I ho-hummed as I opened the book thinking it would be yet another inspirational speaker writing a book bragging about her success and that everyone else should be inspired. Inspirational speakers have never been that inspirational to me - probably because their &quot;inspiration&quot; lasts as long as it takes for me to get back to my car (usually at the top level of the parking lot furthest away from the auditorium). Once I'm behind the wheel of my car I am thrust back into my own world wondering what just happened. Hadn't I felt great just a few moments before? Wasn't I ready to go get \`em? Wasn't I determined to get going and make a success of my business?I read the first paragraph of the Introduction of Brag! and Peggy Klaus had me hooked. Wait a minute. I know she was talking about her own background in her narrative, but it sounded as if she was talking about me! She speaks of her father telling her as a child, \\" ...don't toot your own horn; if you do a good job people will notice you.\\" My parents and Sunday School teachers said that all the time, too, and more. \\"Bragging is a big no-no.\\" \\"The Bible says that modesty is a virtue.\\" No wonder I never really liked inspirational speakers. They come off as giant braggarts. According to Peggy Klaus, they're not doing it right.Countless phrases of virtue and avoidance of being obnoxious and self-aggrandizing hang in the back of my head waiting to pounce as soon as someone asks me what I do. I murmur, \\"I'm a graphic designer\\" only half-believing that I deserve the title despite my success. \\"Graphic designer?\\" they ask. \\"Does that mean you do, like, brochures and stuff like that?\\" \\"Yeah,\\" I answer. And then the conversation falls flat.This is where Peggy Klaus picks up the pace and tells you right out that if you don't speak up for yourself, no one else will. However, there is an art to this type of communication. Peggy spends the remaining 190 pages helping you take stock of what you have to brag about while you make yourself a \\"Brag Bag\\" full of \\"Brag Bites\\" and a few good \\"Bragalogues\\" to fit various situations. She also has some plain talk rebuttals to the \\"buts\\" we all have to talking about ourselves. My favorite:\\" \`But... do I really need to brag 24/7?' Like the Scouts, be prepared... to toot at any time. That doesn't mean, however, that you do it all the time or that you do it at inappropriate times or places. You do it when it feels comfortable. And learning how to make it feel more comfortable is what this book is all about.\\"Peggy's examples are plentiful and, if you're like me, you'll see yourself in her examples more than once. She's not just any braggart, she's the best! Her natural way of writing (read: unpretentious), extremely practical advice, recommendations and her sense of humor combine to make this my favorite book of my business reading and the book that, right now, is making the most impact in my life and in my business.-Anna Kris BellCatchphrase Graphics"},{"Title":"Brag!

No examples of good and bad ones are given, however, so you are on your own.The remainder of the book consists of questions followed by simple examples. Unfortunately, most of those questions are standard interview questions, and the sample answers are the ones that better books tell you to avoid. For example, What is your greatest weakness?

It is a valuable business tool that career women must add to their strategies for success. It's easy to wrongly assume that a mentor (for those lucky enough to have one), or supervisor will take control and make sure that we gain professional visibility. Women, especially, show far too much humility about their talents and skills. If we want people to value our skills, we must first show that we value ourselves -- by making sure our accomplishments are visible to targeted audiences. If we want people to hire us or promote us, buy from us or invest in our companies, they have to know who we are, what we have accomplished and why they should do business with us!

Or put more properly, WHEN is bragging bragging and when is it taking advantage of opportunities? According to Klaus, there's a time and a place for proper bragging.

She encourages all of us to have a &#34;brag bag&#34; of sound bites available whenever anyone asks - &#34;So what have you been up to lately&#34;. It truly is not bragging to simply tell people what you have done. One point that hit home was the concept of &#34;credit theft&#34; in organizations. If you aren't telling lots of people what you have accomplished, then there is a high probability that someone else will take credit for it.It is hard to keep perspective on what you have done. You may think that you are just doing your job. Peggy gives a way to keep a log of what you have done so you can tap into the brag bag when you need it. If you just take a look once a week or once a month, you would be surprised at how much you did.At first her terms &#34;brag bag&#34;, &#34;brag bites&#34;, &#34;bragologue&#34; and &#34;brag nags&#34; seem contrived and self serving so she could make her point.

Get out of the way of people with purpose. This is an excellent book that shows exactly how to deliver your value with CLASS. People need to know what you have to offer, they won't figure it out unless you tell them. I used to be one of those who did not show my value well. Of course I worked hard and produced great results, but other than my boss or direct relations, nobody really knew about them.Ms. Klaus explained the \\"Art\\" expertly and easily enough for me to understand the value of self promotion.What struck me was that this was not an exercise in bragging, showiness or selfish desires, it could be done within a reference that didn't offend my values and beliefs. This self-promotion is better defined as showing your value while letting the company and team benefit.I also used lessons to transition from a career in the army to the corporate world.Excellent book with large userbase.

She is a great educator."},{"Title":"Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"Growing up in a traditional home in the midwest, I could immediately identify with author Peggy Klaus as she retells the story of how her ideas about self promotion (a.k.a. bragging) were developed. Messages from family such as, \\"don't toot your own horn,\\" or, \\"don't talk about yourself, people won't like you\\" are all too familiar.In Chapter 1, Peggy dispels 7 myths of bragging that hold us back from being able to talk confidently about ourselves and our accomplishments - skills that are critical to achieving most of our professional goals.In Chapter 2, she offers an immensely helpful evaluation process that I used when building my \\"story\\" about myself as my husband and I launched our company. She calls collections of these stories your \\"brag bag\\" - filled with \\"bragologues\\" you can recite whenever you need them - be it for a job interview, presenting to a new client, or for your quick, 30-second elevator speech. Good advice that she shares is to keep updating your \\"brag bag\\" so it's always current.Throughout the book, the author provides specific examples of creative ways people from any industry can use the evaluation to create their own custom \\"bragologue.\\"She also offers specific advice for a variety of business situations that are ripe opportunities for putting your \\"bragologue\\" to work -On the elevator with your new company president - what do you say?Networking at company events - you won't be tongue-tied wondering how to break into conversation about yourself any more!Business meetingsAround the watercoolerJob Interviews and performance reviewsAn interesting section is included on \\"techno-bragging\\" - how to brag in the 21st century when many people work virtually, face time is limited and technology is being put to use in new ways every day. I could really relate to this section, having managed a team of 10 people virtually from my home office in Minnesota for over 7 years.Not just for those working for others, Peggy's chapter on bragging when you work for yourself gave me great advice on making certain that my bragologue for our company is as compelling as it can be.Whether you are currently employed, between jobs or striking out on your own, this book offers great advice on how you can overcome your hang-ups about talking about yourself so you can promote your skills and accomplishments and achieve all of your professional goals."},{"Title":"Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"If you notice, most famous people brag about themselves--especially movie stars. This method, along with truly excelling in what you do, is what it takes to advance your present status. Look at celebrities such as George W. Bush, or any politician. They have to point out their accomplishments or they would never get elected. Is it wrong to brag? Well, the word alone has negative connotations, yet used correctly, bragging is a very useful tool. Kudos to Peggy Klaus for a book well written, and needed by so many of us wallflowers. Remember, \\"success is when preparation and luck come together\\". Bragging is an important step of preparation. Read this book. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Brag!

The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"The 5-star reviews here mystify me. I found Peggy Klaus's book \\"Brag!\\" to be borderline unreadable and completely unhelpful.It had a great title/subtitle and stellar Amazon reviews, so I figured this would be the book to help overcome my natural reluctance to tout my own achievements. Instead we have a supposed \\"communications expert\\" -- who readily admits that she feels like a fraud because she's not really a communications expert -- giving us commonsense advice that can be distilled into about five sentences. For example, the \\"12 Tooting Tips for Bragging\\" she ends the book with look like something anyone would come up with in 10 minutes when tasked with creating such a list: \\"Have a sense of humor\\" and \\"Use it all: your eyes, ears, head and heart\\" and \\"Know when to toot\\" and \\"Think about to whom you are tooting.\\" OK...The rest of the book is similar: full of trite observations and sweeping generalizations that sound like they were written by someone with not much corporate experience. Like \\"People on all rungs of the corporate ladder -- from entry level to middle manager, from heads of divisions to heads of companies, from Silicon Valley to Wall Street -- had a hard time talking about themselves.\\" Heads of Silicon Valley and Wall Street companies have a hard time talking about themselves? If you find that sentence credible, then buy this book, because there are lots of others like it in here.Don't brag too much, but let people know your accomplishments when it matters, and tell it in a quick story they'll remember. That's what this book takes 200 pages to say. I've never seen such an obviously bad book get such high ratings on Amazon."},{"Title":"Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"Brag to many of you would be considered a four letter word that is considered not one you want to be associated with. But take a look at the full title before you start to judge.The great thing about this book is that it's all established from a point of authenticity, very much like the personal branding approach. It is not about being BRASH or BOASTFUL , in the current climate you can probably not afford to be those either.If a company has not made any downsizing announcements yet, you can be 99.9% sure that the senior team have had those discussions. The conversation that is included in that is looking at an employees value to the organization.The harsh reality of todays workplace and career management in general is that you cannot rely on others to keep an watchful eye over your career - they are too concerned with their own and after all you know yourself best and what you are good at.Enter some of the great suggestions from the BRAG! book. This book is one of my recommended reads for those looking in to the whole concept of personal branding and if that type of approach sits comfortably with them, it's a start , by no means a definitive piece but a good start. What I really like about this book is that it has some great suggestions for people in just about every eventuality - even if you are not working or looking to return to the workforce.Start off by looking at the \\"Take 12\\" Self Evaluation - which can actually be downloaded from the book's related web site. This evaluation gets you to look at what you have done in terms of development, are good at, known for and remembered.This is the basis for formulating your 'brag bites' and 'bragalogues' - sound bites or taglines and mini elevator speeches that can be used at various 'bragging' opportunities with different target audiences.A shortfall of the book (or at least my copy!) is that because it was published in 2003 it is a way behind the times with regards to the advances in social networking etc. The Techno-Brag certainly needs updating - but makes some good solid points about having a clear plan.For those of you in more active job search the book is also relevant and has a chapter devoted to the Job Interview and bragging your way in the door . Also speaks my language in not relying on the resume to do the talking for you - Peggy Klaus talks about once you are in the door - I believe this has equal merit well before that too.And for those happy where they are and looking to get along internally the chapter around Performance Reviews is also another good example of using the brag to great effect.A quick pick up and read book, likely can be finished in a couple of evenings - after all how many more series of Survivor or 24 are going to be that different?At least this book will give you some practical skills and ideas that apply to the real world - not those of fiction or reality TV."},{"Title":"Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"If you are even slightly inhibited about self-promotion, I highly recommend taking Peggy's course on \\"bragging,\\" if ever given the opportunity. Not only will you learn to push the envelope, but you'll also get to jump around and scream and shout a little. (Much fun during long conferences where most presenters just talk at you.) However, one thing that can't be fit into a single workshop is how and when to \\"brag\\" appropriately. But, that's a good reason to also read her book even if you took the course! She has fabulous examples of appropriate and inappropriate bragging woven throughout the entire book. Realistic scenarios (sitting on an airplane, making a cold call, etc.) make this a useful guide for anyone trying to build a \\"bragalogue.\\""},{"Title":"Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"I never write product reviews, but felt compelled to for this book because it was so disappointing. The book suffers from two fatal flaws. First, fully 50% of it is anecdotal fluff. While that is not an uncommon approach to business books that need to fill pages and maybe provide helpful examples, this book only does the former. Second, the specific advice it offers elsewhere consists of unhelpful, general platitudes you already know (e.g., be your best self!). To illustrate that, the following is the point of one of the smaller subsections:\\"... [interpersonal communication] goes like this: You acknowledge someone, she acknowledges you. You say something, she listens and says something back to [sic]. You listen and respond, perhaps posing a question; the other person listens and says something back to you. And the cycle repeats - you have conversation!\\"To reiterate, that was the main point of that subsection, not just filler (which would be egregious enough for its level of condescension for its audience).Basically the book boils down to the premise that you should be conscious about marketing yourself and you should have a few stock phrases or saying that you have worked out ahead of time to help you do it more efficiently. That is helpful advice to be sure, but you can read that sentence and save yourself the time and money because beyond that advice there is really nothing here."},{"Title":"Brag!

She told the story of how in a former job everybody in her department was required to read it and how much she recommended the book. I'm already a pretty shameless self-promoter who is very confident but I figured I could learn a little about the \\"not blowing it\\" part. The book explains why making the numbers is simply not enough, and you have to make sure you brag about them in a way that gets your name out in front of the right people without sounding like you're being a jackass. I think this is essential reading for anybody in the business world, especially those who are naturally shy and might be getting overlooked even though they're doing a killer job."},{"Title":"Brag!

For those who say that it is simply a collection of stories, I guess my only response to that would be that everyone learns in different ways. Personally, if I am learning how to relate to others in a way that is not offensive, I would like to hear stories so that I can relate the experience to others I have had and identify it in action.

The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"It's true...if I ever boasted for even a nanosecond my mother always said, \\"Honey, don't brag - it's RUDE.\\" After hearing this motherly mantra for a quarter century, it was an arduous task to reverse the trend. Oddly enough - it was my mother who suggested I read Brag 'so I could get ahead at work'! Simply put, this book changed the way I looked at self promotion in and out of the office. I've taken every word on every page to heart, and I continue to use this book as a reference year after year.A few of my favorite lessons from Peggy Klaus include: (1)Don't wait until your performance review to let your boss know why you're great at what you do, (2) Don't just sit there and wait for your hard work and results to get you noticed, (3) Remind yourself of 3 things every morning on the way to work: your name (easy enough), your title/what you do and what you are working on right now AND how it makes a difference to your company, (4)Write down the 10 most interesting things that have happened to you and weave them into your \\"bragologue\\", (5) Don't just assume people know you b/c you've worked together for years...introduce yourself!, (6)Don't succumb to the peer pressure against 'kissing up to the boss' - Who cares what they think? Put yourself out there! (7) While in an interview, don't let your resume 'speak for you' - tell your own stories and liven them up with your 'brag bites', (8) Above all, back up your 'style with substance' - you could be an excellent self promoter, but if you don't really pack the punch...you'll be all washed up."},{"Title":"Brag! The Art of Tooting Your Own Horn Without Blowing It","review":"Webster's defines brag as : to talk boastfully : engage in self-glorification. Yet the author says, \\"Bragging in my book is subtle ...\\"(P.5). Subtle bragging! It doesn't exist! So this book is not about bragging, because everyone hates a braggart. This is a book about communicating, by an author who refuses to admit to the inappropriateness of the title. She just used that to get your attention, and is ashamed enough that she keeps spinning the \\"brag\\" theme all through a book that has nothing to do with bragging.This book is targeted at people who lack confidence (as I did at the time I bought it). Lack of confidence is the problem, and this book will do nothing to help you fix that. This book is peripheral. The answer is to develop great skills and deal with your emotional issues. If you do those two things, you will communicate assuredness. People will try to hire you everywhere you are communicating with someone (at work, in coffee shops, on buses and trains - you name it) and this book will look like a complete waste of your time.Books like this exist to help the career of the author, not to help you. When an author can write something like, \\"This is the bragologue she developed to zap the zinger: ...\\"(P.103), it should ring bells in your mind about the author's ability to give you something of value.And more bells should ring on page 120. \\"The worse thing you can do ...\\". \\"And to my fabulous copyeditor, Anne Montague, thank you for your sharp eye ...\\" (Acknowledgements). + \\"... this first-time author riddled with literary insecurities.\\" With good reason."},{"Title":"Brag!

If you have studied up on this subject before than this book may not prove to be all that ground breaking. If not, then you should definitely pick it up as it covers a very important topic in the business world and provides valuable nuggets sprinkled throughout.I didn't care all that much for the format which was essentially a bunch of stories of other people, which is all nice and dandy but I could have analyzed the same stories and concluded everything on my own without her interpretations but I am still not quite so sure about how to convey my own success.

Both are farmer's wives in Iowa, but that is where the similarities end. Nance's affair with Burton leads to an accidental shooting of Arlene's husband Harvey. Arlene moves back to South Dakota and sells the farm to Burton. Years later, her son is wounded by a trap gun set at the old place by Burton and criminal and civil lawsuits ensue which test the women and their friendship and further twist the lives of all involved. Nance must come to terms with her life and realize she MUST deal with things.Nance is an idiot. Her whining to Arlene is pathetic and the lack of sensitivity to Arlene's situation is ridiculous. Equally ridiculous is the martyr role Arlene takes on. Her husband is killed and her only son maimed due to a woman's actions - why would she even bother to maintain contact? Harvey is a ridiculously one-dimensional character and Burton is a stereotypical Vietnam vet. I almost hoped they would lost heir farm and wind-up divorced in the end, which I am sure is not what the author wanted the reader to feel!"},{"Title":"The World Still Melting","review":"In 1980s Iowa farm country, Harvey and Nancy Riker, Burton Stone, and Paul and Arlene Tobler are neighbors. Harvey abuses Nancy who finds first solace and then love with former Nam veteran Burton. When Harvey learns of their affair, he gets a gun to kill Burton, but instead murders Paul for being a Good Samaritan by trying to stop the violence before it happens. While the grieving widow Arlene returns to her family in South Dakota, Harvey goes to prison and Nancy and Burton marry.When vagrants use the vacated Tobler home as a shelter, Burton becomes upset feeling these break-ins is blasphemy and a reminder of the cost to his friends of his happiness. He fixes a shotgun to the door so when someone opens the weapon fires at them to scare them away. Arlene's adult son Peter opens the booby trapped door only to take a shot into his knee, shattering the joint. With Harvey cheerleading Peter on, he sues Burton.THE WORLD STILL MELTING looks closely at the relationships between farmers and the land and between the farm families. The story line is a combination of a soap opera with the Grapes of Wrath battle against nature, the government and the bank. When the tale stays with farmer vs. the environment (natural and man-made), Robley Wilson cleverly uses the past to provides a well written SPLENDID OMEN of what could reoccur in the future. However, when the plot concentrates on the dysfunctional relationships, readers ask why soap up the farm.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Combat Flight Simulator 3: Sybex Official Strategies & Secrets","review":"GREAT GAME, TO FLY AND HAVE FUN AND DOGFIGHTING ON THE INTERNET IS GREAT.

Reason being when there is only one event throughout the entire book, the book becomes uneventful. He did a great job with details, but it was redundant in most areas. The Old Man and the Sea was the most boring book I've ever read.Throughout the story, Santiago becomes a very lonely man. For example, he is constantly talking about how he misses the boy and wishes he was there. The boy is his only true friend and because of this, he is lonely without him. Santiago would probably be a normal guy if the boy was there. Also, Santiago talks to the animals around him. Talking to animals helps keep him occupied and not so lonely. Plus, he never has to argue with them because he knows he will be right. Believe it or not, that's only part of the boringness.All the story talks about is how Santiago doesn't catch his fish. Between ten pages after the story begins and up until ten pages before the ending, all the story talks about is how Santiago doesn't catch his fish. That's the biggest waste of 127 pages in the entire universe. If there were more characters, maybe it would have kept my attention. The only other character is Manolin, a young boy. He also has no friends other than Santiago. This is because he is a little nerd. Next time this book comes up in discussion, I'm leaving the room.The old man and the sea was the worst book I've ever read. It was dull which made it seem very long and drawn out. It talks the whole time about Santiago's loneliness and his crazed fishing incidents. I do not suggest reading this book to anyone.

I think not! Although a couple nearly interesting things happened, through out the majority of the book there was nothing to keep my attention. Had I slept through the reading, I wouldn't have missed a thing. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you lack a personality completely.Every single aspect of the plot was stale. After all, only two exciting things happened. Even in those \\"action\\" scenes nothing really caught any attention. The setting didn't even change except at the very beginning and the very end. Beyond that, the very few characters didn't even do much. His actions only portray certain aspects, leaving much of his personality blank, and making him shallow and predictable. That's just why it was boring on it's own.It was also boring because it didn't relate to the experiences of many readers. After all, how many people have gone marlin fishing? Very few to be sure. The size, style, characters, and plot of the book seem simplistic and geared towards a younger audience. The actions, though, are the things that adults would be the only, if them, group interested in. Yet The Old Man was the only developed character. He was very hard to relate to and seemed to make nonsense decisions. The Old Man was so simple, he seemed to fake to care for. When a novel is hard to relate to, it's hard to get into also.With so many things wrong with the book, I never cease to be amazed by people enjoying this book. Nothing changes, very little happens, and it's more of a folk tale then novel. I would never recommend this book for anyone!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A joke. That's what I think about The Old Man and the Sea getting a Pulitzer Prize. I can not comprehend what the Pulitzer Committee was thinking when they gave this book a prize. The Old Man and the Sea is a redundant book full of hum drum that is not worth 127 pages of anyone's time.This book did not deserve a Pulitzer Prize for the book lacked excitement and plot. For example, Santiago does a ton of work and does not succeed. The Climax of this book is a major let down which makes the reader regret reading it in the first place. Since the climax is poor that also forces the plot of the story to go downhill. Another example is that this book was written at a low reading level. This is a big part of why I can't see why this book got one of the highest awards in history. Sure the book probably got the prize for the theme or the symbolizing the author put in it, but these are not very strong in my opinion. Any younger kid could have written a book like this. The Old Man and the Sea is not worthy of its award.Repetitiveness makes a book extremely... For example, Santiago always says \\"I wish the boy were here\\" (48, 50, 51, 56). By saying this over and over this book gets old. Half of this book is unnecessary because it is so repetitive. Another example is; he often says that he \\"must eat the tuna in the morning\\" (57, 58, 59). This happens several times in the book and the book becomes tremendously dull. Tediousness makes any piece of writing uninteresting. And this book is exceptionally uninteresting and tedious. All together this book is quite redundant.I did not find this book entertaining, pleasurable, or enjoyable. This book definitely did not deserve any prizes at all. All in all, The Old Man and the Sea is a redundant book full of hum drum that is not worth 127 pages of anyone's time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old man and the Sea is a story about a lonely unlucky old man who never loses his faith even thought he has not caught a fish in over 80 days. Even thought his fishing partner, Manolin, was ordered by his parents to leave the old man, Santiago Still continues to fish. And then one day while he is out fishing the amazing happens, he catches that one dream fish. The Old man and the Sea does not deserve the praise and adoration it gets. This book deserves to be cast adrift from the landmass of literary works.The Plot of this story is slow and dull with little action. In this book action is like a slug slowly climbing up a steep hill, it takes for ever and ever to get to the top. For Instance, when action comes it drags on and on. Action in this book is like running backwards; it takes forever to get anywhere..."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemmingway is it a captivating and relentless story? Or is it an uneventful, praise-seeking, fishing tale? Santiago, the protagonist of the book, is an old, unlucky fisherman. After 84 days without catching a fish, he goes farther out to sea than ever before. He then catches a marlin as large as his skiff. Exciting, isn't it? Not particularly. The Old Man and the Sea is a boring and difficult book to get through.The lack of events is capable of putting the reader to sleep. For example, the most exciting event was when Santiago caught the fish. This book is mostly a hundred pages of an insane man's dull thoughts. When something actually happens, the moment is short-lived. In addition to having only one \\"thrilling\\" event, the book has repetitive and mind numbingly pointless dialogue. Santiago often talks to himself, like when his hand cramped he said, \\"Come on hand. Please come on.\\" (62) He also talks to the fish, trying to tell it what to do. \\"...I'll let him eat it well... Eat it well.\\" (44) One or two events and boring dialogue leads the readers to dreamland.This tiresome reading seems to be fishing for compliments. Hemingway tries to make the reader feel pity for the old man. For instance, Santiago puts himself through so much pain. It is his own stubborn attitude that causes his agony. In addition to putting himself through pain, he is very tired, weather-beaten and sore. He is old and cannot handle this \\"feat\\". He has been out to sea for a few long and uneventful days. Is the wear and tear worth the pity?The Old Man and the Sea is a bad book to read due to being a dull-as-dirt book begging for compliments. It took a lot to keep reading and finish it. It is short and simple, but so incredibly uninteresting. My suggestion is to just keep reading Harry Potter."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book, Old Man and the Sea, is so immensely unbelievable it isn't even funny. Exhibit A: it says in the book that the marlin was longer than the skiff. Come on, sometimes it takes 2 people to handle a good size shark. On another note, how is it possible for a single old man to hold onto fish that size for that duration of time?Then there are many paragraphs were he goes on and on about how he is sorry for hooking the fish. If you are that sorry for hooking that fish let the thing go. I mean, if you are that torn up about it, then better you live and let it go than get killed adn catch the biggest fish ever.I mean thats just my opinion. Well thanks for reading my review. Many of Hemmingway's other works are good. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"How can a book with excellent characterization be an uninteresting novel with no realistic thoughts or adventures? The author does not clearly explain mandatory parts in the book that are truly needed to make the book a success. I would not recommend this book to anyone that wants to read an exciting and realistic book that is very descriptive and relays the thoughts of the protagonist.The main character in this novel is not exposed to a consistent amount of realistic conditions or events that would in reality take place. For instance, the protagonist goes out and is pulled around by a fish for four days. Santiago should go out and take control of the fish, so he can go home and be rewarded for his great catch. Santiago does not show that he deserves the fish. He should be strong and wise about his actions. Furthermore, Santiago goes out unprepared, with just his boat, not expecting anything. Santiago does not sleep for hours, thus causing severe exhaustion, which lowers the overall possibility of catching the fish. When Santiago's hand cramps, the only thing he does is talk to it, and he does not try reviving it by other conventional methods. The problems that persist and the treacheries that he overcomes does not allow an overall clear understanding of the plot, theme, or other critical elements that arise in the conflict of the story.This book does not reflect the author's overall knowledge about the subject of this novel. Truly, Santiago goes out and catches a fish that he then follows through the water. The very large fish does not allow more action to enter the story. The author does not reflect the major thoughts or actions put our by the protagonist (Santiago) which makes the story dull and uninteresting. Likewise, the characters do not add much action to the story. The protagonist does not have any extremely exciting experiences or battles that could twist the ending, and thus the plot is very predictable. The parts in this story that are not extremely boring do not add up to much, because the author does not use many metaphors to relate the story to any actual experiences. The plot and characters make the story dull because they do not add any suspense to the story.This book should not be read by anyone. This truly shows Hemmingway's weakness as a writer. The protagonist does not prove to have any common sense at all and he may be going insane. This book proved to be an overall failure because it did not add up to my expectations as a reader."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway really tells a great story and uses fantastic / simple language to do so much in this story.I really like the microcosm of the fisherman's battle as a symbol of life. This story speaks to the reader on so many levels.At the lowest level, it is a great story about a fisherman who is down on his luck and must strive against nature to find out whether or not he is just all washed up. At the highest level, it is the story of everyman who strives to do his best in life.A great story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is excellent. Its about a very skilledold fisherman that lives in a fishing village in Cuba, and he doesn't have any luck for eighty-four days. On the eighty-fifth day, he goes out and fishes and catches a huge marlin. Since the fish is so big, the fish takes him out to the middle of the ocean for a ride. This is one of Ernest Hemmingways best books. He won a Putlizer Prize in fiction for Old Man and the Sea in 1953. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is one of those rare novels that a fan can read and re-read every few years without any loss of enthusiasm. The story is a simple yet profound one about struggle, loss, and the human condition.

It's short, the language is simple and terse, so there's no excuse. It's a great read for all ages. I found the story fascinating, as an old fisherman takes his small boat into the big sea and tries to catch himself a big fish.

The book keeps you on the edge of your sit and keeps your attention throughout the entire story. While at times the story may seem a bit boring and repetitive, it has a wonderful message to whoever is reading it, to always be brave and persistent and it might pay off.People enjoy or dislike reading the book, The Old Man and the Sea, for many different reasons. Some individuals would say that Hemingway's novel was to low of a reading level and they would question how the story won various awards. The people who believe the book is bad they have their own opinion on why they feel that way. One of their biggest reasons why they dislike the book, The Old Man and the Sea, is because of the lack of problems or characters in the story. Another cause of people not liking the story was possibly the choice of words in which case were extremely easy small words that an elementary student could probably define in detail. On the other hand, there are individuals who believe this book deserved the awards it received and that it was an excellent work of fiction. A reason why some might perhaps enjoy reading the book is because the amazing smooth flow of the story from one paragraph to another with exceptional sentence fluency. This story can also be considered great by some because of its plot. In some cases the plot was fantastic and sometimes it was quite dull but overall an exceptional main idea and plot. In my perspective this novel was a bit overrated in a number of ways. I enjoyed the persistence factors of Santiago but some parts of the book were too crazy and unimaginable to understand at all.Several might agree with me when I say the plot of The Old Man and the Sea was pretty good. The story was basically about persistence, bravery, and courage among other things. Santiago and Manolin were the only real main characters. Santiago was an unrelenting fisherman and Manolin was a caring young boy. The main problems which they face were not getting any good big fish when they want to and the dangerous encounter with the vicious sharks in the Gulf of Mexico. The two are separated for some time while Manolin is home and Santiago is on the open sea. But with persistence and gallantry Santiago received what he dreamed of getting which was the biggest fish he has ever caught in his career. My favorite character was Santiago because the way he responded to not catching the big one and then when he did he knew that the hard work and patience was worth it. I could not relate to the main idea in this novel because I have never yet experienced such an event. Santiago is so much unlike me because I am not too persistent even though I'd like to be. I somewhat enjoyed the book, mostly about how Santiago went about his problems to overcome them and live on. In my viewpoint this novel was very enjoyable but strange at some points of the story but generally an outstanding tale of man vs. fate.Just like I mentioned earlier, some people enjoyed reading The Old Man and the Sea and some people disliked reading the story. No matter who read it and how they felt about what they read everyone has different opinions. I somewhat enjoyed reading the novel but I also have reasons for why I didn't quite think it was the best book I have ever read but in my mind it's a educational story which will teach you a few things about life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaThough extremely well-written, The Old Man and the Sea is a depressing and boring story. Sometimes I read a book and love it. Sometimes I start a book and can't finish it. And sometimes I read a book and wish that I hadn't. The Old Man and the Sea is one of those \\"I wish I hadn't read that\\" books. Hemmingway, the author with the infamous depressing style of writing, has crafted a very sad story with a disappointing ending. Nevertheless, the descriptions are absolutely wonderful the author not \\"telling\\", but \\"showing\\".In example, when Santiago says that \\"he wished that he had splashed the water in the boat and made salt\\", I couldn't help but see a rickety wooden boat with finely-grained salt on one of the seats. Little facts like that pop up all over the book, astonishing the reader that they can actually see what he wanted them to see! Like when Santiago is telling the boy about the lions in Africa, Hemmingway uses such fine explanation to show everyone what he means. I saw golden-brown lions lying on a sunny beach, snoring and keeping track of their cubs by instinct. The depression is still there, yes, but Hemmingway crafts his main character so wonderfully that he seems very real to the one reading the novel. Hemmingway describes ever aspect of everything he says; a sentence can't be read without a graphic description hanging on there somewhere. He paints a picture in the reader's mind better than any artist could have done, showing off his amazing ability of storytelling that is much envied by writers all over. The character \\"Santiago\\" is an n example of Hemmingway's descriptive novel-writing.The Old Man and the Sea a sad account about the struggle between a man and his fate. For example, Santiago's struggle with the fish leaves the reader feeling anxious and sad. I found myself cracking my knuckles and wanting to scream at the old man, \\"Hurry up and pull that fish in! This is driving me crazy!\\" Hemmingway tugs with the reader's emotions and knots them up like a fishing line, causing the reader to feel exactly what Santiago is feeling. Suspense is built throughout the story, and the reader will feel discontented and apprehensive until he or she has finished it. I wouldn't read the book more than once, nor would I recommend anybody else to. One will just feel miserable and wish that they hadn't.Finally, I'd like to remind anybody who is reading this that The Old Man and the Sea is a quality novel, and worth reading-but only once. That is, unless one likes reading sad, depressing novels that you wish they'd never read, go for it. But, warning...Hemmingway will leave the reader unsatisfied with the ending and eager to know what happened to the old man. Happy reading! (Or should I say, \\"Good luck\\"?)"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Although Hemingway is still regarded as the figurehead of everything that machismo and the American concept of rugged individualism is, was, and ever could be, this book is a surprisingly poignant and realistic look at the heretofore unseen, inner world of such seemingly superhuman men. This book is also a tender and moving review, a very real summing up, of what Hemingway perhaps once was - or wanted to be. It could also be considered the ultimate fish story with an unexpected, surprisingly triumphant twist to the &quot;one-that-got-away&quot; ending.Here, Hemingway explores the true concept of a winner, and unmasks defeat. As his hero shows us, being victorious is standing strong to the bitter end, and defeat cannot exist where the spirit has not been broken.Too, Hemingway shows us that tender youth need not be synonymous with vulnerability, and we can only wonder if the young lad - so devoted in his love and care of the Old Fisherman - does not represent a shadow of Hemingway in his younger years, his other self concealed behind the granite sense of self-existence that Hemingway passed on to a whole generation.Above all, however, this is the story of a quest - of how far man can and will go to achieve his goals, and, despite having his grand prize ripped bitterly from him, of being able to come to terms with such occurrences and find rest and pride not in the prize itself, but in having taken every step of the long, hard journey that led to that goal.Here, Hemmingway comes full-circle, melding the essence of rugged manhood with the physical, emotional, and psychological vulnerability, not to mention the values and ethics, which make such strength human. In my opinion, it is the poignant highlight of his career, and this book is more Hemingway as a human than any of his previous works.Masterfully and movingly written, this work has more than esthetic value to it, however. Read it and dare yourself to be every inch as human as its heroes, and you will be all the richer for the experience.- Benjamin Gene Gardner"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"First of all, I admit I'm biased here. I am a tremendous admirer of Hemingway's writing style. The language - unbelievably minimal, declarative, free of any irrelevance - is absolutely intoxicating. This, by itself, makes Hemingway a joy to read. Every sentence is so tight, so compact, yet they all say so much and create as vivid a picture in your mind as a photograph. Hemingway's writing at its worst is amazing.However, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is one of Hemingway's finest novels, fully deserving of the Nobel Prize. The story is simple and may seem boring to some, but the beauty of the old man's struggle with the marlin is heartbreaking and encouraging at the same time. Hopelessness and full awareness of defeat are contrasted with perseverance, determination, and an unwillingness to be destroyed. &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; brings home all of mankind's failures and all of mankind's successes in every sentence.I can't recommend this book more highly. Read it and stand in awe, both at Hemingway's astonishing command over the English language and at the dignity he brings to the failed in mankind. Brilliant in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man And The Sea is a fabulous book. I greatly enjoyed reading it. I liked how the book kept a lot of things mysterious, and then told a little later or didn't tell at all. I also liked how unique this book is. I think this is a magnificent book and I would suggest it to anyone. In most books the human wins over nature, not in this book. The old man is defeated by the sharks. I would be heart broken if I lost a fish that big! Most books also have a happy,cheerful ending, I guess this book is just &quot;different&quot;, yet different is sometimes better. The mood of this book goes up and down a lot. The book starts out sad, because the old man has not caught anything in a long time.If you read this book, don,t stop there. It gets a lot better. Do not decide the mood of the book until you are finished with it, and do not judge it until you're finished."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Look--I don't really like Hemingway's style. I've read two of his books and a few of the stories, so I'm no expert, but from what I've seen, his sentence structure and diction is at a junior high school level for the most part. That's not my criticism, really, it's just his style. For his works to be worthwhile to read, then, there must be much more to the stories than the words themselves. The Sun Also Rises has more. The Old Man and the Sea does not, as far as I can tell. It is simple, but simplicity does not equal genius. Yes, of course, there is symbolism, but it is completely obvious and heavy-handed. This book is a nice parable, I guess, but it doesn't deserve the praise it's been given as one of the greatest books ever. There's just not enough substance to it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is the first Hemingway I've read and I have to say that I was disapointed. I did like the scenes with the boy and the old man but that was about it! But when he is at sea for five days I got tired of reading it and wanted to stop the book. As one reviewer said, &quot;The story line was dragged on...&quot;. That sums up exactly how I felt about the book. When I learned it won a Pulizer I was even more surpirsed. When I talked to other people they felt that he deserved a Pulizer for his other books and maybe they just gave him the Prize because they felt they needed to. I'm not sure and I'm probably wrong. To me, it seems that you either loved it, or hated it. I've talked to people who think this is the best book ever and I've talk to people who didn't like it at all."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Philip Pullman, my favorite author, once said that a lot of novels get so wrapped up in showing off beautiful writing that there's no story, and the story really should be the most important thing. I agree with him. This book seems like just an excuse for the author to explain his view of the world, and life, &amp;c, &amp;c., and the author forgets to put an interesting story in it. Luckily it doesn't get too boring because it's short. I also hate fishing, and I hated the author's writing style, which sounds like it's trying so hard to be simple and profound. The author also sounds snobbish and superior at times, and at other times like he's trying to show you, look at this character I've created, isn't he wonderful. For a novel with deep things to say and beautiful writing AND a great story, try Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This was an extremely boring book to me. I had to read it for school in 8th grade,and I almost fell asleep reading it. I think a big part of it was that as an 8th grader i didnt understand a lot of the hidden meanings of the book. I didnt like it also because it was very slow going and the end is a dissapointment to me. Also, none of my friends liked it either"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. I had to read this back in high school. In that time I struggled with reading it because it was so boring it took me almost a month to finish it. The only exciting thing in the whole book was when the sharks appeared. I cared so little for all the characters especially the old man I hoped they were going to eat the old man. But nope they ate his stupid marlin instead. When the reader is hoping for the \\"hero\\" to die your book sucks."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After reading the old man and the sea, I found myself wondering what exactly Hemingway was trying to do. At first I found it extremely hard to actually get into the book. I mean how much can you say about a fishing trip the last 84 days with no luck. I did find that i sympothized with Santiago, especially when Manolin's parents force him to leave Santiago's boat. I feel that there wasnt enough action in this book to keep my interest going. Hemingway goes into such great detail in all that he says, that i find that it gets boring. Once I had finally gotten to the 85th day of Santiago's unlucky streak, I found that I was rooting so much for him the whole time. I was much more intrigued once he caught hold of that big marlin. I continued to read because I was afraid that he would give up after all that he went through. I fell that the most exciting part is when the sharks lured by the blood of the marlin. I felt bad that Santiago didnt get to enjoy his fish, although by this point Santiago has grown so much I dont think he minds. I enjoyed how he finally did something for himself instead of trying to impress others. I enjoyed the end of the book when Manolin and Santiago see eachother once again. The end of this book gets much better, but i found it didnt compensate for the rest of the book. I would not recomend this book to anyone who seeks action thrillers."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a book of great descriptions and great symbolism. It's great to write a book report on but if you're not a Hemingway fan you probably won't enjoy it. It's a good book to see if you like Hemingway or not but not a great book otherwise. Must read for Hemingway fans, read it once just so you're familiar with it otherwise."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is the most likely of Hemingway's works to be loved in the future. Why? Because it is a classic. Why is it a classic? Because of two reasons, pertaining to content and style. In the content, the message is universal and eternal. In the style, the writing is self-contained but evocative and brilliant. Excess is entirely absent from Hemingway's craftmanship here.Santiago is an old fisherman from Cuba, a lover of baseball and contact with the sea. His life has been rather sad, lonely and lacking in material well-being. But, and this is what makes the book unforgettable, he is a MAN. Not just a brawling macho, like Hemingway himself, but a MAN in the best sense of the word. Although nobody will be witness of his prowess, he accomplishes it nonetheless. He is not abjectly trying to become a celebrity, like many people nowadays. Fishing the marlin, and carrying it home against Fate incarnated in a school of sharks, is not a matter of spotlights, but of dignity, of true love for oneself instead of plain vanity. And so, dignity is the name of the game. He is not like Hemigway, who got utterly stressed at having to go on with his fake image and so gave up and killed himself. Santiago would never kill himself: he fights on. Dignity is deep inside of him, in his consciousness of what he is worth, even if he remains a lonely old man scratching survival day after day. This is then a great book because it pairs the relevance of the story with the excellence of the writing. One last note: Hemingway is not very much liked these days, and for good reasons. But at least he could write this. Not many of us have done so and I guess it proves he was an extermely complex man, and not just a macho type."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"My fianc&eacute;e hated this book; she told me it nothing but fish and machismo - futility personified as a short novel. After absorbing the story, I cannot agree with her. While it may appear to be nothing but a fight between an old man and a big fish, it is more. It is struggle. It is pain and perseverance. It is the acknowledgment that sometimes defeats look like victories, and victories defeats.That being said, I can now also say that I am not a fan of Hemingway's choppy writing, his overly overt masculinity, or his cavalier attitudes towards death and pain. But it is worth reading, especially if you like the things do not."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There are those Hemingway fans who have read his work and love it and those \\"fans\\" who haven't read his work. In my view, the latter are the reason he won a Pulitzer Prize for this novel. It was mercifully short and fairly interesting, but not very good writing. Although I'm glad to have read Hemingway, this book serves more as a \\"check the box\\" for me rather than inspiration to read more. Sorry to disagree with all the fans out there, but this book is really just okay."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book in Chinese,and I plan to read it in English again.(Maybe something that I am writting is not good translation from Chinese to English)I think the best way to understand a novel is to read it in its original language.Hemingway is one of my favorite authors.I like his style.&quot;Less is more.&quot;He uses the words that are not hard for me to understand,and they express his thoughts as well as the big words.In The Old Man and the Sea,Hemingway tells us a story about an old fisherman's experience on the sea.The part I like best is after the old man's way home after he finally catches the big fish,but he doesn't have enough strength to protect his victory from the sharks.He is all tried thirsty and hungry.Unfortunately,the sharks eat his fish bit by bit.So when he gets home,the fresh of the fish is gone,only the bone left there.Hemingway uses symbols a lot.For example,the old man's dreams of lions play on the beach represent the old man's youth and power.The old man is a hero that Hemingway creates successfully."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book at one go at a local bookshop. It's bad that I did it but how could one stop reading when one's heart is captured the first instance one lay one's eyes on the first sentence of the book? Pausing will only result in breaking the feel the book gives me and to continue later will not give me back the same feeling. I know that.This book is about an old Cuban fisherman, yes. But to me it is much more than that. It's about how one struggles in life just to live and also at the same time how one could appreciate what one has and treasure the pleasures that one is lucky to be bestowed from time to time. It's also about determination and perseverance, of how one should never let go without a good fight. For those who has been a warrior, this book will ring deep in the heart.The prose that Hemingway employ is extremely simple yet beautiful. Conveying beautiful messages in simple sentences is not easy but in this little novella, one can see ample demonstration on how a master of prose employs it so elegantly. Read it and feel good about it. If you're as unlucky as the old man one day, this book will surely be your best companion as it is as real and as good as it can get."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I, like many, have laboured my way through a number of books that are hailed as modern classics and have been left wondering why they are acclaimed as such. Therefore, it was with some degree of trepidation that I began reading the tale of Santiago, the ancient Cuban fisherman. Do not be put off by critics eager to impress upon you how they grappled with the religious symbolism and spiritual undercurrent. Instead Hemingway's crisp, clear style will have you loosening your collar as you bake in the hot sun on the Old Man's boat. In this slim volume you share in Santiago's recollections, friendships, joys and his frustration. Despite the brevity of this book, it is a must for anyone who wishes to enjoy one of the ultimate displays of power through the written word."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of my all-time favorites. I love the contrast between the simplistic writing style and the deep message that Hemingway sends. I believe The Old Man and the Sea is about much more than an old man and his fishing tale. The Old Man and the Sea is a story about life and the victories and struggles it entails. Around the bend, after every defeat is a victory waiting to be tasted, and then another defeat will follow, and so on and so forth - the story of life. I first read this book over three years ago and I still find my mind wondering back to it every now and then. When I am faced with challenges and struggles, I think back to The Old Man, and I am reminded -- it is life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a slim book full of moves that hit you without your lifting a hand to defend yourself.The old man goes out to sea, catches the biggest fish out there, and brings it back lashed to the side of his boat. On the way in, the sharks attack the dead fish and leave only the skeleton. He thinks of Joe DiMaggio.A simple story full of feints and jabs.The words are mostly one syllable. The paragraphs are spare and lean.I have gone out to sea and caught the biggest fish out there. You have all gone out and caught the big one also: the big promotion, the fastest computer, the biggest SUV, the big house on the big lot. We have all been there.We have each of us chased and caught the thing we were chasing.Keeping the damn thing is another story: your new staff has loyalties to the boss you just replaced; the computer crashes; the SUV takes so much money to keep; and the house needs maintence. Little by little, the sharks start nibbling at your prize.Only the heroes rest. The sharks stay away from heroes. The sharks just circle the hero at a safe distance.This book is not a story about a fish. The book is really about the fighter, who moves and feints then jabs at the sharks closing in on him.After you have read this little book, forget about the fish. The fish is gone. They ate it. Just think of all the other things the book is really about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Reading once again 'Old Man And The Sea' by Ernest Hemingway was simply a joyful reading experience that will stay with me for a very long time. The writing is eloquent yet raw. The reader experience humble yet filled with sheer power. The connectivity is filled with singularity yet there is a sense of one with the universe.There is of course so much that has been written and said about 'Old Man And The Sea' that I will not write a commentary about this marvelous book's movement; however, what I will say is this: there are books that are indeed worth returning to since they have a timelessness to the story, and, as the reader's own life experience grows, so too does the appreciation and understandings of the written story. In this compelling book, I have found that the meaning of this story so powerful and connected to my soul in few ways a book ever has.Do yourself a favor, go pick up 'Old Man And The Sea' and enjoy yourself. Though you may be holding a paperbook in your hand, you may soon come to realize your actually holding a mirrow, and you're peering into your own life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago, a fisherman, has gone 85 days without catching anything, not even a tadpole. But he knows that his luck is about to change. For last time, he went for 87 days without catching a single thing, and came back with a huge fish. This time, he believes his luck will be the best ever. So, come early morning, before the sun has risen, Santiago hops aboard a tiny fishing boat with his supplies, and sets out towards the middle of the sea. He fishes for hours without even the tiniest bite, until he feels something. Not a small something, but a great, big, giant something, tugging on the end of his line. So begins the fight betwen the old man and the sea. Santiago spends all day and night trying to reel the fish in, to no avail. When the fish finally does calm down, the sharks begin surrounding him, and Santiago is forced to try and make his way back to shore, before they have the chance to grab him or his fish.As an avid reader, my mother thought I would be interested in trying Hemingway's THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, so she bought it for me for Christmas. Until now, I didn't have time to read the short novella, but I am happy that I finally had the chance to do so, as I enjoyed Hemingway's lyrical writing very much. The characters found within the pages of THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA are enjoyable, and bring the story to life. Santiago is a brave old man, who is determined to battle the sea, in the hopes that he will have the strength to bring home one of the largest fish ever; while \\"the boy\\" is kind, and does anything in his power to make Santiago feel good about himself.

Hemingway was at his shining best when he wrote about the fearless old man, Santiago, and the epic personal battle with a hooked marlin. Here, unlike in Melville's Moby Dick, Hemingway's main character is both at odds with himself while seemingly being at peace with the natural world. Many time he describes the marlin as his &quot;brother.&quot; Hemingway is also a master of unconcious symbolic gestures. Many times the old man describes his wish for a young man to help him with the tasks aboard his small skiff. There is a young male character who had fished the ocean prior to the start of the text with Santiago, but if the reader has read such books as Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises and Farewell to Arms one would interprate this as another one of Hemingway's symbolic loopholes that leads us to a further understanding of the intristic nature of Santiago. In simple terms, The Old Man in the Sea examines the search for youth through the experiences of an old Cuban fisherman who examines his life while praising DiMaggio and cursing his lack of strength.

He finally caught the fish it is bigger then the boat. Then when he is taking it home the fish is bleeding and it starts to be attracted by sharks. The old man fought them off but they end up getting a bit. Then on the way home keep saying that he shouldn't have gone so far out. He also apologizes to the fish for that.

I understand all of the religious imagery, and all of the symbols with the mast, and everything, but this book really sucked! But, I dont really think that it deserves 1 star.

To tell you the truth that is about the only thing I find good about it. The many allegories and ways to interpret it left me completly confused. The over all theme was a cute idea, an old man and the love for the sea and the boy, but I think it could have been written in a better way. Like I said it was short which is a definate plus when it comes to required reading. Maybe if I could relate to the book or the story line I would have enjoyed it more. Maybe I'll like it better when I am older."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"To put it bluntly and honest I found &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; incredibly boring. It's surprising that a short story could have such descriptive, drawn out parts. This is why the story lacked interest for me, the descriptive words took up most of the book not leaving much of a story line. Another factor for the dislike is that it's all about fishing, and since I don't like fishing the dislike is obvious. Many people say you have a look beyond the fishing for the symbolism, but considering I couldn't get into the story and that I have a very literal mind I didn't see any of that. I'm sure it was a well-written piece for those who can enjoy that sort of thing, but it wasn't my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway is a story about quiet determination in the face of insurmountable odds that would overcome a person who was not as courageous as the novel's main character, Santiago. Santiago is a fisherman who has not caught a fish in eighty-four days and is beginning to feel the effects of being fishless for so long. He is very thin and weak, and had to sell most of his fishing equipment, and someone has to give him food for him to eat. The bright spot in his life is a boy named Manolin. Manolin used to fish in the same boat with Santiago, but after forty-two days of not catching a fish the boy's parents made him switch to a luckier boat against his wishes. The boy still felt obligated to the old man in a way a son loves his father, and takes care of him, making sure he eats, and had blankets to sleep with, and that sort of thing.Hemingway creates characters with a lot of depth like Manolin; he cares for Santiago even though he doesn't have to and fishes for a lucky boat. This is indicative of Hemingway in the sense that he likes to create characters through action and dialogue and not so much from digressing commentary on the side, you only get a feel of Santiago by how he catches the fish and what he says to himself as he is catching the fish. Hemingway also uses a lot of imagery throughout the book that allows the reader to get a sense of what he is talking about without a bunch of detail that most writers of his era used. The way Hemingway describes Santiago's Cuban town and Santiago himself are both good examples of this, a line from the novel reads, \\"That afternoon there was a party of tourists at the terrace looking down at the water among beer cans and dead barracudas.\\" This line clearly gives the reader a vision of the poor and disheveled town where Santiago lives. The Old Man in the Sea also was laden with symbolism that was subtle, yet just obvious enough to catch the reader's attention. The birds Santiago sees while fishing is the best example of this as they show freedom and prosperity, two things Santiago is striving for. My favorite character was Manolin because he is very dependable and is always willing to help Santiago.The character I felt I could most relate to was Manolin, \\"the boy.\\" He would rather have stayed on the boat with Santiago regardless of whether he was catching fish or not, but his parents would not let him, and a boy must yield to his parents. My father is much the same way, making decisions for me whether I agree with them or not, but I must go along with his wishes no matter what, because he is my father. And that is how Manolin and Santiago both feel, that Manolin must agree to his father's wishes simply because he's his father. Hemingway does this a lot; he creates characters the \\"every day person\\" can identify with.The book, stylistically, is not appealing to me because, even though I like the short-and-to-the-point works of writers like Hunter S. Thompson, Ernest Hemingway's style leaves too much to the imagination. I like to read a book where authors try out their ability to create beautiful language and Hemingway just does not do that. But, I felt he tried to get across a good lesson in the novel, and that was to have courage. A person cannot go through life always being afraid, and Santiago was the one of the most courageous characters I have ever read. So, I like it for its message, but not for the way it was written.This novel is an easy read, and would be perfect for anyone that feels they cannot read a lot of books because the authors make it too difficult. I would also recommend this novel to people who enjoy adventure stories, because this story is one long adventure. And personally, I would recommend this book because Hemingway gives a good message in it everyone should think about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A quick comment on the amazonian editorial review, above, which states that the old man is \\"triumphant as the other fishermen marvel at the size of the skeleton.\\" Perhaps this reviewer read a different book ... there is absolutely no \\"triumph\\" or any other strain of hubris in the old man's character. Only a strong resolve and bucketloads of humility. The old man is not even around when the fishermen and tourists are \\"marvelling\\" - he's in his shack, in bed, recuperating. Maybe this reviewer never even read the book. Just up to the bit where it starts to get boring, after the old man actually hooks the fish, and then figured on a good Hollywood ending. Fair enough. Actually reading a book is a hindrance to writing a good review. Check out my only other amazonian review, on &quot;Recollections of a Bleeding Heart&quot; and see what I mean. Never even read it. Good review though, don't you think? Sure, no one has yet voted that they found my review useful. I would be very hurt if anyone did. Bleeding utilitarians. If you want to read something useful, read the instruction manual for your dvd player or something. Don't waste your valuable - sorry, useful - time reading reviews by mark coddington.But I did actually read Hemingway's novella. Sort of felt obliged. You know, when books start to reproach you each time you glance at them? I've got a 614 page biography of Arthur Miller on the bookshelf in front of me, with Arthur's face on the spine looking at me through those crazy black minimalist glasses (they never really caught on, did they?) and he knows (he knows!) that I'm never going get around to reading Timebends in this lifetime. And he's mocking me!So, this old guy hasn't caught a fish for yonks. Everyone thinks he's no good, except the boy. One day he goes out deep, hooks himself one big effoff fish. Too big to fit in the boat, he straps it alongside and by the time he brings it in, sharks have picked it clean.I mean, there you have it. Its not about spoils going to the victor. Its not about overcoming great challenges against all odds, then rubbing your detractors' noses in it. Just because The Old Man and the Sea is written by an American, doesn't mean it's about winning.The book's 127 pages long. After the old man hooks the fish, he takes 83 pages to bring the creature in. 83 pages! Of Hemingway's unrelenting and unembellished prose. Think of the most uncomfortable chair you've ever sat on. Now pick a number between one and ten. Imagine sitting on that chair for that many hours. It will start to give you some idea of what reading this book is like, particularly if you are an empathetic type like me. The cuts on the old man's hands from the line - ow! Now, multiply this number of hours by nine. If you get a two-digit number, add those numbers together, otherwise stick with what you got. Now subtract five. Just do it! (Oops, I think I've broken copyright laws. Ignore that last sentence). Next, count along that number of letters in the alphabet and think of a country starting with the letter you came to. Take the second letter of that country's name and think of the first animal that comes into your head. Got it? Now when you've finished reading this review, I'll tell you what animal that was. (And I'll bet you right now that you didn't think of a fish or an old man.) Okay, do we have a deal? But I digress. The idea of the animal kingdom provides one key to understanding this tale. Firstly, the old man constantly dreams of lions on the beach in Africa. Why? What do lions represent? I do not profess to be proficient in, or interested in, psychoanalytic approaches to literature. But the lions must represent something important to the old man, or why would Hemingway waste his valuable - sorry, useful - time by writing about it? Secondly, the old man (his name is Santiago, by the way, but is seldom referred to as anything other than \\"he\\" or \\"the old man\\", so I'll follow Ernest's lead) continually refers to the fish he has hooked as his \\"brother\\". During the old man's three day fishing marathon, he eats raw fish, as he has no other sustenance, which further emphasizes this \\"brotherhood\\". Hemingway is asking, where does man stand in relation to the animal? Then he goes a long way toward answering it: \\"I am only better than him though trickery and he meant me no harm.\\" And: \\"But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed.\\"The old man is alone, locked in a battle with both himself and the fish. Yet he identifies with the fish; he feels sorry for it: \\"I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I'm sorry about it, fish.\\" The fish's name is Alberto, but is only ever referred to as \\"fish\\" by Hemingway. In a struggle to come to terms with his own life and imminent death, the old man talks aloud to himself, asking questions both simple and profound. Death is a central motif in The Old Man and theSea, but not one I'm much interested in.Perhaps looking for motifs, and pondering their significance, is to read too much into a book. Maybe this one is just a story about a guy who catches a fish, a short parable about the food chain. Now there's an interesting question. Do Jehovah's Witnesses read all books in their literal sense, or only the Bible? Hmm. Furthermore, are there any good customer reviews of the Bible on Amazon? I'm off to have a look. Oh - before I go, I must keep my part of the deal. Was it an elephant?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a strange monologue about an old man &amp; a fish. The old man Santiago is down on his luck, having endured 85 days, without a catch. He believed that his luck will turn and continued going to sea. Indeed, his luck turned put for the better and he caught a huge Marlin, which he battles with care and respect. Finally after 3 days of struggle, he lands the Marlin with a sense of profound victory.However, on the journey back to the port, the dead Marlin was attacked and devoured by several schools of sharks, leaving a skeleton of the magnificent fish. The old man went to bed tired but without much despair.So what was the moral of the story? Your luck will turn out better if you are patient, but regardless of your attempt, you cannot avoid fate.Did I read that Hemmingway won a Nobel Literature prize on the strength of this novel? In my opinion, it was undeserving. But it was a good attempt."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is about a man who lived all of his life on the sea as a fisherman.

It has been many days since he has caught anything. Even the boy who had been helping him has been ordered by his father to work on another luckier boat. This isn't new to Santiago as he had previously gone 87 days without fish and caught plenty for many days to follow. Maybe his luck is about to turn again...It would appear that for those who found great joy in \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" found it in its allegorical aspect and the attempt by Hemingway to demonstrate a struggle of then modern man of biblical proportions. The actual story in and of itself is very simple as it relays the tale of an old man fighting the fish of his life after a long spell of bad luck.The Good: In no way am I trying to discredit Mr. Hemmingway or \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" or the merit of this book as a literary gem. Reading for me (for the most part) is about being entertained or connecting to the material in some way. I found this story to be a plodding story about a man trying to reel in a fish. I of course realize that the attempt was to demonstrate the struggle etc but as a story the book just didn't reel me in (pardon the pun).The Bad: At the opposite end of the spectrum I didn't find \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" to be a terrible read either. I just wasn't grabbed and pulled in either direction.Overall: While I feel no more than luke warm about \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" I think you should try it for yourself and see what you think. It is considered to be a literary master piece and is only slightly over 100 pages either way so it isn't a story that will demand hours of your time to complete."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ok so in all fairness I am 25 now and I read this in high school at 18, but I detested it so much that I still wont read any of Hemingway's work.

But what does the author want to tell us? What does he want to give us? Can it be validated as good or rather not valuable? It is a work of Nihilism though Hemingway\`s life maxim, which he revealed as his personal life\`s lie in the end of his life, to \\"never give up!\\" is opposing to this. The old man\`s battle for victory with the fish serves nothing even if the fight were not already the way which to go makes a sense of life. Hemingway negates this. With his suicide he devaluates his works or makes them more believable? Can somebody attribute meaning to meaninglessness? If Hemingway is right and life is meaningless, then also his works are meaningless.What should we have to believe? That life, how Hemingway thought, is senseless? For what then never give up? \\"One can be destroyed but one may never give up!\\" he lets his heroes say, who die or fail in the end nevertheless. And he himself does the same. That \\"never give up!\\" makes only sense, when it has a basis that is outside of oneself. The author never saw it that way. No matter where he turned to there was nothing to be hoped for. His works are covered by a thick layer of desperation and sinister melancholy. And beneath there is also no hope. One of his heroes says: \\"a dark way to Nowhere, which leads to Nowhere and again to Nowhere and again..\\"In \\"The old man and the Sea\\" Hemingway strikes a balance. Much tested, nothing won in the end. He regards his life like the old man who fights in solicitude with the fish on the Sea You think, you have something with the fishing rod in life yet in the end there is nothing left. The fight ends with the inescapable defeat, for the fish is caught but torn to pieces by sharks. \\"You are tired old friend!\\" he says. In this the perception of the futility of his acts is expressed. The fisher could hang the skeleton at the house front or feast over his triumph of the proper catch, but this also would be futile. Hemingway did not find any meaning there where he was looking for in his life. To search further he did not want.In his Nobel prize speech Hemingway said, that every writer of importance should have to deal with the eternity or the missing of it. But what is eternal in this world? What his father a Methodist church principal connected with eternity he rejected. Maybe because of that \\"The old man and the Sea\\" has no happy ending. And the end of Hemingway is perhaps also only a seeming end!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"For barely 100 pages long, this thing that enjoyed worldwide claim is hardly a page-turner. It is so dry and uninteresting, full of repetation, boring description. The author does lack of the ability of using dialogue to tell a story. The dialogue or monologue is, at best, pretty weak. The book is certainly over-rated. The reason that it won the Nobel Literature Prize is what it claimed politically."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Although I did find the \\"waiting for interesting things to happen\\" bit of this read to be tedious, I think that is what Hemingway was trying to portray...how much patience and tedium a fisherman must endure just for those brief moments of excitement when he \\"outwits\\" a fish. The sad irony of course is that he himself is then easily outwitted by the sharks. It is depressing how all our hard work and accomplishment can be so quickly eaten away by theives. I agree that the reading was mediocre."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"In the tradition of great Ernest Hemingway books, The Old Man and the Sea is another success. In my opinion the book was written and very descriptive. The caracter Santiago was close to being an excellent example of a Christ-like figure. The last chapter of the book you get a good comparison of Santiago to Christ on the Cross. The book really shows the similarities. Manolin was also a interesting representation of a disiple. He looked up to Santiago as Jesus' disiples had done. I would very much so recommend this book to anyone it is easy for kids to read but still entertaining enough for adults."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I found this novel exceptionally detailed. The author let you get to know Santiago without writing a complete biography. I especially liked the fact that Hemingway gave a little information about Santiago's previous adventures. The conflict with the sea was a popular subject in the years previous to the writing of this novel. Yet Hemingway introduced his readers to a new side of the sea. Santiago saw the sea as a friend that harbored a brother. The sea gave people food, and was a very peaceful place. This is totally opposite to the sea in Mellville's Moby Dick. Personally I would recomend this book for anyone to read on a rainy day."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a classic work of literature. The Old Man and the Sea was an enjoyable reading experience, because it shows the indomitable will of a determined man. The man I am talking about is Santiago, who goes through many trials and tribulations while trying to catch the fish. The Old Man and the Sea is full of symbolism. Hemingway once said, &quot;The old man is the old man, the boy is the boy, the sea is a sea, the fish is the fish, the sharks are like all other sharks no better or no worse, and the rest of the is what you get out of it.&quot; but I believe he was kidding because you can't read this book and not find any symbolism. An example of this is the fish. I believe the fish represents what all of mankind strives for but few will reach, which is greatness. Santiago reaches greatness when he defeats the fish and beats the sea. Santiago and his struggle with the fish taught me a lesson about life. It taught me that anyone can do anything, but there is always a price to pay. Santiago's price was his health and time, but to him it was worth it. He got his prize, he got what he wanted, and was happy about it. I admire that."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Once started, unputdownable.

Look, Ernest Hemingway has a different style of writing. His style is unusual, but unique and refreshing...like a breath of fresh air. He writes simply, though he doesn't always get to the point straight off. It was relaxing to read this book - there aren't any confusing sub-plots - there's also hardly any dialogue. If you want to read a classic, this is the one. The Old Man and The Sea is easy to understand and you can read it in a couple hours. There's also a soul to this novel hidden between the lines and an aura that lingers after you finish it - for me, in any case. There's as much symbolism as you want - or as little. One message of warning: You'll either love the novel, or you'll hate it - I'm sure there are a few exceptions - including myself. I thought it was good and somewhat insightful, no more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was so intense I was exhausted when I finished it but at the same time exhilarated by it's triumphant ending.

When he caught the fish I thought he was going to get the fish on the boat easily. I don't think I would try that hard to caught the fish. When he describ the fish it drew a every vivid picture in my head. I didn't think he was going to live. When he finly caught the fish I thought he was going to make it back. I think for how old he was he strong to caught large fish and not be dragged in.Seth Hahlen"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A great book but one that takes a lot of thought.

This is the capstone to his brilliant career. Besides being eloquently written in Hemingway's concise, true sentences, it is the embodyment of a lifetime of thought on the human existance. Please do not attempt to read this work if you are a simple-minded person who is too afraid to pull your head out of the sand and examine the nature of the human experience. If you do, you will probably end up saying absurd things such as, &quot;I thought it was boring.

The barren language, the lack of detail. Descriptions only go as far as colors and rarely a metaphor. What Hemmingway achieves by this technique, is by using such limited language, there is more room for the core of the story to be exposed, which is, this old mans love for the sea and fish. The old man constanly refers to great baseball player Joe DiMaggio as, The Great DiMaggio. When in actuality, what this man achieves with courage and love is bigger and greater than any baseball player's heroics. This book is a classic."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea may be one of the best all time classical novels I have ever read. Set in the Gulf Stream, Ernest Hemingway thrillingly puts the Old Man to a fierce clashing struggle between him, the Marlin and his own will. A will that Hemingway amplifies as the Old Man's determination to survive on the sea and prove to himself that he is still not too old to catch a fish. Hemingway's detail description of the Old Man's skirmishing fight with the Marlin on the sea will make you screaming with sweat. The Old Man has gone for eighty-four days without catching a fish so a little boy which follows him on every fishing attempt has been taken away by the his parents, how sad. After moments of tears, the climax part comes in where the Old Man wants to especially catch a fish for the boy and proves to the boy's parents that he still has the ability to catch even a Marlin, of course which he does. I like Hemingway's style of language which is very easy to follow, but also maintain a level of depth in the meaning. For those fishing lovers out there, this novel is perfect for your taste. Overall, this is a worthwhile book to read so I extremely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"does reading novels bore you? would you rather &quot;wait for the movie?&quot; well, if you've heard good things about &quot;the old man and the sea,&quot; but have never had the focus to read it, then you're in luck: it's in a slightly modernized film version now, and it's called &quot;city of angels,&quot; starring meg ryan and nicholas cage. crushingly tragic story lines will always have a place in our hearts. enjoy this fine novel."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I don't usually read much but I read this book really fast.

While I initially struggled through it one summer as part of my high school honor's course it wasn't until years later that I finally came to appreciate its numerous levels and nuances for what they are. Much like any book what you will take from this one is dependent on your own experiences and the authors, however here Hemingway offers up quite a bit more then you tend to find in your average paperback. Discussing life, the connection between man and nature, the relationships between people, the illusions of greatness and safety, all while touching on such key archetypal figures as destiny, nature, oppression, victory, honor, familial love, and success it is no wonder why for so many it and for so long it has been a treasured piece of American Lit.

You feel, I mean you really feel the old man's utter disappointment after many days of fishing failures. And you feel the old man's determination as he sets out again for another day certain to be a waste, but it wasn't.I recommend you take the hour or two required and read The Old Man and the Sea.

The Old Man and the Sea is a very short novel, a novella really, but it is as fine a book as any Hemingway wrote. His blunt prose is so powerful I can feel the cuts from the line on my hands. It's a simple tale of a single trip by a fisherman, but it is heavy with symbolism the inherent struggle of a man's life to gather light and thwart darkness.

Santiago's battle against the indefatigable takes us to a chilling conclusion and eternal truth: even if man feels that he has won against nature, in such a victory he has actually lost. Santiago has drowned: he has lost his pride to the sea. What will humanity lose?Read this novella again and again and again and you will always discover some new literary magic.

The details of this novel are very specific and to the point. It does not seem like Hemingway used any special techniques to try to attract the reader even more towards the novel. However, the novel was still enticing, and clear; unlike other authors, Hemingway did not keep me bewildered throughout the whole novel, and then surprised me with a bad conclusion-it was the opposite of that. I liked that Hemingway used various themes like courage, loneliness, defeat, and others. I also liked that Hemingway used very detailed descriptions of everything he talked about, and he used very simple language, comprehendible to everybody. I found the novel interesting from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Intrigued by the classics of the 20th century such as 1984, Animal Farm, and Brave New World, I decided to request Old Man And The Sea as a Christmas present and am I glad that I did. This was not my first time reading Hemingway,however, as I had read a Farewell to Arms in my sophomore year of high school and did not really enjoy it analyzing it as a book for school. The Old Man and the Sea was a different book altogether. Based in Havana, Cuba, an old fisherman sets out on an thrilling adventure to catch the biggest fish that he or any other fisherman has ever seen. After 84 days of fruitless fishing, Santiago strikes rich with an enormous Marlin and must endure spiritual, physical, and mental anguish to outlast a fish that has every bit of the strength that he does. The ending is tragic considering what Santiago went through to get the fish, however, it is a wonderful novel and my first time that I enjoyed reading Hemingway outside of a school environment.At 127 pages, I'd pick this book up right away... a short and quick novel to enjoy on any occasion.-Travis S."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I thought The Old Man and the Sea was a great short novel. I could not put this book down until I was finally finished it was just that exciting and powerful. I think this is one of the best short novels ever written. Hemmingway wrote this book as a short but influential novel. I suggest The Old Man and the Sea to all readers who like exciting, fun books that are a quick read.The first reason I thought this book was great was because of the characters. Characters like Santiago were great characters because though he is a failure as a fisherman he still has enough pride and will power to go on and continue to do what he loves knowing that one day his luck may change and he may start to catch more fish then anyone else.In my opinion perhaps the best and most significant part of this book is when Santiago has a three day fight with the largest fish he has ever encountered. I thought the old mans will and relentlessness to catch the fish was great and moving because if I had that kind of commitment in anything that I do, I think I would be much more successful.The thing I did not really like about this book is how in the end Santiago only makes it back to shore with the bones of the huge fish. The reason for this is because of the scavengers that ate the fish as he towed it back to shore on his small boat.Though I feel there is one down fall to this book I still think it is an awesome book which if you have not read yet you should do to its interesting and moving plot."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Very good short story about a man, his passions and dreams.

It is a classic Hemingway book, which I like, but it isn't his best."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I gave the book The Old Man and the Sea four stars. I gave it four stars because though I enjoyed the book, I found it boring at times and sometimes hard to follow. Although the book was sometimes boring it had great detail that made you feel as though you were right there with the old man trying to pull in the huge marlin fish. In using such vivid description he put you into the story feeling the sorrow the same sorrow for the old man that the boy felt.I suppose I found the book boring at times because I sometimes felt as though I was reading about things that had no relevance to the story. Which in turn also made it hard to follow and I would get confused. But, I kept reading because the determination of the man to catch a fish kept my interest to see if he really would get that big one he was waiting for. Hemmingway makes you become emotionally invested in the story. &quot;No one should be alone in their old age....But it is unavoidable&quot; (pg. 48) When the old man says this you feel bad for him and you hope never to become that way.The old man possess much determination he shows this by never giving up. \\"Fish...I'll stay with you until I am dead.\\" (pg.52) The old man says this during his chase of the big marlin. When he says this you can hear the determination in his voice and you know he will get this fish or die.I would recommend this book for others because although there were some parts that were boring are hard to follow it was a good book and I thought it had a great lesson behind it. Never give up. I think this lesson is proved when Hemmingway writes \\" But man is not made for defeat... a man can be destroyed but not defeated\\" (pg. 103)."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I found the book the &quot; The Old Man and The Sea &quot; written by Earnest Hemingway a pretty good book to read. I thought it was simple to read and understand.The author begins by introducing Santiago, the main character. He is an old fisherman who has be nicknamed &quot; salao &quot; meaning the worst kind of unlucky. It's been over 80 days without a single catch of a fish. A young boy Manolin helps the old man, and has great faith in him. Manolin's parents finally told him not to fish with Santiago, because the bad luck might rub off on him.One day, Santiago goes out to fish on his own. Although he s not as strong as he used to be, he believes he can still make it on his own. So out to sea he sails. He sailed out further than any other sailor has ever gone out. He gets situated and finally casts out his line. Little does the old man know that he is in for the struggle of his life and pride.Santiago has caught the marlin. It's the biggest marlin that Santiago has ever seen in his life. This marlin drags the boat for several days and nights, yet the old man refuses to let this one go. He wants everyone to know that he can do it and his luck is still on his side. At times, it seemed like the marlin was going to win. But Santiago hung in there, ate his raw fish, got his rest in when he could and beat the marlin. Now all he had to do is bring that marlin home. And the only way to bring the marlin back was to tie it to the side of the boat. The blood from the dead fish attracts sharks. So Santiago had to battle the sharks the whole way back. By the time Santiago got back to the village his prize catch was all eaten up. So he crawls back to his shack and into his be, face down, arms stretched out.I liked this book because it was a conflict between Santiago and himself. He knows he sailed out to far. He knows it would be a battle to catch and return with the fish, especially for his age. I think it's Santiago's determination that made him sail out to catch the marlin. I would say he succeeded in his unlucky streak by catching the biggest fish anyone has ever caught. The funny part is that no one saw it and he has no proof of it. But Santiago knows for himself and thats what matters."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is another work of Fiction that I put off for years to read. I enjoyed it from the first to last word. It's not genre fiction for sure. Hemingway tells one man's battle in life as it often truly occurs. The protagonist achieves his goal, but the elements of nature take the most from him. Great fiction! I think, sometimes, I see a hint of this writer's dynamic impact of simplicty within the pages of today's popular genre novels.Hell, Old Man And The Sea won a Pulitzer!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Any fisherman going eighty-seven days without a catch would be considered by many as unlucky. But when the old fisherman Santiago managed the feat not just once, but twice, he rightfully earned the dubious distinction of being outright salao-the worst form of unlucky. However, when he sets out on his eighty-fifth day for the deeper reaches of the sea he remains as determined as ever. This passion and determination beam forth from his eyes, \\"Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated\\" (10). His pride long lost, he sails on, deeper and further than ever.Perhaps he is merely fulfilling his duty to a task he was born to, or perhaps a debt owed to the unflagging loyalty of a young boy named Manolin who continues to believe and care for him. But most likely, it was Santiago's unbridled belief that la mar would once again open her arms and embrace the fisherman she had known and loved for so many years. Irregardless, Santiago sets sail hours before sunrise fatally optimistic, \\"Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready\\" (32). Santiago captures the adage that success is achieved where opportunity meets preparation. But it is this blind faith in his ability and the righteousness of the universe that blinds him to the fact that his odds are really no better than Sisyphus'.Santiago's fishing expedition begins auspiciously after catching a ten-pound tuna. It is perhaps one of life's greater ironies that man is so deceived by such a token gift that his faith is restored in himself and that of divine justice moments before it was to be thrown overboard. Yet the fisherman's years have made him quite attuned to nature as he immediately realizes the significance of a man-of-war bird circling above him. He sinks his line deep in the ocean and hooks an eighteen-foot fifteen hundred pound marlin, thus beginning an epic struggle between man and beast that would last two days.The fisherman's line wound taught and on the verge of snapping, parallels that of his physical and mental suffering. Alone and fledgling, Santiago realizes how lonely he is, and perhaps how life is more enjoyable when you have someone to share it with. Santiago says aloud, \\"I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this\\" (48). His determination is as resolute as that of the marlin, or any being of nature left desperate and bereft, \\"Fish, I'll stay with you until I am dead. He'll stay with me too, I suppose...\\" (52). Their fates have become entwined both in life and death.The fisherman realizes the sorry predicament that life has put him and all God's creatures in, \\"Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him\\" (75). Finally, the marlin weakens and Santiago is able to harpoon him. He proceeds to tie the marlin to his skiff and begins the long journey home to the Terrace. The struggle weakened the fisherman sufficiently to make his catch vulnerable to an onslaught of hungry sharks. Fending them off the best he could, his efforts were no match for the relentless number of sharks.After finally seeing the lights of his beloved Cuba in the distance, Santiago experiences a moment of clarity after reflecting on the loss of his marlin to the sharks while journeying home, \\"It is easy when you are beaten. And what beat you, he thought. Nothing, I went out too far\\" (120). He is to blame for his misfortunes. His pride led to his downfall, but presumably he is somehow a better and wiser man for taking on nature and living to tell about it. Reminiscent of Sisyphus rolling his rock up the mountain for the first time, Santiago will inevitably try again, and again will be left with nothing more than the experience that must ultimately end in failure."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Living in the Keys I felt obligated to read one of Hemingway's classics.

Perhaps Hemmingway's best novel, though it's a close call as To Have & Have Not, The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms are great too."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Great fiction engages the imagination with a vivid, moving picture, conveying what needs to be conveyed in order that the reader understand the action and take away something meaningful. Well, this short, 120 page masterpiece does just that. Without the need for anything other than this book, you will be carried away to the ocean with an old man battling for the catch of his life. And you may find out that you don't always get just what you set out to get; in fact, you may find something completely different on your chosen path. It's how you handle that journey that may distinguish yourself from the crowd. Highly recommended... - lc"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"simply outstanding.....in a world of mass produced literature it is refreshing to rediscover such a timeless classic.Hemingway has given us an illustration of ones struggle to survive our own vanities with such a simple yet profound story , the telling of which paints vivid images with such simple use of language, evoking a sense of connection which is sadly missed in today's literary offerings."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I hadn't read a Hemingway novel since I tackled \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" during my freshman year in college. And granted, to call this one a novel is a bit generous, but it won the Pulitzer (1953), so it has to be at least considered in that company.I read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" last week simply because I never had before. Somehow I escaped reading it during high school and read Dickens instead. I think that had I read this in high school, I would have found it kind of boring. Now that I have almost 20 years under my belt since high school, it's a much more meaningful book than it would have been then. What's the point of explaining symbolism to bored students? Once you're old enough, you can see the symbolism right there, because you've lived through some of the same things that the protagonist has.A great book, and well worth the 1-2 hours you'll only need to spend reading it. Santiago is an everyman, and his struggles on the sea during a 72 hour time period mirror the struggles that we all face in our lives."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a simple story with a powerful impact. It's about an old man, and, well, the sea. He goes out day after day, trying to catch a fish and comes up empty handed over and over.This book is a great read because, unlike some of Hemmingway's other books, it is not overly long. It's 'short and sweet', as people say. As is his style, Hemmingway writes in clear, reticent sentences that are packed with meaning.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Does not disappoint.

The author did a very good job using imagery because during the whole entire book I was able to picture everything in my mind. For example, in the part were Santiago is fighting for what he wants I could feel his emotions. One thing that made me love this book was the theme, which is so aspiring because it teaches you determination and how to endure pain and it also shows you how anything is possible. I really recommend this book who loves to read for the reason being that it can relate to almost anyone because every human being has come to a situation were there just about to give up. Ofcourse you would have to read this book for your self and I guarantee that you wouldn't resist buying it.E.T."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What can you say about this book that hasn't been said a thousand times?You could take this novella at face value or you could read as deep into it as the marlin dives and I think you would have an equally good time.Laced with bold imagery and brilliant words this book is one I look forward to reading to my children."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I enjoyed this book, and I enjoyed a lot how the book is short, but has an enjoyable storyline. The book starts off with this old man called Santiago and this little boy named Manolin spending some time together talking about how he's due for a catch.The main plot about this book is the old man and a battle he has out at sea with a huge fish. It doesn't sound like it, but it's a really good story. I really enjoyed how it made me worry that he was going to stay out at sea and die or something. It keeps you reading from around half way threw the book to the end. You can't help but feel bad for that old man, the way he gets beaten up by this fish he is fighting.A problem I had with the book is how it started off very very slow. I had problems keeping my attention in the book. However, it wasn't that bad, and all I needed was a quiet room in order to get my reading done.Another thing, is that the way he wrote the book was kinda annoying. He always seemed to use really short sentences, and it's semi-distracting, but nothing too serious. I could also be wrong, and the size of the sentences are actualy standard size.I recomend this book to anyone who wants a short story to read on say, a plane trip or a long bus ride. Because this book will do fine in that place. I give this book 4 stars out of 5. It missed one because I didn't like how the book was written, and it got a little bit under my nerves."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"'Meaningless! Meaningless!'says the Teacher.'Utterly meaningless!Everything is meaningless.'\\" (Ecclesiastes 1:2)Ernest Hemmingway, in this short little novel, gives us a glimpse into a meaningless life. The Old Man lives a life which has no real purpose, beyond catching fish. There is no higher goal, nothing to stive for beyond himself. This was Hemmingway's own view, and he ended up committing suicide later in life. It is a very interesting novel, which is very enjoyable, and it is nowhere near as dark as stuff by Camus.The Old Man is a very interesting character, and it is great fun to watch Hemmingway develop his character. I really enjoy Hemmingway's writings, and if you like this, I would recommend his longer book For Whom the Bell Tolls, which is much better (though that is difficult to do)."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man and The Sea\\" was Ernest Hemingway's last novel published in life. Not only did this book give him a Pulitzer Prize, but it also cinched the Nobel Prize for him, awarded in 1954. Nevertheless, critics and scholars aren't unanimous to believe that this is best work. For many, in this book, Hemingway abandoned his realistic approach.For many people this is an allegory of the writer's condition when he wrote the novella. Hemingway himself would be the \`old man' being attacked by critics on a feeding frenzy. However much some people do believe in this interpretation - and they say that Hemingway's writing were based on his life experience, so why wouldn't this be? - this would be a very small interpretation.In \\"The Old Man and the See\\", Hemingway found a middle shape that fits between his long novels and his short stories. In this novella, the writer takes his famous style to another level since he retains so much from his prose. Everything we know about his writing is there: the short and direct sentences are the best example. But in this novel the sentences aren't the only device that is short.The novella \`lacks' characters - actually, there are only two major characters and one of them is off the stage for most of the time. This is the \`old man''s show. As character he is fully developed however we don't learn much about his past, but it doesn't take too much from Hemingway to tell us who somebody is - just some tips and we know.The narrative is short and concentrates on a couple of days in the old man's life. The most dramatic moments -near the end - unfold beautifully. Throughout the book, Hemingway deals with someone struggling against defeat. The main character, Santiago, has gone eighty-four days without catching a fish. But he refuses to accept defeat: the old man sails out beyond the other fishermen in search for the biggest fish.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a short book that doesn't take to much time to be read. On the other hand, it may stay with reader long after finishing. With his power of persuasion, Hemingway has created an unforgettable tale of love for life and honor."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I'd never read any of Hemingway's works before picking this slim book up on a whim. I hesistate to pick up very famous, classic works because they can be very difficult and sometimes boring to read. If you are hesitating as well, don't. This story is simply, beatifully written. I literally could not put it down - I had to know how it ended. And after I finished I thought about it a long time - both the story and what Hemingway was trying to say through the story. No matter if you are looking for just a good read or a thought provoking work, you won't regret reading this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I consider this novel Hemingway's best. This novel is quite unlike other novels of Hemingway. As Hemingways's last novel it has only two human chracters - a boy and an old man - in stark contrast to his first novel 'The Sun Also Rises'. Yet it represents the same themes that pervade his other novels - not belonging to society and trying to vindicate yourself by taking a challenging route.The novel discusses an old fisherman's struggle with a porpoise he sympathises with and how victory proves futile but does not break the old man's dreams.In this respect it is a philosophical reflection on the meaning, negation of meaning and search for new meaning in life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"No doubts this is one of the best books written by Hemingway. That's why he was awarded by the Nobel distintion.A short novel, very enjoyable, with a full description of the human soul."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"book was in great shape,lost an old copy in hurricane andrew,just replaced it in my small collection.will be back for more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway is one of those authors who has become famous for defining a style of writing. Dostoyevsky and Dickens swam in intricate detail to the point of verbal diarrhea in their prose; by comparison with most writers, Hemingway has verbal constipation. Admittedly, the only one of his works I'd read previously was \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" (which left much to be desired), but I was dreading \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\". Stories about hunting and fishing rarely catch my interest, and that plotline, combined with the trademark less-is-more writing style, had me gritting my teeth through the first few chapters. But at the end, I actually liked this book a lot more than I thought I would.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is about a Cuban fisherman named Santiago. He has had eighty-four straight days of not catching anything, and when he sets sail on day eighty-five, he is determined to come home with a fish. Relatively early on, something large catches his hook, though it is several hours before he realizes how big of a fish he has gotten. For two days, he and the giant marlin he has snared battle it out on the open sea, both fighting for life, and, despite their mutual respect for one another, both knowing that it won't end until one or both of them dies. But Santiago catching the fish is only the beginning. He still must make it back to Cuba, through sharks and other carnivores that want nothing more than to snack on the large prize tied to the side of his boat.I know there is some symbolism in the story, but I didn't read deep enough to find anything major. To me, it was a poignant tale about the will to accomplish something, and how, despite your best efforts, that accomplishment doesn't always work out the way you want it to. When I realized that Santiago's journey back to land wouldn't go smoothly, I was saddened, because at that point, I was somewhat attached to him.After reading this novella, I think I may give Hemingway another chance. This book redeemed my faith in him, and while I don't think it ranks with other masterpieces of literature, I can see why many beleive it to."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have read this book before and of course it is a classic but for some of us on a fixed income $10.00 is too much for an e book that you can't even pass down to your family and I know from experience that the publisher S&S will tack on tax also, so Off I go to the library to get it free."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I bought this book in preparation for a visit to Cuba that included a visit to Hemmingway's home. That was 4 months ago and I still haven't finished the book.

There were many I did read, but was \\"forced\\" to as a school kid. One of them was The Old Man and the Sea. As I kid, I thought it was an \\"okay\\" story, and I sort of enjoyed the film with Spencer Tracy, too.But I recently re-read the novel and realized something had changed within myself. I could actually feel and understand the depth of Santiago, the old man, and understood his feelings about the sea, the marlin he caught, about the sharks, and about his life and the lives of others, as these things are depicted in the novelAnd, I could truly appreciate the power and beauty of Hemingway's prose in this novel. His descriptions are magnificent, and Santiago's character emerges in great depth, and the meaning of his struggle with the sea, too; all of it comes out in relatively few pages at the hand of a master.I guess it pays to re-visit some of the classics that were thrust upon us in school, but with the perspective we now have. It was an awakening for me--a realization of the power of time and maturity and how they impact on one's perceptions.A fine read it is, if you read it long ago when you were a different person.Mark Rubinstein, Author, MAD DOG HOUSE (Thunder Lake Press, October 23, 2012)"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I never fully understood Ernest Hemmingway until i got older.What a great author, you actually can feel, what he felt about himself ."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Salient and nostalgic, the dry voice of Santiago, quietly accepting and melancholy, casts a penumbra upon the most noble of professions. The weathered \\"old-man\\" might better be described as \\"seasoned\\" in his strong character as a fisherman. With vivid memory he recalls events from the past as they relate to his current struggle; a tireless tug-of-war with a sizable fish. His personal wrest may be allegorically comparable to man's plight against the perils of the sea and the ambivalence of self. Part short story, part heroic account of perseverance, the old man's confidence provokes arrogance in this classic tale of a battle not yet won. Experience as a fisherman allows him to make predictions about the environment and the behaviors of the game, these are not always fortuitous and the old man's ominous acceptance of future events can read as pessimistic. Good introduction to Hemingway, masterfully written as he captures the feeling of a summer setting."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book provides satisfying reading. Within 150 pages, one enjoys a wonderful fishing adventure story and a glimpse of a friendship between Santiago (a Cuban fisherman, El Campeon of his village in his prime, now gone old), and Manolin, a young boy who shares the love of fishing and the love of baseball with Santiago. It is artistry as Hemingway weaves words to describe scenes, dreams, thoughts and fears. The fishing adventure story -- old man in a skiff, battling to land a marlin and fending off sharks - this story by itself is well-worth the 3 hours that it takes to read the book. Then the reader is provided a bonus of Hemingway's musings on a man maintaining dignity as he get older or a man bemused with the difficulties of his day's challenge with the thought of wretchedness if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun. This book is representative of Hemingway's literary genius and is worth making required reading in high schools."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea is a very good book. All of the great detail and discriptive words, although sometimes it does seem to get boring. Well hey, that is probably because I am still young and like to keep things simple. My dad had read the book when he was young to and felt the exact same way I did, but when he read the book as an adult he liked to read and remember every single word.Now I think I would like to share some of my thoughts with you. I really liked the book the way it was excithing after the long intro duction, and the way he told with lots of detail so I was able to understand a whole lot easier. I also did feel sorry for Santiogo when he lost the fish after all of the hard work.the way the boy had to leave before he cought the fish. Well any ways it was a really good book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemmingway expresses all the feeling and detail of an old fishermans life perfectly. The fisherman is poor but carries on a happy life. And even when the fish almost took his life, he gathered up his courager and strength and succesfully caught thew greastest marlin the town had ever seen! Sadly, his great fish was devoured and destroyed by vicious sharks.

The reason is it is an adventure and I LOVE adventures. The adventure part is cool. It is about an old man and his fishing trip. He was out on the ocean for at least 84 days. On the 84th day he caught a marlin. This book is also very descriptive which is sometimes hard to understand. This author likes to make people understand that the person that suffered was very strong."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"In my opinion, The One Man And The Sea is one of the great books by Ernest Hemingway, if not in all literature. The struggle between the fish and Santiago (the fisherman) shows that humans aren't always the greater force. At the end the struggle taught him a lesson, and also thought me a lesson. It taught me that everyone struggles, but there is an end to that struggle. He had a lot of courage and determination to get the marlin. The relationship with Manolin and Santiago was a good one. Manolin was there for the old man at the end. Overall, it was a good book, and it was a pleasure to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fishing or the sea, like my uncle. I hope you read the book and enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea HemmingwayPLOT: The conflict is between a fisherman and his self-respect.

It is also nice that it is by the un-intimidating prose of Hemmingway. You don't have to worry about ending up in the never-never land of T.S. Eliot, William Faulkner &amp; Ford Maddox Ford (although visiting never-never land isn't always a bad thing).&quot;The Old Man And The Sea&quot; is an age-old struggle between man and Nature. The persona is a fisherman who spends most of his time either mulling over his lost youth or vicariously re-living the prime of his life thru the baseball exploits of Joe Dimaggio. I think it was Charles Degaulle who said that old age was a shipwreck; this story is indeed emblematic of that.At base, this is a classic story of what Joseph Campbell describes as a hero's journey. I would recommend you join the old man on his heroic quest."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I recently read this book for English class. I was really affected by it. Yes the book was short and the story simple, but it was a well told story. Hemingway is a great writer using simplistic sentences that we all can understand. I feel that he wrote this book to leave us with the poignant message that &quot;a man can be destroyed but not defeated.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway as usual deciphers a different language into English in the way it would be spoken originally... Beautifully. The story is timeless and the plot need not be retold.Hemingway explores worth in life. What is worth more; a prize or what makes one stronger in the end. What people think over what you know. Worth.The fish which leads Santiago is allegorical to faith in God. Santiago has faith but in the end, as in life, we do not always get what we want--yet we endure and become stronger because of our faith even in the event of loss.I need not even say this but--this truly is a timeless masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One doesn't have to fish to enjoy &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; by Ernest Hemingway; the story is short and told with simplicity. When reading this work one should try to imagine living the life which Santiago must endure, a hard and unsure life. Because Santiago has been down on his luck he must catch this great fish which he needs to survive and regain the respect of his peers. As the epic battle rages on, Santiago begins to feel as though the fish, a grander Marlin, is his brother. This belief makes Santiago feel guilty about finally dispatching the great animal. Though he has triumphed over the fish he still is defeated by nature.Hemingway uses several conflicts to show the theme of the novel, man versus self, man versus beast, and man versus nature. The most significant of these being man versus self. Santiago must face himself, as he has aged he feels weak and useless. He must fight this fish as he fights himself, his hands and muscles do not perform as they used to and he must be strong to overcome the fish. Santiago is in great pain and he must defeat himself to triumph over the fish. Hemingway also installs into Santiago a love for the magnificent creature. Santiago struggles to kill the fish; he is filled with guilt because he feels as though the fish and he have a bond. Hemingway is showing that the strength of man is minute when compared to that of the wild and that man must find triumph in the dark reaches of defeat."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest HemingwaySantiago, an old man who has made his living fishing from an old skiff far out in the Gulf Stream has run into some bad luck of late. It has been many days since he has caught anything. Even the boy who had been helping him has been ordered by his father to work on another luckier boat. This isn't new to Santiago as he had previously gone 87 days without fish and caught plenty for many days to follow. Maybe his luck is about to turn again...It would appear that for those who found great joy in \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" found it in its allegorical aspect and the attempt by Hemingway to demonstrate a struggle of then modern man of biblical proportions. The actual story in and of itself is very simple as it relays the tale of an old man fighting the fish of his life after a long spell of bad luck.The Good: In no way am I trying to discredit Mr. Hemmingway or \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" or the merit of this book as a literary gem. Reading for me (for the most part) is about being entertained or connecting to the material in some way. I found this story to be a plodding story about a man trying to reel in a fish. I of course realize that the attempt was to demonstrate the struggle etc but as a story the book just didn't reel me in (pardon the pun).The Bad: At the opposite end of the spectrum I didn't find \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" to be a terrible read either. I just wasn't grabbed and pulled in either direction.Overall: While I feel no more than luke warm about \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" I think you should try it for yourself and see what you think. It is considered to be a literary master piece and is only slightly over 100 pages either way so it isn't a story that will demand hours of your time to complete."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a book about a man, a fish, and the sea. Throughout the book, I couldn't help but admire the old man's, a.k.a. Santiago's, endurance, and his love for all life is staggering compared to the average human one can meet on the streets. To me, Santiago embodies the love and beauty that too many people don't display, but Santiago has more than that, he has enough for everyone the little Cuban village he lives in. The saddest part of the book, for me personally, was not that the magnificent fish Santiago caught was destroyed, but was the fact that the little boy was his only friend despite his seemingly endless love for everything. However, one friend is much better than no friends at all, and I think Santiago understands that. All in all, my only problem with this book is its shortness, but when I think about it, there really wouldn't be a good way to extend the story without taking away some of the charm.If you ever get the chance, stop and read this book. 120 or so pages may not look like much, but the lessons taught by Hemmingway in this book are some of the most important many people will ever learn."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaI've always thought of The Old Man and the Sea as Hemingway's suicide note.

One such place is when he gutted a dolphin and had his face stuck in it.The story is too short to go into detail without revealing the surprises; however it is about (you guessed it) an old fisherman, that should be over the hill, going out to sea from Cuba to catch fish.

Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book.In \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life.Of course, \\"Old Man,\\" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy.A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it.I fully recommend \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I never intended to revisit this book, but the other morning I pulled it off the shelf to read a few pages while drinking my coffee, and Hemingway's soulfully simple tale swept me away for the rest of the day. Not that it's really simple. What's amazing about this novella is how Hemingway makes it seem simple, how he weaves Christian symbolism with human/fish/bird/baseball parallelism so precisely, so delicately, so subtly. Don't let the ease of its language fool you. If you (or your teacher years back) missed the Christ-like significance of the crucified marlin gliding below Santiago's boat with his pectoral fins spread wide, then you need to read this one again."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago who hasn't caught a fish in eighty four days. A boy used to accompany him in his boat to assist him, but after the fortieth day without catching a fish, the boy's parents declared that the old man was unlucky, and made the boy go out in a different boat that wound up catching three fish the first week. The boy still loved the old man however and even after he no longer accompanied him on his boat, he still tried to look after him and lend him some assistance on the shore.One day in order to try to change his luck the old man sails out by himself beyond his normal limits to the deep sea in search of a big fish. Out beyond all the other boats and the view of the land he gets into a great battle with an 18 foot Marlin and several sharks. Several times the man has to gather his remaining strength to match his wits and will against that of the great fish. The battle becomes a kind of religious experience and in it the old man gains great respect for the fish and for life itself. He shows great courage in the face of defeat, and with it gains a personal triumph from his loss.The story is based on a true story Hemingway was told by one of his fisherman friends named Carlos when he lived in Cuba. They were having a discussion of the thrill of deep sea fishing and big game hunting. It took several years however before he actually got time to write it down and turn it into a short story. When he finally got back around to it he had to go back out deep sea fishing with his friend again several times to get the feel down just right, but I believe he captures the experience perfectly.This book was written in 1952 which was baseball's glory days, and you certainly can see it's influence in this story. Joe DiMaggio who's father was a fisherman is reverently mentioned on more than one occasion. (I wonder whether it's favorable depiction in this book has helped Baseball maintain it's tremendous popularity as a sport in Cuba to this day.)I first read this story over twenty years ago when I was in High School and loved it. When I was recently reviewing my list of books deemed to be among the best ever written, one of my daughters asked me to read it to her. It wasn't really a children's story, and was a little difficult at times to read out loud (since the main character Santiago speaks in broken English), but she appeared to love it just as much as I did. I haven't read all of them as of yet, but In my opinion I'd say this is the best story Hemingway has written out of the ones I have read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"this is one of the worst books i have ever read. if this is one of ernest hemingways best works then i do not wish o read anymore of his books. this book literally had no point."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.TWO STARS for your book Ernest! One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!

Many reknown Literary Critics have suggested that this was a metaphor for Hemingway's own battle with Depression and Alcoholism. Most biographers of Hemingway have also suggested that his drinking excesses exacerbated his Depression which is why his books are often of differing quality. Sadly Hemingway shot almost every living animal on this planet until the only thing left to shoot was himself. No doubt had he lived he would have enrolled in a Twelve Step Programme (that's the correct Australian spelling of that word by the way) for alcoholics and 28 days in Rehab just like his Grandaughter the beautiful but highly unstable Margaux Hemingway."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago, an old fisherman, is the main character in the dreadfully boring book The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway. The short, choppy sentences ruin the plot which is Santiago trying to catch a fish.If you haven't read this book yet, then don't. You're not missing anything. The main and only real conflict is that he's an old man and he hasn't caught a fish in almost 3 months.This book couldn't possibly be at all interesting.

Santagio fished for many day and only came back with the shell of his prize, but knew in his heart that he was an all around winner.

In \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", the main character Santiago learns this lesson the hard way. With the odds stacked against him Santiago overcomes a lack of proper equipment, health issues, and being attacked by sharks. One can find many life lessons in Santiago's story beyond its relevancy to fishing. Well-crafted works of literature like this can shape our world view and cause us to reflect on how themes of the story can be found in our own lives. Well-developed characters, dramatic and/or entertaining stories, and a sense of purpose which cause us to reflect on our own lives are what make works of literature like \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" great.At first glance, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" appears to be quite simply a story of one man's battle to catch the fish of a lifetime, yet in further analysis more can be found within the symbolism used in this tale. In the story, the old man Santiago has gone 84 days of fishing without catching a single fish. On the 85th day he catches what could be the biggest fish ever pulled out of the sea in the area near his home. In this example, Hemingway is showing us the value of staying the course regardless of history. This is but one example of the symbolism used here, many more lessons like this can be found within the text.The old man is an interesting character to follow because he possesses many unique qualities that readers will find likable. Down on his luck and then being outmatched by both the fish he caught and the sharks out to steal it away from him, Santiago becomes an underdog fighting to save his fish and maintain his livelihood. The drama of the situation before him and the quality of his character makes Santiago easy to root for because this underdog story has universal appeal. At some point, most of us have fought for our own livelihoods in our lives and we can see a little of ourselves in Santiago.Appealing characters not only work great for literature, they also work extremely well in real life stories we hear from people around us. Some of the best teaching and coaching is done in the form of stories of individuals facing challenging situations. These stories teach the principles of how to overcome adversity and the importance of rising to the occasion in order to come out on top. Stories also teach us how to avoid mistakes that others have made. Many times a good teacher or coach will share stories not just of triumph but also of tragedy, hoping the listener will learn valuable lessons on what situations or actions they should avoid in the future. Great story tellers find a way to intertwine both the triumphant and the tragic. This will provide balance plus make the story more believable and entertaining. In \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", Hemingway does this skillfully as Santiago triumphs over the marlin only to lose it tragically to the sharks when returning it to his village.The beauty in literature, just as it is also true in works of art, lies within the eye of the beholder. Some people will not find Hemingway's novel as fascinating as others. A reason why this is an important point to make for this essay comes from the knowledge that not everyone will agree on a story's interpretation. Thus knowing how to reach a wide audience and gain universal appeal is one of the most defining qualities of a great author or story teller. People come from a wide range of backgrounds and levels of experience, meaning one must find a way to connect with a diverse group by finding themes which touch basic emotional responses. Hemingway's story \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" succeeds in doing this because it gives the reader a lesson on the struggles of life and trying to survive even when the odds are stacked against us.In \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", Santiago's battle with the fish becomes symbolic of the battle man faces in his fight for survival. One defining element of this story is whether Santiago should let the fish go in order to save his own life. Not only is Santiago underprepared for the size of the fish he catches, he is out of water, food, and it is questionable if he possesses the endurance needed to outmuscle the fish long enough to get him to the surface, let alone pull it into his boat once it has been caught. Yet throughout the story we see how Santiago does not give up and let the fish go and the longer he fights the fish the more invested he becomes in accomplishing this task making his determination to kill the fish that much more meaningful to him.While there are certainly dozens of individual lessons one can derive from Santiago's story, the most valuable lessons appear to be:-Never give up hope that good things will happen simply because nothing has happened yet. Santiago knows there are fish in the waters he fishes in. He goes 84 days without catching a fish, yet on the 85th day he landed the biggest fish anyone in the village has ever caught showing that great things are rarely accomplished without dedication.-Do not plan what to do with a reward until the job is fully completed. When Santiago catches the marlin, he begins to plan how he will spend the money he makes from selling the fish on the market. It is at this point in the story when sharks begin to circle his boat and eventually take the fish from him piece by piece. The lesson here is that Santiago could have brought his fish ashore had he focused his attention on finishing the task at hand rather than deciding how to spend his money.-Enjoy successes in life even if they are taken from you or lost. Regardless of the fact that Santiago's dream of bringing his prized fish ashore is taken from him he does not let his loss defeat him, rather he find energy from it. In the closing paragraph of the story, Santiago finds himself once again dreaming about lions. The lion dream is symbolic for Santiago of past times, more youthful times where he was full of vibrant energy.While the aforementioned ideas certainly are valuable lessons, Hemingway's main purpose in writing this story was to inspire the reader to see that regardless of the situation one has the ability to overcome insurmountable odds with the right attitude. By failing to cave into the negative self-talk that often accompanies dire situations, individuals can find hidden strength within themselves to persevere through almost anything, even circling sharks, health issues, or a lack of proper equipment. While it is true that we often face our greatest challenges when we are least prepared and at our weakest yet Hemingway says that with the right attitude, anything is possible."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I was very interested in, what on the surface sounds like a plain story, that I finished it in one day. Typically I am a slow reader, so finishing anything in one day is rare for me.I liked the clear and concise details and descriptions. Just enough to let the reader imagine the scene without belaboring the story.The story itself had me wondering what would come next for Santiago and how he would handle it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"How dare I? How dare I criticize one of the greatest works by the Nobel laureate, Hemingway, a literary giant of the last century? How dare I criticize a great American writer who showed that the U.S.of A is more than than a land of gun-toting, tobacco chewing, spitting cowpokes? How? Because Hemingway himself would expect me to do so. If The Old and the Sea has something to teach us, then as every great teacher knows, it is to teach the next generation to be better writers.Hemingway's sentences are often long, convoluted and confusing. Take one at random \\"Each line, as thick around as a big pencil; was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over a hundred fathoms of line.\\" Take a breath.First this is 'telling', it is not 'showing'. Maybe 50 years ago readers were content to be told, but they no longer are. Second it has words that are as sin in contemporary writing - 'was'. Third it has redundancies that add nothing to the story ', if it was necessary,' These errors detract from the story. The greatest writing error is such complex sentences shove too much information into the reader's mind in one breath. The reader is forced to read again, to check he has understood. Good writing should slip effortlessly into the readers mind creating scenes, characters and emotions, like a good wine intoxicates. Writing is not to be read , it is to be seen and felt.We all know readers will forgive all manner of errors for a gripping story. Hemingway's writing is powerful. He engages the reader's empathy for the protagonist and skillfuly plots, building the pace up and down like the waves of the setting. These are the true story telling skills but Hemingway uses them to excess. Long before the story turns the corner, the ending is predictable.For the literati, The Old Man and the Sea is a classic retelling of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph snatched from the jaws of loss. But lets be candid. We can imagine Hemingway sitting in at a bar in his tropical escape, gradually getting bored by visiting tourists' stories of the fish, this big, that got away. So he told the most incredible story of the biggest one to get away, a story to end all such fishing exaggerations.Let's not be distracted by Hemingway's failure to edit, his failure to recognize darlings and kill them. Let's pay homage to one of the greatest writers and personalities of his time. Let's pay homage as Hemingway would have wanted, by emulating his skills and learning not to repeat his failings."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is an amazing (and short) novel, written by one of America's greatest authors. Recieving the Pulitzer prize, The Old Man and The Sea is similar in theme to some of Hemmingway's other well known novels (The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms) and as such will probably leave you in a morose, contemplative moodDescribing the relationship between an old man and a young boy, both of them fishers, the story takes place over a couple of days, describing a harrowing fishing adventure by the old man in his small skiff. After 84 days of not catching a single fish, Santiago sets out, alone, once more to do what he was born to do - fish. What's left to describe of the story is better done by Hemingway, and at under 100 pages the novella is accesible to almost anyone, at least on some level.Short and terse, Hemingway's style is in full swing - writing only the so called \\"tip of the iceberg\\" it is many times what Hemingway understates or doesn't say at all that is most moving and important. Dealing with issues common to the 'lost generation' Hemingway considers a the role of man in relation to nature, presenting a very different yet relatable understanding to previous generations of American writers. Human accomplishment, missfortune, and aging are all dealt with in this deeply critical novel. Indeed, one could even imagine the themes and ideas represented in this work to be as the Marlin, swimming, powerfully under the surface of the endless ocean.The publication (for the Kindle) is acceptable, but interspersed are several poorly done, and hardly acceptably drawings. These interrupt a serious and engaging text, are little more than childish illustrations and - because of the Kindle display - they interrupt the text, offsetting it with their poorly recognizable 4 gray tone lines and coloring. I'd recommend getting a paperback version, or simply being prepared to skip over these. (This is the reason for the four star rating of an otherwise 5 star novel)"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book sums up the neverending challenge and struggle of the human condition in less pages than any other book.

Do you burn books, too?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway one of the best authors of all time wrote many great classics. The old man and the sea may go down as his best. He was able to portray so many symbols in this story. For example the old man, Santiago was like Christ and his disciple was the little boy. Another symbol is the old man always dreamt about lions in on the coast of Africa, I think this resembled his strength when he was young and able to handle large jobs. The final symbol is the old man and the boy cared about nature. When the marlin was being attacked by the sharks, Santiago kept on apologizing to the fish for going to far out.Some people may not like the book because it is mainly an old man in his boat out at sea battling with a marlin.I really enjoyed this book and I fell that alot of other people would enjoy this book also. This book was so great it won Mr. Hemingway a Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of the worst books I have ever been required to read. The first chapter put me to sleep. I found the fishing examples and language hard to follow since I have no interest in fish. The one thing that I found interesting about the book is the way Ernest Hemmingway wrote it as a reflection of his life. Hemmingway, like the old man, had not had much success for a while in his career. The entire story is left free to interpret it how you wish. Fatalism takes place when the shark eats the fish, Endurance takes place when on page 64 it says &quot;He was comfortable but not suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.&quot; This book is considered to be one of Hemmingway's greatest books. With this stated I might venture to read one of his books again but not for a while. I think that this book would be far more appreciated by someone who is into deep thinking. Myself...I like the point of the story cleary stated."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I've read just about everything by Hemingway I think, but never this one. I believe in the back of my mind I was saving it; keeping it in reserve, so to speak, so that there would always be something to look forward to.But I finally picked it up. I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I was when I saw the size of the type, which is huge--like a child's book--and realized the book was only 140 pages long. I read ten pages and almost didn't pick it up again.But I did and I'm glad I did because this is really a terrific book. The plot is pretty simple: it's the story of an old Cuban fisherman who hasn't had any luck in 84 days, and finally, on the 85th, experiences the catch of his life. It is typical Hemingway: the taut prose style, thorough understanding of human emotions, plot tension, and superior knowledge of his subject matter are all here.Thematically it is also superb. The struggle of man against nature, the need we have for one another, the sad decline of all of us as we age, and our eternal hope that tomorrow will be better, no matter how awful today is, are just a few of those represented. I thought the Christ symbolism near the end was layed on a little heavy, but this is only a minor complaint. This is an excellent, moving novel.But it is simple, and Hemingway was clearly past his prime. It is remarkable that just a little more than ten years after writing the unbelievably complex For Whom the Bell Tolls, he was reduced to this. But, a good book nevertheless. Read it to your kids."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What do Saddam Hussein and the American reading public of the 1950s have in common? They both loved this book. Its easy to see how Saddam saw his own predicament in this sentimental story of an old fisherman landing and losing a legendary fish. Hemingway was not, unfortunately, a good novelist. Hemingway's best short stories are some of the finest in the English language but he doesn't seem to have been able to sustain character and plot development sufficiently to produce really good novels. Even this short novel displays Hemingway's weaknesses as a novelist. Even worse, it is sentimental beyond belief, without any of the clear-eyed irony or insight into human nature exhibited in the best short stories. This is a weeper for middle-aged men. See any of the great Nick Adams stories for comparison. While this book appears to have revived Hemingway's career, at least in terms of popular readership, it really shows the decline of Hemingway's powers."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I was looking forward to read this acclaimed book but in honesty, was just disappointed by it. Not that the writing style isn't good, not that the story isn't interesting. Yes, as many critics say, the book touches on many topics of human personalities, flaws and qualities. But when they say \\"touch on\\", that's really all it is. If you are looking for insights, for inspiration in any of these topics, I think you are better off reading Herman Hesse. So much that it's clear to me that the level of awareness that Hemingway had was quite lower than that of Hesse. Where Hemingway saw that there was more to man than his action and thoughts, Hesse saw emotions, yearning and melancholy.Perhaps 50 years ago, with the level of consciousness society had, this was a good novel. But today, the main value of this book is the details of fishing at the time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This was the book that changed my life. I read it as a young child over and over. I then put it down and later read it as a young adult. Hemmingway inspired me to become the Author I am today.

I have noticed the same styles in my new book &quot;Sunset Point.&quot; (www.lathamdoxey.com) I recommend this book to every author out there who wants to be motivated. It sure helped me!!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"For many, the thought of Ernest Hemmingway brings to mind a great author and a great read. For me, it is another story. I find his writing extremely boring and predictable. To think that this book, The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize makes the thought of writing a great read very simple. The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemmingway is a very bland and boring read without enough excitement to keep the reader captivated.The plot of the story begins with persistence and results in defeat. For example, Santiago is an old man, yet a very persistent one staying out at sea for over eighty-five days without the luck of catching a fish. From this, Santiago learns that only sometimes does persistence pay off. Going out to sea everyday with the hope of being lucky, I think Santiago deserves to catch an award winning fish. Furthermore, this man vs. fate conflict arises when Santiago goes out to sea to catch another fish. Excited by his success, he heads home reaching the only thing that unknowingly stands in his way-fate. Fate is very different for everyone, but cruel to Santiago. He must feel that his luck came back to haunt him as fate begins to set in. While Santiago tries so hard to accomplish his goal, he loses control of the fate that he regretfully must overcome.Santiago is very persistent and I can relate in many ways, but I still see the book as a lack of originality in a short story. For instance, Santiago works so hard for those eighty-five days to catch a fish and never gives up, but is still let down. I have been in many situations where there was a need for persistence and I know how he felt when he was let down. Many people of every day life need persistence when competing against another as Santiago was with fate. Furthermore, this book is simple and without detail. The repetition left me bored and I did not want to turn the page because I knew it was only going to get worse. Toward the end of the book, I felt it was too predictable and I felt there was no need to read the ending; for I already knew what would happen. Being able to relate somewhat to parts of the story made it better, yet it still lacked the complex plot and intense detail that I would have expected, knowing that it won the Pulitzer Prize.As Ernest Hemmingway's short story, The Old Man and the Sea leaves others excited and completely captivated, I sat there and as I turned the last page, I closed the book with enthusiasm; not the enthusiasm one would think when finished with a book. I was extremely relieved that at last, the end was here. I already knew how it would end and felt it was incredibly boring for a writer who has given himself such a great name. I would definitely not recommend this book to any readers who needs detail and enthusiasm to turn the page."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read the book The Old Man And The Sea by Ernest Hemingway. The main character is an old man named Santiago. He is from a Cuban village where fishing is life. He didn't catch a fish for 84 days. The man is very old and not respected. A good thing the author did was to give a hopeful ending. With all the bad luck Santiago is having something good has to come out. The problem is the man catches no fish. This means he gets no money and the people in the village find him to be a waste. The kind of people that would like this book is middle aged people. The book tells of a bond between a boy and an old man who is struggling to prove his worth anymore. The authors style was good. The book had a good lead up and was well detailed. I liked the book because it showed there was hope. The old man goes out on a 3 day fishing voyage to prove he is not bad luck. Will he come out succesful or return a useless old man? To find out the suspensful ending read The Old Man And The Sea yourself."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This novel is not my favorite, and it is not(in my opinion) my favorite Hemmingway novel; however, after reading all the worthless reviews by other high school students, I knew I had to make a comment. This novel is a brilliant story about a man's personal victory. It is also an ingeniously analogous to Jesus Christ's struggle. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I got bored the second time I read it. Did you kids even pay attention in your english classes?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Shark attacks. Hunger strikes. Desperation for food. Problems like this occur almost all of the time in Ernest Hemmingway's The Old Man and the Sea. Even though the story seems like it would be exciting, it is not the fastest of stories. The story that The Old Man and the Sea creates is slow but well written story.The story of Santiago is slow. For example, when the marlin was dragging him he kept repeating words about how he wished he had the boy, Manolin, with him and how he loved the marlin. It was so slow during these parts that I distinctly remember trying to keep myself awake. When the marlin jumped, I didn't realize the significance of it because the story was so slow and tedious. The only parts that had some real action in them were the shark attacks. I was so excited during these parts, both for Santiago and for the sharks, that I woke up most of the way. The description of the attacks was quite vivid and brought some sort of art to the destructive nature of the sharks. Even though the story was quite slow, it did have a few exciting parts that I enjoyed.The description of everything that happens is enormously creative. One of the pest descriptions of the whole book is that of the marlin. The way that Hemingway tells about the movement and color of it is captivating. I like how he \\"shows\\" the stripes on the marlins back and the sail fin that has on it's back. Santiago is also depicted very well. The way that Hemingway describes the face of Santiago is awesome. I was able to form a picture in my mind of what he looks like including the sun-burned eyes. The reason that this book won a Pulitzer Prize is obvious; it is wonderfully descriptive and well written.I love the way that Hemingway writes even if it is a bit slow. It is marvelously descriptive and has a wonderful choice of words that it to make it that way. Even though I liked the book, I would not read it again and don't plan on reading more of Hemingway's literary works. This book is very creative, but I would not want to be a writer like Hemingway."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a great easy reading book for children and adults. The author uses small and understandable words to help the reader read smoother. By doing so, it makes the story more interesting when the reader doesn't have to trouble themselves with confusing words. The author creates Santiago's character through his dialogue by using Spanish words and that he talks to himself and the animals. Though the author uses Spanish words he explains them immediately after their use. This makes this a good book in my opinion.The word choice of the author definitely increased the quality of this book. The Old Man and the Sea is a great book for the young and old readers. This is because of the authors style. Hemmingway makes the book very understandable and fun to read. The book had a good plot but being able to follow along and not get lost really helps the novel. I recommend this book to almost all ages (if you can read of course).This book is also enhanced by the authors' method of describing the story through the character. Santiago talks to himself in the story and because he does this Hemmingway uses him to describe events in the story as it happens. Santiago is also described with the character through his speech. The author uses Spanish words to show his nationality, which helps you under stand him. Though he uses Spanish words, they are immediately explained after their use. These elements put together made this story much better.The Old Man and the Sea was a great book for almost all ages. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaThe Old Man and the Sea is a great example of Ernest Hemmingway's writing. It was a great and interesting book. I liked the book The Old Man and the Sea.I thought this book was a good book. For example it had good description and sentence fluency. With the good description and sentence fluency, it made it so that the book was not boring. An example of this is \\"it is a strong full-blooded fish.\\" It had good description. Also, this was not a boring book. It was interesting and it kept my attention throughout the entire book. \\"If sharks come God pity him and me.\\" This is a great example from the book that kept my interest, and was exciting. Over all, this book was a good book that kept my attention and was not too boring.I would recommend this book to other people. For instance it is pretty easy reading. An example from the book is \\"He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came.\\" The words are easy to understand and they are not too sophisticated. This makes it easy for the littler kids, who are into reading, to understand what Hemmingway is talking about when he uses the types of words he uses in his style of writing. Also people will probably have had to read Hemmingway's books to understand his style, because his style also confused me. Some of the wording is strange. I didn't even understand it. His word choice was also pretty strange. He used words like que&igrave; va and agua mala. Overall, I think people of all ages might enjoy reading this book.I think this is a good book for people of all ages. I do recommend the book The Old Man and the Sea to people who like books that go into a lot of detail and who like short novels. Even if people haven't read his other writing they will like this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The SeaThe Old Man and The Sea was a great time altering novel by Ernest Hemingway. A story by an old, depressed mad man not afraid to speak his mind, he caught not only the attention of the young adult, but this book could also be read to little children with the exception of censorship. This is obviously one of the greatest books of our generation and others to come.Santiago (the old man) was a great Spanish fisherman striving on catching fish for money. His main goal in life is to be able to catch the one fish that will get him his riches. The old man was 84 years old without a fish. Although everyone in town mocked him and his ability to catch fish, he pursued his dream and kept trying. And he knew that one day he would in fact prove them wrong, with the help of a young boy he knew so well. The young boy is the one person with the most integrity to help out this mocked old man. He was a very brave young boy. Hemmingway made a smart choice in putting such bravery into this story of self-victory.Without the young boy, Manolin, the one person in the world who cared, the old man felt lost. The boy helped Santiago in believing in himself, and gave him the majority of self confidence he could possibly hold. The old man truly needed that young boy. He was the link to all his striving. The boy and Santiago were most inseparable, when Santiago caught even the littlest fish; the boy was there to cheer him on. The boy is a smart character because of his sense to not follow everyone in copping fun at the old man. This makes the story so much more intriguing to have a friend for the old man so that he can laugh and have fun too. This shows how even such a serious writer like Hemmingway, can, to, put a little bit of fun hidden within his writing.This story was not only one of the most easy to follow novels, but also it was fun to read and it intrigues every man, women and child with the reading ability. It was also intelligent enough for the normal person to read, not just the higher class people. This story of and old man and his dream of fishing is a true classic. A person wouldn't think to look at it or just read a page, but to know so many people liked it; there can't be a single person with simple intelligence who doesn't like this book. It would be smart to give it a chance and just try to read such a life changing story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Original...Simple...Gripping. The Old Man and the Sea is an example of classic American Literature that is all this and more. It reflects on Hemingway's past fishing experiences and has deep inner meanings. His style makes the reader feel as if they are actually struggling with Santiago on a skiff off the coast of Cuba. The Old Man and the Sea is a heart-wrenching tale that is worth reading.The Old Man and the Sea is a novel that people of all ages can enjoy. The reading level is simple, but that gets the point across. For example \\"\`It is not bad,' he said.\\" (84). Instead of cluttering up this simple sentence, Hemingway used four simple, but concise words to get the point across. It would have been unnecessary to use the thesaurus to replace these mono-syllable words with more complicated ones. Everyone has obstacles to overcome in their life. \\"You're feeling it now, fish,\\" and he said, \\"and so, God knows, am I.\\" (56). Everyone can relate to what Santiago is feeling, which creates a connection between the reader and the protagonist. The author gains the reader's interest with his simple style and a plot that can be related to.Ernest Hemingway portrays his two main characters brilliantly. For instance, \\"You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,\\" he said. (84). The character of the Cuban fisherman, Santiago, and the marlin both show personality traits that make them seem real. The reader can almost guess how the old man feels and how he will react. Santiago's story causes many emotions in the reader. In addition to portraying the characters perfectly, he also creates well-founded relationships between them. \\"But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight, he said.\\" (49). While reading this novel, I particularly enjoyed how the marlin represented the old man. The respect Santiago has for the enormous fish and their similarities doesn't affect his determination in killing it. Both characters are giving all they have, and their age and wisdom prove to be equal. Ernest Hemingway created a masterpiece in is portrayal of both the antagonist and protagonist.It is amazing how a story can capture so many people's attention in only 127 pages. Ernest Hemingway's special style can never be re-created. The unique plot and the secret deep meanings are what make this story great. If I could change one thing about The Old Man and the Sea I wouldn't. Read it and see why it won the Pulitzer Prize!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A True ClassicStruggle, tiredness, and agony are what the old man named Santiago faces when a huge fish catches lines.

I know that that may now make any sense but I am going to explain how that works. Also I am going to give my thinking on why this book was written, and also, why kind of hidden meaning is in this book.In this book Hemingway talks about a mans life (Santiago). To me this book was boring and dull. But there was also a hidden meaning behind this whole story. Now at first I didn't get why I and to read this story. Then I started to think about what this book could mean or what it could be showing. And then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Not giving up, have faith for what you believe in. That is what the whole book was about. Having the courage to keep going even when it may seem like there no reason to.In Hemingway's book he expresses what he is feeling. When times are sad he writes sad. When Santiago is being stubborn then you can actually feel what Manolin is feeling. Which in my opinion is a awesome way of writing. Because when Hemingway is expressing the way that he feels it is almost like you are feeling the same thing. In the book, Hemingway is explaining what Santiago is feeling in his hands, like how they are cramping up and how they are so raw from holding on to the rope for so long (62). In the book, just the way he explains the feelings of Santiago is amazing. He puts so much feeling into his writing.I must say that in some parts the book seemed to just kind of go on and on and on. But also, when I think about it he can't help it, because he is writing a book about a man's life and he can't help it if the man's life is boring. In my opinion this book is more of a man's book, because it is talking about fishing. Now don't get me wrong I like fishing, but I don't like to read a book about it. This book showed that even if things may get tough you should still try your hardest until the end. Never give up. The book The Old Man and the Sea, was a very inspirational and meaning full book. It showed me that things may get tough, but when they do that's when I should work the hardest."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Old Man and the Sea is a novel about struggles, challenges, friendship and love. Hemmingway invented a new style of writing when he wrote this book, which attracted many different types of audiences. He uses this book to tell what he went through early in life, and how he conquered many difficult challenges. This novel is a classic story of man verses self.Santiago was not having very much luck fishing, but things started to change on the eighty-fourth day of bad luck. He went out expecting another empty day, but when he encounters the catch of is life, things begin to change. Santiago would not have been able to complete his challenge as well as he did with the marlin, had memories and the voice of Manolin not been heard by Santiago. The battle between the Marlin and Santiago is a very long exasperating battle. Ernest Hemmingway uses the battle to symbolizes his own feelings and of his place in life. Santiago and Manolin have an amazing friendship that helps them survive the difficult fisherman life in Cuba. Without their friendship, the battle with the marlin and Santiago may not have lasted as long as it did; because Santiago would have felt as though he has little to fight for. Santiago has little life left in him at his old age, but the things that keep him going are the love and friendship he feels for the boy. Hemmingway uses the characters in this book to express his feelings of life, and how he got through the long struggles, which a lot of authors won't attempt to write.Ernest Hemmingway's novel The Old man and the Sea, is a new way of writing. Hemmingway uses simple words and simple sentences, to make the book easier to read and follow. Making the book easier to read is what attracted so many different types of readers. Even though he uses a strong emotional story he manages to keep the story fun to and easy to read. Hemmingway did something that most writers won't do, which is share his life, feelings and opinions through the book. Using Santiago to represent himself is a brilliant idea. He was able to share his life experiences, with the audience, but still have the book seem fictional, which attracted many different audiences. I believe he won the Pulitzer Prize, for this new technique of writing. This book shows just a little bit of the courage, challenges, love and friendship that he encountered while he was living in Cuba.Hemmingway told of his life through the characters he invented for this novel. The hardships and challenges he faced may seem unreal for a-lot of people. In society today we have so much in life, that a lot of people take it for granted. Read this story to see what it is like to have nothing, but the love and care from one true friend to keep you going. He truly deserves five stars for this unique style of writing, and for his new invention of powerful narration."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was a boring, but good book. It was boring because the book didn't go into a lot of detail on the action scenes and it was good because it turned out to be a peaceful ending. The author Ernest Hemmingway talked the struggles and unluckiness of Santiago.The creativity of the struggles and unluckiness were blunt. For example Santiago was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream, and he had gone 84 straight days without taking a fish. (9) Santiago would be the only person out of the people who went fishing that day who didn't catch a fish. For instance So Santiago didn't have any fishing stories to trade with all the other fisherman and he couldn't trade in the fish to get money. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this. (16) Santiago was so poor that he did have anything to eat, unless the boy brought him food. Luckily Manoline brought him food everyday and he checked on him to make sure he was doing well. Santiago has found some way and some how to make it through his struggles and unluckiness.I thought this book was boring and good at the same time. For instance the action parts didn't have enough detail and all they other fisherman did was explain boring fisherman stories. Like about them catching a trout or salmon. Poor Santiago couldn't relate to any of their stories because he hasn't caught a fish for a long period of time. The book was good because Hemmingway's writing style was superb. The action scenes weren't really detailed, but a lot of the other scenes were. For example the shark oil was tangy and it flowed warm down my throat on the cold morning. He didn't actually say that, but that's the kind of detail he provides. I think this book should be recommended to everyone who likes fishing stories and who ever think that luck turns out to be a good thing.Santiago is an old man who hasn't caught a fish for 84 straight days. He is the unluckiest fisherman. Ernest Hemmingway's style of writing made the book good, through all the boring parts. The book it self was boring, but his writing style is great. What I think about the book The Old Man and the Sea."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Tami RobinsonPeriod 63-13-02A Very Intriguing StoryWhat happens when Ernest Hemingway, Santiago, a marlin, Manolin, and the ocean are put together? A really great book is created! Ernest Hemingway brings the characters and setting to life. The Old Man and the Sea proves to be a very intriguing story.I was at once thrilled with the character, Santiago, and the conflicts in the story. For instance, this wrinkled, sun-burnt old man passes the time by talking to himself. This is such a typical old man characteristic and it adds a dash of humor to the story. Santiago was not only entertaining but believable. Because of his knowledge of the sea and description of his many scars it was obvious he had been a fisherman for a long time. Also, a huge marlin drags Santiago around for a couple of days and he finds that he has no food on board the skiff. This creates quite a problem for Santiago. He is out in the middle of the sea, miles from shore, and there are not any boats around. But somehow he manages to catch some flying fish, while still holding on, for dear life, to the marlin. All in all, a great book starts with a believable character and a good conflict and Ernest Hemingway delivers.In my opinion, The Old Man and the Sea deserves four stars. The story's strong point is not excitement. For example, it takes Santiago at least fifty pages to catch the marlin. I must admit that while I was reading I was thinking \\"Okay, he needs to catch the fish already.\\" But the story makes up for it in other areas, which I see as more important. However, while the plot lacks in excitement, Ernest Hemingway excels with description. For instance, the description of the marlin when Santiago first sees it is extremely vivid. As I was reading this part the fish was not only jumping out of the water, but also out of the book! I felt as though I was sitting in the skiff alongside Santiago watching the massive fish explode out of the deep blue-green water. In summary, I enjoyed this book very much and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good, easy read full of adventure and beauty.Ernest Hemingway turned a simple story about an unlucky fisherman who hooks \\"the big one\\" into an epic. His description of the sea's beauty and the fish that belong to it can dazzle anybody. This story has a way of making me smile and pity the old man. This story is great for people of all ages! And I guarantee that anyone who reads it will feel challenged, inspired, and enlightened."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have recently finished reading The Old Man and the Sea. It was a pretty decent book and i liked how it was easy to read and pretty short. It was boring at times but in all it teachs some pretty good values. The old man faces hard times but still remains content and happy. He struggles with a big catch and ends up loosing it all in the end but he still is still happy about actually catching it. It has a good storyline and i enjoyed reading it and would recomend it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was a little on the boring side. But also contained many morals and values. The old man never loses his fight for catching the big one. And the boy at his side gave him strength through the tough times the man encountered. So all in all it was a good book, but I think it should be aimed more towards a younger generation."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I just finished reading this book for the first time and I thought it was great. It's short and to the point with it's plot line and it doesn't take long to read at all. It's like the sunday paper. Please read it, it's just that good."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When I first started reading The Old Man and the Sea was totally turned off to Hemingway's simplistic writing style. Although the more the book went on and the more I learned about the Old Man the more I liked the book. It was written with simple words and a simple plot but yet you can take so much out of the book. You can understand the pride the Old Man has for fishing because Hemingway puts so much emotion into the Old Man. The book consists of no pauses, page breaks or chapter markers which is something that I haven't experienced before. It makes you feel like you are right there with the Old Man through his journey with the marlin. I think chapters or pauses would take away from the Old Man's journey and make it seem less intense, especially when he hooks the fish. Over all it is a great book and would I would recommend it to anyone. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I am used to reading books with more complex plots so to me the book seemed almost too simple but full of great morales you could take from it and apply to your life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Old Man and The Sea is about an old man's determination in the face of misfortune. After heading out to sea, he realizes he is in for a greater challenge than expected. The old man, Santiago, encounters a battle with a great creature of nature and the elements. But, it doesn't end there. The struggle to get home after being beaten by the elements is the greatest challenge of them all. The old man shows his endurance and determination by remaining calm in the face of danger. My favorite character in Old Man and The Sea is Santiago because he has so much determination in what ever he does.I think I could most relate to Manolin, the boy that helped Santiago, because I like to give my help and things I have to my friends without expecting any thing but friendship in return. I have gone fishing before and caught a pretty big fish. My fish was not even close to the one Santiago caught. I think it would be very exciting to catch something that big. It would also be a great accomplishment to get it home.I liked the book because it is easy to read and understand. My favorite part was when Santiago is beats the sharks away from his fish. He finds any means necessary to kill the sharks. My least favorite part of the book is when Santiago eats the raw fish because I think eating raw fish is disgusting. If I could change any part of the book it would be the sharks attacking the Marlin. I think the old man worked so hard that he should have had a greater reward.I would recommend this book to another person because it is a simple book. The book is easy to interpret. The type of person that would like this book is a patient person because the fish-fighting scene goes on forever. All around it's a good book though."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is undoubtedly Hemmingway's most masterful piece. In this simple story takes place a man who goes out to sea, catches a wonderful fish, and who ultimately loses it because he has gone too far out to sea. As the man struggles to keep whatever is left of his magical fish, sharks attack and slowly pick away at it until nothing is left of it. In many ways, this is the jealousy that inflicts mankind, to have something pure and good and wholesome, only to have it corrupted through mankind's greed. In another way, it is mankind's eternal struggle against himself, to find something magical deep within the foaming sea of mankind's subconscience and to attempt to bring it back as one piece, failing to do so. Hemmingway learned both sides to this from his previous successes and failures, and in this book outlines the pitfalls that lay ahead as one attempts to capture that ephemeral trophy of the muses."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man & the Sea is a powerful story about an old Cuban Fisherman named Santiago. The old man hasn't caught a fish in eighty four days, which is a very long time not to catch a fish. The village people didn't think much of Santiago . They thought of him as less than a man. His only friend was a young village boy named Manolin. Their relationship was special; they respected one another . The boy learned the lessen of greatness and faith from the old man. He also learned about courage and strength. The boy didn't think that Santiago was a failure. In fact he regarded the old man as El Campeon (the champion). The opening story is tense and direct. The main characters are described well. Hemingway's novel is based on a true happening. The old fisherman sets out in the gulf of Cuba to catch a dolphin but misses his chance. He decides to go after the big fish the \\"great marlin.\\" He fights endlessly for his catch, but he can't stop the struggle with it; he has a code of the hero. It was a code that men must live by always. He speaks of the New York Yankees & Joe DiMaggio with great admiration because DiMaggio's father was a poor fisherman like himself. Also, he admired Joe's fortitude because he played while in pain with heel spurs. DiMaggio was the old man's hero. Santiago had missed his chance to catch a dolphin. But he still went after the big fish in the gulf stream of Cuba off the coast of Havana. The old man and the fish are locked in the struggle of their lives. This goes on for days & old man gets weaker and weaker. He didn't have food to eat and hadn't slept in a long time. Santiago thought that he might die fighting the big fish. He admired the fish. Here Hemingway likens the old Man to St. James the lesser the patron saint of Spain. Also to St. Francis of Assisi. There also is the comparison of the suffering of Christ on the cross and the Christian martyrs. These are symbolic of Santiago's suffering and never giving up. The struggle finally comes to an end & he feels sad about the kill. The old man had felt a kinship with the giant fish. As though the two were brothers in nature. The old man apologizes to the fish. He felt a deep love and respect for this noble creature. The test of endurance continues & lack of sleep etc. The old man dreams of lions. \\"Aristotle pointed out that pity is a vital ingredient of tragedy\\". The quality of pity completes the tragic situation. The dreaming of lions symbolizes the old mans strength in his younger years. For the reader to learn the fate of the old man they must read the book. Ernest Hemingway was awarded the Noble prize and the Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1954 and 1955."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"As true today, as the day it was written. Are we not all just fishermen in little boats in a great big sea? Do we all not head out day after day, only to return home empty handed?

It actually moves along quite well. At times Hemmingway's sparse and arid prose is maybe a little too one dimensional to sink your teeth into, but he gets his point across. We understand quite well the degree of Santiago's persistence, and bad fortune, yet he still persists. There is zero pretension in this novel and that makes the simplicity of the fisherman's life that much more authentic. If you're a Hemmingway fan you'll like it. If not, you won't... 'cause it treads the same stylistic grounds."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When the old man set out on his daily routine he experiences more than he has expected. He has found his dream fish and now has the task of reeling it in.Ernest Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899 in a small village in Illinois. After he graduated from high school he started to report for the Kansas City Star where he learned to get to the point in direct, simple sentences. After going to WWI and being injured he fell in love with his nurse. These events inspired his first novel, which led to his amazing career as an author.In my opinion &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was a great adventure and accomplishment book. In the book the old man is so dedicated to his goal that he endures pain and hardships to achieve this goal. I also think that the book is well written in the aspect of how easy it is to read. The book is easy enough for a younger reader to follow yet it is still interesting and in depth enough for the more average reader to enjoy. So if I had to rate this book on a scale of one to five I would probably give it a four because sometimes the book gets a little too detailed and boring."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am ashamed of some of my peers who denounced Hemingway and his Old Man. Within these few pages, Hemingway depicts the struggle of life and the war between man and nature brilliantly. His syntax is by no means &quot;choppy.&quot; Hemingway purposefully writes in the manner he does and that is what makes all his material beautiful. Anyone who puts down Hemingway,and especially this story, should be taken to the gallows. If you are young and do not like this, I strongly suggest storing it in your memory and picking it up when you are a little older...that goes for those young'ns who DO like it even...Its definitely a story that takes some experience to appreciate. Overall, this is an amazing book that inspired me to further my reading of all different types of material dealing with &quot;what is life all about, and what is my purpose here?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Granted, this is probably &quot;the&quot; greatest testament to man's inner will to prevail against great odds, but was it really worth a Pulitzer Prize? I'm not entirely convinced that it was. There are only two main characters in this story, one of which is only read of in the beginning and end of the story. The leading character, Santiago, is what makes this story work, and provides a window into the inner thoughts of the lower/peasant class. Only Steinbeck's &quot;The Pearl&quot; goes this far in depicting the peasant class in its daily struggle to make ends meet. Santiago is a determined individual. He is obsessed with gaining a fortune from deep-sea fishing. The story builds up gradually, finally having Santiago gain his ultimate goal, and then see it all wisked away before his very eyes. The element of tragedy, combined with Santiago's hope for a better future provide a bittersweet emotion when compared to the over-all message. This is a great novel, and a classic. But, I feel that it just lacks any real depth. There was no real diversity between characters that is present in Hemingway's other works. Reagardless, this is worth reading, and I encourage anyone interested in classic literature to do so."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you have never read any Hemingway before then I would not recommend that you read this book. I think that it can only be fully appreciated with a consideration of his style and history.He wrote this short novel towards the end of his career and, having read Hemingway novels, you get the sense that this book is the final, undiluted book of fiction from Hemingway. If his life was a learning curve, then perhaps this book is the end result and all of his previous works moulded him to give this conclusion; all plot, love interest, violence is finally surpassed by the raw, inescapable internal struggle that is always present within his charactersIt is beautiful and very poetic and is pure Hemingway. Unforunately, this probably means that if you don't like Hemingway, you will hate this book as much as I love it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The novel &quot;The Old Man and The Sea&quot; is a very interesting one. Not only in its content, but in the way that it was written. Many topics, such as morality and relationships were covered in a very short novel. It is not a book that can be categorized as one with a villan and a hero. But much more as one with an antagonist (Santiago, the old man) with no enemies. It is a book that many may find boring, as I first did when I read it. But it is upon reading it and reviewing it that one begins to enjoy it. Analysing this novel is what I found most interesting, for there is much to pondered due to both the author and his ideas. This book may not be for everyone, but it is written very well, and was written in a way that I have not previously seen before. I hope that if you read this book you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What happens if you love your profession, but you are not making any money? What should you do, continue or proceed to a profession you don't like? In The Old Man and the Sea, a cuban fisherman named Santiago had to encounter this problem. He proceeded to be a fisherman. He and a little boy went fishing with him for 84 days without catching a fish. What bad luck! But Santiago was determined to catch a fish, so one early morning he sailed alone into the cold sea. He sailed for many days, until one day he batteled with a marlin and killed it. Santiago is a perfect example why we shold continue to pursue our profession no matter what barriers try to diverge you away from it. Santiago brought back the marlin and was drained from the voyage, but he was a hero to the little boy because he knew Santiago was one of the best fishermans and continued to pursue."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The title and cover of the fabulous book, &quot;Old Man and the Sea&quot;, give you reason to believe that the book is all about and old man fishing (at least thats what i thought!).

Throughout the novel, the reader is introduced to the old man and his daily fishing activites.

I would recommend this book to anyone because anyone can read this novel. It is so simple, yet so profuond, it is probably one of the greatest stories ever told."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book shows a beautiful portayal of extreme courage in individual, unrecognized situations.

But then my teacher made us look deeper into the meaning and symbolization. I found it to be an excellent book with a different meaning for everyone. I myself am very into my religion and I found the religious symbolization to be very profound and greatly related to the Bible.

The gigantic marlin that the old man (Santiago) catches, and subsequently lashes to his boat, only to lure sharks by dint of its bloody scent, was the creativity that Hemingway put into his last story, only to be &quot;eaten up&quot; by the critics. Not all the characters in the book understand what happened to the old man and his great, big catch--but still, he can dream that he is strong, and will not fail again."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I certainly was not ready for this book in junior high.

Don't miss this one, it is Hemingway's best and it is unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The thing that impresses me about Hemingway most is that he knew what he wrote about and, therefore, wrote with such confidence and authority as to dispel all doubt about the authenticity of his characters and what they did and what they thought and said. This book is an easy quick read and a good introduction to Hemingway. But don't stop there. Go back and read it again and notice how rich the detail is and how much you missed the first time through."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Writing these clueless reviews; are teachers actually encouraging them to clutter the Amazon.com site by making their &quot;comments&quot; mandatory? Please spare us; grow up (for our sake) and resist the temptation to view the human condition as &quot;boring&quot; (for your own)."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I can empathize with the people who felt that the novella was boring; I felt the same way myself when I first read it. However, I do not believe that Hemingway intended to entertain the reader, nor did he intend to put them to sleep. What he was trying to portray to the public was a much deeper theme than that of man against nature. True, that was included, but the theme excelled beyond that of those parameters. As a personal opinion, I believe that he took us to the depths of human nature and provided us with an incredible microcosm that touches on many aspects of life. To me, he was trying to express that everybody has an impact on the rest of humanity. Some people that take the time to recognise the worth of that one person can see some of the majesty of the individual. (Manolin, Martin) However, others, through ignorance and self-sightedness can deprive society of that same insight. (the tourists) The symbolism is incredible. Yes, Hemingway's style does not appeal to everybody, but through it he strived to emphasize certain things. The simplicity of the style indicates that Santiago's struggles happened to a real person, and not so much to a fictional and unapproachable literary figure. So, to the people that felt that the book was boring, please don't degrade it because it is difficult to understand. Truly, it is a very deep work that is difficult to grasp. However, please try and see the &quot;method to the madness&quot;; you may find that it is a great work after all.

Upon getting the fish to take the bait, he engages in a three day struggle, in which not only nature, but his old body work against him.Then as the fish wears down, he is reeled in and killed,leaving Santiago the winner. But despite his victory, the great fish is devoured by sharks, as if the sea was spiting him for taking one of her great creatures."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This short novel was the winner of the 1953 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. It was required reading in one of my high school English classes and is still required in many schools over thirty to years later. Many believe it was the publication of this book that assured Hemingway of winning the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature. This book is a parable of man's struggle with the natural world and the inherent dignity of a man. An old Cuban fisherman named Santiago takes his small boat out into the Gulf of Mexico and has a battle with a giant marlin and with several sharks. He has to deal with his own weaknesses, with nature, with loneliness, and with his own mortality. It is a great novel and a reader can get much out of it with a little effort. I also feel that I have to respond to some of the comments from those earlier reviewers who rated the book with low scores. The book isn't about fishing. It's about man. Hemingway hadn't written a book for ten years. But, as soon as this comes out, he picks up a Pulitzer Award and the Nobel Prize! An earlier reviewer from Kansas (May 30, 1999) commented that Hemingway was no Jack Kerouac or F. Scott Fitzgerald. I love both those writers; but, they weren't even nominated for the Nobel. And, to the Canadian reviewer of March 29, do you actually think that Philip Pullman himself would classify his works, as enjoyable as they are, greater than those of Ernest Hemingway? But my most impassioned response is to the bizarre comments of the reviewer of May 11, who awarded &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; five stars. After reading his comments, I went through all of the earlier comments, attempting to find what he was referring to. Except for grammatical errors (such as ending my previous sentence with a preposition) or spelling mistakes (such as misspelling mispelling), I saw nothing crude or offensive. Don't we have freedom of expression here? Even though I may disagree with others comments and opinions, they still have this right. And, more power to them (and to amazon.com). But, what I found most bizarre from reading this person's comments was that it would appear, from reading his last sentence, he awarded the book five stars yet hadn't even read it! At least those who gave the text a low rating had actually read the book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This bookm is one of the greatest books i have ever read,it is meaning ful to most every one espescilly me.Even though it is a short book it is really good.it was recomended to me by my favorite teacher and i really enjoyed it.I would recommend it to every one."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"You don't come across a lot of stuff like this in literature: a novella that has so much depth to it.

This book is about an old man who has caught a giant marlin, bigger than his skiff. On his way back, his marlin is completely eaten by sharks. My favorite part of the book was when he used his harpoon to kill the first shark, a mako, that tried to eat the marlin because mako sharks are supposed to be the fastest sharks in the world and are very big. I was quite interested that an old man could kill one. I learned that marlins can be very big and that you have to be careful if there is a lot of blood from it because it will attract many sharks including makos and shovel-heads. The old man would not give up hope while trying to catch the marlin. If you don't stop trying, it can pay off.

Hemingway was America's leading author in the field of sports and adventure from the 1920s to the 1950s.Hemingway's novel takes place in Cuba during the early 1950's. The story shows us the determination of one old fisherman who struggles to regain the confidence and respect of his peers in a local fishing village. The novel also tells the story of a boys love for the old man (Santiago). The boy looks out for Santiago and deeply cares for him.The novel is a breath taking tale of Santiago fishing far out to sea off the coast of Cuba. The old man is by himself in a sixteen foot wooden skiff battling the odds of nature, physical endurance, and mental fatigue. It is a mental game between the giant Marlin he hooks and himself. As the old man respects and admires the fish, but he knows he must kill it and bring it back to the village. The suspense and action brings you to the edge. You can actually feel the physical pain the old man suffers from Hemingway's detail description on how the fishing ropes are cutting his hands to shreds.Santiago is an old poor fisherman who is past his prime and has not caught a fish in eighty four days. He has lost the respect of the younger fisherman as they laugh at him. The older fishermen feel pity for him. The young boy and the old man are like father and son. They use to fish together but as the old man's luck changed for the worse the boy's parents made him fish with a luckier fisherman. The separation between the old man and the boy is heartbreaking. As the story prevails with the old man longing for the boy's company while out to sea. The boy is overly concerned for the old man's well being and safety.The morning of Santiago's eighty fifth day of fishing he sets far out to sea to break his bad luck. The current takes him further out to sea then he wants to go. The following day Santiago hooks a large fish that pulls his skiff for several days. The battle between nature and man begins. Bear in mind that Santiago had this large marlin hooked and was fighting the fish by holding bear rope. It is mind boggling to think of such a technique as today's fisherman use advanced rods and reels. The struggle between fish and man continues for days.As the days go on and Santiago keeps his grip on the rope, he must eat and try and sleep. It is survival of the fittest and mind over matter. The pain that Santiago suffers from the tension of the fish is overwhelming but he blocks it out and continues the challenge. Hemingway makes you feel right there, inside the boat. It is quite obvious that Hemingway must have experienced something similar in his life. The detail that Hemingway narrates about the open sea and the wild life that inhabits it is no other then someone who has experienced it themselves.As you read on with great anticipation Santiago finally conquers the big marlin. With a great twist and nature's fate Santiago's victory is short lived or is it? On his long way back the sharks attack his marlin. Santiago is helpless as they overwhelm his efforts. The old man finally arrives back at the village with the fish's skeleton tied to the side.Hemingway does not make Santiago a loser as many may think. The old man is actually a winner. As the village people see the eighteen foot skeleton in the morning, they have new admiration for the old man's conquest. Most important the boy and the old man are a team again. The two would be happy as the old man would no longer be alone on the sea. The old man's luck had changed he had beaten the biggest fish he had ever seen."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What a great story, but the introduction gives it all away. It would have wrecked a lesser book. It took alot away for me. I'm done with introductions, i'll read them in the rears from now on."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"On time. Packaged well. A paperback book so not for rough handling. Easy read as it is only 120 pages. Has large font. Crisp new book to be handled gently. As described. Can be read in one day. Easy to follow characters and story line. An excellent book to become acquanited with Hemingway's works."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I didn't really like it as much as I thought I would. I love Hemingway's style of prose, but I have to admit that I just didn't really like this novella very much. It would have been much better as a short story in a collection or anthology instead of a full novella. I'm not saying its bad, its just that I had high expectations because I love most of Hemingway's other books(For Whom the Bell Tolls is my favorite), but this felt weak and repetitive. I dunno, read it for yourself and find out. Nothing is wrong with the binding or the paper or the printing. It isn't an exceptionally strong binding(I wouldn't recommend it for a library, I slightly tore a page the first time reading it because I turned it too fast) but it is on par with most book bindings and paper qualities."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man is a fisherman, lives in a shack. He's had bad fishing luck for many days. Most the story is his fishing trip alone on a small boat. He struggles and faces obstacles without complaint. There is a dignity to him. I cried in the scenes with the boy. The boy knows the old man has no food. The old man says he will eat later. He does not ask for help. The boy brings food and they quietly eat it. The boy loved and cared for the old man with such respect and esteem. That really pushed my buttons. I've never been loved like that. It's the way an ideal parent would love a child.My two emotional reactions. I was sad to experience the old man's struggles and pain, yet I was inspired and admired his determination and actions. Then I cried as I watched the love from the boy. A slight comfort came in the way one feels after crying.This book was the catalyst for Hemingway winning the Nobel Prize which probably influenced me to give it 5 stars.NARRATOR:Donald Sutherland was wonderful.DATA:Narrative mode: third-person. Unabridged audiobook reading time: 2 hrs and 30 mins. Swearing Language: none. Sexual content: none. Setting: Cuba and the Sea, probably around 1950. Book Copyright: 1952. Genre: fiction.

His timbre and pace are ideally suited for telling this story. He's just the right amount of ragged and raspy. I can see why some readers are short of patience, but this story is about more than a fish, and was not intended for those inured in Hollywood special effects."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I purchased this book as a high school graduation gift. The young lady is an avid sailor and is going to the Coast Guard Academy, so I thought the book appropriate and one that would remain in her personal libraby."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is my first Hemingway story, and was pretty pleased with it. I have always been told that his writing gets right to the point and that he's not a \\"flowery\\" writer, so I wasn't surprised to see how long this story was. On the surface, the story was very exciting, even more so at the end when he battles the sharks. As I was reading it, I would get so excited whenever he ran across another shark I didn't even want to read those parts. I was really rooting for Santiago, and felt totally gypped at the end! In terms of reading the story for just \\"more\\" than the story, I found that the themes are very easy to identify and talk about so that would make this a great \\"discussion\\" novella, and it's no surprise that this is a frequently read book in school. This is an excellent starter book for those who are interested in reading a story for more than face value. It's not too long and it's themes and symbolism aren't too vague to understand."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The novel, The Old Man and the Sea starts out on a very peaceful and smooth note. The story takes place in a small Cuban city on the coast however most of the action happens in the Gulf Stream. It seems to be a mostly poor town with the given descriptions. There are only two main characters in this book Santiago and Manolin. The novel is about fishing and the adventures Santiago faces while fishing, but it has an underlying message of pride, faith and luck. Mr. Hemingway goes into detail on the hardships old Santiago faces when he goes out to sea on the 85th day without catching anything. On his journey he encounters a giant Marlin and many sharks. He has some good luck and some bad luck on his journey through the ocean. This book though short is one of the main reasons that Hemingway won the 1954 Nobel Prize.The old fisherman Santiago had not been lucky at sea for over 80 days; this can be identified as the major conflict in the story. He had lost his everyday companion at sea, Manolin. Manolin's parents believed the old man to be a failure and wanted better things for their son. Although this did keep the two from working together it did not keep Manolin from seeing Santiago. Everyday Manolin helped Santiago bring his fishing equipment home from the boat. This shows his loyalty to the old man. Manolin always tries to do something to cheer Santiago up after an unsuccessful day; he buys him a beer or just sits with him and talks. They both enjoy talking about baseball and the great Joe DiMaggio. He is the only one in the story who really cares for Santiago. He is beyond doubt a trustworthy character.On the 85th day of not catching anything Santiago sets out like every other day. He goes to the Gulf Stream where most of the story takes place. Little does he know that he will catch something great today. After sailing far out in the gulf Santiago notices a man-of-war bird and he knows from experience that there has to be fish below, he spots a 10 pound tuna which he catches and uses as bait. This one catch can not even compare to what Santiago will catch soon. As Santiago is sailing along father and farther into the Gulf he feels a jolt at once and realizes that he has caught something big. After a while he realizes that he has hooked a giant marlin. He is overjoyed that he has caught it; but he prays to God that the fish stays on the line. At this point in the story Hemingway starts to disengage the reader by going into tedious details about the catch.After almost three days of being out at sea and being pulled along behind the fish, it starts swirling around in the water. Being extremely tired and fatigued Santiago tries with all his might to catch the fish but has a hard time doing it. Continuously the fish swims around the boat. On the third swirl the giant marlin starts going underneath the boat and it starts swimming away. This is the point in the book where there is the most action and excitement. Hemingway starts to engage the reader more into the story with this event. Although he did catch the fish it was not an easy task. It is pretty fascinating to read about how he goes about catching the fish. He realizes that now he has to tie the fish up to the side of the boat. He is overjoyed that he caught the fish but at the same time feels somewhat sympathetic towards it. This can clearly be identified as the greatest highlight in the story. He believes that the great Joe DiMaggio would be proud of him that day. There is an overwhelming ferocity of human spirit during this part of the book. This makes the book all the more interesting and exciting.Even though he has made a major accomplishment by catching the fish Santiago still has more adventures and hardships before he finally reaches home. The catching of the fish signifies that the resolution of the story has almost been reached. He will find trials and tests on his way that will make him a stronger person. He will do things he never in his life thought he would do. Santiago has a tendency to never give up and that is what makes him distinct. Most characters would give up and just go home. But Santiago has a goal and works towards it.While this book may look like an easy read it has a deeper meaning. Hemingway uses simple words to convey a very deep message. The novel was not just about an old fisherman going out to sea and catching a big fish. It is about his struggles and pride, faith and luck. Hemingway makes the reader look deeper than just the text of the book. He sends a message to the reader in this book. Pride is shown through Santiago catching the fish and killing the sharks. Faith is shown by Manolin having faith in Santiago and Santiago having faith in himself to catch the fish. Finally, luck is shown by Santiago actually catching the huge fish by himself with no help.Overall this was a good novel. It is simple but it has meaning to it. The whole story keeps the reader engaged and wanting to know what happens next. Of course there are some points in the story where Hemingway loses the reader, but for the most part it is engaging. It is a classic by Hemingway that has earned him much respect and credit. Although it only has two main characters the characters are very well developed and vital to the true meaning of this story. This book has many angles that any reader can relate to. For these reasons I give this book 4 stars out of 5. I believe this to be an appropriate rating, the reason being that this is a very well planned and thought out book.This Summary/Review was written by: Samer Ijaz"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago is a Cuban fisherman version of John Wayne, who despite his bad luck has more determination and optimism than he deserves. Much of this novella is devoted to the struggle of catching a fish, then the battle of who will wear out first - fish or man? This battle lasts for more time than you would think possible, until Santiago recounts an arm wrestling match he had in his youth, and then you realize Santiago is not a quitter. You live through the physical pain of the catch and the gritty determination. To endure the pain, Santiago amuses himself with thoughts of the great Joe DiMaggio. And just when things look good, your heart sinks when predators arrive.This book is surprisingly easy to read, yet captures the heart of man. A must read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"On a recent vacation to Mexico, I was looking for a book to read while sitting on the beach. Something short, something easily digestible, but not vacuous. I chose this book because it had been on my \\"list\\" for years, and the beach seemed like the perfect place to read it. I had no idea what it was about, besides an old man and the sea.It is a wonderful story. I could not get over how deeply you can look into the allegory. I'm not going to say anything specific about the tale. But now I know why Hemingway is a masterful author. Highly recommended for anyone, any time, anywhere. However, looking up from the pages to see the Caribbean Sea stretch out to meet the horizon makes it even better."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"My opinion of old man and the sea is that it was a pretty good book . It was short and interesting. The best parts of the book were when the sharks were attacking the marlin and tearing it apart while the old man tries to kill them. The main charicter in the book is very interesting. He is an old man who hasnt cought a fish in 84 days even though he is very precise. He thinks alot about baseball and talks to him self alot. I liked the fact that he hooks a large fish and then spends days brining it in only to have it torn apart by sharks on his way home. It makes you sympethize with the old man. The setting of the book was pretty good. It took place in havana. As for the fish itself, it was 18 feet long and the most beautiful fish the old man had ever seen. He tasted it and said it would be very good at the market.

When I unwrapped the package and took a look inside the book I decided to read the first page to get an idea of how it was written. I sat in the same chair without getting up and read the entire story without stopping. I enjoyed it so much I bought several more books by Hemingway as well as a book about him. A fantastically talented yet troubled author, it's clear to me why he became so famous."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is literature at its best. Hemingway's deceptively easy and simple writing stile makes this a pleasure to read. Sweet."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is another one of those texts that you were assigned in 8th or 9th grade, largely as a function of the author's stature and the brevity of the book. And, of course, your teacher analyzed all the Christian symbolism, from the bleeding palms to the marlin carcass as Cross. Allow me to take a little different tack.I recently had the great displeasure of reading The Affluent Society. Mr. Galbraith argued that as Western society reached the novel stage of being affluent, that is producing enough goods to meet the subsistence needs of every member of society, we would inevitably rebel against the notion of work, our work hours would dwindle, people would demand four or even three day weeks and many would opt out of the workplace all together. We now realize of course that this was the idle prattle of an effete twit. Instead, the past fifty years have seen the massive entry of women into the workplace (as a form of liberation no less) and folks working well past retirement age and the past five years have seen the government demand that even the chronic unemployed get jobs or lose benefits. How could Karl Marx and Galbraith and all those liberal thinkers have been so wrong about what motivates people? It is quite simply a function of their dependence on materialism. This blinded them to cultural and spiritual influences on mankind and they failed to reckon with these forces.Hopefully, nobody who has ever read The Old Man and the Sea could possibly fail to understand that, for most people, doing a job well, even, or especially, a physically taxing job, provides an abiding sense of gratification and self worth. Most of us are not alienated from our labor, we are challenged by it. Because of the dignity and grace that the old fisherman, Santiago, demonstrates in rising to face the challenge--his exhibition of hard won skill and his determination in the face of overwhelming odds--this book reaffirms the indomitable human spirit and reminds us of the possibility of encountering the sublime in every day life and in the most lowly of labors and laborers.There is more insight to the soul of man in the scant 127 pages of this book, than in all the volumes of Marxist/Socialist pablum spewed forth in the past 100 years. It is a fitting tribute, on the Centennial of Hemingway's birth, that we remember him for this great tale."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I'm one of those who just revisited this novel after many years. I thought it a very good novel the first time I read it, and this time around it was even better. The writing and the characterization are phenomenal. Hemingway was one of the greatest short story writers of the 20th century, and this novel shows he was also one of the best novelists of all time.Anyone who finds this novel boring needs to look within themselves for the cause. The problem certainly isn't with this novel.

Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.But you haven't got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and you had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils.So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought. He jumped almost as though to show me how big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what sort of man I am. But then he would see the cramped hand. Let him think I am more man than I am and I will be so. I wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence.He was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all. \\"I am not religious,\\" he said. \\"But I will say ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cobre if I catch him. That is a promise.\\" He commenced to say his prayers mechanically. Sometimes he would be so tired that he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically. Hail Marys are easier to say than Our Fathers, he thought.Christ, I did not know he was so big.\\" \\"I'll kill him though,\\" he said. \\"In all his greatness and his glory.\\" Although it is unjust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a man endures.After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked at it. \\"It is not bad,\\" he said. \\"And pain does not matter to a man.\\"It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he thought. At least the kind of strength that I need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle and let the fight come.\\"I have no cramps,\\" he said. \\"He'll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don't even speak of it.\\"The sea had risen considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it to get home. \\"I'll just steer south and west,\\" he said. \\"A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island.\\"\\"Get to work, old man,\\" he said. He took a very small drink of the water. \\"There is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over.\\"Then his head started to become a little unclear and he thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? If I were towing him behind there would be no question. Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would be no question either. But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him. I am only better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm.\\"But man is not made for defeat,\\" he said. \\"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\\" I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought. Now the bad time is coming and I do not even have the harpoon. The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent. But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed. \\"Don't think, old man,\\" he said aloud. \\"Sail on this course and take it when it comes.Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish. I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many people. But then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin. It is much too late for that and there are people who are paid to do it. Let them think about it. You were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish. San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father of the great DiMaggio.They had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement. But they were closing all the time.He closed them firmly so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come. He could see their wide, flattened, shovel-pointed heads now and their white tipped wide pectoral fins. They were hateful sharks, bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers, and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat. It was these sharks that would cut the turtles' legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the surface, and they would hit a man in the water, if they were hungry, even if the man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him.\\"Ay,\\" the old man said. \\"Galanos. Come on galanos.\\"Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut. Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.\\"I wish I had a stone for the knife,\\" the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt. \\"I should have brought a stone.\\" You should have brought many things, he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.I cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too worried. There is only the boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he would have confidence. Many of the older fishermen will worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town.\\"Don't be silly,\\" he said aloud. \\"And keep awake and steer. You may have much luck yet.\\" \\"I'd like to buy some if there's any place they sell it,\\" he said. What could I buy it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken knife and two bad hands? \\"You might,\\" he said. \\"You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at sea. They nearly sold it to you too.\\"I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I wish I could see the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things.\\"The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see,\\" the old man said. He noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to himself and to the sea. \\"I missed you,\\" he said. \\"What did you catch?\\""},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a narrative with a complex perspective. Although our class has differing opinions on the enjoyability of this novel, we can all admit that it is a great classic for a reason.It lacks spark and action -- or does it? While it might not be as exciting as \\"The Hunger Games,\\" it does explore morality in a subtle way."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was fine. I enjoyed the book and I was rooting for the main character. I was hoping that the main character will win the fight. I do not want to give too much information about the book. I hope you enjoy reading this book"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There are a lot of negative reviews about the book being slow and possibly boring. If you've ever been fishing then you know you may go all day (or 84 days) without a catch or a bite. But if and when you get that bite, things can come at you quick and you fall back on what you know. If the fish is more than anything you've ever dealt with, your common practice is out the window and you wing it. Perhaps that is what Hemingway has put before us and I enjoyed this perspective. He does an excellent job in his description of Santaigo's experience, his pains, and his mindset throughout the book. Page 110 Santiago struggles with his own conscience to keep his head in the fight \\"Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.\\" Those are the thoughts of a man with experience, knowledge, and grace under pressure.However, my biggest criticism has to be some of the symbolic meanings in the book. Many believe the end results of the old mans fishing journey tells us that through all of lifes struggles, we never give up... that it's worth it to fight. I can appreciate that, but I have a hard time getting over that for such an experienced fisherman, Santiago came unprepared for work. I understand this is no ordinary fish as Hemingway has explained, nor did Santiago set out for this big of a catch. But the old man continues going further out to sea, further away from his norm of how he fishes, without key pieces of equipment, without Manolin. Ofcourse if this does not happen, we will not have the same story, but it angered me to have to believe that Santiago would take things to the limit the way he does considering his age, considering his physical condition worsens, and how he never seems to consider the sharks until an hour after he has finally taken over the Marlin. So I get it, the \\"elements of life\\" reduce his prize catch to nothing. In the end all of the marvelors looking over the skeleton of the Marlin can only imagine what Santiago had to endure. If that end result is to be \\"celebrated\\" or seen as triumph, I guess it is just not for me. The older I get, the less risks I seem to take so I guess my attitude or outlook spoils my overall appreciation for The Old Man and the Sea. All in all, I have a great appreciation of Heningway's description of the ocean and fishing. The book left me wanting more of the lifestyle in the saltwater, but I can't consider this as one of my favorites. I can say that I came to appreciate it more after having read it a second time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This the best book about a fish getting away that I have ever read. Every time I read it I wonder again if the fish is going to get away this time. And it always does. But that's the sign of a genius (Hermingway); when you read a book and think maybe it will end different each time. Personally I really like fish. Old men, not so much. But together, old men + fish makes for some good reading. Final score: Fish: 1. Old Man: 0. And it's really short!!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Give me tales of unrequited love and I will weep, name you author of the decade; give me tales of overcoming tremendous challenges and I will cheer, name you author of the century. I am a sucker for hard-earned success and so are you. Aren't we all fishes in the sea lured by a story of triumph? Hemingway's novella is hard to dislike, but very easy to dismiss as simple because of its accessible style. The occasional description flashes out of a page, such \\"But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicate for the sea.\\" But really, it's about the characters--'people Hemingway has always been excellent at creating. The old man is crafted with enough believability--'despite his unexplainable clairvoyance--'for us to invest in his vicissitudes. I felt his victory as palpably as I did his tragedy. As for the boy: what do we do about the boy? It is hard to determine whether the boy possesses faux-complexity'as do the characters in \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\"'or true depth, as in the characters in \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.\\" I do suppose it is up to you to decide, as it should be.The prose is easy to follow, so is the vocabulary. The symbols, however, are difficult to interpret as they allow for us to push meanings onto them. Are we to look deep or is a cigar a cigar? As all good literature, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA offers multiple levels of analysis. A shallow reading is satisfying'it is a good story'and an allegorical reading is satisfying."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is an iconic short novel by one of America's most recognizable twentieth-century authors - equal parts compelling narrative and profound universal truth. Hemingway spins a tale that can be taken in at face-value, read metaphorically, or interpreted philosophically. Essentially, it is a man-vs-nature tale, but as it deals primarily with the old man, it comes across a bit existential - not the pessimistic existentialism of someone, like say, Kafka, but the optimistic existentialism of someone who knows what he must do and does it, and although the old man might not be in control of the outcome, and might even expect it to end badly, he refuses to abandon his task. The work is short, and can be digested in a few hours, but oh, what a beautiful way to spend an afternoon."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Classic Hemingway - great story, depressing ending. This book was published in 1952 and was his last work of fiction to be produced and published in his lifetime. The success of this book was a significant factor in Hemingway's selection for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. The book centers around an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago who has one of the great struggles against a giant marlin. For days he battles with this great fish and once he lands the prize and begins his journey back to land the story turns to his battle with the sharks who attack the great marlin which is strapped to the side of his little boat. Santiago does not win the battle with the sharks and returns home with only the skeleton of the great marlin in a quasi-victory to demonstrate not only his own personal achievement, but also the greatness of the sea itself."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is the book that got me hooked on Hemingway! Truly a great work."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A great story communicated in a non-traditional manner. Though some find Hemmingway depressing, I find that his method of delivering a message ensures that anyone, despite their background, can relate and grasp the meaning"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was an enchanting book to read because Ernest Hemingway describes everything so you always have a picture in your mind. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes American classics because this truly is one. Ernest Hemingway is an excellent author and I would like to read more of his books."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ok, this is the first Hemingway I've read so I'm by no means plugged into his body of work. I will say that the tale is incredibly delightful. It somehow manages to be an epic complete with hero in a novella's length. It is a tall tale that is quite realistic. It has a tragic yet triumphant ending. The book shows the reader what is possible with your life and should be required reading in order to inspire people to live up to Santiago. I can't wait to explore Papa Hemingway some more!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"On the outside, The Old Man and the Sea appears a simple tale of an old man in an epic battle with a giant marlin. On the inside, however, there lies so much more. Through a strong set of Christian symbols, Hemingway throws the reader deep inside the complex world of his religious beleifs. With this dimension added to the story, it is hard to stop thinking about what Hemingway actually meant with these symbols. In other words, the novel provokes a great deal of thought. Along with these symobols, Hemingway creates an admirable character in Santiago, the old fisherman. It is hard for a reader not to gain an emotional attachment to him, and this attachment makes the novel hard to put down as the reader is continuously pulling for Santiago to come out victorious. With the book's short lengh and simple diction, it is easy to &quot;fly&quot; through the pages. The reader's thirst for the ending is satisfied quickly, and Hemingway does an excellent job of keeping the reader genuinely interested throughout the whole thing. The novel forces the reader to look inside himself as he watches Santiago battle his internal impulses to give up his battle all together. With this, the novel has an inspiring quality which helps the reader learn a good deal about not only himself, but about mankind as a whole. I strongly recommend this book to anyone. It has everything from a good story line to a deep meaning all in just over 100 pages. With its short length, I suggest reading it twice, once to get the story, and once to go back an look closely at the symbols held within. It is by no accident that this novel stands as one of the classics of all time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I think that this story is like a lesson, because the author tells us, about many things that we have to learn in life, like patince and bravery.The author is omniscient, but he doesn't give his opinion and I like this because I can to have my own opinion.I recomend this book because you will have a new point of view about how to survive in this world."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What a glorious work. Not a wasted word. Not a single distraction. Stripped of all artifice and affectation. He leaves only the very essence - of art, of life, of creation.In reading the various reviews, it seems that many young people have read this work as part of their class curriculum. It pains me to see how so many of them have had their perception of it directed - no, constrained - to the wrong things. Their teachers should be ashamed of themselves. They have taken something exquisite and eloquent and unadorned, and coated it, suffocating its splendour with &quot;symbolism&quot; and &quot;interpretation&quot;. The Old Man and the Sea is not about symbolism. It's not about Christ parallels, or communing with Mother Earth, or the price we pay for ambition.It TELLS us, clearly and poignantly, what it's about. And we must have the humility to take it at its word. It's about struggle, and courage, and pity, and proving something to the only two beings that really count in the end - our Maker and our Self.There's nothing complicated in any of this. And Hemingway strives to reflect these simple, yet powerful truths in language that is likewise simple and powerful. He succeeds beyond measure.To properly understand this work, we must actually oppose modern teaching. We must resist the temptation to analyse. We must strip away bombastic complexity and artifice. This is a story about essences. It is set away from civilisation, in the majestic vastness of the sea, precisely so that there can be no distraction, no adornment, no artifice. Adding such elements does not further the understanding; it only pollutes.As is true of all great works of literature, this one is not for everyone. If your depth extends no further than low-rent thrills, then don't bother. You will find this book boring. Similarly, effete intellectuals need not apply. There's nothing here that appeals to cheap cynicism, nor to cowardice masquerading under the guise of sophistication.This story is a great man's parting gift to you and me. It speaks with pity and a deep sorrow to those lonely acts of courage, large and small, about which no one will ever know. Only our Maker and our Self. What a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Honestly, I didn't enjoy it when I forced to read it in sixth grade. But hey, at that time I found Who's the Boss interesting. Now that I've matured, and reread this book 10 years later, I realize that this book is a true epic battle between courage of a man, and the forces of nature and age.Hemingway's greatest work, this 120 page novella can be easily read in a single sitting. In fact, it's more of a challenge to put it down than to keep reading.On the surface, this book is very touching and exciting - a man struggling to win over great odds. On a deeper level, it's a representation of human courage, survival, and instinct in its greatest form.
